       The elite wants to establish one government, one army, one way of thinking, one currency. They want to turn us into zombies and servants. Now more than ever we have to spread the word about the NWO, because it is upon us. When it is established they will be able to monitor and surveillance everything and everyone, which will make a revolution and protesting nearly impossible. For the last 100 years every mayor power has worked to establish this order through brain washing, vaccines and food. Their ultimate goal is to debilitate the immune system, and make it nearly useless, so we would be almost obligated to enter the NWO, where they would have the cures to diseases they created themselves.

       I don't think they mean by NWO what this community means by it, or else they'd not say it in public. They're talking about stuff like trade networks and international courts for war criminals, etc.

       I don't get why you're so hostile to me. I said I don't deny whether they do or do not have other, more sinister plans, just that they present a verison of the NWO to the public that is very different from what CT's say is the real motivation

       Look at Europe, the NWO is already established there, one currency, and it is all one country. The Rothschild have had this plan since the time of Napoleon, they have ruled this planet for centuries, here is a clip of someone confronting Jacob Rothschild about the NWO, and how he evaded the question

       They just want control and a one world Government. Just like they wanted the EU, they want an American union. They would also want a single currency. Somethings they have done have worked, Trump isn't helping this effort. Bitcoin isn't helping either since there is no central control.
      </p>

       The question was weather elites have ever talked about the NWO, and the answer is yes. I didn't make the video and like this sub it's a conspiracy. Look at the evidence and decide for yourself, calling people dense because they have different view, kind of the pot calling the kettle black.

       If you examine their writings and speeches, they're all rather blatant about it.
      </p>

       *“For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.” *

       Zbigniew Brzezinski has many NWO quotes, and Dr. Carroll Quigley wrote a 1800 page book called
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_and_Hope">
        Tragedy and Hope
       </a>
       where he tells the reader exactly what the gameplan is- he worked directly with these groups attempting to "unify the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       Joseph Plummer wrote a great book on Quigley's book called "Tragedy and hope 101" that compiles the relevant quotes from this giant book. Here's chapter one if anyone's interested.

       The Bush family were German nobility that branched off from the House of Bussche. The Bussche family ruled as feudal lords in the regions of Ravensberg and Osnabruck located in Westphalia. The House of Bussche had several family branches in the Holy Roman Empire and the Bush family are one of them. The German word for Bush is Busch. In their region of Osnabruck it was governed by Catholic Prince-Bishops which were given their authority by the Pope of Rome. The movement of protesting against Roman-Papal authority rose up in Osnabruck so they brought in the Jesuits to combat the protesters of Rome. The University of Osnabruck was then turned into a Jesuit University for a short period of time. Jeb Bush is a Roman Catholic convert and a fourth degree Knight of Columbus. Bush Sr's grandfather George Herbert Walker was Jesuit educated from Stonyhurst College. Adolphus Busch was an ancestor of the former Bussche family of Westphalia and the co-founder of the Anheuser-Busch beer company. The Bussche family are also intermarried with German-Dutch royalty like the House of Lippe. The Peirce name from Barbara Pierce-Bush comes from the Percy family who are British Peers and Dukes of Northumberland. The Percy family also settled a covert family branch in Mississippi which became politicians and plantation owners with their Trail Lake plantation. Thomas Walker was an ancestor of the Bush family and was a British slave trader. The Bush family are basically the royal family of the United States working as princes under the authority of the House of Windsor which have German ancestry. George Herbert Walker Bush is a Knight of the House of Windsor's Order of the Bath. King Edward VIII of the House of Windsor was a Nazi supporter.

       Axel von dem Bussche was a Nazi solider who "planned to assassinate Adolf Hitler" which is just another one of the many lies told by this wicked family similar to "weapons of mass destruction in Iraq". The German royal and noble families helped to create Hitler and the Nazi movement. The Windsor family changed their name under King George V who was from the House of Glucksburg and House of Saxe Coburg and Gotha and both of these families were involved with the Nazis. Prescott Bush's Union Banking Corporation was holding gold for Nazis and was shut down under the "trading with the enemy act". J. Bush &amp; Co. was a continuation of the Union Banking Corporation and founded by Skull and Bonesman Jonathan Bush. J. Bush &amp; Co. was bought by Riggs Bank which absorbed into PNC Financial Services after allowing money laundering into Saudi Arabia. Vannevar Bush oversaw the Manhattan Project as the head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development and developed Raytheon. Steven Walker is the Director of DARPA today. Wesley G. Bush runs Northrop Grumman. The Bush family own and run the Military Industrial Complex and are using Directed Energy Weapons on civilians. Prescott Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush, the banker Jonathan Bush, and George Bush were all initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society at Yale. The Nazi SS used the Skull and Bones symbol. The Skull and Bones secret society at Yale is a military council which is why George Bush Sr. started the Gulf War and George Bush Jr. started the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Bush family are war profiteers. The Skull and Bones also use military and war for recruiting soldiers into paramilitary death squads which are used inside the United States for persecution and assassinations. The Bush family are a destructive menace to society.

       It can be both ways. Many people are feeling negatively about the future right now. More control by the same people causing the negativity doesn't sound pleasing.
