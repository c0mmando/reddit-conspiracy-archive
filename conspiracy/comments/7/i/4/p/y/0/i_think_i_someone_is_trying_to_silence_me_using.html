        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know this may sound crazy but here it goes. 
Ive always been someone who is generally loud about speaking the truth. I talk about our current situation to friends, coworkers etc. I talk about how our unhealthy food and water is linked to diseases the medical industry tries to get you &quot;out&quot; from but instead, they have been guilty of creating addiction to pills. (chemtrails, staged shootings, etc). 
I am also a person who likes to participate in protests and have said to myself that I will never be silenced even if I am scared.
Well, lately ive had certain dreams that really make me afraid of speaking out. 
One of them, I was in a protest and someone started shooting and after I ran away all I could see is buildings collapsing.
Another dream i had: I was in an appartment and two men were trying to sneak in poison gas cuz i knew too much (I just knew this was the reason why in the dream) and they were trying to kill me. When I tried to tell someone, I sounded crazy.
Theres others that I cant remember but I seriously wake up scared and think of how I need to stay low key.</p>

<p>has anyone else experienced this? could this be caused by subliminal messages?</p>

<p>sorry for typos.</p>

I feel like either someone is trying to tell me something in my dreams or at least controlling them. Been trying to keep a journal about them. It has been useful. I find the more I write in it, the more I am aware in my dreams. Pros and cons with that though. I would recommend it, makes things even more interesting. My friends think I’m nuts. I quit drinking and smoking never looking back. Just lost the desire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t experienced this, but there is something important to remember about dreams...<em>you</em> have the power. <em>You</em> control the narrative, the only hard part is learning to realize that you are within a dream. No one can control your dreams if you realize what is happening. It is your own mind working out its&#39; anxieties and trying to make sense of our ever maddening world.</p>

<p>Just remember- you always have the power within your own mind. Always the biggest issue I saw with Freddy Kreuger...if someone had enough mindfulness, they could easily destroy him with the powers of their own mind. Stay strong friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your Freddy example, would be an allegory of a  dark spirit attacking you in 1,2,3 false awakenings. Hence the riddle. 1-2 freddy is coming for you, 3-4, better lock the door, etc etc. Occult is hidden in MSM. Possession is real, and so are Astral attacks. Humans have a shield from these lower vibrational beings, but, it&#39;s not as you say... From experience. I drink to sleep, because it&#39;s 50/50. It opens the door to the dark and light to enter. Your mind set is key. Face your demons, and they have nothing to feed on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dreams are a way for the mind to process daytime stress, sounds like these dreams are signalling to you to be conscious that you are going through some anxiety.   All the dream books I&#39;ve read say a bad dream, like falling buildings, doesn&#39;t mean bad things are coming, only that you are experiencing some stress that you can be more conscious of.  i remember hearing dream objects don&#39;t represent things, they represent relationships - seeing a cup of milk on the table, doent represent mother&#39;s support but only the supporting relationship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do protests accomplish aside from making you feel like you are a part of something /stroking your ego? Nothing. People who protest just want to feel like they are taking action, that they are a part of something and they love the attention. All successful &quot;people&#39;s revolutions&quot; throughout history were orchestrated, no protest has ever lead to any changes. So you need to be honest with yourself about your motives. What does blabbing about conspiracies to people who are closed minded to it does, aside from letting you hear the sound of your own voice and freaking others out? Why push your opinions onto people who are not on the same page? Your dreams might be demons/spirits giving you a healthy warning that you need to keep your ego in check and be smarter about the way you approach life.</p>
