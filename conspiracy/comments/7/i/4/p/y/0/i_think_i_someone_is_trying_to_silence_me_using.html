       I know this may sound crazy but here it goes. 
Ive always been someone who is generally loud about speaking the truth. I talk about our current situation to friends, coworkers etc. I talk about how our unhealthy food and water is linked to diseases the medical industry tries to get you "out" from but instead, they have been guilty of creating addiction to pills. (chemtrails, staged shootings, etc). 
I am also a person who likes to participate in protests and have said to myself that I will never be silenced even if I am scared.
Well, lately ive had certain dreams that really make me afraid of speaking out. 
One of them, I was in a protest and someone started shooting and after I ran away all I could see is buildings collapsing.
Another dream i had: I was in an appartment and two men were trying to sneak in poison gas cuz i knew too much (I just knew this was the reason why in the dream) and they were trying to kill me. When I tried to tell someone, I sounded crazy.
Theres others that I cant remember but I seriously wake up scared and think of how I need to stay low key.

       has anyone else experienced this? could this be caused by subliminal messages?

       Mine started a few weeks ago after I rolled my truck off the side of a mountain. Ain’t been the same since. I feel like either someone is trying to tell me something in my dreams or at least controlling them. Been trying to keep a journal about them. It has been useful. I find the more I write in it, the more I am aware in my dreams. Pros and cons with that though. I would recommend it, makes things even more interesting. My friends think I’m nuts. I quit drinking and smoking never looking back. Just lost the desire.

       I haven't experienced this, but there is something important to remember about dreams...
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       have the power.
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       control the narrative, the only hard part is learning to realize that you are within a dream. No one can control your dreams if you realize what is happening. It is your own mind working out its' anxieties and trying to make sense of our ever maddening world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember- you always have the power within your own mind. Always the biggest issue I saw with Freddy Kreuger...if someone had enough mindfulness, they could easily destroy him with the powers of their own mind. Stay strong friend.

       Drink half a glass of water before you go to sleep and finish it when you wake up. It should help you retain some of the details in your dreams.

       Try and remember to look for your hands in your dream. If you can remember to look for your hands you can remember that you're dreaming.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't have to be your hands, it can be anything. The reason I say look for your hands is that your hands should always be with you!

       Your Freddy example, would be an allegory of a  dark spirit attacking you in 1,2,3 false awakenings. Hence the riddle. 1-2 freddy is coming for you, 3-4, better lock the door, etc etc. Occult is hidden in MSM. Possession is real, and so are Astral attacks. Humans have a shield from these lower vibrational beings, but, it's not as you say... From experience. I drink to sleep, because it's 50/50. It opens the door to the dark and light to enter. Your mind set is key. Face your demons, and they have nothing to feed on.

       Dreams are a way for the mind to process daytime stress, sounds like these dreams are signalling to you to be conscious that you are going through some anxiety.   All the dream books I've read say a bad dream, like falling buildings, doesn't mean bad things are coming, only that you are experiencing some stress that you can be more conscious of.  i remember hearing dream objects don't represent things, they represent relationships - seeing a cup of milk on the table, doent represent mother's support but only the supporting relationship.

       Been having weird dreams lately too, and seen other reports from other empaths reporting the same. Started in September and has been getting increasingly more frequent.

       A lot of us have been there bud. Just normal feelings of paranoia. Check out lucid dreaming/reality checks for recognizing/controlling dreams.

       Mine started a few weeks ago after I rolled my truck off the side of a mountain. Ain’t been the same since. I feel like either someone is trying to tell me something in my dreams or at least controlling them. Been trying to keep a journal about them. It has been useful. I find the more I write in it, the more I am aware in my dreams. Pros and cons with that though. I would recommend it, makes things even more interesting. My friends think I’m nuts.

       I've never had this issue. I've had some bad dreams, but not quite as specific as yours to your situation. 
There's been a few movies and games that deal with dream/reality manipulation. The Evil Within was an awesome game that dealt with a psycho killer influencing everyone's brain/visions, using a high tech machine.

       My dreams aren't like that but I have heard voices. Always at or around 3-4 am. I can't figure out if these are fictitious or not. They are continuous and are commenting and appear to be observing me for some reason.

       3-4 time frame when spirits are at their most active. Ask them questions, find out if what you're hearing is real. You can also just tell them to "fuck off" and see if they stop, then you'll know for sure.

       It gets even weirder though. Some dreams seem like I am getting asked questions or they are commenting on stuff. One lady asked me a question if she should move in with her boyfriend once. She was asking a question in New York City, too. I think I may be tied to something if these dreams are dreams. Like a few days ago, a woman with the voice of that SNL tall black lady asking me who I was. So somewhere in my sleep people ask questions in NYC and I answer them or they summon me to answer questions. It is really weird during those hours.

       The dream where they asked you who you were is extremely important. Are the dreams uber realistic? Are you in control/can you ask questions back or do realize you were dreaming only after you wake up? You need to ask them questions. Next time you have to ask any of them who you are and who they are. Don't be freaked out by the answer.

       I guess so...some kind of portal opens up. They are around us 24/7, but that particular time frame they have more influence/ are able to communicate better. Once you are aware, they become more involved in your life. They start giving you all kinds of information.

       What do protests accomplish aside from making you feel like you are a part of something /stroking your ego? Nothing. People who protest just want to feel like they are taking action, that they are a part of something and they love the attention. All successful "people's revolutions" throughout history were orchestrated, no protest has ever lead to any changes. So you need to be honest with yourself about your motives. What does blabbing about conspiracies to people who are closed minded to it does, aside from letting you hear the sound of your own voice and freaking others out? Why push your opinions onto people who are not on the same page? Your dreams might be demons/spirits giving you a healthy warning that you need to keep your ego in check and be smarter about the way you approach life.

       To me it sounds like personally you are feeling a true loss of control. You are very worried that your efforts cannot make a difference anymore. Your dreams just illustrate this feeling to you. It's ok to feel scared but for your own sake take a mental break from things and try to find some joy in your life. I don't think anybody is trying to silence you. You are scared and that's ok. Never stop advocating for what is right and just. Peace
