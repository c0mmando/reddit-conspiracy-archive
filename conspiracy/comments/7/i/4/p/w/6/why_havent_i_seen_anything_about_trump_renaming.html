       I have a shocking suggestion.. Maybe both sides actually wanted this and neither are trying to criticize him for it on the forums. So both sides may be suppressing any criticism. Don't forget JIDF.. they still exist here as well.

       A lot of people believe that those in the US government aligned with Israel are trying to make the prophecies happen.. or at least push them forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not any of that is true the people in power seem to be continuing down this path.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, those who are seen as the "enemy" also have the same type of prophecies.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gog and Magog appear in the Quran as Yajuj and Majuj (Arabic: يأجوج ومأجوج‎ Yaʾjūj wa-Maʾjūj), adversaries of Dhul-Qarnayn, a legendary figure derived from Alexander the Great. Muslim geographers identified them at first with Turkic tribes from Central Asia and later with the Mongols. In modern times they remain associated with apocalyptic thinking, especially in the United States and the Muslim world.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So this side is also trying to manipulate world events in order to fit into their religious world view.

       It's absolute fucking madness, and basically eliminates any possiblity of an equitable 2-state solution in our lifetimes. It struck me with great anger and sadness upon reading the news. Trump has no fucking clue what he has just done. This may prove to be the single greatest mistake of his presidency.

       It's not bad because of Trump, it's bad because of geopolitics. Jerusalem can not be given to one group or another before a 2-state solution is reached, which would likely see a joint administration of the city. Giving Jerusalem to Israel shows the Palestinians that we aren't really interested in a 2-state solution, and will guarantee the cycle of violence continues.

       Trump said a lot of stupid, ignorant shit during his campaign, some of which he has done and some of which he hasn't. This is one of those things the rational ones hoped he wasn't foolish enough to attempt.

       Yes, it's absolute madness if you take into account the international situation, the Palestinians, diplomacy, and the possibility for a 2-state solution. Just because the Senate voted 90-0 last June and Clinton had the same shitty plan doesn't mean its a good idea.

       No it wasn't, but it is ultimately his decision to do this now, of all times, during his presidency and in 2017. The blow back will ultimately rest with him and his administration, because as Truman said concerning the Presidency- the buck stops here.

       Yeah, because Israel OWNS the senate, the judiciary, the congress, the legislative branch, the monetary system, the US military and the president. The US is a defacto puppet state of Israel. You don’t get to do anything without Israel’s say so.

       Nah, not revisionist hysteria. Just because a bunch of other foolish politicians have the same idea, doesn't make it a good one. And the key difference between Clinton, Bush, and Obama, is that they knew they were never going to do it. It was all Domestic Propaganda. Trump is actually going through with this insane plan. As such, he gets to shoulder the blowback as his own. Actions matter more than words.

       Considering all 3 major religions have a "claim" it's not really fair to say the Jewish People have it exclusively. You are also ignoring the fact that at Israels creation in 1947 and until 68 Jerusalem was partitioned and belonged to both "sides". You are also ignoring the ethnic majority/minority issues and the fact that the Palestinians lived there before modern Israel existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital destroys peace talks. Even if Jerusalem was to be given to Israel, it would have to be fair game going into negotiations. Our recognition does nothing but tell the Palestinians that we aren't there in good faith. It is a destabilizing act for the entire region and will lead to just more death and violence.

       Man you really like to throw that term around. And it's funny that you blindly defend Israel as if they have done no wrong. There will never be peace in the ME w/o a mutual recognition of each other's right to exist and an equitable 2 state solution. You aren't looking to fix the problem, you're only looking to pardon Israel for their own sins and screw over Palestine too.

       I don't like the decision. I know a lot of people are pro-Israel, and I used to be as well. Now, I know there are atrocities committed by both sides, but I see Israel as the bully in that region.
I would have hoped that Trump would have actually brought a deal to the table, as he said he would during the campaign.
