    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people believe that those in the US government aligned with Israel are trying to make the prophecies happen.. or at least push them forward.</p>

<p>Whether or not any of that is true the people in power seem to be continuing down this path.</p>

<p>Alternatively, those who are seen as the &quot;enemy&quot; also have the same type of prophecies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gog and Magog appear in the Quran as Yajuj and Majuj (Arabic: يأجوج ومأجوج‎ Yaʾjūj wa-Maʾjūj), adversaries of Dhul-Qarnayn, a legendary figure derived from Alexander the Great. Muslim geographers identified them at first with Turkic tribes from Central Asia and later with the Mongols. In modern times they remain associated with apocalyptic thinking, especially in the United States and the Muslim world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this side is also trying to manipulate world events in order to fit into their religious world view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not bad because of Trump, it&#39;s bad because of geopolitics. Jerusalem can not be given to one group or another before a 2-state solution is reached, which would likely see a joint administration of the city. Giving Jerusalem to Israel shows the Palestinians that we aren&#39;t really interested in a 2-state solution, and will guarantee the cycle of violence continues.</p>

<p>Trump said a lot of stupid, ignorant shit during his campaign, some of which he has done and some of which he hasn&#39;t. This is one of those things the rational ones hoped he wasn&#39;t foolish enough to attempt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering all 3 major religions have a &quot;claim&quot; it&#39;s not really fair to say the Jewish People have it exclusively. You are also ignoring the fact that at Israels creation in 1947 and until 68 Jerusalem was partitioned and belonged to both &quot;sides&quot;. You are also ignoring the ethnic majority/minority issues and the fact that the Palestinians lived there before modern Israel existed.</p>

<p>Even then, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital destroys peace talks. Even if Jerusalem was to be given to Israel, it would have to be fair game going into negotiations. Our recognition does nothing but tell the Palestinians that we aren&#39;t there in good faith. It is a destabilizing act for the entire region and will lead to just more death and violence. </p>
