Sorry but this is the only way I can communicate to you now:
ENTY: If you get this, I&#39;m on a plane getting the FUCK outta Hell-A. Too much smoke for me. FYI: I have some guys working for me who also work at Blogger. They&#39;re on it. They&#39;re into the backbone of the site, and going around your top-tier credentialing to override and switch the flow of those DDOS attacks to a mirror. No damn clue what that means. I&#39;m no expert, just repeating what they told me. I paid them out of pocket for it so they said it should be back running clean again soon. Within the hour at least. Figured you wanted this solved asap. Sorry to do it without asking. And yes, just so everyone knows - the attacks were trackbacked to the same root. Wanna guess where it points back to? Don&#39;t need a blind item to solve that one buddy. Be well and stay firepoof. Literally!
In the Air -

    <div class="md"><p>The blind obviously doesn&#39;t say names, but it gives enough clues for the people reading and commenting to figure it out. 
(If the commenters are not mistaken, this is who the blind is about)- 
The big one to come out is saying that Chris Cornell&#39;s widow was given some powerful drugs to give her husband, in order to get him badly addicted and led to his death. She is also receiving monthly payments through a family member (her mother), for helping to kill him. 
Chester Bennington is also mentioned, but the blind is cut off about halfway through the post, because supposedly the site is currently being attacked by hackers or something. People are having a hard time logging in right now. 
Pretty much, both men were killed because they wanted to expose David Geffen for molesting children. Geffen being a billionaire, had them killed before they could say a thing. </p>

<p>Today&#39;s Blind Items - The Web</p>

<p>Ever wonder why one widow looks like she is grieving every day, all day, and the other looks like she is getting ready to party all the time? Well, lets go back in time a bit to the first widow. We all know she is a black widow who only cares about herself and her survival. Right up there with that is how much she loves money and fame. So, when a couple of people came to her and offered her a great deal of money to make some of her past crimes and foibles go away, she was all ears. When they offered her a chance at her own reality show down the road, she really listened. When they told her that her A- list (PJ) celebrity husband was going to divorce her and enforce that prenup, she was 100% on board.</p>

<p>They provided her with drugs that were much stronger versions of the ones her husband used to take. Her job was to get him hooked again. They told her exactly what to do, and how to do it every step of the way. When that first wire transfer hit a relative’s bank, she was the most enthusiastic helper ever. She might not have been there to commit the actual crime, but she was part of the conspiracy to kill him and she has had no problems with the money and fame she has received after his death. She is so greedy and so concerned with herself that she never even asked more than a few questions about why anyone would want her husband dead.</p>

<p>Contrast her situation with another widow. A widow who became one not that long after the first. She was married to an A- lister (RJ) herself. She would never have done anything to harm her husband. Nothing. Someone could have offered her millions of dollars and she would say no. Every day she grieves for her dead husband. She grieves for her family. She also grieves for the people that her husband and the other A- lister were trying to help.</p>

<p>Her husband was an inspiration to so many troubled youth and teens. Naturally those people reached out to the A- lister when they struggled. About a year or so before his death he was told by one of the teens that he had been sexually abused. The teen talked about others who had all been abused at the hands of the same group of people. The teen named some names and our A- lister knew who some of the people were. In fact, he knew one of them really well. That one is a permanent A+ lister who has been known in the past to make his problems go away permanently. When our A- lister approached him, the A+ lister advised him to not pursue things any further and to let the matter drop. It was shortly after that conversation that our A- lister talked to his friend PJ and told him what the teens had said and his conversation with the A+ lister. At that point, PJ and RJ went and spoke to the A+ lister. This time, they were warned more strongly and threats were made about their careers which the A+ lister could destroy.</p>

<p>PJ and RJ started interviewing the teens and recording the interviews. No one knows how that information got back to the A+ lister. Did PJ or RJ or both send him a video? Howv</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve been on this site since someone here at this sub turned me on to it, and even though there might be some spelling/grammar mistakes here and there, they usually don&#39;t even with a weird misspelling like that. I was thinking the big wig was Hova (Jay-Z). Speaking of, there is a bit of dirt on him too, if you go a few days back. Crazy stuff. I&#39;m glad the site got on the pages of Daily Mail and Daily Beast. Reading all these past blinds makes me realize that justice needs to be done not only for the women harassed, but for the children that have been hurt by Hollywood and the music industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no show business connections or anything like that so my opinion isn&#39;t based on my own experiences, but after reading this site a lot of the celebrity behaviour made a lot more sense. Check out &quot;yacht girls&quot;, the guy basically said that middle eastern business men use the celebrity magazines as a catalogue to decide who they want to sleep with. Apparently if you see celebrity women on a yacht in the summer it&#39;s likely they&#39;re paid to sleep with the owner of the boat. The woman are paid in diamonds and for &quot;public speaking engagements&quot; but in reality they&#39;re being paid for sleeping with men. I found that on the site too, it seems that the casting couch is for both men and women too (Burt Reynolds and John Travolta have both been quoted as saying they slept with male producers to get a role). All levels of celebrity seems to involve sleeping with someone at somewhere down the line according to the site. Hopefully it continues to get more publicity so people will at least be forced to giving a statement one way or another </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that site and this Conspiracy Reddit really opened my eyes to a lot of things. I see a lot of things differently. </p>

<p>It really does make sense though. Imagine being a big wig producer with the power to make anyone famous. Why should he pick a certain girl over 10 others that look the same, and are equally talented? Why should he make YOU famous? The girl/guy who sleeps with him is the one who will get the part. Actor gets fame, and he gets to have sex with a woman who is idolized all over the world. A total power trip. One of many dirty things that I&#39;m sure happen in Hollywood.</p>

<p>&quot;Johansson, who was 17 years old at the time [of the film&#39;s shooting], immediately accepted the part and Coppola was happy with the maturity she brought to the character.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the boat thing, I remember a thing from a few years back with &quot;instagram models&quot; etc where the guy was posing to be a fake Saudi person organizing with said &quot;models&quot; to fly over there for a holuday where as well as sex they&#39;d be defecated on and multiples of the examples he showed were fine with it. A tiny glimpse into that world. I guess it&#39;s kind of people trafficking/sexual abuse with a thin vale of business transaction.
This is made fun of in The Dictator.
Kind of makes you rethink why Kylie Kardashian (pre most surgery) was in SA before she was 18.

I was doubtful at first but I saw proof of this friendship as this guy kept a photo album of pictures with him chilling and a letter of thanks that Staley sent to him for a good job done on said video , and Staley signs his name and leaves his phone number . He tells me that one night Staley recounts a time where him and Cobain are sitting around using heroin and Cobain starts telling Staley that he’s concerned for his personal safety . Cobain goes on to tell Staley that “some high ups in the record industry related to David Geffen” have warned him not to try quitting or backing out of the industry with all the money that was at stake . Cobain went on to tell Staley that he was getting threats from these heavies and that he thought he was being followed. That was pretty much it, because then Cobain seemed to then want to change the subject . This happened just a “short time before Cobains death “ apparently is the best time frame i can get. Make of this what you will but this director has no reason to make this up and I find him to be truthful and honest . He’s been sitting with this story since then , and hasn’t told many people because he doesn’t think anyone will believe him. Thought I would share </p>

Pretty much all I could find was on the website listed above. He&#39;s a billionaire. He can make things go away, from what the site says. Not too far of a stretch, considering everything that the Clintons and other power players can do with money and influence.
I&#39;m not sure of the Cobain thing, but people have always had a feeling of foul play.
Just like with politics, I don&#39;t think we get to know the full story with a lot of these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Often it’s named later after more stuff comes out publicly and it becomes harder to deny. So, for example, now the Chris Pratt and Anna Farris are divorcing, it’s easier to name him from an old blind about a cheating actor husband. </p>

<p>I’ve also heard something about the legal loophole of only confirming after others guess on the site. That doesn’t make as much sense to me from a legal standpoint, but I’m not a lawyer. </p>

<p>Anyways, like all gossip columns this will eventually get burnt and put to an end once enough dirt is spilled and people pissed off. I used to read Ted Casablanca on E! in the 90s and early 2000s, but he pissed off the wrong person and mine as well no exist in the celebrity world now. I suspect it was Ryan Seacrest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been waiting for something like this to happen since they posted that Blind about the hundreds year old group that runs an extortion honeypot out of a mansion in NOLA. It tied it to the unexpected and covered up death of one of the worlds richest men. Everything else in the blind was fleshed out easy enough, but something about the details do not add up to fit either the saudis or Rothchilds. But at any rate, it also called out a supposedly democratic PAC extorting money from celebs through sex tapes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well basically what you are posting says that &quot;blogger&quot; is a server/domain. The backbone means the actual server/unit that hosts site. Top tier credentialing is like blacklist or whitelist for ip , connections to said server. They found a workaround not hard (except actually for pcmatic servers surprisingly which is very hard) , a mirror is a server based copy of said web server. ....... Are you trying to hack this one or protect it. Meaning in your posting is vague. Either way. Here is what means. Either is redirecting all attacks focused on ip address of server via ddos attacks to a mirror of server through rerouting of network and thus eliminating lag put on server from attack, or rerouting attacks from server being attacked to mirror hosting server in order to sidestep ddos attacks on server and cause outage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People up/down vote for various reasons.. not always because they necessarily agree with post mind you..</p>

<p>There also concerns of systemic forces downvoting content not deemed suitable for public consumption, despite the weight of evidence supporting the material to be true; this post is a great example of that.</p>

<p>There is no reason, as far as I can see, regular civvies on reddit would downvote this particular post.. most folks haven&#39;t even heard of CDAN, so this will be new information.</p>

<p>Which supports the idea that forces beyond regular users of reddit have pushed (by downvoting) this post beyond the conspiracy front page.</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense  :)</p>
