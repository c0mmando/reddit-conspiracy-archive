    <div class="md"><p>I think they are just trying to prevent the spread of Wahabi Islam. Since when did Israel need to ask permission to the rest of the world on where they set their borders? I don&#39;t see how this so bad in the eyes of Palestinians that they feel the need to start a war over it? To me it&#39;s really no different than Trump not wanting radical Muslims in the US. Just trying to see where the rationale is coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are grossly mistaken if this declaration is to stop Wahabi Islam.  How in your mind does that do that??  please elaborate</p>

<p>Why does Israel need to get the world&#39;s permission to set their borders?  let&#39;s see, technically they are on palestinian land lol, your illegal settlements are nothing more than a land grab and they are massively oppressing the people of that country.  Which in turn is causing nothing more than anger towards israel and the US.  </p>

<p>So yeah, declaring Jerusalem israel&#39;s capital is a pretty idiotic move, unless your intention is to start a war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re talking about a land mass twice the size of Dallas, TX here that was created as the State of Israel in 1948 correct? That was a 2-state solution. The British left and the UN split the land mass in half so Israel (Jewish people) could have their own place there (can you blame them for not wanting to convert to Islam?). </p>

<p>However, Arabs never wanted them to have their own land and began attacking Israel right after the British left. These people (who have suffered tremendously by the Nazis BTW) deserve their own land. Israel survived. </p>

<p>Then it happened again in 1967 when Egypt, Jordan, Syria threatened them again. Israel stood up for themselves again and took the West Bank. </p>

<ol>
<li>Sudan gives the 3 famous NO&#39;s: No Recognition, No Peace, No Negotiations. Israel agrees to give Sinai Peninsula back to Egypt + Oil but their enemies never wanted peace. </li>
</ol>

<p>The motto of Hamas is &quot;We Love Death as Much at the Jews Love Life&quot;. There was never an autonomous Arab state in the area known as Palestine. </p>

<p>So again, this is about and always has been about, the Jewish people in Israel wanting Independence based on their own beliefs. It&#39;s actually very simple. </p>

<p>You are incorrect, the land was not split in two.  <a href="http://www.aljazeerah.info/images/2011/February/9%20p/Palestine%20Theft%20Maps.jpg">here is your map of the post &#39;balfour&#39; declaration.</a></p>

<p>In truth, the Six Day War was begun by Israel on the morning of June 5 with a surprise attack on Jordan’s ally Egypt that obliterated its air force while most of its planes were still on the ground.</p>

<p>You are an idiot if you really believe this.  Jewish people have had more than their independence and this is nothing more then a land grab while oppressing the people that are really from there.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying everything is Reagan&#39;s fault, we should&#39;ve corrected this immediately after, but obviously all of the presidents after would rather exploit the population for free labor than try to improve the system.</p>

<p>You say the country was well managed under Reagan, but he tripled the national debt and part of the reason he ONLY tripled it, is Carted increased social security tax before Reagan came in. </p>

<p>Reagan began a chain reaction that had huge lasting changes. It should&#39;ve been corrected, but his war on drugs set this country on the wrong path, and no one had course corrected since. The establishment on both sides have a shit ton of issues and that&#39;s one of them. Considering Trump considers himself the law and order president, I don&#39;t see things improving. </p>

These people control religion (as well as many other things), when they say something in church like this it&#39;s predictive programming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So people went to jail for breaking the law.  How terrible!!</p>

<p>Marijuana was illegal well before Reagan, and people were going to jail for it for longer periods in the Nixon/Carter era&#39;s.  </p>

<p>For profit prisons - like a lot of things that come out of a bureaucracy - aren&#39;t good - but they are a product of a bureaucracy that exists in Washington DC.  </p>

<p>Reagan didn&#39;t sit down and decide to create a system that makes it more profitable for businesses to keep people in poverty.  It takes an overreaching government to do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was apparent they did not want a candidate in this race that could have been a Ron Paul of 2008.  Bernie was in my eyes their controlled ron paul, why else wouldn&#39;t he take the green party nomination?  Hell i would have voted for him if he did that and i disagreed with him on almost all his economic policies.</p>
