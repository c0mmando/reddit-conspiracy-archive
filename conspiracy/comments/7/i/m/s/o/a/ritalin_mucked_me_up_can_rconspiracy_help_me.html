        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe you lot here might be able to help with this. I&#39;m posting this in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because of the conspiracies surrounding the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>Was prescribed ritalin when I was 25 in 2014 and it just ruined me.</p>

<p>I have spent a lot of time researching my symptoms and talking to healthcare &#39;professionals&#39; about it only to not be listened to and outright lied to.</p>

<p>I experienced massive sexual dysfunction and a change in my sleeping habits. I used to lucid dream every night and have great dream recall. I have dreamed less than five times since and they have been very weak dreams. Some on this sub claim that pharmaceutical pills can affect &#39;gifted&#39; people differently. I have strange experiences. A year, to the day (I think) before I met someone their first name popped into my head. &quot;He&#39;s not the one but here&#39;s the name of the person who is&quot;. Was weird af and I have other (small) things like that happen somewhat often.</p>

<p>My appetite increased yugely on the pills, craved sugar, weed, and booze (and out of those three the only one I&#39;d craved previously being weed. I hate booze and much prefer salty/fatty food to sugary).</p>

<p>The reaction I had to the medication makes me wonder whether I was allergic or something (I broke out in a rash, had flakes in my eyebrows, really itchy scalp, eyebrows,eyelashes receded/fell out, hair fell out in large clamps when only days before the medication there was no problem). I haven&#39;t had any stimulant medication since 2015 and still the issues remain.</p>

<p>I get told it&#39;s all in my head but how did I make myself stop having erections, morning wood (which I had every single day previously), wet dreams/dreams, ejaculating properly-from the first day taking the ritalin the volume of my ejaculation has been depressingly diminished to sometimes there being almost nothing. When I went to speak with a doctor about this she said &quot;Men don&#39;t shoot far&quot;.</p>

<p>!</p>

<p>tl;dr</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why someone would experience sexual dysfunction and sleep changes because of stimulants? Side-effects which have lasted two years after stopping. Down regulation of dopamine and serotonin?</p>

<p>I noticed changes also. I took one on two occasions to understand it. Never will do it again, and luckily my brother continues to move forward without them. </p>

<p>Best way I can describe the Ritalin is I felt that I was dead inside. I recognized emotions but didn&#39;t actually feel them. I knew I was sad but I felt almost like my emotions were in third person view. </p>

<p>Either way good luck man. It&#39;s a tough time to be alive.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read up on gut bacteria and crazy as it sounds your stomachs brain! See if you can find anything in there that rings true. If you&#39;re drinking soda pop, specifically diet soft drinks cut them out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m NAD but I would suggest you find an Internist rather than just a GP - I think they tend to have a more balanced outlook on the human body health!</p>

<p>IMHO people can have allergic reactions to meds. It means your body is fighting off an invader. Dosage might also be a factor in any medication. Once it was discovered that mass production of pills was so damned profitable - to hell with the patients weight, height or well being.</p>

<p>Hope some of this helps. Be well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a doctor but a young guy coming in saying he can&#39;t sit down because his prostate/testicles are sore doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s fine to me. From research I have thought it was CNS related but wasn&#39;t sure whom to speak with about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking into magic mushrooms and have tried to take them a number of times this past year but haven&#39;t managed to actually trip while others have on the same stuff.

<p>I blaze heavy everyday and cannot remember my dreams for the life of me. As soon as i take a break from smoking, my dreams come back and they are more vivid than others.</p>

<p>Try taking a break from blazing for a week (it’ll get your tolerance back down a bit too) and see if you can remember any of your dreams. Do a simple google search and you’ll quickly find out you aren’t alone. Hope this solved this part of your issue. Good luck and i wish the best for your health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NAD but sounds like you got cross-stimulant sensitisation. It&#39;s a rare side effect from stimulants on your receptors, and can have wide ranging and long lasting effects. There is information out there, people in the recreational drug and research chemical community also have experience with it.
 And there are possible treatments.</p>

<p>Though it also sounds like you&#39;re having mental health issues as well. The lack of dreams is likely  from the marijuana. Have you been taking anything else? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid of seeing more doctors and other health professionals. I know you might have had bad experiences but seeing as how so many people were prescribed stimulants for ADHD there&#39;s bound to be a number of people with similar side effects and a specialist in treating them. There may even be a support group on the internet or maybe FB.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand why you posted on Conspiracy. I can assure you there&#39;s no big pharmaceutical conspiracy to mess people up with these drugs. </p>

<p>I would recommend seeing a psychiatrist, to abstain from all psychoactive substances including caffeine, and to eat a whole foods diet rich in green&#39;s and to live an active lifestyle which includes weight training. Your brain has a certain amount of plasticity and can repair itself, but sometimes it takes a long ass time.</p>

<p>Keep up the good attitude my man and good luck to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ritalin doesn’t have long term effects on your body unless you abuse high amounts of it over long periods of time.  Yes, everyone is different, some people get increased appetite and some people get decreased appetite, lots of people engage in more addictive behavior on stimulants.</p>

<p>BUT, Ritalin shouldn’t fuck you up for 2 years.  It’s not going to fuck up the amount of semen you produce, for example.  That’s totally unrelated to Ritalin.  Either something else is happening to your body, or, it’s really all in your head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ritalin is not much different than meth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately your side effects are common.</p>

<p>To heal you’re going to need to eat clean, organic, and non processed foods. You might want to try a low carb high healthy fat diet to give your brain the proteins and fats it needs to repair itself. Look into r/paleo and r/keto It can take years. Get off sugar, carbs, corn sugars, caffeine, etc. Do not eat soy or anything that boosts estrogen levels.</p>

<p>Equally as important is giving your brain and body time to heal every day. A daily meditation practice is clinically proven to help heal the brain.</p>

<p>Other things you can look into are medical mushrooms such as cordyceps and lions maine <a href="https://draxe.com/cordyceps/">https://draxe.com/cordyceps/</a>. </p>

<p>Cordyceps can help boost your libido and energy.</p>

<p>Lions Maine helps heal the nervous system and brain tissue. If you take it before bed it will induce more vivid dreams again.</p>

<p>I would also look into iodine supplementing and detox, detox, detox. Avoid fluoride water, and stop eating anything that doesn’t come naturally from the earth.</p>
