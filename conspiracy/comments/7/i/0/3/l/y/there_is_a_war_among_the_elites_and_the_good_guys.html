       The Background
      </h1>
      <p>
       "Through three millennia of recorded history to date, centered around the Mediterranean, the civilized world has been run by two, bitterly opposed elites, the one associated with the faction of Socrates and Plato, the other with the faction of Aristotle. During these thousands of years, until the developments of approximately 1784-1818 in Europe,
       <em>
        both factions inner elites maintained in some fashion an unbroken continuity of organization and knowledge
       </em>
       through all of the political catastrophes which afflicted each of them in various times and locales.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the elite associated with the Platonic (or, Neo-platonic faction which organized the American Revolution and established the United States as a democratic constitutional republic...
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that first broad level of division between the knowledgeable and the credulous, the secret knowledge is distinguished by the division of elites into two irreconcilable factions. Beyond the sheep-pens of the believers in mythologies, there exist two fundamentally opposed views of what to do with the world, of what direction to adopt in steering the historical movement of the human, species. One elite, the humanists, the Platonic or Neoplatonic faction, is dedicated to steering the course of history away from rule through mythologies. The other, the Aristotelians and their heirs, is committed to strengthening the rule by mythology, for the purpose of establishing a permanent, "feudal-like" Utopia of obedient, simple-minded folk ruled by a tenured neo-Aristotelian oligarchy.

      <h1>
       The Current Situation
      </h1>
      <p>
       After temporary defeats, the Platonic elites (the "good guys") have finally made a resurgence and gained the upper hand. You see effects of this as we speak:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Elite sexual perversion and blackmail networks being exposed
      </p>
      <p>
       -Increased prosecution of pedophilia
      </p>
      <p>
       -Decreasing trust in the thought control media
      </p>
      <p>
       -Increasing interest in "conspiracy theories"
      </p>
      <p>
       -The increased popularity of politicians outside of the mainstream such as Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and so on (not an endorsement of any specific politician)
      </p>
      <h1>
       The Future
      </h1>
      <p>
       Now the question is whether we will have a "limited hangout" involving removal of the worst elements of the Old World Order, but without a fundamental change in the modus operandi?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or will we win a major victory and dismantle the whole corrupt system, replacing it with honest government, fair money, cooperation instead of war, and increasing economic growth for everyone, not just the elites.

       There are no "good guys". They don't care about you or me. They care about themselves and that's it. Elite Group A and Elite Group B would feel the same thing tossing you under a bus for $1,000,000: nothing but the weight of their pockets getting heavier.

       How do you explain the existence of America, in open rebellion to the aristocracy of Europe? How do you explain the incredible improvement in the human condition before this great experiment was subverted? Leaps in science, literacy, economic growth and others that didn't occur for thousands of years occurred in just a few generations.

       Satan is real and he uses dualism.  Both the light and dark are his and h doesn't care who is winning as long as people deny Jesus Christ.  Most of the scientific advancement you think has happened in the fields of quantum theory and cosmology are complete fabrications.  All the world's space agencies are elite propaganda.  Darwin and Newton were an Occultists.  Evolution is a lie,  the Earth is flat, and "outer space" doesn't exist.

       Lucifer means bringer of light.  The light bearer.  All the Luciferian cults like the Masons talk about bringing the light into the world.

       "Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view." - Albert Pike (33rd degree Freemason)

       2Co 11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

      <p>
       2Co 11:15  Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.

       It seems I misunderstood what you were saying, at first. Satan does indeed masquerade as an angel of light.

       God is real and so is Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom 1:21  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom 1:22  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 1:18  For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get yourself saved by the blood atonement of Jesus Christ by repenting and believing his Gospel. Which is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       If you stand before your perfect, holy, God under his perfect wrath at judgement and he throws you into a lake of fire for eternity you will have none to blame but yourself.  You will remember pridefully calling us insane forever as you think about how easy it would have been to be saved.

       It's possible, but I haven't been able to confirm it. And I don't know that there was ever an actual Plus Ultra, at least not a large or important group by that name. Plus Ultra seems to have been a meme planted that there might be a good group of elites somewhere, not necessarily under the name Plus Ultra.

       The good guys are you and me and all the nobodies hiding behind the internet.  Everyone you see on the news is a bad guy.  If a good guy ever becomes a somebody, he gets put on a short list and he gets neutralized one way or another.
