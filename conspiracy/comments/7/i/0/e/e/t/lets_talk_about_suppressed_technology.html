        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here are a few technologies that you can verify with mainstream science that are not being implemented in spite of the incredible benefits they would offer:</p>

<h1>Molten Salt Reactors</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/what-is-molten-salt-reactor-424343/">Molten Salt Reactors</a> are superior to conventional nuclear reactors in almost every way. They cannot melt down due to safety features inherent to their design. If they overheat, the fuel melts a plug simply falls into a holding tank and cools down, without any human input.</p>

<p>They produce far less waste than conventional designs, and may even be able to turn old nuclear waste back into fuel, thus reducing the net nuclear waste in the world. With scaling, costs of 1-2 cents per kilowatt hour, are achievable, making them the cheapest form of electricity currently available.</p>

<p>Molten Salt Reactors have been a viable technology since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment">1960s</a> when the United States ran a test reactor for several years. By all accounts, the test was a successful proof of concept.</p>

<h1>Cheap, Safe Access to Space</h1>

<p>Currently it costs thousands of dollars to send one pound of payload to space on a rocket. At this cost, economic opportunities in space, such as asteroid mining or space-based solar power are not viable.</p>

<p>However, we have many ways of deploying payloads that are both cheaper and safer. There were many viable ideas for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_propulsion">nuclear propulsion</a> that would have produced much better thrust than liquid fuel rockets and removed the constant risk of explosions.</p>

<p>There are other ways to access space that don&#39;t involve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rocket_spacelaunch">rockets</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator">Space Elevator</a> remains difficult, but there are materials being developed (nanotubes and graphene) that are strong enough to support the long tether.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t necessary, however, because we have designs to access space with current materials technology. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1MAg0UAAHg">Launch Loop</a> is a large ground-based launcher that can safely send payloads into space for a tiny fraction of the cost of rockets. An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E">Orbital Ring</a> is a form of space elevator that can send payloads to low earth orbit (no strong materials required) and then launch them out into space using maglev technology.</p>

<p>There are many feasible ideas along these lines. Reducing the cost of sending a payload into space by 99% or more, they would open the door to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/09/the-potential-100-trillion-market-for-space-mining/">trillions of dollars</a> in economic productivity through asteroid mining.</p>

<p>Solar panels produce far more electricity in space with no cloud cover or night time, and this solves the current base load problems (not running at night) with solar. The ability to put solar panels into space could result in electricity generated for less than one cent per kilowatt hour, or nearly free energy.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>There are many other verifiably suppressed technologies, such as anti-aging therapies, wellness-based medicine, hydrological engineering, vacuum rail, and so on. The problem isn&#39;t the lack of viable technologies. The problem is that we haven&#39;t risen up and <em>demanded</em> the future that we deserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Profit disruption is a part of it, but not the biggest part. These technologies would grow the economy, giving people free time and growing the population. Population growth leads to greater population density, which is one of the most important factors influencing both technological innovation and diffusion of knowledge.</p>

<p>Free time would give people time to think and learn, leading to their becoming outraged at the actions of the current rulers. This is the real reason for keeping people poor and stupid, and it&#39;s been that way since ancient rulers instituted forced labor for exactly the same reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s cool. Ive been doing research to try and piece it together for awhile now. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it was FBI and if it were why would field agents be instructed under secrecy to arrest Sava Kosanovich(The distant relative to Tesla who had access to his safe) </p>

<p>Or a women come to John O&#39;Neil&#39;s before his death about information pertaining Tesla&#39;s work and was afraid of revealing information about her maiden name because of the army(They visited John so he assumed that fear was warranted to a degree). I find it cool The u.s armies role(rightfully so because he was developing stuff for their war Department) 
she did give a potential clue to her identity though. 
John thought it was crucial that she be tracked down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about this, and how I&#39;ve heard NWO is 25 years ahead of us technologically. According to their agenda, mass mind control is the solution to world peace, and they indoctrinate us through the education system, press, and internet to believe material things are the way to boost the economy. If they wanted us to prosper, they&#39;d have given us some of these technologies, but instead they want us to toil until we are dead. It&#39;s all about creating wealth for themselves, and spying on us. Technology like the cell phone is just so they can keep track of us. After watching Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick I&#39;m convinced they have the technology to control us most of all, and the &quot;alien&quot; ships they test that keep popping up everywhere are a way to keep surveillance on us and one day used to incite world panic. It&#39;s probably the last trick up their sleeve to keep us in line if we decide to unite against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my favorite topics!</p>

<p><a href="https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2017/11/invention-secrecy-2017/">https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2017/11/invention-secrecy-2017/</a></p>

<p>As of FY2017, there are 5,784 patents forced to be classified under the Invention Secrecy Act.</p>

<p>The worst part about Invention Secrecy isn&#39;t even any specific technology that is stunted by the Deep State.
The worst part is that Deep State has decided by itself what can and cannot be &quot;Knowledge&quot; itself.
The Founding Fathers never would have created any patent system if they had
known it would be abused for society wide censorship.</p>

<p>What&#39;s in those secret patents? Could any of those inventions contribute to
other innovations that could lead to scientific and engineering break throughs
that would transform and benefit everyone in society?  Are any of these
inventions being used to prop up secret Monopolists and AntiTrust and other
unfair business practices, for the select benefit of a few Insider&#39;s who funnel
all the profits to themselves, while you and I and any oversight are none the
wiser?</p>

<p>The Govt is far outside of its enumerated powers when it is deciding by itself
what Knowledge can be known, with no consent of the governed.</p>

<p>That egregious blunder of divine hubris is precisely how Copernican and
Galilean Revolutions spark and crash entire Empires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holograms are actively surpressed for money reasons. I work in volumetric video and holographic development and the price of these machines are over inflated beyond belief.  </p>

<p>Look into mvis. This stuff could be everywhere but they actively discourage use of their own products. It&#39;s fucking weird. </p>

<p>Our world could be very different if not for greed. </p>

<p>Did you know we have completely transparent hd displays? Floating full color 3d display tech? Displays that work off of 3d point cloud data displaying fully volumetric videos up to 800x800x800@ 300fps 14bpc. </p>

<p>This stuff bothers me for some reason, but it&#39;s a good paycheck, and they never made me specifically sign anything saying I couldn&#39;t talk about it. </p>

<p>I actually am under the impression that it doesn&#39;t have a good practical application at the moment. The content I make for this stuff is almost pure hot garbage. 3d animations of Pikachu&#39;s and Happy meals.  Shoes and lipstick model animation. Actually, none of it really makes much together. It never seems like it&#39;s for any one company.  Just a bunch of pieces. </p>

<p>Then again, I&#39;m not really allowed to see the end product they&#39;re used on. I&#39;d take a picture but when I work on these things they take my phone from me and put it in some faraday box.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the Government/world leaders know thousands of technological advances but harbors them for timed public release increasing profit and growth of the public. I’ll make a small list of ideas/advances I believe are kept from Americans; more so the globe to control the rate we progress spiritually and through the universe. </p>

<p>I started off looking into 100mpg conspiracies. That turned into carburetor patents as far back as 1920’s IIRC. From then into fuel vapor devices getting cars insane gas mileage compared to today. Furthermore into fuel comes water fueled cars by burning the hydrogen. There are stories of people being paid by companies for their inventions for increased fuel efficiency, and there are plenty of workshops being raided by MIB. Open your eyes people. We are killing ourselves being so inefficient but that’s what they want.</p>

<p>Furthermore my nighttime tangents of browsing, looking into free energy and magnetism. Free energy would benefit or destroy life as we know it. There have been stories of people making devices; but they emit a frequency that satellites can pin point. Expect MIB within 15 minutes of using one for extended time. Magnets are used from anti-gravity with electricity, Spacecraft, and free energy. Not just your fridge. </p>

<p>I’m unsure if you could classify health personally and medically as technology but I will for sake of my open mind. Pineal gland, meditation, astral projection/remote viewing. As far as tech, look at reptilian Rockefeller living so long. Confidence? </p>

<p>Also Hollow Earth.</p>
