<p>I mean by science standards there are no &quot;gods&quot; or &quot;divine creators&quot; so my theory based solely in personal opinion is there is more control to lose by letting go of religion. </p>

<p>People would probably utterly lose their shit if gods were proved not to exist but why? I mean sure, it&#39;s a staple in many people&#39;s moral fabric but it also isn&#39;t for many many others. </p>

<p>To just know that this is all you&#39;ve got so you better be a good person and give to people all you can before it&#39;s over is pretty reassuring to me.</p>

<p>Time to dump the fantasies. </p>

<p>It is coming. Slowly... steadily. </p>

<p>Look at the censuses. A definite uptick on  people not shamed into saying &quot;Christian&quot; on there now. The last few decades have seen a startling increase in atheism. Not because our numbers are growing but because we aren&#39;t vilified and chastised (and even murdered) for saying so ( at least on this side of the world) anymore.</p>

<p>Ridiculous fantasy. Just admit it&#39;s parables and you can go on your silly way </p>

<p>I&#39;m not hardcore religious myself, but I find that Christians/Muslims/Jews/Buddhists/etc usually behave as if what they believe is true, but atheists usually do <em>not</em> behave as if what they believe is true.</p>

<p>Which is a data point for me, since I seek answers, but when determining the weight of someone&#39;s opinion I must determine if they actually have a belief system or are just going through the motions for other reasons.</p>

<p>Why? If you take away macro evolution everything points to intelligent design. It&#39;s logical to believe in a creator. Remember, TPTB push this theory on us for a reason. They want everyone to be without God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If TPTB had things their way, everyone would be an Atheist. They don&#39;t like people believing in religion because then they cannot control the narrative. They cannot dictate morality, and they cannot be god. They convince Atheists that they are thinking on their own but at the end of the day most atheists hold the same views because they are conditioned to. Atheism is culturally limited to it&#39;s immediate context, so it is perfect for TPTB because its standards can change fluidly without recourse. I would argue that free and open thought leads to deeper theological and theistic revelations rather than atheistic ones. TPTB don&#39;t want anyone believing in a higher power than themselves</p>

Science is a subjective religion where the scripture is written by weak minded fools who cannot live without an explanation. Why should we go to war unless we are passionate and what is the purpose of passion for meaningless animals such as ourselves. Logic is far too limited in what it can explain. We have war constantly, but we hide it. Logic has only taught us to knod our heads as though we understand a universe we were never meant to and hide the truth of our fear.

<p>Same can be said about Atheistic views. We&#39;ve seen that in Communist regimes, where they just massacre millions of mouth breathers. They were unfit, vermin, so who cares... was the mentality.</p>

<p>There&#39;s simply no logical way to jump to the conclusion that God exists.</p>

<p>Why? If you take away macro evolution everything points to intelligent design. It&#39;s logical to believe in a creator. Remember, TPTB push this theory on us for a reason. They want everyone to be without God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If TPTB had things their way, everyone would be an Atheist. They don&#39;t like people believing in religion because then they cannot control the narrative. They cannot dictate morality, and they cannot be god. They convince Atheists that they are thinking on their own but at the end of the day most atheists hold the same views because they are conditioned to. Atheism is culturally limited to it&#39;s immediate context, so it is perfect for TPTB because its standards can change fluidly without recourse. I would argue that free and open thought leads to deeper theological and theistic revelations rather than atheistic ones. TPTB don&#39;t want anyone believing in a higher power than themselves</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have become subject to this if you can&#39;t see how hard TPTB are fighting against religion. They take it out if work, school, media, and higher education. They careful construct an anti theistic agenda and have the media (which they control) collectively laugh at anything remotely religious. You my friend have been turned, and you don&#39;t even see it.</p>
