<p>I&#39;ve seen a few posts talking about who made bitcoin, why, and if the major players in bitcoin are working against it&#39;s premise, or against us. Some specific passages I noted here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, the occurrence of Bitcoin followed by all the other cryptocurrencies, in some or even many ways, became not only our chase but even a scream for freedom. It became a way, we all believed or still do, that would liberate us from big player&#39;s and big brother&#39;s control, from manipulative and controlling corporations, banking cartels and governments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his/her warning message, Luka Magnotta said that <strong>many governments were secretly buying Bitcoin, trying to ensure their resistance</strong>. Their large volume Bitcoin purchases caused even more significant value increase of the Bitcoin, but despite that most of the governments don&#39;t exist anymore (in 2025) as those Bitcoins ended up on private accounts of greedy government employees who vanished afterward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m seeing something that&#39;s not really there, but I found it to be interesting to look at none-the-less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way.  It&#39;s already shifted from a currency to a store of value (like gold, aka &quot;digital gold&quot;).  Until the transsaction backlogs and fees are reduced, and the price volatility stabilizes, Bitcoin will not be used as a currency thr world over.  Hell, even Steam recently stopped using Bitcoin as a payment on their site, because of the reasons I&#39;ve stated.</p>

<p>Bitcoin might be the idea seed for a future global cryptocurrency currency, but I doubt it will be the one.</p>
