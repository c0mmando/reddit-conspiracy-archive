       Firstly, I think there are massive conspiracies in the world. I find believing otherwise is pathologically naive and a result of sophisticated design, propaganda, schooling etc. However, most content created by conspiracy theorists and their "subcontractors" feels like undisciplined garbage or noise purposefully created to cause confusion, hopelessness, defeatism etc. 
As a matter of fact, I do not side with anyone on any matter in the world. I am not even sure regular people are any better than evil elites. I am only interested in a cold, objective description of the world we live in. So, watching amateurishly edited videos with no point, or stuff like how Lady Gaga is an MK Ultra victim are not much interesting to me. I am looking for fresh material and points of view. Can anyone suggest any authors, documentaries etc. ?

       The 6 Purposes of Schooling by John Taylor Gatto explains how PS in the US is used to create cogs in the machine and pre-select a new generation of leaders. JTG was a NYC school teacher for 30 years who won multiple state-wide awards for teaching excellence, before retiring to spread the Truth about the system-

       Here's a great Documentary (split up into smaller parts) about the origin of Farming and Civilization as we know it from the late Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age-

      <p>
       I would also recommend a couple of books on Western Civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Brief History of Western Civilization, by John Harrison- Details the origins of the West starting in Sumer and Egypt, transferred through to Crete then Greece, Rome, and Western Europe. Really helped me to organize my thoughts and see the full narrative of Western Civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why The West Rules: For Now, by Ian Morris. Morris is a Professor of Classics at Cornell, and in this seminal work he described the rise of both East and West, and seeks to answer questions such as why the Industrial Revolution began in Europe and not the more developed China. His main theses is that Geography was the driving factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also look into Magick and the Occult.

       This is the wiki entry for Hermeticism, a fantastic place for anyone who wishes to begin investigating the ideas surrounding Hermes Trismigestus, the Mystery Schools, and more-
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a good primer for Gnosis and also dives in to Hermetic magick-

        http://gnosis.org/hermes.htm
       </a>
      </p>

       Here is a link to start research on Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and Magick, who was also associated with Hermes in the Greek Mythological tradition.
       <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/thoth.html">

      </p>

       Here is a primer from wiki on Crowleys' definition of Magick and a rundown of this Thelema, an absolutely essential piece to understanding the modern Occult-
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Thelema)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Thelema)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And a book- The History of Magic and the Occult, by Kurt Seligmann. This offers an academic view of Magick and its origins in Sumer and Egypt up through the 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       kind of a hodgepodge, I know, but you didn't really specify what you were into...

       I am questioning the authenticity of the NK documentary. Although, who would go the lengths to make such a fake video, right? I am not sure if they would air this on national NK TV though. Maybe it was made for the eyes of some select individuals as part of their training?

       That's not it friend. The problem with the whole conpiracy culture is that mainstream view of conspiracy theorists is not all that wrong. Most people who feel a tendency towards such stuff do so because they fail in life, relationships etc. or they have serious mental problems. So if you do not pick your material carefully you are bound to be subject to unorganized, undiscplened blabbering of idiots looking for a mega excuse to why their existence suck so much.
Another big problem is the phenomenon of controlled opposition. Alex Jones is a fraud as much as Noam Chomsky is (in my humble opinion). 
So, I am trying to find intelligent sources not mild, tamed ones. Scarier the better as a matter of fact.

       from content and degree of coherence of  (the lack thereof actually) the material and more importantly personal experience, even first hand personal experience i.e. my own. For example I am here talking to you right now because I just broke up with my long term gf and nothing else was enough to keep my mind off my actual problems. Whenever I do not have anything going on in my life I become more interested in the big picture.

       What would you personally say the big picture is? You're aware that the big picture always exists right, and that some people are interested in the big picture regardless if they're having girl problems. I'm not sure what the New World Order has to do with your girlfriend, but many people think it's important enough to stay on top of even with the many things going on in their lives. So I'm not sure why topics like MKUltra are for tin foil hat losers. This is all very real my friend.

       Never said that. Just said "not that interesting to me". I personally would like to decipher codes Hollywood uses than obsessing about celebrities. 
I am not here to pick a fight. If you do not agree with my opinions (or your projections of what they are) you are free not to advise me anything.

       Have you watched this before? I personally have not. However, I've heard very good reviews on it. It's featured here a lot. You just might enjoy it. Cheers.

       I am thinking of trying to read "On Bullshit" by Harry Frankfurt. It is supposed to be a theoretical work on how bullshit works. Not exactly conspiracy theory material, but might be worth my while.

       What would you personally say the big picture is? You're aware that the big picture always exists right, and that some people are interested in the big picture regardless if they're having girl problems. I'm not sure what the New World Order has to do with your girlfriend, but many people think it's important enough to stay on top of even with the many things going on in their lives. So I'm not sure why topics like MKUltra are for tin foil hat losers. This is all very real my friend.
