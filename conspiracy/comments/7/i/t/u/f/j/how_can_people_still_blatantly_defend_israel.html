How the fuck can the masses completely defend all of Israel&#39;s actions as if they have never &amp; are not doing anything morally horrible at all? This is made incredibly apparent on Reddit, say anything remotely critical of Israel &amp; you will be immediately downvoted to hell, any &amp; all facts against them will be brushed aside. Like WTF, this is even more blantant with the Palestinian conflict, i&#39;ve heard several amounts of people try to tell me that Israel historically treated them peacefully &amp; and that they were justified in exiling the 700k Palestinians from their homes. What the actual fuck, how is this possible, how are people this ignorant towards the real world, like what the hell are they teaching these kids in school nowadays that we have so many of us growing up with these warped ideals of history &amp; our current reality?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel, and the middle East in general is wildly more complex than most in the USA realize. After spending a couple of years there, I realize I still don&#39;t understand the complexities of that region. What really confuses me is why we focus on Israel versus the adjacent  countries. For example, compare the number killed in Israel versus Syria over the past 5 years. Or look at the treatment of Shia Muslims in the Kingdom of Saudi. Israel looks like a saint compared to the other countries in the region (except maybe Jordan, which is a pretty solid country). I also find it odd that we focus on the rights of the Palestinian people, but ignore the Bedouin, Druze and Christians who have also lived in the region since the time of Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I hate are people who make it far more complex than it is. The zionists stole Palestine, on the word of some 2000 odd year old fantasy book... And they use the guise of the holocaust to rationalize all of it, and put anyone down who criticizes it. They have been the greatest example of oppression, genocide, and backwards primitive mentality for ALMOST 100 YEARS NOW. Pretty fuckin simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And before the Zionists stole it, the Ottoman stole it.  The fact is, the region has been rolled over by conquering armies for all of recorded history.<br/>
Greatest example of genocide? Really?
The Syrian conflict is estimated at 481,000 in the past couple of years.  The total death count of Palestinian&#39;s since the 1920&#39;s is estimated at 91,000.  Palestinian&#39;s have killed roughly 2000 Palestinian&#39;s in intra-fada fighting.  </p>

<p>I am not giving the Israeli&#39;s a pass for their actions, but I also don&#39;t see this as a simple environment with a simple solution.  Why do Arab Muslim&#39;s get their own country, while Bedouin and Druze people do not?  The Bedouin claim to the territory is as valid as the Palestinian people&#39;s claims.</p>

In fact much of what is in it is reliable, but you have to take into account a) words and meaning we&#39;re most definitely lost in translation and altered in Councils such as that of Nicea where Jesus&#39;s teaching we&#39;re completely construed and b) Abstract terminology such as &quot;seeing a dragon in the sky&quot; or &quot;healing miracles&quot; may actually refer to things that the people writing it simply did not have words for. Let me ask you this, if you we&#39;re to describe a Jet plane in the sky right now with using the words Jet or plane how would it look like?</p>

<p>Please tell me what I am a believer of? I promise you whatever strawman you will try and construe is wrong. The problem you have is that you have this false notion of what God means.

<p>I never said that it does.

In fact I am inclined to believe that the God of the old testament is an E.T. of some sort or survivor of a prehistorical advanced civilization i.e. Atlantis.</p>

<p>Again you are creating these strawman arguments that do not represent the metaphysical teachings of these religions. It makes you come across as arrogance and ignorant. I am inclined to believe that the polytheistic religions are based upon similar prehistorical times when E.T. or at least a extremely advanced civilization ruled the earth and perhaps more. These &quot;Gods&quot; I believe refer to the beings that we&#39;re in control at that time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nor are the the theories presented in this paper at variance with the essential tenets of the Judeo-Christian stream of thought. The concept of visibile reality(i.e. the &quot;created&quot; world) as being an emanation of an omnipotent and omniscient divinity who is completely unknowable in his primary state of being. The Absolute at rest in infinity is a concept straight out of Hebrew mystical philosphy. Even the Christian concept of the Trinity shinres through the description of the Absolute as presented in this paper. The description of energy totally at rest, in infinity fits the Christian metaphysical concept of the Father while the inifinite self-conciousness resident in that energy providing the motive force of will to bring a portion of that energy into motion to create reality corresponds with the Son. --From the Gateway paper itself</p>

<p>Not really, the bible has some kind words. Aldo it is not more insightful than Harry Potter. Billions of people hate and believe just because a book told them to, and it&#39;s been like that for years. The bible, just like other religions, is the root of the ignorance we have today, so don&#39;t try to make it a pretty fairy tale that has some metaphors about the ancient giants that once lived here. Anything ancient is copy paste from other books and civilizations, like Gilgamesh - sumerians or the &quot;born of a virgin&quot; which is a tale from the Egyptians, or the &quot;flood&quot;. The rest is just made up bullshit like living in a whale, talking snakes, creating a world in 7 days or the Apocalypse with horses, trumps and dragons.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see that YOU put the meaning to things in your life. In this universe events are neutral. It isn&#39;t insightful to YOU. Now that said like I said before I see the Old Testament of the Bible as a historical document which holds merit when compared against other tales of it&#39;s time. To compare it to a fantasy novel is quite nonsensical for numerous reasons that need not be stated.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again things only have the meaning that they are assigned. It is bullshit to you, but you clearly do not see the full picture. It&#39;s interesting that basically your &quot;rational&quot; argument is, &quot;If I can&#39;t understand it or don&#39;t know why it is the way it is it is bullshit.&quot; That is the opposite of rationality which should be striving to understand things as they are not casting out that which doesn&#39;t agree with you. A truly rational person knows they know nothing and treats each possibility as equally probable until proven otherwise. Again I encourage you to read Graham Hancock Magicians of the Gods if you haven&#39;t already and look into Egyptology and see that our pre-history is loaded with inaccuracies. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Now I am not saying Jesus is the son of God I believe that many of modern religions today basically took these valid spiritual teachings which essentially presented modern energy physics (i.e. law of one) where basically what is outside of yourself is a representation of your own beliefs and thoughts (ultimately manifested through other dimensions with the proper amount of energy) and twisted the teachings into these ritualistic control cycles where you go to Church once a week preform a ritual and look to the &quot;arbiters&quot; of spiritual knowledge &quot;Churches&quot; for spiritual knowledge when the reality is all of the answers lie inside of yourself.</p>

<p>All of these Religions are controlled by a single hidden organization or &quot;brotherhood&quot; which has controlled human events for thousands of years leading to much hatred and war to hide the old spiritual knowledge of Atlantis which was hidden in the Library of Alexandria is now locked away in the Vatican and Constantinople. So you are correct in saying that these religions are the cause of much hatred and division because they are controlled by beings who feast off our hatred and division and not allowing us to realize our multidimensional spiritual selves.</p>

<p>I believe with good reason that includes evidence from multiple sources that much of the &quot;visions&quot; of the Bible were actually drug induced (i.e. DMT or LSD) visions and descriptions of technology from a Civilization that exists on the inside of the Earth after the flood.</p>

<p>Regarding ancient Giants there is quite the evidence of extremely large humanlike beings living hear thousands of years ago from skeletons to cave drawings.</p>

<p>It really comes down to what you have seen. There is evidence to support my conclusions, but obviously it isn&#39;t widespread and mainstream and I would argue that is by design. It is a theory in that I came to the conclusion from dozens of unrelated sources all converging on the same conclusions backed with evidence each of their own validity. I also have experienced many of the &quot;spiritualism&quot; first hand including some quite peculiar experiences. Now I haven&#39;t smoked DMT but I suggest you read about some of the experiences people have posted about while taking it as well. Or even astral projection. Or if you want to engage your rational side check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/773ok5/subjective_experience_i_saw_fractal_structure_of/">this</a> is pretty similar to what I have found.</p>

<p>Also you should look further into what you call fiction. If what I am saying is true and I believe so much of what you call fiction is actually rooted in truth. Harry Potter for example with its description of &quot;magic&quot; is really just channeling of multidimensional energy using things like wands, rings, crowns, etc or even blood rituals much like the ones people believe exist in Hollywood and D.C. it&#39;s all connected.</p>

They dislike you for your ideology of 2017 years ago this place was ours so give it back And so I have the right to kill and remove you from land that was my right 2017 years ago...sounds a bit strange and unethical no?

    <div class="md"><p>I think a big difference, especially from anti-war Americans, is that Israel and the US are such close allies, and Israel arguably has a large degree of influence in American politics. Just look at how every  major presidential candidate has talked about how much of a friend to Israel they&#39;ll be. Now the US is also allies with several Arab nations, notably KSA today, but it&#39;s seen as much more of a vassal state relationship.</p>

<p>So when I criticize Israel, I&#39;m also doing it from the standpoint of criticizing my government&#39;s support of Israel&#39;s policies which I oppose. </p>

It&#39;s a very sufficient way of shutting people up. Rothschild Boulevard is at the center of Tel Aviv. What else is the Rothschild name at the center of? Our money system.

<p>This is the original post from the thread we are arguing over, which claims that the Khazars (a Turkic tribe) are modern day &quot;Jews&quot; with &quot;no relation to the original tribe&quot;. Genetic evidence does not support this. Khazars can be Jews by religion (and were) but that in no way suggests that most Jews are Khazars today. There&#39;s nothing to actually support that.</p>

You&#39;re arguing for the modern contemporary definition of a word and that&#39;s ok.

<p>I used eyewitness accounts, such as the &quot;gas chambers&quot; not being air tight in any way, as well as remnants of normal bathroom plumbing being found in them. mixed with the logic that gassing people to death is simply a horribly inefficient way of killing people.</p>

<p>Also, I think it&#39;s Fox News that&#39;s selling pro-Israel sentiment, all the Fox News watchers I used to know at my old work would always say, &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t we want to support our only friend in the middle east.&quot;  I would try to explain to them that no one is seriously questioning the existence of Israel at this point, we&#39;re just questioning the Isreali extremists running the government over there and everything they&#39;ve done to try to make a two state solution impossible because they fundamentally don&#39;t believe in one.  Also, that doesn&#39;t make any sense, because if they become one state then what are they going to do with the Palestinians?  They&#39;re will be more Arabs than Jews and I don&#39;t see Israel loving that outcome.</p>

its funny to see this deflection spin always try to pain the majority with a few people saying awful shit, i mean its almost as if its a tactic the JIDF always seem to bring out in these threads, one of them post some insane hitler shit, and then the JIDF all pile on screaming see they are all antisemetic, when in fact it was one of them who posted the shitty comments.</p>

<p>they do this all the fucking time, half the time people get caught painting swastikas on shit its fucking jews doing it.</p>

<p>most of the &quot;denial&quot; here is that the numbers were massively inflated and most of the truely sadistic shit was made up.</p>

<p>did a lot of jews get rounded up? yes
did they get thrown in to work camps? yes</p>

<p>were 6 million killed? fuck if i know because i have never seen a single piece of evidence to back that up.</p>

<p>were they shoved down rollercoasters that flung them in to incinerators? probably not because the witnesses that claimed that read like a childs recollection of a dream where physics and space no longer apply.</p>

<p>the reality is half of it was trumped up lies to justify killing the enemy because we won and they lost, and no one wanted people looking in to the truth or minutia of why the war was actually fought.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Hamas use human shields (non-combatants to deter enemies from firing at them) because they are effective-- Israelis and Americans care about the lives of noncombatants. However Americans and Israelis don&#39;t use human shields on a matter of principle, but even if they did,  they wouldn&#39;t deter their enemies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that the Jewish loosing their country is a punishment from God for disobeying his laws right?</p>

<p>That is the whole narrative of Jewish history. </p>

<p>The creation of the state of Israel is unacceptable because you murdered thousands of people and forced them to give up their homes in order to make room for Jews.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really matter which side is fighting for peace now. Israel doesn&#39;t want a two state solution because they are religious fanatics who were perfectly willing to massacre a whole group of people to force their way into the area. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you find it a bit odd that a people who supposedly want nothing more than a home would be willing to take the home of another people? Seems pretty atrocious to me. </p>

<p>Our opinions aren&#39;t based on Facebook photos and bbc. They are based on historical facts. And moral standards that don&#39;t find the murder of thousands of people acceptable.</p>

<p>Who asked Palestine if it was okay to move the Jews in? No one we slaughtered them to make room for you. And then you continue to slaughter them and defy the law to expand your Jewish state.</p>

<p>You realize that when the Jews were brought to that area of the world it was to live in small pockets of land. Basically small neighborhoods. And now you have them all fully connected and have built walls to separate people who have way more right to it than you do. </p>

<p>The Jews were kicked out of Canaan thousands of years ago and ever since have been going from place to place murdering people for the sake of a home. And just because some asshole did the same to your people the entire world has allowed a modern genocide to take place in Palestine. </p>

<p>But of course you know all that right because you live there? </p>

<p>Generally, population trends in Israel reflect distinct patterns of three sub-groups: Non-Haredi Jews (around 63.3% of the population), Haredi Jews (11.7%), and Arabs (20.7%).[6] Over the past decade, the Muslim annual population growth has fallen significantly, from around 3% to less than 2.2% by 2013,[7] while the overall Jewish growth rate rose from around 1.4% to 1.7%, primarily due to the expanding Orthodox Jewish sector.[8]</p>

<p>Your lack of logic can almost be considered a skill. I am glad you ignore basic human rights. I bet when Israel destroyed those Palestinian cemeteries with bulldozers so they could be one story rancher style homes you blamed the Palestinians for being &quot;in the way&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure.  There would probably be some kind of war involving Iran and other surrounding hostile nations.  I used to think like you (who cares if they should be there or not, they are there and we can&#39;t go back in time and change it) but I&#39;ve come to realize there will never be peace in the middle east as long as they&#39;re unnaturally propped up there.  I&#39;m not gonna moralize over Israel vs Palestine because if I were Israel I would act exactly like they act, and if I were Palestine I would act exactly like they act.  At the end of the day I say their right to be there depends on their ability to defend themselves there.  With the United States backing them it&#39;s not natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently shared the video from this sub showing an American Jew being silenced by the Israeli army with brutal force for speaking up against what they&#39;re doing while in Israel. </p>

<p>A fellow Jewish friend chimed in and his first comment was, &quot;oh from 2014...ok.&quot; I mentioned how if anything, its worse now. I went ahead and shared with him a few IG posts from <a href="http://instagram.com/robert_martin_palestine_">http://instagram.com/robert_martin_palestine_</a> and asked why Palestinians are treated this way and his response was a video of a knife attack on the Israeli army at a checkpoint and a pie graph. When I asked him about the the videos I shared (one was the Israeli kid holding an assault rifle), he didn&#39;t say anything. </p>

<p>I think people just don&#39;t want to see or believe certain things. They rather live in their perfect little world without knowing what&#39;s really going on. You show someone the truth and you become antisemitic or like my friend said, &quot;you&#39;re spewing hate.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is truly a great question. While evidence of the Isreali side of acting agressively toward the Palestinians is shown almost daily on the news around the world, many people still take up for the Israelis. My initial assumption is about religion. The media outlets that support the Israeli movements are mostly Judeo-Christian, where the media outlets that support the Palestinians are mostly Arabic in nature. Many nations like the U.S. claim to be tolerant of all religions (and some of us Americans REALLY ARE while others are not tolerant at all) however are still ran from a classically Judeo-Christian perspective lending support to Israel. There is also the politics and investments behind the scenes that also control this. I am not going all conspiracy here or anything, just stating that if Jewish people tend to financially support your causes, you tend to support their causes sort of thing. Almost like an ally sort of thing. </p>

<p>These are just a few facets into the complicated world of international politics in the Middle East today. </p>

<p>Read up on the history of the Palestinians and Jewish people throughout the centuries as well and that will give you a more mature introduction into the political complexities between these two groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re Jewish, they are being blackmailed by Jews, they are afraid of Jews, they have religious beliefs favoring Jews or Israel etc. The double think is MASSIVE, many Americans are so brainwashed they ignore the tell tale signs Israel did 911.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And how is the removal of 700k Palestinians any different from the Indian Removal Act, in which the United States removed the Indians?  People &quot;blatantly defend Israel&quot; because it didn&#39;t do anything wrong.  Removing people from your country is how countries exist.  Every single country in the history of the world has done it -- the US, England, France, Spain, Russia, Germany..... Every. Single. One.   </p>

<p>Why does Israel have the right to exist?  Because it won the war.  That is how it works.  For Every. Single. Country.  Why does England have a right to exist? Because of bunch of French dudes came and killed King Harold.  Then the French dudes (Normans) started expelling the removing the native people (Saxons) and this went on for centuries.  Then they killed the Scotts.   </p>

<p>Why does the US have a right to exist?  Because a bunch of terrorists killed the British (formerly know as &quot;French Dudes&quot;).  </p>

<p>You starting to see how it works? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not true.  Israel was denied use of the straits of Tiran, and there was a build up of troops in Syria.  It was understood in the intelligence community that these were defensive moves, and that Israel had military superiority.  The estimates that were done in the intelligence community were on the dot about how the conflict was going to play out.  The Israeli&#39;s were pissed about being denied the ability to move their goods through the straits of Tiran, and used the troop build ups as a pretext to lunch an attack. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second paper Helms had brought—the “who will win” memo—was the crucial one. It stated that Israel could “defend successfully against simultaneous Arab attacks on all fronts . . . or hold on any three fronts while mounting successfully a major offensive on the fourth.”</p>

<p>Of course there was Mossad propaganda, but at least back then the IC had semblance of honesty. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two days later, Tel Aviv muddled this clear intelligence picture by submitting to Washington a Mossad estimate that claimed the Israeli military was badly outgunned by a Soviet-backed Arab war machine. The Israelis may have been trying to exploit the special relationship they had with James Angleton, chief of CIA counterintelligence. For years, Angleton had run the Israeli account out of his Counterintelligence Staff, without involving the Directorate of Plans&#39;s Near East Division. That unusual arrangement may have given Tel Aviv a sense that Washington accorded its analyses such special import that US leaders would listen to its judgments on Arab-Israeli issues over those of their own intelligence services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The blockage of Tiran was a provocative attempt by Arab nationalists to bait Israel into firing first.  Nasser’s overtly intentioned caliphate and active recruitment of surrounding countries was entirely hostile.  Once Nasser’s coordinated Arab attack began, however, Israel’s tactical advantage by taking out the Egyptian airfield crowned them victor in the region who could now dictate terms as they saw fit.

    <div class="md"><p>There was no attack on Nasser&#39;s part.  It is understood, and even admitted that his troop build up was defensive. It was admitted by Yitzhak Rabin in Le Monde. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not think Nasir wanted war. The two divisions which he sent to the Sinai, on May 14, would not have been sufficient to start an offensive against Israel.He knew it and we knew it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition here is what Nasir told the US state department:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Whether you believe it or not, we were in fear of an attack from Israel. We had been informed that the Israelis were massing troops on the Syrian border with the idea of first attacking Syria, there they did not expect to meet great resistance, and then commence their attack on the UAR.” I said to him that it was unfortunate the UAR had believed such reports, which were simply not in accordance with the facts. Nasir said that the information had not come to him from sources he would suspect. He added that among other signs “your own State Department called in my Ambassador to the U.S. in April or May and warned him that there were rumors that there might be a conflict between Israel and the UAR.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The historical evidence on this subject is clear.  The Israeli&#39;s and the US knew that Israel had military superiority, and would win in their objectives.   Nasir was acting defensively, with his moves then being utilized to further justify the war that ISRAEL LUNCHED. </p>

<p>Any talk of a Arab nationalists or Arab countries united to destroy Israel is Hasbara. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not really &quot;defend&quot;, more like say nothing out of self interest.  Israel stands as a buffer to un-reformed Islam (re: radical Islamic fundamentalism).  The Palestinian conflict is a vexing moral morass.  Israel&#39;s creation, like America&#39;s is based on over-running less technically advanced cultures.</p>

<p>The real question is: What&#39;s more important?  Survival of the culture that you depend upon for your well being, or doing what is &quot;right&quot;.  If the two were compatible, then I would agree, doing what&#39;s right is superior to Israel&#39;s actions.  However, Islamic fundamentalism (radical/unreformed Islam) is not compatible with western culture, and although I don&#39;t like how the Israel is treating the Palestinians, Israel&#39;s existence is important.</p>

<p>Reform Islam (like Christianity has been reformed) and I&#39;ll take a different stance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely because all the former communist states that refused diplomatic relationships with Israel or suspended them in 1967 (except Romania) were definitely controlled by the zionists/jews. Of course... Even when supporting the PLO and in bad or non-diplomatic relations with Israel the People of those states had witnessed the deportation of the Jews and seen the death camps, and wouldn&#39;t deny the Holocaust as you do. Ask those People in those countries. What happened to those 550.000 jews from Hungary that got deported and died during the WWII? What happened to those more than 200.000 jews that died in Romania and it&#39;s occupied territories? We could take this much further and also to look at it from a non jewish view, what happened to those 3,3 million dead russian POW? No systematic killing and forced labour under the worst circumstances could be the case for all those casualties, surely a conspiracy conducted by the jews, the capitalist and communist states.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have red-pilled many on Israel. Friends, Lovers, and family.</p>

<p>Everyone who sees the information, and goes to research for themselves, becomes anti-Zionist. EVERYONE.</p>

<p>Everyone except one person. My father. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>He refuses to listen or watch anything related. He does not want to change his mind. He chooses not to care about truth. </p>

<p>Some people are stubborn with their view of the world, and that changing it is a danger to them. If success is built from actions made of the content we have, his massive success is in danger of changing his mind, in any way. This is how some successful people think, when they have the momentum of life behind them. They conquer.</p>

<p>In respect to that context. I&#39;m pretty &#39;red-pilled&#39;, as an over-all understanding and acceptance of how human run/organized systems seems to progress into nepotistic hierarchy and personal vendetta of those at the top.</p>

<p>IN that process, I have no ambition to be part of a fucked up trickle down system, and most people who think they know everything grow apathetic in behavior. </p>

<p>As Tolstoy might have concluded: Meaning in life is a random leap of faith. A choice to believe in something, and then to move along. </p>

<p>Truth does not equate to happiness, and in mythology, brings only processes of suffering and acceptance in &#39;a sense of knowing&#39;.</p>

<p>Finally, that &#39;knowing&#39; and a &#39;sense of knowing&#39; are not the same thing. Yet, that confidence in a knowledge of a system, creates opportunistic and momentous behavior towards actions that bring upon general success, and in action a sense of meaning. That a sense of meaning is truth to some people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same reason many blatantly defend the US military forces. There are many assumptions that the US and it&#39;s allies are forces for &quot;good&quot; in the world. Therefore Israel is an ally=Israel must be good. A lot of good comments in here about the complexities of the Middle East. Now, I&#39;ll make some assumptions about Israel and their people. They probably are fed the same propaganda in their schools about the &quot;evil&quot; other. Therefore many feel justified in the way their military operates. </p>

<p>As long as WE continue to feed into the idea that the world operates in an Us vs them mentality. We will continue to be victimized by propaganda about the nefarious &quot;other.&quot; There is no &quot;them.&quot; There is only us. We cannot continue to scapegoat other countries. </p>

<p>There is no one to blame really except for all of us. We do this to ourselves. Because we hate that we love. Or maybe we love to hate others due to our own perceived lack of power. </p>

<p>I think our problem lies in the fact that we want to believe that countries work like machines. Machines all work the same, but countries are made up of individuals. All who tick to a slightly different tock. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are people in Israel who are screaming &quot;WTF are we doing!&quot; Just like many of us here in the US are screaming &quot;WTF are we doing!!&quot;</p>

<p>On top of which, most people are just trying to eek a living out inside the machine. Our imaginations are subverted into these political machines. And it&#39;s heartbreaking and difficult to deal with. It&#39;s difficult to stand up because sometimes it seems like you&#39;re all alone in a world gone mad. You risk losing friends. You risk losing family. And so we go along because we don&#39;t know what else to do. </p>

<p>But maybe it begins with not knowing what to do. Because in all reality who&#39;s fault is it dude? Is it mine? Is it yours? We are all guilty in one way or the other. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to change the world. I haven&#39;t got the slightest clue, but I think that&#39;s where it starts. Because until we can all admit that we don&#39;t know, we will fall victim to unconsciously following someone who says they know. </p>

<p>The country was called &quot;Israel&quot; until Hadrian became Roman Emperor, renamed it as &quot;Palestinia&quot; and eradicated all Jews from the country and banned them from their holy city of Jerusalem. The country was pagan, celebrating Roman gods until Constantine came to power, converted to Christianity and turned the nation into a Christian country, which lasted until the Muslims invaded and took the country for themselves. Then after hundreds of years of Christian/Muslim wars, they agreed to divide Jerusalem between them but still barred Jews from entering the city and kept it that way for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you have conspiracy nuts claiming &quot;Israel is evil, they should give the land back to Palestinians&quot; when it was the Palestinians who originally took the land from Israelis in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. It&#39;s complete lunacy. It&#39;s important to make the distinction between &#39;real Jews&#39; and &#39;false Jews&#39;, which the Bible warns of. In terms of what the Bible actually says, the Jews were promised the holy lands -- not a Jewish state. The state of Israel should not exist. It&#39;s a Rothschild creation, don&#39;t forget. Rothschild&#39;s have hijacked Judaism with Zionism, and the Zionists are in the process of hijacking the whole world. The Protocols of Zion provides the missing link of evidence which supports the infiltration of Judaism by &#39;false Jews&#39;, in my opinion, and it blatantly details the techniques of the Cabal. Israel is nothing but a puppet of the Rothschild&#39;s. </p>

<p>All of that being what it is... it&#39;s hard to really judge the average Jew for this. Jews, and practically all who support Zionist Israel, are among the most heavily brainwashed people on the planet. &#39;Real Jews&#39; are regularly protesting against the existence of the state of Israel, as well as the genocidal, terror creating/funding, manipulative actions of the state - and they&#39;re being put down with force. Holocaust literally means blood sacrifice and it&#39;s not an accident that most of the Jews sacrificed during that period were Orthodox (&#39;real&#39;) Jews. </p>

<p>So yeah, fuck Israel. I have no sympathy with the Jewish state at this point. I stand with Palestine. But I suspect, given what&#39;s going on, that the final genocide against Palestine is soon to be enacted. </p>

<p>I imagine you support Palestine in any conflicts with Israel, and yet if I wrote &quot;How the fuck can you completely defend Palestine&#39;s actions as if they have never &amp; are not doing anything morally horrible at all?&quot; you would say &quot;of course I admit they do things wrong, but that doesn&#39;t justify their suffering&quot; or something to that effect.</p>

<p>Well, the god from new testament is not all good as you might think.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again where did I say that he is &quot;good&quot;... You&#39;ve got a problem with making assumptions man come on... I&#39;ve read much 85+% of the Bible as I went to a Catholic school growing up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or listen/read what Dawkins says about it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh I get it now your an atheist so only an atheist&#39;s viewpoint is considered acceptable okay...</p>

<p>The problem with that viewpoint is not only the arrogance and quick dismissal of anyone who disagrees with weak strawmans in a weak attempt to rationalize that they are smarter than everyone else, but more ironically the fact that they are not really &quot;thinking rationally&quot; or on their own, but regurgitating what they have read from their atheist sources meaning you are doing the exact opposite of what you claim to be doing...</p>

<p>In addition modern science, specifically quantum mechanics, holographic theory, string theory in no way disproves God or &quot;infinite creator.&quot; In fact as many famous scientists such as Werner Heisenberg have said, “The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.” </p>

<p>Aldo it is not more insightful than Harry Potter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t see that YOU put the meaning to things in your life. In this universe events are neutral. It isn&#39;t insightful to YOU. Now that said like I said before I see the Old Testament of the Bible as a historical document which holds merit when compared against other tales of it&#39;s time. To compare it to a fantasy novel is quite nonsensical for numerous reasons that need not be stated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anything ancient is copy paste from other books and civilizations, like Gilgamesh - sumerians or the &quot;born of a virgin&quot; which is a tale from the Egyptians, or the &quot;flood&quot;. The rest is just made up bullshit like living in a whale, talking snakes, creating a world in 7 days or the Apocalypse with horses, trumps and dragons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again things only have the meaning that they are assigned. It is bullshit to you, but you clearly do not see the full picture. It&#39;s interesting that basically your &quot;rational&quot; argument is, &quot;If I can&#39;t understand it or don&#39;t know why it is the way it is it is bullshit.&quot; That is the opposite of rationality which should be striving to understand things as they are not casting out that which doesn&#39;t agree with you. A truly rational person knows they know nothing and treats each possibility as equally probable until proven otherwise. Again I encourage you to read Graham Hancock Magicians of the Gods if you haven&#39;t already and look into Egyptology and see that our pre-history is loaded with inaccuracies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no records that a guy named jesus lived from the Romans, and the latter is obviously mythology. Anyone who believes in jesus the son of god is severely misinformed, aldo the existence of a group called jesus or a guy can&#39;t be dismissed completely (like last-thursdayism).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I am not saying Jesus is the son of God I believe that many of modern religions today basically took these valid spiritual teachings which essentially presented modern energy physics (i.e. law of one) where basically what is outside of yourself is a representation of your own beliefs and thoughts (ultimately manifested through other dimensions with the proper amount of energy) and twisted the teachings into these ritualistic control cycles where you go to Church once a week preform a ritual and look to the &quot;arbiters&quot; of spiritual knowledge &quot;Churches&quot; for spiritual knowledge when the reality is all of the answers lie inside of yourself.</p>

<p>All of these Religions are controlled by a single hidden organization or &quot;brotherhood&quot; which has controlled human events for thousands of years leading to much hatred and war to hide the old spiritual knowledge of Atlantis which was hidden in the Library of Alexandria is now locked away in the Vatican and Constantinople. So you are correct in saying that these religions are the cause of much hatred and division because they are controlled by beings who feast off our hatred and division and not allowing us to realize our multidimensional spiritual selves.</p>

<p>I believe with good reason that includes evidence from multiple sources that much of the &quot;visions&quot; of the Bible were actually drug induced (i.e. DMT or LSD) visions and descriptions of technology from a Civilization that exists on the inside of the Earth after the flood.</p>

<p>Regarding ancient Giants there is quite the evidence of extremely large humanlike beings living hear thousands of years ago from skeletons to cave drawings.</p>
