        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those of you who don&#39;t know, a porn star named August Ames committed suicide after being cyberbullied for controversial comments about not wanting to work with gay male talent, as there is an increased risk of spreading HIV. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/07/porn-star-august-ames-commits-suicide-after-bullying-for-not-wanting-to-have-sex-with-man-who-did-gay-porn.html">http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/07/porn-star-august-ames-commits-suicide-after-bullying-for-not-wanting-to-have-sex-with-man-who-did-gay-porn.html</a></p>

<p>The news broke yesterday, as all sorts of communities talked about the story and the negative affect cyberbullying mobs have when they focus on one target and won&#39;t let up. Then, on pretty much every reddit sub, every news article was deleted, every trace of it gone. Try to find a single article that was posted yesterday and wasn&#39;t deleted since then - the only sub I&#39;ve found that didn&#39;t delete their August Ames threads is r/drama.</p>

<p>A lot of the mainstream media is also not touching this one. Fox News, British websites, Newsweek are, but nothing on CNN, MSNBC, CBS, or ABC. She wasn&#39;t some unknown porn star - at the time of her death she was the 9th most popular pornstar on PornHub, and when that Bachelor contestant committed suicide a few years ago, it was CNN front-page news. </p>

<p>So why make the August Ames story go quiet? </p>

<p>To me it should be the one time of the year everyone with a holiday around then should just chill the fuck out and feast. I mean hell the Germans and allies could do it in a major world war I think Joe Christian and frank atheist should chill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People should look into her husband and his connections.</p>

<p>If she blew a whistle on her talent agency breaching fiduciary duties to their clients, i.e., omitting material and relevant information - like that the person you&#39;re about to have sex with has an increased likelihood of STD&#39;s, that could lead to a lot of problems for a lot of people, in a really shady and abusive business. </p>

<p>Further, the commies that run silicon valley are ideologically and financially opposed to the position AA was taking. AA had a substantial following no? A following she might decide to use to shine some light on rather unseemly subjects that she may be privy to?</p>

<p>Shady shit. I just find it really hard to believe that a person who is comfortable enough to get fucked on camera a few hundred times isn&#39;t able to deal with a bunch of fags on the internet, especially when she stood up for herself and rebuked their comments repeatedly, but somehow in the end hung herself?</p>

<p>IDK, shit just smells fishy to me, and the fact that when you google the story, all the mainstream shit starts out right away painting her husband as this saint who&#39;s deeply heartbroken. </p>

<p>I could just be totally wrong and she just hung herself, who the fuck knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, this is an interesting idea.  If she could have exposed some sort of widespread porn industry problem and lead to another industry #MeToo scandal, certain sociopaths might have considered it in their best interests to suicide her.  The stuff coming out of Hollywood right now is pretty devastating to the people who run this country&#39;s media... how can they talk about Trump&#39;s pussy grabbing now that their own little open secret is mainstream knowledge?</p>

<p>On the other hand, the porn industry doesn&#39;t really have the social sway Hollywood has... you don&#39;t see people retweeting the political opinions of porn stars as if they&#39;re moral authorities.  It would not be destructive enough to the business or its social function to be worth murdering someone.  People who watch porn would be like &quot;you mean it&#39;s unhealthy for the stars? you don&#39;t say&quot; and go right back to watching it.  With that thought process I guess it&#39;s up to how cynical you are about how lightly people take assassinating others.  </p>

<p>The thick skin aspect of it is interesting.  From what I briefly glimpsed, it did seem like she was firing back on Twitter.  And people are saying she had depression, but tbh I&#39;m not sure how much weight I give that when 1 in 4 women are on antidepressants.  Maybe the abuse coupled with potential career ramifications could push her over the edge... but how many of her actual fans give the slightest fuck about her twitter drama?  Again, it&#39;s fucking porn, apparently she&#39;s popular, I don&#39;t see why she&#39;d get blacklisted in the industry or something over this since she clearly brings in money.  I dunno, need to gather info.</p>

<p>A rebuttal is also right in the article you posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leue of the Free Speech Coalition reiterated the argument that this transmission was outside the industry&#39;s watchful eyes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CDC report refers to an incident from several years ago involving a out-of-state, noncompliant production in Nevada, where the industry testing protocols (known as PASS) were not observed. While AHF would like to claim otherwise, there is no comparison between shoots which used expired, non-uniform tests, and the industry&#39;s comprehensive 14-day-testing protocol. </p>

<p>... No HIV transmissions has occurred on a PASS-compliant sets in over a decade. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>she just didn&#39;t want to have sex with a dude</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the saddest things about this is she was mistaken about the performer she didn&#39;t want to shoot with, apparently he had only done solo scenes for gay sites, no sex with other dudes (saw this posted elsewhere):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[name redacted] stands accused of being a crossover.  For those that don’t understand the term, it means anyone who performs in both mainstream and the gay and/or transsexual market.</p>

<p>I did some research and have only found 4 scenes in his past that some people may question. He did four scenes, <strong>all solo</strong> (meaning he jacked himself off) which appeared on gay male websites. You can’t argue that he himself had gay sex or sex with anyone because in each of the four scenes in question he only had sex with himself.</p>

<p>He never once had sex with another man (not even a blowjob) so how can you really say he’s a crossover? <strong>Funny thing is, he was condemned int he gay community for not being gay. As one commenter put it “He’s hot, but unless he’s fucking another guy, then who cares”.</strong></p>

<p>And here we are now calling him gay because he played with his own penis on camera and those scenes appeared on a gay website. Interesting. So does that mean all those straight guys in porn who play with themselves on webcam, knowing men are watching, does that make them secretly gay too?</p>

<p>...I just wanted to sort of defend a guy that was getting heat for something he didn’t do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>her fans complained</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of. She got both support (mostly) and negativity. I think what had the most effect was the mix of either <a href="https://twitter.com/thejessicadrake/status/938818194738839552">quite rational</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=jaxton%20wheeler&amp;amp;src=typd">very angry/stupid/profane/vicious</a> porn industry types that are her peers.</p>

<p>Apparently after her slightly misinformed tweet blew up, she may have lost future gigs. I think that fact (especially considering her profession which closes off other opportunities to support yourself) and likely depression/deeper issues were the biggest factors that led her to hang herself.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>It seems like quite a few screenshots were saved so I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be seeing the end result of someone piecing them all together sometime soon.</p>

<p>So she refuses, gets flack/suppport. Comes out that the dude never did a full on gay scene, so now she get a shitton of flack. </p>

<p>Thing is this didn&#39;t really come out on a large scale (not even sure she knew) so the uproar by her/her supporters was mistaken and the push back was mainly about &quot;don&#39;t discriminate against gays/crossovers.&quot;</p>

<p>You can agree with the premise that Ames shouldn&#39;t be cyberbullied.</p>

<p>But should we also ignore how Fox constantly shames sex workers and women having sex outside of marriage? And how they use it to advance an agenda?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve no rebuttal to how Fox is co-opting this story.</p>

<p>Pointing that out doesn&#39;t mean this story doesn&#39;t matter AND it doesn&#39;t mean the Dems are some infallible god we should worship.</p>

<p>You can understand there is more than 1 point to focus on.</p>

<p>But yes I guess we should be surprised that a Republican-majority government is causing backlash in a <em>conspiracy</em> subreddit about all the shitty things they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love to see any source on Christianity pushed by Fox being compatible with the views that sex shouldn&#39;t be had outside of gay marriage or that gay marriage is compatible with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll donate $100 to your charity of choice if you can show Fox doing that.</p>

<p>Yea I linked an opinion piece since you did too.</p>

<p>But I guess when I do it, it&#39;s wrong. When you do it, it&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>Fox sure did a 180 in how socially accepting they are. That&#39;s why their corporate handlers donate to Mike &quot;Conversion Therapy&quot; Pence.</p>

<p>Apologies, I guess you&#39;re right Fox really is socially liberal.</p>

<p>The other commenter left a source of one opinion piece. A holistic view of Fox obviously disproves it. They constantly shame sex outside of marriage.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s sources of Fox -</p>

<p>Shaming sex outside of marriage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We teach them that sex inside that bond of marriage is good and even holy, but outside that bond it brings nothing but trouble and heartache.</p>

<p>Sex outside of marriage is a sin.</p>

<p>Writing against gay marriage - &quot;Why the Same-Sex Marriage Experiment Will Not Work&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/05/24/sex-marriage-experiment-work.html">http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/05/24/sex-marriage-experiment-work.html</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s surprising people are so up in arms about this. </p>

<p>Fucking obviously Fox doesn&#39;t endorse prostitution, it goes against their religious beliefs.</p>

<p>Christianity is entirely against prostitution. But the mental gymnastics you go through to justify it to yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;From Joey I met John Leslie and Rocco Siffredi and John Stagliano and began working at times for all of them. Eventually, after many years of working under them, I began to branch out on my own. I started shooting stills and movies for a wide variety of companies and the rest as they say is history. Eventually I was offered by <strong>John Stagliano</strong> the chance to direct at Evil Angel.&quot; [1]</p>

<p>&quot;Stagliano was diagnosed with HIV in January 1997.&quot; [2]</p>

Its a laughable phrase that has no evidence behind it. Its implications are completely irresponsible to make without strong evidence, since the suggestion is that gay people hate a porn star refusing to work with gays so much that &quot;they&quot; had her killed.

Gays outrank women on the victim scoreboard, so you&#39;re not allowed to refuse sex to a gay man as a straight woman.  Not to mention the fact that he&#39;s obviously not gay if he&#39;s able to have sex with a woman, which means she wasn&#39;t even denying sex to a gay man, but logic isn&#39;t even relevant anymore I mean hello its 2017</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah let us whine about the gays!  Right?!  Us conservatives just want all gays and liberals dead right? </p>

<p>I think that group is filled with hypocrisy and if you don’t see it in this situation your logic is lost forever.   </p>

<p>People should be pissed the fuck off that these sassy guys on twitter are making no apologies for contributing hateful comments toward her.   They can’t see it because they are so immersed in their own victimhood.  It is quite absurd.   </p>

<p>Plenty of gay folks have been bullied and probably to suicide often, but are we so far off from decency that the fact that it happened to them excuses their actions?   Crazy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think anyone here would condone malicious cyber bullying of other groups either. </p>

<p>I think the main outrage here is that the LGBT community presumably gets a pass for this because “they were standing up to her and her toxic homophobic rhetoric”, which is pure bullshit.  I don’t care if you are trans, gay, bi or straight you don’t get to spew that hate against other people while on the flip side advocating for your own group and demonizing the hate that gets spewed at you.   Just another example of the hypocrisy you see from those groups.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus it was posted in a comment after someone mentioned it and another asked for more info on a thread saying Ronda Rousey is going to WWE, then children started posting to basically cyber bully her for having a mental breakdown and going through depression after her big UFC title loss a few years ago. Didn&#39;t get deleted, either, as OP claims.</p>

<p>Plus, why would British news sites report on the suicide of a porn star, when porn stars are generally ignored by the media due to their line of work and the whole &quot;not wanting to promote it on sites that children can easily access&quot;?</p>

<p>I appreciate shining a spotlight on cyberbullying but my god, it seems any anti-Semitic, homophobic, anti-protecting your children from disease, paranoid nugget of bullshit can be freely posted on subs like this one by the more unstable of society.</p>

<p>Bloody hell...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullying is a leftist narrative.  They want you to believe bullies are really horrible and cause people to commit suicide because of their awful remarks.</p>

<p>Now ofc what they are referring to are online trolls.  This bullying narrative was created in an effort to censor wrongthink online.  That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>The problem is leftists are the biggest bullies on the planet.  They literally think &quot;You must think and act like me or die!&quot; as this article clearly shows.  </p>

<p>So the establishment must reconcile selling bullying as a grievous offense so they can use it to censor non leftists and trying to cover up bullying from leftists, the biggest bullies on the planet.  It&#39;s easy for them, just cover up any story where leftist bullies are at fault and blow up any story where non leftist bullies can be blamed at all.</p>

<p>The media is very fake news.  This is just yet one more example of that.</p>
