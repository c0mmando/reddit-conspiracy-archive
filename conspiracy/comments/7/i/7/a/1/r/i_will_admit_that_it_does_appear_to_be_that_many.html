<p>If not, are there things that he /has done/could do/might do/ that would cause you to doubt in his authenticity as a true outsider?</p>

<p>This is an honest conversation coming from someone who is openly anti trump.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve seen me many times in this sub criticizing him for many things, however, I don&#39;t want you to get the wrong impression that I am just here to stir the pot with this post.</p>

<p>I truly am curious to know how you think, and wonder if there is a faction of Trump supporters who are 100% loyal no matter what.</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking here because i know I&#39;ll get banned in the other sub for doing so.</p>

<p>What would Trump have to do to make you lose your support?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a supporter of Trump, but also not anti-Trump either. I&#39;ve enjoyed as well how the Deep State seems to be scrambling to counter each of his moves. It&#39;s intriguing to say the very least. </p>

<p>I&#39;m wary about recognizing Jerusalem as the capital. That&#39;s the second definitive play he&#39;s made on the international stage that would seriously give me reason to be nervous. I was wary, though to a much lesser extent, following Trump&#39;s UN speech where he mentioned NK, Iran and Venezuela as potential future locations for US involvement. </p>

<p>I&#39;m hesitant to believe anyone who so vehemently supports either side, because there&#39;s so much at play and we know so little that there&#39;s no way to know for sure. There&#39;s little sense in stooping to fervor before an action is taken and it&#39;s disheartening to see the constant vitriol back and forth between both camps. </p>

<p>Trump showed his true colors by bombing sovereign nations immediately upon taking office. The fact that the Obama/Clinton cabal wants to oust him does not make them any less evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>what about his tax breaks for all his buddies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not a huge fan of the tax bill because I thought they had the chance to pass a truly pro-growth piece of legislation and of course they ended up passing something that mostly benefitted their donors.</p>

<p>That said, myself and most Americans will be paying less in taxes (despite what you may have heard), so its not all bad. I also don&#39;t blame that on Trump, that&#39;s on Congress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>his plans for cutting Medicaid/medicare</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Medicare spending will still rise over the next 10 years -- by about 82 percent over 10 years, instead of 99 percent growth over 10 years under the status quo. I don&#39;t consider that a &quot;cut.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what about getting rid of regulations for big businesses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over-regulation is just as bad as under-regulation. We&#39;re constantly trying to find a balance of the perfect level and type of regulation, so using a more pro-business approach to help further bolster the economy may be a good thing. It depends on which specific regulations are being dropped or changed and how they are changing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>trying to detroy our national monuments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say that&#39;s a pretty gross mischaracterization of what he is doing. Those lands should have never been Federal, anyway. That is a huge overreach and abuse of power imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given that it took Pizzagate investigators about 5 minutes to figure out McCabe and the other stooges in the FBI were Clinton loyalists and the Trump team is a year late in coming to these revelations, we have only a few possibilities...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trump is basically alone and has little to no idea what is going on. If a bunch of Internet researchers beat him to the punch on Uranium One and the most obvious corruption within the FBI, Trump is never going to catch up. While there is a lot of misinformation and nonsense on /v/pizzagate, there is also a lot of solid research that ties the intelligence community to organized crime.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is feigning ignorance and has a &quot;big picture&quot; plan where the swamp will end up drained. The longer this &quot;ignorance&quot; goes on, the more likely that this is not the case. Unless we start to see some meaningful arrests, this is going to increasingly become a more and more remote possibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is part of the swamp. Maybe a different faction than the Clinton cabal, but he is still constrained by the agenda of the swamp where the news is not allowed to mention that the intelligence community is involved in organized crime and neither is he.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t support trump, but I find myself defending him a lot against the accusations he faces.  </p>

<p>Personally, I would lose all hope in trump if 1. Sided with Israel in a potential war with Iran/Russia </p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>If pizzagate ends up being fake (with questions answered).  Yeah, I know, trump could&#39;ve been a pedo too, but I feel like he might jump on the sword.  The Haiti stuff he said about clinton in front of a bunch of elite Catholics was insane.  I&#39;m a fan of his tweets for the most part.</p>

<p>So far, I  still have no idea what to think.  </p>
