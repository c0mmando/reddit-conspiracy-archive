        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was lost in the jungle like Simba</p>

<p>After the death of Mufasa, no hog, no meerkat</p>

<p>Hakuna matata by day</p>

<p>But I spent my night time fighting tears back</p>

<p>I prayed and prayed and left messages</p>

<p>But never got no hear back, or so it seemed</p>

<p>A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream</p>

<p>I build the ark to gently, gently</p>

<p>Row my boat down Noah&#39;s stream</p>

<p>Sometimes the path I took to reach</p>

<p>My petty goals was so extreme</p>

<p>I was so far down in the mud</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t even let my light shine</p>

<p>But you was always there</p>

<p>When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line</p>

<p>From a lofty height we wage war</p>

<p>On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ</p>

<p>Spark the dark with the pulse of light</p>

<p>Strike a corpse with a pulse of life</p>

<p>I spit on the Tidal, it&#39;s tidal waves</p>

<p>I spit on the Apple and kill a worm</p>

<p>A fire in Cali will swallow a valley</p>

<p>For every African village burned</p>

<p>Jay Elect would&#39;ve never made it</p>

<p>O&#39; son of man, O&#39; son of man</p>

<p>Who was the angel in Revelations</p>

<p>With a foot on water and a foot on land?</p>

<p>Who was the angel that rode a Harley</p>

<p>From the project to the house of Parliament</p>

<p>And opened the book in the Devil&#39;s chamber</p>

<p>And put the true name of the Lord in it?</p>

<p>Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem</p>

<p>Comes like this beast with a ball of fire</p>

<p>They poisoned the scriptures</p>

<p>And gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie</p>

<p>Mystery babylon, tumbling down</p>

<p>Satan&#39;s establishment crumbling down</p>

<p>This is the year that I come for the crown</p>

<p>Bury my enemies under the ground</p>

<p>...Shit seems prophetic to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, if you want to talk his pre 2000 career, well, there is a reason it wasnt received well. quite safe to say, a collab of chance and him, well yeah, classic post millenium dogshit. i cant help i had the golden era. i can help with highlighting a significantly non prophetic tune, just because its edgy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What pre 2000 career? We aren&#39;t talking about Jay-Z. This what Jay Elec raps about. You grew up with the golden era? Me too. There&#39;s good and bad in every medium, every genre, every decade, and every year in history. It&#39;s 2017, there&#39;s no excuse (unless you just aren&#39;t into music like that) to be ignorant towards certain periods with streaming services and tormenting. You&#39;ve convinced yourself modern is bad without having a basis for it or even knowing what the fuck we&#39;re talking about in the first place. Learn to talk about music.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show me any of his work pre 2000, or enlighten me on what he was doing. Bring something to the table. From what I understand, he bounced from music scene to music scene until he started getting shit out there in the late 2000&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he was playing shows, and getting terrible reception. hence,him not getting releases. he was a joke. it took the millenials watered down, poor choice in rap to create his mainstream career. but dont let facts get in the way of a good argument</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of his slang and accent. It took fleshing out his style, working with right producers, MAKING A PROJECT, and meeting the right people to get things going. He still hasn&#39;t put out an album and never will because he doesn&#39;t give a shit about having a mainstream career, he&#39;s never been that. All he does is a few random verses a year, if that. The artists and fans in critical circles are who his audience is, been that way for all but a very short period of time when people thought he&#39;d actually release something. Says a lot when you&#39;re considered one of the best of all time by many with only leaks, unreleased tracks, and a few mixtapes to your name.</p>

<p>But ok let&#39;s pretend like performing well at open mics and random rap shows gets you a contract. What kind of fucked up world do you live in? </p>
