<p>It gives this false need for dopamine when you want to post content to get the most likes, when you should instead go out, and be socializing with actual people, while turning off your phone. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201710/is-facebook-making-you-depressed">So many people are getting depressed over it.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201202/facebook-addiction">So many people are addicted to it.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/the-psychology-of-oversharing-facebook-couples/376112/">So many people who share more about their relationship, the worst of their relationship is. When I was on facebook, the couples with the most pics, posts about what a great man he is, the quicker the relationship would fizzle out.</a></p>

<p>I also notice it&#39;s so hard to make friends with people. No one knows how to socialize without a piece of technology. I miss some of the groups I was in that were geared towards my hobbies, I might get a throwaway facebook account to have only for the groups. But for use to keep connected to friends, no thanks. </p>

<p>Facebook Tinkers With Users’ Emotions in News Feed Experiment, Stirring Outcry</p>

<p>But last week, Facebook revealed that it had manipulated the news feeds of over half a million randomly selected users to change the number of positive and negative posts they saw. It was part of a psychological study to examine how emotions can be spread on social media.</p>

<p>The company says users consent to this kind of manipulation when they agree to its terms of service. But in the quick judgment of the Internet, that argument was not universally accepted.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Facebook KILLED anyone with their emotion manipulation stunt. At their scale and with depressed people out there, it’s possible,” the privacy activist Lauren Weinstein wrote in a Twitter post.</p>

But the last couple of years almost all I see are the most horrific, disturbing headlines that are usually so messed up I question if any of them are actually real.  But it&#39;s so blatant it definitely is being used as a tool to depress the fuck out of it&#39;s readers.  To what end, I have no idea.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got on for about 3 months about 6 years ago. It was such an unnatural social situation that it freaked me out. People from high school, college and other places that I barely knew or let go of because I didn&#39;t really care to keep up the relationship (how real life works) were coming out of the blue asking to be my friend. I didn&#39;t want to be their friends, but feared revenge and other social repercussions, so I&#39;d friend them. It was stressful. Add on to that all the posts revealing their dirty laundry, politics, and pics of their kids which shouldn&#39;t be posted where anyone could download and do what they wanted with them (including Facebook for ads), and the stress went even higher. Then I understood what Facebook was--a data collection ruse--and got fed up with their changing settings without warning,  I eventually reached a point where I said to myself, &quot;what the hell am I doing? I don&#39;t need this in my life.&quot;</p>

<p>I deleted my FB. Funny thing, I got emails from people asking what was wrong and if I was okay. That freaked me out. It was like I left Scientology or the Amish or something.</p>

<p>After that, the only site I deal with is Reddit. I can be anonymous, block messages, delete accounts easily and start another if I wish, and hang out where I find it&#39;s most fun. No stress. I realize that Reddit is gathering info on my IP as well, and probably know who I am, but it doesn&#39;t feel &quot;evil&quot; just yet. </p>

<p>I believe Facebook is run by a psychopath who just wants power in the long run. No better way to get powerful than to gather personal and psychological information on people who willingly give it over. FBI director, Hoover knew that. He had a lot of power due to all the information he gathered on politicians. Facebook knows your name, your friends, your mistresses, how you think, your skills (monitored from games), and so much more. Info is power.</p>

Most employers search for your facebook profile before hiring you, if you dont have one they find it strange. To me its just an attention seeking ego boosting mechanism that people find addictive because they&#39;re not fulfilled with their real lives. I&#39;m guilty as charged for being hooked on it for years but thankfully deactivated it about 8 months ago. Only thing I miss is creating/being invited to parties and events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best decision ever to get off social media, I was done with Facebook/ social media platforms when I only saw combative post and never saw my own husbands. And someone screamed my IG name at me while driving by (decently private, no actual pictures of me) ... I got sucked in for a little, I spent more time thinking about posting crap than actually doing crap. Keeping up with virtual jones is a pretty scary concept. </p>

<p>The hardest thing to do is get other people off and see how unhappy it makes them. They don&#39;t wanna give it up, as they state at it lifelessly.
I have a gf whose obsessed with snapchat, if we hang out all she does is stare at her phone looking at the trash on Facebook and takes 10000000 pictures just to say they all look bad. Drives me nuts.
  Ill look at her, say, &quot;dude your not even enjoying yourself&quot;, without looking up, &quot;so?&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree with everything you&#39;ve said here. I greatly dislike FB, but I still hop on every 3 days or so b/c people have tagged me and I get an email. For very casual usage, like planning to go to an event with friends, it seems fine. But I&#39;ve seen people become very addicted. Same goes for Twitter, Instagram, etc. Sometimes you want to shake people and say &quot;HEY - we&#39;re here together in real life right now having a nice meal! Let&#39;s BE here.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, one point I saw in the Atlantic article seems to be the opposite of what you were saying however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in fact, the same people who posted couple-y items more frequently also tended to be more satisfied with their partners than those who did not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anecdotally, I&#39;ve noticed the opposite though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook was fuel to the fire of my anxiety and also made me tad paranoid.  It&#39;s crazy to think how connected people are with people that don&#39;t really know.  It&#39;s also fucked up that people think you&#39;re the strange one for not using fb.  It&#39;s a strange social experiment that&#39;s gotten to pit of hand, and one time I thought it was a fad and would eventually fade away but that seems not to be the case.  I also hate the people who scream government spying but actively use FB.  It&#39;s past time to give it up!</p>

I don&#39;t try to get people to join because I don&#39;t care what you do. I don&#39;t care about likes. I would have lost contact with 95 percent of my old high school friends without it. Most people have a different phone number and address than they did 25 years ago its easy to lose contact. Yeah keep in &quot;real&quot; contact with your top 5 friends but the 50 that made up your greater circle would be almost impossible to find without it. I moved a thousand miles away its really easy to lose touch. Also its less awkward than asking people for their number, I start all new friendships with a FB add. I wouldn&#39;t want all those people having my number. It&#39;s improved my social life not hurt it.  </p>
