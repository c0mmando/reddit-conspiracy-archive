       By the way, I don't believe in any type of Jewish conspiracy.  But what is scientifically provable is that Jews have higher IQs than any other people in the world (particularly in language)
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's a given, then doesn't Jewish conspiracy theory denigrate into shrill petulant irrational whining?

       It would make sense, not since. Sounds the same, totally different meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if they really were God's chosen people, then they would not be so typically gosh darn UGLY, or have so many nasty genetic diseases. There are a whole lot of other people in the world who are much, much more attractive [most of them] and healthier than the Jews. The good looking Jews are the exception, NOT the rule. As a group of people, they are basically very unattractive, downright ugly even. I can see why they boil with jealousy against the other, more attractive races.
      </p>
      <p>
       A social coping strategy for this defect of theirs that would be better than attempting to dominate us all, would be interbreeding with better looking and physically healthier people; but that is not encouraged by their self defeating religion. They would rather use their 'Sampson Option' and kill us all in a big nuclear war, than admit they are not the greatest. That kind of hubris deserves a nemesis.

       Boy, your comment is just loaded with strawman bullshit. Right out of the gate, you generalize anyone who would criticize Zionism as "white pride folks" and then you make the ridiculous leap that criticism of Zionism really just amounts to "disliking Jews for their success." lol your comment really doesn't even deserve to be dignified with a response, but eh, I was feeling generous.

       Why are you still talking about white pride? You missed my point (or, more likely, you're being willfully ignorant). You're still trying to steer the conversation toward race-baiting. Of all of the people I've met and talked to who are opposed to Zionism, only a very small percentage were motivated by "white pride" or any kind of race-related consideration. You're committing logical fallacies left and right. What you're trying to do with the conversation is dishonest. You can't just dismiss any and all criticism of Israel as racially-motivated.

       Your question is loaded as it gets. Jews aren't disliked for their success. Asian immigrants are often admired for their success, because many of them came to this country with nothing but the shirts on their backs and then made something of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can be annoying about Jewish people is that they practice tribal nepotism, meaning they overwhelmingly hire and promote Jews over goyim. They are shielded from criticism for doing so through claims of anti-semitism and bringing up the Holohoax. And they often pretend to be white when talking badly about white people, while actually considering themselves Jewish and not white.

       Zionists are the most racist assholes in the world, even injecting birth control into fellow african jews that have emigrated there.  You always get it both ways, don't you?

       For the longest time Jews have always believed that being intelligent is the key to life.  Jews believe that through 1000s of years of persecution, that opposing forces can kill your body, but they cannot destroy your mind.  They dont have a higher IQ because of their religion, if they have high IQ's its because the Jews have believed in education longer then most societies.

       I dont believe I said Jews were the only ones that believed in education.  Its that most religions, Christianity, Muslim, and Catholics all went through periods were education beyond the bible was forbidden.  Yes, most groups use utterly corrupt methods to gain power, however, that does not mean that religious leaders speak for everyone within the religion.

       I studied IQ as an interesting amateur research topic. It is surprisingly related to early sexual child abuse. People who are sexually abused as small children develop a personality that is hyper attuned to threats and manifests in a higher intelligence. This is the backbone of the MKUltra program.

       Be careful if you meant to mix the term sexual abuse and child abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       **most children who are in an abusive family will experience the traits you speak of - but that abuse is not necessarily sexual. It might vary from physical or mental abuse to neglect and might never manifest in a sexual nature. But any of those types of abuse would likely produce a higher iq in the adult children of abusers.

       Its not high IQ, its nepotism and favoritism how they over represent in the ivy league schools (by 25%+)  which translates into the high paying jobs and opportunities. Their SAT scores are lower than Asians and some other Caucasians (why the doj is looking at harvard Etc).  Its not a meritocracy (neither is Hollywood and their high paying opportunities).  Basically its a scam in the simplest form.

       Like Asians, Jews do have a fairly high average IQ. Whites have a larger range of IQ, though, and there are more Whites with an IQ over 140 than there are Jews in the entire world.

       It would help if you explained what exactly you mean by "Jewish conspiracy theory." They are overrepresented, that is a fact. But why? I think its mostly because of the Jewish banking families acquiring vast amounts of wealth and power early on, coupled with tribal nepotism and a shield against criticism for this practice via the Holocaust.

       I dont believe I said Jews were the only ones that believed in education.  Its that most religions, Christianity, Muslim, and Catholics all went through periods were education beyond the bible was forbidden.  Yes, most groups use utterly corrupt methods to gain power, however, that does not mean that religious leaders speak for everyone within the religion.
