       Only my right ear, facing almost directly west (i'm in wa state).  Lound ping that lasted for at least 30 seconds while slowly becoming less and less apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       No it's not tinnitus, i went years without an ear ring but in the last few months i've had a bunch and I know others here have also.

       nope, a few weeks ago a few people all got them at the same time.  There was a HUGE thread on a similar thing a few years ago on ATS forums.  It's not that big of a stretch to think something could car tinnitus in people, whether it be an upcoming earthquake, weapon, or some other natural phenomenon

       if you didn't have one, just don't participate in the thread.  I was interested to see if it was something anyone else here just experienced.  I don't have an ear infection or anything else.

       oh trust me, i know it sounds stupid but i get ear rings so infrequently I was just trying to see if it was something other than a normal explanation.  I never thought about it in a "conspiracy" sense until i saw a few people all post about them here a few weeks ago and thought i'd try to correlate it to something else.  Like if there'a huge earthquake today or something

       And another idea i had...all of those mysterious booms people have been hearing around the world.  I wonder if that's related?  Maybe some of us have slightly better hearing than the majority...think dog whistles...and we just happen to hear things others can't?  I've always had great hearing when tested, that's what made me think of that.

       i know this will cause even more downvotes but i'm a really high level empath.  I can tell someone's mood before i even walk in a room yet alone see or speak to them.  So this is really interesting, thanks for posting.

       Yeah, I can read everybody most of the time. It sucks. Sometimes helpful, but mostly sucks, as so many people now are toxic af.

       You can learn to conciously realise the difference between your feeling and someone/something/event if you become better at staying mindful and meditating on your emotions and questioning why you feel how you feel. Hope you find something that helps you and you find the happiness that you are looking for

       it's really hard to not integrate others' residual energy. i struggle with that. not being 'open' is key. wearing silver or gold can help. always discharge it.

      <p>
       i've come to believe demonic torment and possession are real things. more than half the people i encounter are at least 'being followed' :( if not fully possessed. the truer the heart, the more one is beset.

       my wife is an empath too as well as having those "i see dead people" type powers.  Anyway, you'd never know from looking at us, we're normal people.  But anyway, we had some sort of reallllly evil "thing" trying to get to us last year.  I can't explain it without sounded looney, but whatever it was wanted in our house (or us) but my wife knows how to shield the house and us so i guess we lucked out.  I was a really horrific feeling though and went on for months.

       I've not had the exact type of experience, but I can relate. I lived in a place that was a well of negative energy &amp; must have been a place of misery for the former owner; that was a huge bummer &amp; extremely taxing. I've had a couple experiences with negative entities. But have also had quite a few positive, reaffirming experiences that left me with lasting hope.

       Nah, you don't sound looney to me; it's quite natural, actually. Glad you have a mate that relates. You two wouldn't be Rh negs, would you?

       I keep reading about RH- and + in random comments but i need to google it to see what it is exactly.  I really think i knew my wife before this life.  hard to explain but the minute i first saw her it was like i knew her.  Like extreme deja vu or something.

       Very seldom do we meet people that we haven't had relations with before. Recognizing one means they're special. The Edgar Cayce stuff is great for info on that.

       Yeah, read up on Rh-. People try to attach some strange claims to it - some deserved, some not. There are some verifiable statistics that are remarkable.

       So weird.  My ear that i got the ring in was facing west, so that might corroborate your story if your ear was facing that same direction.  Mine happened a few minutes before i made that thread, what time was yours?

       From WA state as well. I did have a ringing in my ear today but it was light compared to what I've been experiencing. I've had it really bad for the past month or two, sometimes the ringing is so bad I have to stop what I'm doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been hearing that ringing in your ears is part of the ascension process (I, like you OP, am an empath) but I'm not closing my mind off to the idea another commenter had - testing from JBLM. It would be interesting to see how many across the US that have been experiencing this live close to a base.

       I never get regular ear rings from loud noises, that's why this is weird.  And it's always just one ear.  Last week i had the loudest and longest one ever.  It started like a SUPER loud PING (almost like someone flicked a crystal glass) and then it rang for what seemed like well over a minute.  That entire time the ear was deaf aside from that noise too...even while it was super low in volume at the end.

       I really think there's something to that.  I've been reading for years about how earth is entering an area of the universe with more energy and this leads to mass awakenings.  I really always try to take ideas like that and see if science could possibly apply....even the bible and things like that.

       I never get regular ear rings from loud noises, that's why this is weird.  And it's always just one ear.  Last week i had the loudest and longest one ever.  It started like a SUPER loud PING (almost like someone flicked a crystal glass) and then it rang for what seemed like well over a minute.  That entire time the ear was deaf aside from that noise too...even while it was super low in volume at the end.
