    <div class="md"><p>oh trust me, i know it sounds stupid but i get ear rings so infrequently I was just trying to see if it was something other than a normal explanation.  I never thought about it in a &quot;conspiracy&quot; sense until i saw a few people all post about them here a few weeks ago and thought i&#39;d try to correlate it to something else.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>And another idea i had...all of those mysterious booms people have been hearing around the world.  I wonder if that&#39;s related?  Maybe some of us have slightly better hearing than the majority...think dog whistles...and we just happen to hear things others can&#39;t?  I&#39;ve always had great hearing when tested, that&#39;s what made me think of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I live in Washington state too and got a ring in my ear, also happened this morning as well. I believe I was facing east the second time and when I heard it this morning I was facing north. Idk if it means anything or not </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So weird.  My ear that i got the ring in was facing west, so that might corroborate your story if your ear was facing that same direction.  Mine happened a few minutes before i made that thread, what time was yours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From WA state as well. I did have a ringing in my ear today but it was light compared to what I&#39;ve been experiencing. I&#39;ve had it really bad for the past month or two, sometimes the ringing is so bad I have to stop what I&#39;m doing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been hearing that ringing in your ears is part of the ascension process (I, like you OP, am an empath) but I&#39;m not closing my mind off to the idea another commenter had - testing from JBLM. It would be interesting to see how many across the US that have been experiencing this live close to a base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, this one was about a 4 or 5 out of 10 for what i&#39;ve experienced lately (in terms of loudness and duration)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never get regular ear rings from loud noises, that&#39;s why this is weird.  And it&#39;s always just one ear.  Last week i had the loudest and longest one ever.  It started like a SUPER loud PING (almost like someone flicked a crystal glass) and then it rang for what seemed like well over a minute.  That entire time the ear was deaf aside from that noise too...even while it was super low in volume at the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same. Try to look at it in a positive light, like your pineal gland is being activated by the transforming/ascending magnetic field of the earth. Your nervous system is being re-calibrated for a higher experience ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really think there&#39;s something to that.  I&#39;ve been reading for years about how earth is entering an area of the universe with more energy and this leads to mass awakenings.  I really always try to take ideas like that and see if science could possibly apply....even the bible and things like that.  </p>
