       Nice find OP, thanks for providing the link/backstory.  Makes me question how soon we will see a 3rd party pop up that is touted as the party of the people.. but in reality it's just a Blue/Red mush.

       I read the article, doesn't seem like a big deal at all. Franken is obviously a democrat, so he would be against Trump lol. We don't know what Wray, and even if he is a democrat, we know for sure that some people can put their political party aside in order to do their job (Mueller).
      </p>
      <p>
       But, in the end, all this is a huge reach. Even flat earthers will look down at this.

       It was a quick reply. I didn't say to be grammatically correct because I'm sure many of us will fail at that. Just make sentences that are comprehensible so people can understand what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made a meaningful response to the article, it was my own interpretation of the article and this thread. Then you came along with vague comments that make no sense, if anything you're the one who is trying divert attention. You got to practice what you preach.

       No, you complete idiot. That is nowhere near what I said, and they are not the only two people. Go back and look at Clinton's long overdue succession speech and what color she and the rapist were wearing.

       Just because neither the OP or you seems capable of explaining this theory of yours don't get triggered people have no clue what you are even implying. Maybe put some effort into a decent post if you want to be taken seriously and not as a troll.

       Tracy Twyman is an absolute pro when it comes to the deep occult and its influence on global governance. She claimed that it's a shoutout to witches / paganism / occult alliances. I'd imagine the same is true for Franken, etc.

       Huh, I've been a pagan for over two decades now, and this is the first I've heard of purple being "our color".  And if Hillary and Bill are "witches", then they're not of the religions I know.  They may belong to some Luciferian cabal, but don't go lumping general paganism in with that lot of monsters.  No self-respecting pagan would dream of supporting things like fracking and oil pipelines - that hurt Mother Earth.  Hell, Hillary is too much of a murderous wench for most pagans to accept her as one of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't know what kind of "pagan" or "witch" this person thinks Hillary and Bill are, but it's certainly a group I've never heard of.  And most of the people I know would shun.

       I have a feeling that IF the Clintons practice any form of paganism, it wouldn't be of a sort that anyone around here knows. Recommend reading the whole article. It offers a bit more clarity.

       I did.  And it's exactly the kind of article that gets my hackles up, because lumps all paganism under on umbrella, and then associates all of it with "devil worship", and in this case, pedophila.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, Wiccans are the fluffiest bunnies of paganism.  The thought of killing anything is anathema to them.  "An it harm none, do what ye wilt" is the basis of their entire religion.  So the thought of pedophiles and murderers calling out to Wiccans is absolutely hilarious.  Also, Hillary's stance on the environment is enough to send members of any earth-based faith into a frothing rage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, even most of the Satanists I know would reject them.  Despite what most Christians may try to tell you, modern day satanism, or at least the kind that's practiced openly, is closer to radical humanism.  They're all about free will.  And once again, rape is anathema to them, because you are taking away someone's free will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, they may be practising some form of deep, dark, occult religion.  I've actually had conversations with pagan friends theorizing that they're into some pretty dark ass magic.  But this article lumps these assholes with other forms of modern paganism, thus confusing the subject more.  We're already hated and distrusted by a good chunk of the world.  We don't need more false allegations of us all being pedos and rapists thrown out there.  Heavens know we're still recovering from finding out that Marion Zimmer Bradley was a pedo and rapist.  And were she still alive, she would have been immediately ostracised from the community.  So please, don't lump Wiccans and Witches in with these monsters.

       Thanks. I don't think either my intent or Twyman's was to paint all Wiccans/pagans with any sort of brush that has been anywhere near the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your argument that paganism is misunderstood. Sure is! So is occultism, which I have practiced and which has greatly enriched my life in very positive ways. But just because there are dark wizards out there misusing the "technology" of occultism, doesn't have anything to do with me. Same with paganism. Just because there are some bad actors isn't an incrimination of the whole play.

       My understanding is that it's not Satanism but Luciferianism, between which there is a meaningful difference.

       I hope it's not her intention, however the article is written in such a way that the "crazy christians" I know can easily use it to paint us with a broad brush.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, a distinction between Satanism and Luciferanism is likely a good way to explain the difference, but again, one needs to be careful of what audience is reading this.  So many people simply turn off their brains at the mention of "The Devil!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, that Marion Zimmer Bradley.  It was a huge scandal a year or two ago.  She would procure young children for her husband or boyfriend at the time to molest - he ended up dying in jail for it - and she would often join in.  It's why I haven't finished reading the book.  I just feel disgusted when I go to pick it up :(

       I have a purple tie in my closet that is my favorite tie. I never heard about this color thing before. But if I testified before Congress, it would convince you I'm a Soros whatever? That's terrible critical thinking.

       But let's say that Wray was being intentional. Let's say it was to send a message. What does purple represent in American politics? Bipartisanship.

       I like how if you look up this "purple revolution" that's apparently widely known and documented, the source article published over a year ago from the OP's link is literally the first result, and the OP's link that cites the 1st article is the 4th down. That's as close as it gets to this having any basis in reality.

       My elderly mother has been asking me what the deal is with the purple ties for weeks now.  She asked me who sent out the memo for men to wear purple ties.  I honestly thought she was crazy.

       "Purple: 
The opposite of yellow and is the combination of the energies of blue and red. The least favorite of all colors in occult practice, purple is sickness, disease, putrefaction and corruption. Purple is futility and impotent rage."

       Just because neither the OP or you seems capable of explaining this theory of yours don't get triggered people have no clue what you are even implying. Maybe put some effort into a decent post if you want to be taken seriously and not as a troll.

       Can you explain more about it with further detail? Seems like a reach just because two people  are wearing the same color tie.
