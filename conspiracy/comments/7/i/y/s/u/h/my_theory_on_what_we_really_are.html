       Well to start this off I'm extremely high off of caffeine as of writing this, along with sleep deprived. So if you don't like incessant rambling about dimensions and shit you best click off.
      </p>
      <p>
       This came to me during my last trip, I have been, what you might say as "addicted" to psychedelic mushrooms and has somewhat been influenced by these trips.
      </p>
      <p>
       To start this off the mushrooms i tend to ingest are very potent, just a few and I'm off in another world, but recently i have been realizing that these people i see that can walk through walls ARE real and that the mushrooms just activate the part of the brain that lets us see these entities, normally this part of our brain remains unused in normal life, but with ingestion of these psychedelics kick it back into actions, telling our eyes to realize that these creatures are here. Now with these trips you can see these people, they look just like normal people in the real worlds but, i, several times have set up cameras to reveal my trips in reality, they usually reveal me just laying on the ground mumbling to myself about random shit, until a few days ago, now this is what i found interesting, in this recording i could walk around, which if you didn't know, is extremely hard to do with this particular type of mushroom, when you first start tripping you begin to notice movement in the corner of your eyes, but everything is extremely blurry and shaky, but as time progresses it gets more clearer (My guess is that your eyes start to adjust to the new beings) and you are able to make out features like on normal humans, but
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       thing is off about it, they seem to move unlike us, but they seem to be able to travel
       <em>
        through
       </em>
       time and space, unlike us who exist in a three dimensional plane. i have reason to believe, just like 2d characters in games cant look at us and only side to side, that its the same with the 4th dimension,  that they can see us, but we can't see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now on to the juicy part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several theories say that we only use 10% of our brain, but what is the 90% doing? well i have wondered that what if, when we take these psychedelics that it tells our brain to use the other 90%, and allows us to move freely through dimensions, and what if this is the key to time travel and multidimensional travel? and when we die, the "light" at the end of the tunnel is really just the beginning into the 4th dimension, reborn as an entity with enough mental capacity to realize that there are multiple dimensions and how to manipulate them. i believe that there are hundreds of dimensions, within holding creatures that no human mind can understand, that used to control our earth and own it, but as the humans evolved creating bigger brains and a sense of things, that our ancient ancestors fought off these creatures and manage to gain control of our current world, but as we evolved more and more, our brains didn't get bigger or smaller, they just became more underused as time went on, this would explain how the pyramids were built and where the key to immortality lies-- i believe that within the dimensions 4-
       <em>
        where-ever the dimensions end
       </em>
       holds many things thought impossible to the human brain, including telekinesis, the ability to manipulate gravity, the ability to bend time and space to our willingness and so on, but i also have reason to believe that our ancient ancestors still exist, but on a different plain of reality than us, they oversee us and influence our decisions, but when we take these drugs it allows us to overthrow their grasp, and that the life threatening diseases only exist to kill people who have the possibility to create cures and invent things that would in turn overthrow them. that they have the power over us and that there is no one god, but we are all a small part of them, broken into hundreds of trillions of pieces, but to reform one single god would take everything that exists in our universe and in all others and that the people who control us just have larger pieces to massive puzzle
      </p>
      <p>
       But take this theory with a grain of salt and don't think i know everything, but you never know who holds the key to the puzzle of life.

       I believe that psychedelics should be used sparingly, and I have had my fair share of experiences, all of them positive. I think Alan Watts put it best- Psychedelics are like a microscope...you use them for a time, to determine a part of the bigger picture. But I biologist is not always at his microscope. I feel that there is such a thing as too much Psychedelic use, it alters your brain state and your perception of realty, and this is good, for a
       <em>
        time
       </em>
       . But ultimately we need to take what we learn on our trips and bring them back to be applied to practical reality. I do not judge you or your use, but I feel there is a useful limit to it.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is actually false, based on old theories. We use far more than 10% of our brains. What Psychedelics do, though, is allow your brain to communicate with other parts of itself it does not often it. This is where the revelatory nature of psychedelics arise from. Your brain gains new perspective from talking to different parts of itself it is usually isolated from...like neighbors in an apartment building.

       Have you ever wondered if there is any actual evidence to support this claim?

       I'm explaining what I think not what science does, because I think the government holds all of this from us and that's why shrooms and psychedelics are illegal.

       I get these feelings when I'm space-walking too. I feel like for survival sake, our brain doesn't give us full grasp to see things that cant physically harm us. When we give in to psychedelics and allow our brains to work at full capacity we're given a glimpse in to this world. I don't think we really get a chance to compartimentalize or make true sense of it. But I do think they take you to an alternate reality.

       We use 100% of our brains everyday. They may only understand less than 10% of what it’s actually capable of.
