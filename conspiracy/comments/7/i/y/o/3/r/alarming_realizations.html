<p>Andrew McCabe’s wife is Jill McCabe, if you remember Andrew McCabe was head of FBI after James Comey was fired. Upon investigations on Hillary Clinton’s campaigned it was discovered he took a $467,000 bribe in order to derail Hillary Clinton’s investigation.</p>

<p>Terry McAuliffe current Virginia governor and long time Hillary supporter recruited Jill McCabe to run for state senate while her husband was director of FBI in D.C field office in 2015. </p>

<p>In June of 2015  Hillary was a speaker for the common good VA PAC at a fundraiser for Jill McCabe.</p>

<p>In July of 2015 is when the FBI started the investigation into the Clinton private servers. In the same exact month the FBI moves Andrew into no.3 In charge. </p>

<p>In October of 2015 the good common VA, controlled by McAuliffe gave $467,000 to Jill McCabe’s campaign. She lost the race in November however Andrew became deputy director of the FBI in February. That is when he took the head of the investigation on the Hillary investigation. With comey at head. </p>
