       Quotes from above:

      <p>
       One
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (After the Scopes Monkey Trial of July 1925)  Darrow was made to look like a champion of free speech and free thought, like he was.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fundamentalists retreated. Not that those laws against evolution go away entirely, but fundamentalists retreat from public life, set up their own institutions. They become a little insular. ... They work on building their own internal empire, their own publishing arms, their own radio stations, later their own TV stations. ... We don't see them again until the Moral Majority. So fundamentalism takes a public knock. ...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Two
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Scopes trial, in Mencken's coverage of it, posits these two different Americas. One is backward and ignorant and rural, and the other is forward-thinking, secular and urban. I think that opposition stays with people for a long time after the trial.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       (Church attendance in US urban areas fell off like a rock after 1925.)

      <p>
       Three
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Does anyone end up on top at this moment in 1925, or is it more about division?
       </p>
       <p>
        ... I don't think that these divisions are healed until the 1950s, when, because of the Cold War, you get this idea that America is a religious nation, and so Protestant, Catholic, Jew, whatever you are, that we're people of faith. The Communists don't have faith.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Many of us grew up just after this modern Christianity had been invented and are not aware that it grew out of the ashes of a period in America where religion had been on a very serious decline, especially among the educated and skilled urban populations.    This may not have happened had it not been with the help of MK Ultra and its agents.   We have lived in a religious dark ages again in America since the revival of this most rapid new version of religion.   It determining a lot of education policy and a lot of horrible foreign policy since the fall of the Soviet Union,  especially since 9/11.

       We need to know our history and be free of ignorance.

       I believe in the Bible. Based on what I read I know a lot of these people don't teach the Bible properly. Modern Christianity is really skewed in multiple ways. It's really quite sad.

       I am not saying that the world is unintelligent,  or that life in an accident.   I am just saying there are excellent resources that expose how these religious cults grew out of ignorance.    In order for us to communicate,   we have can't just promote opinions.   We all have the right to opinions,  but we don't have the right to make up facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       a)literacy,  degree of being informed,  or some kind of equivalence in educational status.   This no longer exists.    Educational institutions used to provide this and still do,  to a degree,  at least provide a fairly uniform world view to the particular elites who attend certain institutions.   But the value of the average college degree in terms of real literacy is less than what a standard high school education would give an affluent person 100 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       b)reasonable.   a basic common sense,  or better yet,  an open mind and ability to analyze and assimilate information critically and not be part of a cult like identity group that is absolutist or fanatical about its beliefs.    This is rare in extremely religious or extremely partisan ideologues.
      </p>
      <p>
       c)good faith.   not all reasonable people are acting in good faith.    good faith goes beyond reasonable in that previous history of (often legitimate) distrust does not apply.   Old patterns of distrust are set aside,  which is often impossible in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       d)subconscious factors -  Carl Jung and others have pointed out many psychological features that operate outside of our normal awareness,  that affect our dreams and determine our personalities.  People who are in touch with their deepest (not sentimentality) feelings have an advantage in sensing their way through the world without imbalance reliance on mental models,  thought systems,  world views.
      </p>
      <p>
       e)degree of indoctrination,  conceptually compromised.  in general humans have adopted a conceptual framework which they look through and its actually pretty rare for them to look directly at the world without that system of interpretation.     At least that is the focus, and becomes extreme with religious and political zealots.  Body language shows that there is a level at which a more basic awareness operates and is generally not controlled by our thinking.   Thus the thinking level is somewhat superficial or even hallucinatory,  but below it is a level that is much more connected to the subconscious,  and also the basic physiological functions.

       Lol. I'm not reading this right now but I will later. Im just saying that there are double agents in every religion. Those that don't adhere to the doctrine. False Prophets in a sense. That doesn't negate the concept of the doctrine.

       There are excellent resources that expose how these religious cults grew out of a particular literary genre, its actually very well documented. You should be interested in that. Otherwise, you might be putting your faith in doctrinal concepts whose development is not what you think.   You would be factually in error.   Would you want that?

       Learn to read.   After WWI and the Scopes Trial,  religion in the west was less and less popular,  and fanatical crazy extremist interpretations were not being supported by most governments.    The recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is something politicians in the US are being pressured to do by religious crazies in the US,  mostly Christians who have some crazy ideas about end times and who think supporting Israel is their religious duty from a religious point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I said is that MK Ultra had a hand in why religious fundamentalism had a revival in the US in the decade leading up to the Moral Majority bs and ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am saying is that your typical American thinks that religious crazies have always had a big influence on US foreign policy and were always invited to the White House.   American's born after the 60's do not remember a time before TV evangelism took root,  when religious kooks were laughed at in polite society.   I do remember that time,  ruefully.    Whether it was the CIA or whatever that made America get so dumbed down,  I am not sure,   but there are signs that MK ultra was involved,  and I would love for people to at least know about a time in America in the 20's and 30's when the crazies were exposed,  unpopular,  and on the run.    Most people don't know about it,  or how modern evangelical Christianity is actually quite a new phenomenon,   a major revision from anything that happened before.

       I primarily concern myself with things that are highly likely, based on fact, or are verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The section of the book you linked to doesn't incline me to think MKUltra had anything to do with fundamentist revivalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know a fairly good amount about MKUltra, including many subproject names and what they were focused on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd have better luck proving your case by citing the newly released JFK files that prove that the CIA inflitrated, not only the press, but also religious organizations. Not part of MKUltra though, AFAIK.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot to indicate Jonestown may have been a mind control experiment, but Cui Bono? Maybe the CIA in seeing if they could get 900 people to off themselves, but did religious fundamentalism benefit? I don't see how.

      <p>
       and how:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Billy Graham goaded President Eisenhower into getting baptised while in office, that Eisenhower led the charge to insert "under God" into the "Pledge of Allegiance", or that "In God We Trust" didn't become the official United States motto until Eisenhower signed a 1956 congressional resolution. Nor did I know that Billy Graham had been launched onto the national stage because of his resolute anti-communism. Impressed by the charismatic young evangelist's fiery anti-communist message, press baron William Randolph Hearst commanded the overseers of his influential national network of propaganda broadsheets to "Puff Graham". (These are, apparently, "two of the most famous words in all of American religious history", which goes to show how much I know about American religious history.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Soon enough, Mr Graham was undertaking nationwide "crusades", selling out huge sports arenas, and precipitating the rapid rise of a more evangelical strain of "born again" American Protestantism."[T]he principles of Christ," Mr Graham declaimed, "form the only ideology hard enough to stop communism. When communism conquers a nation, it makes every man a slave; when Christianity conquers a nation, it makes every man a king." For Americans in the swelling ranks of Graham-style anti-communist Protestantism, the stakes of the cold war could hardly have been higher.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1942, before Americans came to see the Soviets as their mortal enemy, the ideas of "Strong, immediate limitations on national sovereignty" and "International control of all armies and navies" could seem an enlightened path to the abolition of war. But by the war's end, it quickly became apparent that this sort of thing would amount to an impracticable power-sharing agreement with communist regimes. And as Americans became more and more likely to believe that only a more thoroughly Christian nation could save the world from godless communist tyranny
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And it wasn't just national crusades Billy Graham was America's sponsored representative in 185 foreign countries where embassies and consulates coordinated his appearances.

      <p>
       This happened.

       Sure, no connection to MKUltra though.

       Learn to read.   After WWI and the Scopes Trial,  religion in the west was less and less popular,  and fanatical crazy extremist interpretations were not being supported by most governments.    The recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is something politicians in the US are being pressured to do by religious crazies in the US,  mostly Christians who have some crazy ideas about end times and who think supporting Israel is their religious duty from a religious point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I said is that MK Ultra had a hand in why religious fundamentalism had a revival in the US in the decade leading up to the Moral Majority bs and ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am saying is that your typical American thinks that religious crazies have always had a big influence on US foreign policy and were always invited to the White House.   American's born after the 60's do not remember a time before TV evangelism took root,  when religious kooks were laughed at in polite society.   I do remember that time,  ruefully.    Whether it was the CIA or whatever that made America get so dumbed down,  I am not sure,   but there are signs that MK ultra was involved,  and I would love for people to at least know about a time in America in the 20's and 30's when the crazies were exposed,  unpopular,  and on the run.    Most people don't know about it,  or how modern evangelical Christianity is actually quite a new phenomenon,   a major revision from anything that happened before.
