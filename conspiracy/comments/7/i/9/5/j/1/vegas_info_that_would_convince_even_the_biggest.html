        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ItsClearAsDay.html">ItsClearAsDay</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I decided to just list some coincidences regarding the Vegas incident without coming out and drawing an ULTIMATE conclusion because I mean how could you really? But there’s definitely some main directions. I am not a republican and I am not a Democrat I have no bias towards each. They both suck. Republicans carry out false flags and blame islamic terrorism and the left have these false flags that always consist of a sloppy motive or none, and using the most common weapons always legally purchased and don’t want you to for a second to look into it deep enough to realize it’s not guns. Just cry about the blood shed and give us your securities.  It’s been made into such a shit show. </p>

<p>But we all are aware even the sheep couldn’t play dumb for this one. Even though we can tie in the Illuminati and number game to it all very easy, you don’t even have to for this. So here:  </p>

<p>• the top floors are owned by Saudi princes ( wonder why we have no video? Who says he came in the hotel and went up he could of very easily came from the top) </p>

<p>• the shooters brother was being investigated for child pornography a full month before the shooting now I’m not a detective but if you were to be investigated for something I’m positive they’d talk to any family members with that being said the media stated even though he’s been piling weapons since the 80’s majority of the guns used in the shooting were purchased within the month before the shooting so that means they spoke to him during him buying these weapons.   </p>

<p>•MGM owner James Murren dumped millions of shares of stocks just a month before the shooting ( how 9/11 of the guy right) James Murren was also a sitting member of the national infrastructure advisory council and long time republican until trump when he resigned. </p>

<p>•Stephen Paddock worked as an accountant for Lockheed Martin. ( Lockheed has to always stick there nose in this stuff) ( also I promised I wouldn’t do this but the movie “the accountant” with Ben Affleck seems a little strange now) </p>

<p>•The shooters house was broken into within a week after the shooting while investigations were being conducted. The man who we are suppose to believe committed the largest mass murder in our history had his house broken into during investigations?  </p>

<p>•The timeline... do I even have to go into detail about that? I’ll say this, if I was being investigated for anything ever and changed my timeline as much as the investigators have they’d put my ass in jail. Come on deep state stick to the golden rule of breaking the law STICK WITH YOUR STORY. </p>

<p>•Hillary Clinton tweeted only hours after and it was not your typical thoughts and prayers tweet. She didn’t hesitate for a second to start on guns.  Said it’ll just keep happening. I bet you’ll make sure of that one Hillary.  </p>

<p>There is a hundred other things to point out that I have not or found them to be very obvious. Such as do I even have to say there were multiple shooters, helicopters blacked out, the police reports, the mysterious van gunning it down the strip, the stage high beaming the audience like fish in a barrel. This false flag caused hundreds to lose there life. What’s irritating is how obvious this was and I feel like I’m going crazy because why was this not a bigger deal. </p>

<p>The lines are far to easy to connect in all of this. There’s so much more I urge you to look into like the way you can link the shooters owned planes to private contractors, the amount of thermite, Jose Campos is in mexico now. They didn’t even try for this one. Left it for us all to see. </p>

<p>This was either an attack from the left? Maybe an isis plot gone wrong or he was running guns? He was clearly laundering money that’s why he was playing so much in the casinos. Or this shooter is no one? But one thing Is clear, they did awful at the clean up and this woke up a mass of people. </p>

<p>It’s like they wanted to do an experiment on us to see to what degree of heartache will cause you to suspend all logic and common sense. And it bit them in the ass and now that’s why we hear nothing about it ever or any update. No one in jail. Nothing. Just carry on until they try again.</p>
