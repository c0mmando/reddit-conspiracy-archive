    <div class="md"><p>I tend to lean towards Libertarians when I say I&#39;m right-wing.  </p>

<p>I believe the govt has no right to interfere in private lives.  I believe we all have a right to privacy, liberty, and freedom.  I believe we have the right to do anything we want so long as it does not hurt someone else physically, financially, reputationally, or mentally if they are a minor.</p>

<p>I believe it is the government&#39;s job to enforce the Constitution as it&#39;s written, and not contrive or taint it with agenda or trite interpretations of it.  I believe the govt has zero right to interfere in businesses except where it violates the &quot;hurt others&quot; clause I stipulated above.  For instance, if a corporation is polluting, they should be punished because it is physically hurting those people who live in the polluted area.  A business could charge whatever it wants for a product as long as they are not actively preventing competition.  If harassment or underhanded practices put the competition out of business, then they should be punished.  Otherwise, let businesses do their thing without meddling.</p>

<p>I believe that the more govt coddles people and the more they offer social safety nets, the worse society gets.  Like spoiled children who never learn how to care for themselves, a population that depends on the government for existence is doomed.  I believe the governments duty is to make sure all its citizens are treated equally.  This means no discrimination, segregation, and cronyism.  However, this also means no special treatment, like affirmative action or financial help that&#39;s only available to certain groups of populations.</p>

<p>I believe the government has no right to hide information from its citizens.  I believe Constitutional Rights supercedes violations of it guised under the obfuscating umbrella of public safety.   I believe in due process and innocent until proven guilty as opposed to the court of public opinion which has gained so much power with the advent of the internet.
I believe that freedom of speech applies to everyone instead of just popular opinions.</p>

<p>I believe the government has a duty to protect the country from detrimental forces, domestic or foreign, that threatens the American way of life.  I believe the govt has a duty to protect its own citizens before protecting others.  I believe the govt has a duty to protect our borders.  I believe it is the govt&#39;s duty to expel illegal immigrants and reject immigration from countries that promote terrorism.</p>

<p>I believe good and evil exists.  I reject the notion that diversity is always good.  Nothing good can come out of injecting bad values and cultures into our society.  If you argue that all cultures have value, I would disagree with you.  There are good cultures and there are bad ones.  The PC culture has brainwashed people into thinking that all are good.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Individuality has been lost since radio and tv not social networks, became mainstream. Radio and came in the early 1900&#39;s and allowed the spread of propaganda. If you don&#39;t believe in propaganda, turn on the TV and wait for the next commercial. In the early 20th century with Edward Bernays and the others of his ilk, started theyre systematic attack on individuality. They used tv and radio to treat us like cattle to herd us to whatever cause they wanted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>quick note, Propaganda in advertising works like this. Making someone feel inadequate or inferior is the strongest selling tool ever devised. Bernays was contracted by a piano company to increase sales. So what did Ed do? He made it seem that anyone who has a music room in their house is a success, or doing well. So, with a music room in each house what would someone at that time need to play music? A piano. He didn&#39;t sell the product he sold the idea that the music room/piano is a status symbol. Fascinating shit to read really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what is happening is the popular opinions of the past are becoming unpopular in the present.</p>

<p>It isn’t a loss of individuality. We have more fucking individuality permissible in society than <em>ever</em> before. The same fucking hotel hosts a furry convention one day and a Mason convention the next. The only impermissible opinions are <em>generally</em> those that desire less individuality and more lines being drawn between people, i.e. right wingers.</p>

<p>Can’t repress people of other faiths and beliefs for so long and then complain about “individuality” when society moves to reject those restrictions.</p>

<p>It isn’t individuality that is being rejecting. It is you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can definitely feel the loss of individuality. With your thought in mind, what do you make of the &quot;new age&quot; angle? The idea that we are all one, but living through our own subjective path? I can see the benefits for mankind but is the public buying into a trap?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Are we being directed to loose our individuality to make a more manipulable society?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Explicitly yes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe it started with the boom of social networks. I mean, we can see it here in Reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been happening on some degree since media has existed.  Your worldview is entirely shaped and reinforced by what you spend a lot of your time staring at.  Many malicious or self-interested agents of influence that normalize and encourage outgroup contempt and manipulate your tribal primate cognitive impulses to control <em>how</em> you are conditioned to behave and justify the feelings of rootlessness and insecurity that you feel.  Everyone that has money is spending it to manipulate your perception of the world and agitate your feelings about strangers so that you&#39;re willing to comply with their self-interested control of government policy that exploits you and destroys your future. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When someone has an individual thought that doesn&#39;t fit with the majority they get instantly downvoted to death</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of this varies depending on where you are.  If you&#39;re in a sub and you&#39;re not being antagonistically subversive or blatantly incorrect you shouldn&#39;t be getting super downvoted.  In places like this and and <a href="/r/uncensorednews">/r/uncensorednews</a> and /pol/ anything that is critical of Russia or suggests self-reflection is pretty actively buried.  </p>

<p>That media is maliciously being aggregated to manipulate your perception of it&#39;s frequency and keep you acting in spite of other poor people.  American &quot;Conservatives&quot; have been doing this messaging strategy on some level for decades, but when Russia became a corporate oligarchy the FSB cranked up the pro-corporatist messaging strategy and thought control across all social media, the messaging started focusing on constantly normalizing appeals to hypocrisy and reinforce the mind disease of whataboutism by acting like fellow american redditors and posting fake news and sharing and promoting subversive thought and isolating you from mainstream thought using tribalism and self-censorship that self-propagates through the hivemind like a malignant cancer.  They started focusing on using their social media and 24-hour news propaganda model that they&#39;d been using in russian media forever, and adapting it into every language in the west, running fake news outlets out of places like Estonia designed to look like local papers for every EU and NA nation.  Plus the military industrial complex has been pretty thoroughly studying and applying subversive social media messaging manipulation in the middle east and then Russia, causing anti-government protests in moscow in 2011.  By 2014, after Russia and Putin were sanctioned by the US and the Saudi&#39;s tanked the cost of oil, they started an active measures war against the west designed to breed intolerant emotional tribalistic thought within our populations and it&#39;s gotten progressively more malicious and destructive since Trump actually won.     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and it forces that people to not express what they really feel...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  They weaponized irony.  Everyone is just being reinforced to act dishonestly and use fallacy &quot;trolling&quot; hypocrisy evasions and projecting and strawmanning and false equivalence to normalize in your cognition the idea that it&#39;s ok to lie to yourself.  Because practically, what you think is generally how you justify your behavior.  If you reinforce and reward people when they&#39;re &quot;pretending&quot; to be stupid assholes as a goof, they eventually just stop knowing the difference between who they are, who they want to be, and what they choose to do.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you feel about this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t trust the media that makes you feel good about yourself.  You need to understand that all the social media content aggregation you consume is designed to be behaviorally addictive and emotionally rewarding because they&#39;re paid by corporations for the amount of times you see their ads.  It makes it as easy as possible for you to self-censor and tailoring your website experience around making you <em>feel</em> safe while selling your perception to malicious agents of influence that don&#39;t want you to think or behave like a human. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>am i crazy or is this really happening?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russian active measures in western media has always happened, but it became real in 2011, and they declared war on us in 2014.  The Patriot Act and the explosion of the NSA and Department of Homeland Security bureaucracies and the general blank check given to DOD after 9/11, the US has been researching and financing corporations to research how the internet can be used to control and exploit and subvert a population.  The Citizens United decision in 2010 then created jobs and funded research and a corporate industry that wasn&#39;t interested in the best interests of the American people.  They learned the strategies the US government had been developed as subversive antagonism or manipulation on the internet in the war on terror and applied them to their own pro-corporate messaging that they covertly and indirectly distribute. Every industry and multiple belligerent foreign nations and the delusional people that trust them are both implicitly and intentionally trying to agitate you and keep you focused on outsiders and poor people and being motivated to act in spite of them (and yourself) because you&#39;re being literally being dehumanized and desocialized and intellectually falling into instinctual tribalistic ape behavior.  A primate stops thinking about it&#39;s own sense of self when it sees threatening strangers encroaching on it&#39;s territory, it&#39;s instinctually conditioned to start communicating with the ingroup to act against or away from the outgroup threat, it falls into mob mentality and oppositional defiance behavior and aggression that was evolutionarily reinforced.  </p>

<p>tl;dr: you are under assault and you should not automatically trust the intention of anything you see on facebook, twitter, reddit, 4chan, tumblr, or anywhere else.  The media that highlights assholes or cirlejerks or sensational crimes about people that you don&#39;t like may be maliciously using psychological abuse and manipulation to control the way you&#39;re conditioned to think.  Also whataboutism is cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a feeling about this &quot;everyone is different&quot; but really people are just being conditioned to be more similar/uniform. ever since social media/youtube picked up on the whole &quot;make up is life&quot; thing (I guess it&#39;s super different depending on where you live, who you are) but to me I&#39;ve been seeing, particularly in young women everyone looks the same. I feel like social media has messed with womens brains to think they don&#39;t look good unless their make up is......&quot;fleek&quot;.....whatever that means. This might trigger people going &quot;I do it for me not for you&quot; but if you&#39;re doing it for you why does everyone insist on contouring their face exactly the same, same eye brows that are &quot;on point&quot; to all look the same. The new make up fad/trend is literally a mask that thousands of girls wear to look the same. And trust me it doesn&#39;t look that good without the instagram filters. Contour and highlighting, eyebrows eyeshadow whatever, to me now isn&#39;t something that makes you look beautiful it makes me think you&#39;re wearing an instagram uniform.</p>

<p>I know this is probably just me being picky/judgmental because I personally don&#39;t like the look but I just find it weird how I walk around my town and all the girls in school uniforms or same fashion trends are wearing the exact same make up look and all look the same... and everyone on social media looks the same but really they look different. I really mean no harm in this and don&#39;t want to offend any women, it&#39;s just something I&#39;ve picked up on seeing trends grow on yt/social media ect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking too, hasn&#39;t this been in effect since we&#39;ve been born? Society enforces its norms on you. </p>

<p>Your parents (or whoever becomes your guardian) may have told you what&#39;s right versus wrong, they give you an impression of how to speak, how to be, even what to be. </p>

<p>As early as primary school, you&#39;re given a list of rules to follow, a dress code (can&#39;t really come to work dresses as a pink Barney, can you?), grades or marks to pass to be considered good enough to get to a new level (the educational system doesn&#39;t make you smart enough to tackle life, it&#39;s doing its best to make you get to the next level, like a game booster).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re raised by television and media, then you know that you&#39;re part of the mindhive. They tell you what&#39;s hot and what&#39;s not, fashion-wise, music, TV shows, movies, etc.</p>

<p>Then for people that started to branch out and stopped watching TV or listening to the music they&#39;re peddling, they invented social media. It&#39;s been the machinery ever since. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just one of those folks that tend to lurk and never comment or say much about anything but absorbing people&#39;s opinions whether IRL or in social media, I&#39;ve come to see that there is a  general consensus that whatever MSM says is right becomes the new normal and whatever everyone paints to be wrong is just an absolute abhorrence.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re losing our individuality, we&#39;re trained to be part of a crowd and what core ideas and beliefs we have, we tend to have absorbed from whomever we interact with. Even with the &#39;movement&#39; to express yourself or to be unique, it still makes us crave for acceptance from other people, and it still isn&#39;t being a complete individual, it&#39;s a status of acceptance and recognition from the society that you are indeed yourself. </p>
