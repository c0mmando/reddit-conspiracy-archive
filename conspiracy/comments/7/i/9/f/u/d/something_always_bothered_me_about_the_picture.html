      <p>
       I've been holding my tongue about this ever since the photographs of the deceased suspect were leaked.  I'd like some feedback on this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you take the photograph of the deceased suspect and adjust the settings, you can plainly see the chest entry wound.  However, you can also see a perfect entry wound just under the right nostril.  Anyone with even the slightest knowledge of forensic analysis can see that the abrasion margin indicates a projectile entry angle between 0 and 10 degrees.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In addition, and considering the projectile is purported to be a .357 or .38, the puncture diameter indicates the projectile was fired from a distance between 18 to 36 inches.  Moreover, there is no evidence of tattooing on the epithelial tissue, which would have been apparent especially considering reports that the wound was both self-inflicted and fired from a handgun with a barrel of under 4 inches.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The firearm used by the suspect seems to have been kicked from the suspect's chest by the entry team as they cleared the room.  The blood on the cylinder indicates the firearm had rested on or near the suspect's chest wound for enough time for the blood to spread onto the stainless steel cylinder.  The blood trail on the suspect's shirt confirms this hypothesis as the trail leads from the chest wound, up the shirt, over the shoulder, across the floor, and finally to the firearm itself.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The suspect's upper extremities were positioned at his sides, indicating that his arms could not have been extended to execute a self-inflicted gunshot to his face.  At least one arm should have been positioned away from his body upon his death, unless he was able to miraculously maintain muscle control and move his arms perfectly to his sides after (1) suffering two gunshot wounds to vital organs from a distance of 18 inches or more, and (2) dropping the firearm on his chest.  This is supported by the wrinkle in the shirt by the chest wound, which appears to have been caused by the suspect using both hands to apply firm upward pressure to his chest.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         His left leg is under a rifle supported by a bi-pod.  This is less concerning as the rifle may have been moved by the police entry team, but lends more support to the conclusion that the suspect was executed while on his back.  In addition, there is no blood splatter visible anywhere around the head.  There is only brain matter and blood pooling on the carpet at the back of the skull, which indicates the suspect suffered the gunshot wound to the face while lying down, and the projectile exited at the base of the skull near C1 at the cervical spine.  Even more, the suspect's shirt is loose around the neck and the shoulders.  Unless the suspect's body was moved, this indicates a backwards fall from a reasonable height, such as falling from a standing position.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR:
       </strong>
       I believe the suspect was standing when he suffered a gunshot wound to the chest.  The suspect then fell backwards with both hands on his chest wound and kicked his legs forward with his left leg going underneath a rifle.  He was then executed by a gunshot to the face by an individual standing over him.  The suspect's hands then fell to his sides and his killer dropped the firearm on his chest (specifically on the blood from the chest wound).  The killer the exited the suite through the adjoined room's single door and moved the dining cart into place before exiting the building via the stairwell.  All in all, it was made to look like a suicide, but the killer seems to have been rushed or panicked.

       False flag for what cause? And by who? False flags are usually publicized by either the group who commited the attack or the ones who were targeted. This time the incident is basically being buried like it never happened. It's extremely odd.

       There was an interesting theory claiming that it was an organized gun control bit via the government. A psychopath buys guns legally for several years and then causes the worst shooting on US soil is the perfect motivation to crack down.

       Distraction is also a reason. We had just been hit by 3 hurricanes in a row a public outcry about Puerto Rico was increasing exponentially. I’m not saying that is specifically why it was done, but just an example of the many possibilities. Make everyone start talking about gun control. But something was definitely botched, thus instead we got this “national conversation moment” centered around Weinstein instead.

       One or two? TPTB would be pretty stupid to use fake dead bodies over actual deaths to push their agendas. Think logically here. Just because you're so desensitized to the point where you believe nothing doesn't make this a hoax, sorry to burst your bubble. The reality is people died, whether you choose to accept that or not is on you. I live here, I know for a fact people have died. Kinda sad seeing how far people go down this rabbit hole and get lost in the process. Its people like you that need to take breaks from this sort of material and come back with an open mind, because claiming something like this is a big fat lie and only "one or two" people died is ignorant.

       Nice assumption there. Just because I'm saying people died at the festival doesn't equate to me believing they don't fabricate deaths. Yea I really don't know what's going on in the world. Clearly neither do you, however.

       Sure I do.  Lucifer is trying to drag everyone to Hell with him.  The greatest conspiracy of all is the one to discredit the gospel of Jesus Christ with false history, false science, and all these manufactured distractions.  Repent, believe the Gospel, and be saved by the redeeming blood of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       How does this get upvoted?? This is not how the jurisdiction of the DOJ works. They can investigate
       <em>
        any federal crime
       </em>
       . Interstate commerce clause has absolutely
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to do with this stuff. Stop reading Alex Jones YouTube descriptions and read your civics texts books.

       False. FBI has jurisdiction over active shooters.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Overview of FBI Roles 
FBI Jurisdiction in Active Shooter Incidents
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Shortly after the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in December 2012, the FBI sought ways its personnel could better assist its law enforcement partners. Two actions enhanced these efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012, signed into law by the president in January 2013, permits the U.S. attorney general—at the request of appropriate state or local law enforcement personnel—to provide federal assistance during active shooter incidents and mass killings (defined by the law as three or more people) in public places. The attorney general delegated this responsibility to the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, working with other cabinet agencies, the FBI is finding ways to help prevent and respond to active shooters. A White House working group—consisting of the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security, Department of Education, and Department of Health and Human Services—is part of a broader initiative, Now is the Time, undertaken after the Sandy Hook shootings. DOJ, led by the FBI, was specifically tasked with training law enforcement and other first responders to ensure that protocols for responding to active shooter situations are consistent across the country.

       Excellent analysis.  From day one, it seemed ludicrous to me that someone who was determined to kill as many people would just commit suicide while he had thousands of rounds of ammunition left.  WHO DOES THAT?

       The only way it makes sense is if he wanted to shoot up the concert but didn’t give a fuck about fighting any police. Which seems odd because if someone is willing to shoot a crowd of civilians then they should be willing to shoot cops.

       Is this supposed to be funny? Because it's pretty funny. What are your qualifications for making all of these technical assumptions about OP being a liar? 
I personally have medical training, I've seen gunshots and dead victims. OP seems pretty spot on; I believe you should actually read his entire post before jumping to conclusions. 
Also, OP is currently providing us with more information than the FBI... Take note of that fact and ask yourself WHY that might be.

       Okay, so you are an EMT or similar I guess.  Which is great and useful - I couldn’t do that job, it seems very stressful.  But even if you were the head of cardiology at Cedars-Sinai or a neurosurgeon at Columbia Presbyterian that wouldn’t qualify you to make judgements on forensic issues - particlarly not from a photograph.  I don’t think it qualifies OP to draw any conclusions either.  OP’s whole post is so far-fetched that I can’t help thinking he’s having a laugh.  So its doubtful he’s providing more info than the FBI, and even if he was I don’t see the big WHY.

       You’re right, I shouldn’t have characterized it as hostile, and I apologize for that. I’m just interested in this type of response to this particular issue and am noticing a pattern so I’ve taken to replying when I see it happen for the sole purpose of being able to more easily find it later.

       The rifle placed over the legs was always the most nonsensical. Has no place there. Would’ve presumably been left near window.  If it was oddly near his body, what cop would move that gun to that position in that circumstance? Maybe it’s posed for effect? Defies logic.

       i dont see your picture here but i saw the alleged leaked ones a few HUGE red flags jumped out at me immediately. Firstly there were no brains/grey matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second all the guns alleged to have been Used had Bipods you cant bump fire with a bipod in use (even just attached the extra weight stops the bumpstock from working properly.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The scene looked staged the blood was wrong for the timing alleged and there appeared to be shell casings sprinkled ontop of already congealed blood. The blood was very thick 1/2 or more in puddles and it wasnt covering the .223 casings they were on top and didnt have any spatter on them whatsoever. the brass was also clean and shiny like when you go to cabellas and buy a bag of clean new casings for reloads no powder burns on the shells at all . Look like they just came out of a media tumbler.
      </p>
      <p>
       His body was completely in the wrong spot , but me and my cohort who were looking at it decided this could be from the swat team entering and moving the body (after probably shooting it) to make sure he was dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either whoever released the photos is stupid and blew the whole cover story or they released them so we would know that we are being lied to because the photos tell a completely different story.
      </p>

       Great post BTW I am going purely off memory here alone but you seem to have reached many of the same conclusions i did.

       I agree - just the fact that the guns were ( possibly) purchased - the LVPD is not happy - States have rights and the FED has rules as well - and the western MT states are not onboard with all DC policies (often)

       Something else of interest that folks seem to have overlooked. The police state that they had to break down the door to access the second room.... which leaves the question of why, if he was going back and forth shooting from the two different broken windows, did he have the door to the adjoining room locked before police burst in? It doesn't make any sense to have locked the door.

       Yeah, according to the police he shot 800 rounds at people four football fields away and hit 500 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he shot 200 rounds at Jesus Campos in a confined hallway at less than fifty yards.... and grazed his leg.

       That to me is the biggest red flag. Everything about Campos has been fishy as fuck. But Ellen, all of a sudden real-life Chloe from 24, had all of the answers with her 3D schematics and shit.

       Those rifles don't shoot three round burst. Just an FYI. They shoot semi-auto. One pull, one bullet. If equipped with a bump stock, then it's up in the air how many will be fired

       Great analysis, overall.
Out of curiosity, what makes you think the cart was placed by the killer?  That's pretty random, after such a detailed post of observation.

       We may be thinking of different pictures, but in the photo I looked at he is wearing a black glove on his left hand.  What really confuses me is why there is a multipurpose blue pool hose in the picture.  Moreover, what is jammed inside that pool hose and what purpose does it serve?

       No idea on the pool hose but even if he was wearing gloves, they would put a bag over his hand to preserve it for gun powder tests before removing the glove from his hand.

       I do not know the FBI's protocol on preserving GSR evidence on clothing nor do I have any evidence regarding how GSR evidence was preserved at the crime scene, but using a sterile bag would be an excellent option.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Preservation of clothing obtained in the investigation is another important consideration. Do not shake or overly handle clothing of suspects or allow any evidence to be handled extensively or carelessly. Particle loss can be minimized in many cases, and every effort should be made to preserve any evidence that may associate a subject with a suspected shooting.

       Not sure on the pool hose. Doesnt look corrugated. It almost looks like some sort of stiff but flexible foam rod? Ive always wondered what that is but haven't seen any explanation yet.

       Here’s a link to the press release where Sheriff Joe explains his frustration about the leak of the photos. He does now however admit to the authenticity.

       I'm still not convinced those pictures were real, or that the body was even Paddock.  So far no proof he fired a single shot except police say-so, as he was DOA long before any witness got to the room.  Being the only dead body in the room is circumstantial and not enough information to confirm he was the shooter.

       Isn't that glass hurricane proof for saftey reasons? I seen a video on youtube and the guy called the mandalay glass manufacturer and then found a piece of the same glass and could not even get a small hole in it with a hammer. It spiderwebs but does not shatter like the glass we see broken out both windows?

       Just like 9/11, the official story will hold presedence for many years. Untill too many holes start popping ilup in general conversations, then the official story will stilll be held as true, despite it clearly not smelling like true true.

       Yeah, according to the police he shot 800 rounds at people four football fields away and hit 500 of them.

       Then he shot 200 rounds at Jesus Campos in a confined hallway at less than fifty yards.... and grazed his leg.

       Those rifles don't shoot three round burst. Just an FYI. They shoot semi-auto. One pull, one bullet. If equipped with a bump stock, then it's up in the air how many will be fired
