        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;In 2007, someone in an irregular chain of Air Force command authorized the loading and transport of nuclear weapons from Minot, ND to Barksdale, LA. These weapons were unaccounted for from 10-36 hours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Several military personnel died under mysterious circumstances shortly before and after the incident. There are now questions regarding the fate of these individuals in the U.S. Air Force who could have had relationships in one way or another to the incident or possibly have been directly involved.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/missing-nukes-treason-of-the-highest-order/7158">https://www.globalresearch.ca/missing-nukes-treason-of-the-highest-order/7158</a></p>

<p>&quot;The problem with this explanation for the first reported case of nukes being removed from a weapons bunker without authorization in 50 years of nuclear weapons, is that those warheads, and all nuclear warheads in the US stockpile, are supposedly protected against unauthorized transport or removal from bunkers by electronic antitheft systems-automated alarms similar to those used by department stores to prevent theft, and even anti-motion sensors that go off if a weapon is touched or approached without authorization.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;While the Air Force report doesn’t mention any of this, what it means is that if weapons in a storage bunker are protected against unauthorized removal, someone-and actually at least two people, since it’s long been a basic part of nuclear security that every action involving a nuclear weapon has to be done by two people working in tandem-had to deliberately and consciously disable those alarms.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since the Air Force report does not explain how this hurdle to unauthorized removal of the six nukes could have been surmounted by “mistake,” the report has to be considered a whitewash, at best, or a cover-up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since the Air Force report does not explain how this hurdle to unauthorized removal of the six nukes could have been surmounted by “mistake,” the report has to be considered a whitewash, at best, or a cover-up.&quot;</p>

So that means a weapons or ammo troop had to install the active warheads on the missiles and then mount the missiles on the plane.

<p>Also, the missiles have red tags on them that say &#39;Inert&#39; or something along those lines. The red tag must be removed before take off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>To play the devil&#39;s advocate, I&#39;ve seen other redditors pointing out that you need two people to do anything with a nuke (i.e. it would have been impossible to accidentally load them up, and therefore this was planned).</p>

<p>Again, to further your point on ineptitude, there are literally two options: someone <em>purposely</em> took those nuclear warheads and mounted the missiles to an airplane, or someone <em>accidentally</em> took those nuclear warheads and mounted the missiles to an airplane,</p>

<p>If the military&#39;s procedures are flawed to the point that this could have happened accidentally, do you think they&#39;re going to come out with that? We&#39;re not talking about covering up stupidity, but rather national security secrets. In other words, you&#39;ll never hear the military say &quot;oh yeah, none of the fail safes actually work and anyone could move a bomb and we probably wouldn&#39;t notice it for weeks!&quot;.</p>

bring evidence mate! 
i think it&#39;s a far fetched theory. and i say that while believing in the nuclear 9/11 :)</p>

<p>the issue is what kind of nuclear weapon was used: 1Kt? 100Kt? </p>

<p>Heinz Pommer last stance is for a neutron pulsator. at least Heinz Pommer accepts critics and is able to change his explanations about 9/11.. </p>

<p>*Currently I am refining my proposed model, you find the updated version attached to this letter.</p>

<p>I tried to take into account:
- the observed weak shockwave pattern
- the long lasting energy input in the rockbed
- some observed radiation phenomena</p>

<p>Currently I suspect the use of a neutron pulsator, combined with a neutron bomb, explaining:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimized initial pressure shockwave</li>
<li>high radiation output in the rock (even traversing the &quot;Bathtub&quot;, HotSpots below Tower 4)</li>
<li>attenuated [= flat] pressure chamber below Tower 1 / Tower 2</li>

<hr/>

<p>In my point of view all four leading theories have some value: Dimitri Khalezov, Dr. Judy Wood, William Tahil and Richard Gage.
The discussion should not be &quot;one versus another&quot;, but combining the findings / observations.</p>

<p>I have tried to do this.*</p>

<p>happy?</p>

Its my belief and others that the hurricane was created for aiding the energy weapon, it supplied the energy field that was needed, you can check it up online,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wait a minute! 
the media reported about a storm on september 11, 2001, 5 minutes before the first airplane crashed into the north tower? 
interesting, i didn&#39;t know about that.
that does not exclude the nuclear attack but it gives food for the directed-energy weapons link :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you are right no need for fighting about which theory is fact, the thing is we will probably never no the truth, I hope that isn&#39;t the case tho! I just know with 9/11 there are limited hangouts(smokescreen theory&#39;s) that have been setup to spread disinfo, to take peoples attention away from the truth, I will give you an example, Steven e jones who headed the thermite theory(bombs) and is heavily involved in Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth has a very interesting past helping suppress cold fusion technology, on a side note cold fusion technology has a relation to zero point energy(directed energy weapons) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DEccFO7EiI&amp;amp;t=98s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DEccFO7EiI&amp;amp;t=98s</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup, i&#39;ve read about how steven e. jones turned blanked when asked a serious question by a fellow physician.</p>

<p><a href="http://aitia.fr/erd/les-associations-pour-la-verite-sur-le-11-septembre-la-cherchent-elles-vraiment/">http://aitia.fr/erd/les-associations-pour-la-verite-sur-le-11-septembre-la-cherchent-elles-vraiment/</a></p>

<p>in french but you can use google translate.
the man who hosts the site is trustworthy. the political police prosecuted him for his writings about the lobby-that-does-not-exist. the french aipac and anti defamation league.. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t about steven e. jones being a shill, limited hangout but he&#39;s definitely not a real physician since he denies some facts that happened.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine, for a moment, that the greatest secret is that nuclear weapons don&#39;t actually work. Killing people trying to expose that secret or recovering fake nukes to avoid scrutiny would be the utmost priority of such a machine.</p>

<p>Compartmentalized, no one actually knows every piece of the bomb. So, only a few people could hold the secret while everyone else just thought they were protecting state secrets.</p>

<p>With tritium&#39;s half life being only 12 years, imagine that, after 6, a warhead isn&#39;t reliably operational, anymore. That means 6,000 nuclear weapons would have to be updated every 6 years.</p>

<p>What if North Korea was faking their abilities? </p>

<p>What if everyone was?</p>

<p>Just an interesting thought experiment. At one point, Trump said our nuclear arsenal didn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nukes are psychological warfare being waged as we speak, imposing fear of annihilation, keeping people in terror whether they work or don&#39;t. There are definitely reasons to think they are a hoax. Why is MOAB called the &quot;mother&quot; of all bombs? What would that make a nuclear warhead? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve wondered if those times when the world was supposedly saved at the last minute like the time the Soviet officer Stanislav Petrov who refused to turn the key, were bullshit, that the key <em>was</em> turned, but since nukes are fake, nothing happened, and a story needed to be concocted like a hero thinking it a false alarm. In reality, I think he would have been court martialed, not commended. </p>

I remember one where he said that his team was tasked with finding 6 suitcase nukes that were hidden along the Russian/European border. There were 6 guys designated to go on suicide missions and detonate them in the event Russia invaded Europe, but the people died and they lost track of the nukes.</p>

<p>His books are great reads. This just brought it to mind bc I remember reading an interview with him wherein he said that his &quot;fiction&quot; often has a lot of truth in it but he has to bill at as fiction for legal reasons. Wish I could find it. </p>
