       Ok so I just finished reading up on that whole scandals he had and I can’t help be think that Murphy had that trans killed. 
Supposedly the national enquirer payed a 15k bond for the trans in exchange for an interview, and she sung like a bird,
She said once in the car Eddie layed $200 on her lap and asked to see her in Lingerie, which she was game for. 
Then other trans came forward and said he likes to get down,
Later They find the original trans that Eddie picked up on the sidewalk dead in lingerie and the police summarized it kinda... fishy..
The police say the trans was locked of her apt and she tried getting in through her window by.. get this... “swinging on a towel” 
I call total bs on that. It seems too good of an explanation. Like it’s stupid to think someone would do that but the way it all goes together it’s a little too snug.

       Well lmk what y’all think or just tell me to lay off the herb

       As the user above noted, it's a think people on the right use to disparage people who claim to care about others. But here's the definition: "virtue signaling: the action or practice of publicly expressing opinions or sentiments intended to demonstrate one's good character or the moral correctness of one's position on a particular issue."

       Did you forget to switch accounts or did you just get lazy? Man and Woman. That's all that exists. The rest if you non binary folk are either mentally ill or actually not from this planet. Biology. It's FACT.

       I identify as nonbinary. 
And the post clearly genders her as she/her
The issue is the dehumanizing objectification. 
And hell, if someone who knew her tells me she prefers a different pronoun, I'll happily use it.

       That’s why you’re of non important. How you think you can consider yourself anything else than a man or a woman is beyond me, we all have a code written by the universe or god or fuck even a an alien species pick your poison, you’re like a ltoddler going “lalala I’m not a boy I’m not a girl idc what you say lalala” I’m talking about a possible murder and you’re going off about labels. It’s safe to say if it doesn’t fit in your agenda it doesn’t matter huh?

       Just because the gene that determines what your organ setup falls into either one or the other box at birth, that doesn't account for everything else that makes up the identity of an individual. Sure, you could be born with a dick. But what if all your hormones get produced at the levels relevant to a usual female? Or from another perspective, what if you've been female in "recent" past lives and despite how the gene falls into the "male" box at birth remnants of those past lives carry over into your present consciousness?
       <br/>
       Yes we can generalise, and for the majority it works to say they're either one or the other, but to say those options are absolute is to be ignorant of the multiple factors that come together to establish gender (vs sex). In the majority of cases, usually due to genetics, most of those factors will tend toward one or the other gender and align with the individual's sex, but in a minority of cases you'll get those born into one sex or another whose gender doesn't match up with their sex. Either those born male who feel female, those born female who feel male, or those born one or the other who feel neither. This is to be expected in the minority of cases, as would fit a standard distribution.
       <br/>
       And disclaimer: yes, I'm aware of the theory that current establishment/media is pushing for a trans movement and the implications and reasons of that theory. I don't deny that that exists in its own respect. But regardless, gender fluidity exists and it exists on a spectrum, just as everything else that exists in the universe does on a spectrum.

       To differentiate sex and gender is a social thing, it’s not written by facts like my dick is written into my code. I knew a dude in high school who for awhile thought he wanted to be woman he even dressed the part at times faith had me run into that guy 7yrs later and he was still that, a guy. I asked about the whole woman thing and he gave me this long explanation about sexual abuse from his uncle and his uncle would always say “there’s my girl” so he literally thought that he was just that. 
My point is people can be conditioned into doing or becoming anything, one way or another. You can starve a man to the point where you get him to hurt another man even if he never raised his hand at another human being ever before in his life, so to say that people are born that way is silly. You just haven’t suffered enough to understand what true pain can do. So a man is a man and a woman is a woman, anything else is mental And should not be encouraged

       I agree with Hades, but he could have communicated it better. Emotion(how you feel) should be removed from facts, because it can be manipulated. Despite Tom identifies as a women(based on what? Interest?) doesn't make him one. The whole premise is akin to flag earth.

       If they don't then sure whatever - that's their choice. I've never known or met anyone who doesn't identify as human so I think that's more a meme than anything else. But in this case they do identify as a human. And furthermore the individual in case identified as a woman.
