<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
Evolution Theory is a religion used by the forces of evil as the most important mind control weapon.<br/>
This set of pages refutes each basic assumption of the Evolution Theory. For each assumption:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>presents one or more pieces of evidence;  </p></li>
<li><p>precises the concepts required to justify the pieces of evidence;  </p></li>
<li><p>justifies why that assumption is impossible in relation to the evidence.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assumption #1 -</strong> <strong><em>Human ancestors moved out of Africa to colonize the entire world</em></strong><br/>
<em>Evidence</em>: human races.<br/>
<em>Concepts required to justify the evidence</em>: migration.</p>

<p><strong>Migration: Types</strong><br/>
There are two basic types of migration:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&amp;#35;1 - to a territory not yet colonized by humans;  </p></li>
<li><p>&amp;#35;2 - to an already colonized territory.<br/>
Successful migration to an already colonized territory leads to one of two new initial situations:  </p>

<ul>
<li> &amp;#35;2a - coexistence of races;<br/></li>
<li>&amp;#35;2b - replacing (expelling or exterminating) the race that was occupying previously this territory.<br/></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Migration: Periods</strong><br/>
There are two migration periods:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>the first is a consequence of assumption #1 (for which actually there&#39;s no material evidence);  </p></li>
<li><p>the second covers the migrations that took place during the historical period.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Migration: Features</strong><br/>
Data about the second period (mostly of type #2a, leading to coexistence of races) shows the three basic features of the migration process:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it is an exponential process;</p></li>
<li><p>it is not a one direction process;</p></li>
<li><p>produces very soon one race, whenever it leads to coexistence of races. Political systems like slavery or apartheid can delay the process of ONE RACE. But as these fall, it does not take much time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s no data to refute this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Brazil, it took just over one century to reach the stage where over 90% of the population is mixed from at least two races;</p></li>
<li><p>US, the share of mixed population is increasing exponentially for the past four decades.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: if the current process migration could continue there would be only ONE race in a few generations.</p>

<p><strong>Justification</strong><br/>
All three migration types are incompatible with the out of Africa assumption.  </p>

<p><strong>#1 is Impossible -</strong> <strong><em>Out of Africa exclusively to a territory not yet colonized by humans</em></strong><br/>
This contradicts the basic features of the migrational process:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>since it is an exponential process,  it would not stop, once people reached the most remote places like the arctic areas;</p></li>
<li><p>the <strong><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2016/12/main/articles/6_122416_ancient-human_inline.jpg">famous arrows</a></strong> showing the &quot;out of Africa&quot; process go only in one direction.<br/>
Note: those arrows are one of two basic visual tools that people associate with the evolution of humans, the other being the sequences (computer animated or not) showing transitional forms from apes to a human. Again these drawings exist only on the imagination of the creators of those sequences, this topic is covered by assumption #2).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>#2a is Impossible -</strong> <strong><em>Out of Africa leading to coexistence of races</em></strong><br/>
Since there are several human races we conclude that the first period did not lead to coexistence of races.  </p>

<p><strong>#2b is Impossible -</strong> <strong><em>Out of Africa leading to extermination of races</em></strong><br/>
If migration of the first period was based on genocide, again we would have only one race now.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re arguing because ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Religion</strong> is an explanation of who created all forms of life. There are two basic exclusive explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li>God (creationism) or an accident (Evolution Theory).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Believers</strong> are people that believe there is some evidence to prove that a religion is true. There are two types of believers:</p>

<ul>
<li>true (without doubts) and partial (with doubts).</li>
</ul>

<p>Believers without doubts are those who believe there&#39;s no evidence to prove that his or her religion is impossible.<br/>
From these definitions we can conclude that partial believers might believe in more than one religion.<br/>
Evidence proving that a particular religion is impossible leads (logically) to abandoning that religion. </p>

<p>I am a TRUE believer in God and YES, I do have a evidence. Plenty of evidence.<br/>
See OP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>distinct cultures and different races</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all: having only one religion would be more manageable only if people were not different to start with (genes, culture).<br/>
That&#39;s the first reason why the illuminati created different religions for different audiences.  </p>

<p>The ultimate reason why illuminati created other religions: religions created by the illuminati are only a tactical weapon, paving the way to achieve Global Slavery, their ultimate goal.<br/>
In other words: illuminati didn&#39;t create religions to robotically control the world&#39;s population, only to achieve that goal.</p>

<p>Christianity was the main obstacle to achieve the illuminati&#39;s goal of Global Slavery. That&#39;s why:<br/>
- the first one (Protestantism) directly targeted Christianity as an organization;<br/>
- the most important one, which for generations now children have been forced to learn in EVERY school (Evolution Theory), directly targeted the keystone of Christianity, the belief on the 10 basic facts about God.<br/>
Heliocentrism, the first cult created by the illuminati packaged as science, would become part of the Evolution religion more than two centuries later.</p>

<p>This is just fundamentalist drivel, based on an obvious fallacy.  One can be religious and believe in evolutionary theory.  There are myriad of options. Deism for one, special creation of man for another, or the view that god used evolution as the force of creation, etc.  </p>

<p>You know you can pick up a used Futuyama book for relatively cheap and learn something about this subject. That is what you should do.  Pick up a book, and read it. Then you can make an actual coherent post about this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth and Falsity are truth values assigned to a proposition. The very act of exchanging arguments where a proposition is declared false is an exercise in logic.  Declaring something false because it based on a logical argument is utilizing logic... it is circular.  Or you are just saying random words. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Evolutionary theory is not a religion.  Human beings are not cattle, nor are there cattle that are human.   Human beings are social creatures that have a social psychology. There is no older, nor more systematic form of manipulation of this social psychology than religion.  In the west this has been Christianity and it&#39;s 30,000 variants.  In the past 100 years there is a very insidious form of it called fundamentalism, it celebrates know-nothingism, and it&#39;s members think this makes them superior, or more pure, or even more blessed.  </p>

<p>They are usually easily spotted because they are completely ignorant about stuff like evolutionary theory, but love to spout off bullshit.  Easily cured, however, just requires reading books, and thinking a little. </p>

<p>Correct, the Heliocentricsm is the &quot;mother&quot; of all Big Lies taught today as &quot;science&quot;.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t believe the sun is at the center of the solar system? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.</p>

<p>In the beginning people knew the Truth, visible to naked eyes by gazing into the skies, i.e. Geocentrism:<br/>
- Moon, Sun and planets orbit the Earth;<br/>
- Earth and Moon do not rotate.<br/>
One of the obvious signs of God for the perfect Harmony of Creation and for the special role Earth and Humans had, were total solar eclipses.  </p>

<p>Then the illuminati begun fooling people into believing the opposite, i.e. <strong>Heliocentrism, the mockery of the Truth</strong>:<br/>
- Earth and planets orbit the Sun;<br/>
- Moon and Earth rotate.</p>

<p>Short after that, God allowed people, by letting them use telescopes, discover that in fact:<br/>
- the Sun rotates;<br/>
- the other planets rotate;<br/>
- the moons of the other planets rotate.</p>

<p>So the only visible planet or moon that does not rotate was our moon, a sign to help people understand the illuminati deception.</p>

<p>2b is entirly possible and most probable. There is only one human race, Homo Sapiens Sapiens. We express ourselves in different phenotypes (White, black, asian, arabic, red/blonde/black hair etc.) through adaption to our suroundings though. </p>

<p>You seem to think that the theory is that african humans spread to the world and replaced other humans. The most likely explanation is we started spreading from Africa, replaced most other humanoid species (non Homo Sapiens Sapiens, like Homo Neanderthalensis) and adapted to the environment into the &quot;races&quot; that are present today.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Please read OP again, each word counts. 
The article presents evidence and justification for why #2b is impossible:<br/>
<em>#2b is Impossible - Out of Africa leading to extermination of races</em><br/>
<em>If migration of the first period was based on genocide, again we would have only one race now.</em></p>

<p>2b is entirly possible and most probable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the theory is that african humans spread to the world and replaced other humans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not what I believe.<br/>
The OP article refutes that basic assumption of Evolution Theory, i.e. human ancestors moved out of Africa to colonize the entire world.</p>

<p>We only have one human race now. We only have Homo Sapiens Sapiens. We express ourselves in different phenotypes but are still one race. African humans spread to the world and adapted to the environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the moon is rotating. I assume you at least accept that the moon orbits the earth. Which means you at least acknowledge that it takes around 28 days to make 1 orbit. If it wasn&#39;t rotating, from our perspective it would look like it it&#39;s rotating because as it orbits earth, without itself rotating, we would see every side of it slowly over that 28 day cycle. In reality it&#39;s tidally locked, meaning it&#39;s rotating at the same rate as it orbits.That&#39;s why the same side is always facing us.</p>

<p>And if the earth isn&#39;t rotating and earth isn&#39;t orbiting the sun, then that means the sun would have to orbit the earth in 1 day. That&#39;s insanely fast. Your talking an orbit 28x faster than the moon.</p>

<p>Also how do you explain the other planets? In a geocentric model the orbits of the other planets make absolutely no sense. And that&#39;s justv going by what we can see from earth. </p>

<p>Also you mention God allowing us to use telescopes to try to see the truth. He allowed us to see other planets and moons orbiting and rotating. But that&#39;s how we figured out that we aren&#39;t in the center. Telescopes are literally the reason we don&#39;t use the geocentric model anymore. By your own words God is the reason we have the heliocentric model today. Because with telescopes we could see what everything else was doing and came to the conclusion that our planet had to be doing the same thing the rest of them were doing.</p>

<p>Put yourself in the place of the illuminati as they launched Copernicus. What was their major problem? Correct, the Moon was.<br/>
The first thing required by the mother of all hoaxes, Heliocentrism, was not a hoax of the stellar parallax type. It was the Moon hoax, aka TIDAL LOCKING.  </p>

<p>The hoax at the very bottom of the pyramid of lies. </p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>The REAL distance from SUN to EARTH - revealed worldwide first</strong><br/>
There are no doubts that Earth does not orbit the Sun.<br/>
The hoax was created by the satanists to destroy the credibility of the Bible.<br/>
There are no doubts that Earth does not rotate. So there&#39;s only one question left:<br/>
<strong>How fast is the Sun REALLY moving around the Earth?</strong><br/>
Or in other words: what is the real distance from Earth to the Sun?</p>

<p>Answer: A fraction of what you were told in school ...<br/>
A Sun which size is a fraction of what you were told in school ...  </p>

<p><strong>1 + 1 = 2</strong><br/>
End Times is when some of those 1 + 1 equations that were previously hidden finally surface.<br/>
Solar eclipses (2) are not even in that category. They have been around from the beginning ...</p>

<p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong><br/>
(1) Reminder: to explain &quot;scientifically&quot; their hoaxes, the satanists use two types of &quot;magic&quot;: unspecified equations for observable facts (examples: Evolution Theory, Earth&#39;s rotation) or equations for dummies for the rest (example: Theory of Relativity).</p>

<p>(2) A simple equation to illustrate why the Sun is not as big as the solar scale says it is:<br/>
Sun Moon and Earth in a straight line.<br/>
Sun emits light, Moon blocks light, creates shadow on Earth.<br/>
Take the diameter of the Moon&#39;s shadow, and distance of Moon from Earth.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also how do you explain the other planets? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See my previous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7id9fp/evidence_suggesting_that_evolution_theory_is/dqy00wj/">reply</a>.<br/>
What exactly is your question that was not answered by that post?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He allowed us to see other planets and moons orbiting and rotating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct, by using telescopes we discovered the Sun rotates, the other planets rotate, and the moons of the other planets rotate. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>had to be doing the same thing the rest of them were doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contrast with the only visible planet or moon that does not rotate, our Moon.<br/>
An obvious sign to help people understand the Geocentric Truth.</p>

<p>2b is entirly possible and most probable. There is only one human race, Homo Sapiens Sapiens. We express ourselves in different phenotypes (White, black, asian, arabic, red/blonde/black hair etc.) through adaption to our suroundings though. </p>

<p>You seem to think that the theory is that african humans spread to the world and replaced other humans. The most likely explanation is we started spreading from Africa, replaced most other humanoid species (non Homo Sapiens Sapiens, like Homo Neanderthalensis) and adapted to the environment into the &quot;races&quot; that are present today.</p>
