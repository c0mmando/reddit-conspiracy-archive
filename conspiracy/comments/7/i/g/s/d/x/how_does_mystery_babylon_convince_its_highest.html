        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/RunningDarkly.html">RunningDarkly</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How is it that Mystery Babylon convinces its highest members to worship Satan?</p>

<p>In the Christian belief system, Jesus Christ’s authority over mankind is both absolute and personal. Three ways he achieves this include (1) his human incarnation; (2) his sinless life; and (3) his death and resurrection. These three attributes make him a worthy sacrificial substitute for any man, for all of us can claim our flesh was weak, our lives are imperfect, and that we won’t escape death. Christ went to great lengths to make himself relatable to mankind.</p>

<p>Imagine two men, born at the same time in the same place, one a Christian and one a Freemason. The former struggles with psychosis and spiritual doubts, the latter effortlessly ascends the heights of that system. At the twilight of their respective lives, the question is asked of each: Do you hold these mysteries to be true in your heart, even were the whole earth to fall away? </p>

<p>The Christian answers, “I have never felt otherwise; let the earth fall away and deliver me to heaven.” His faith is one rooted in a savior larger than this world, but who is likewise personal. His faith is not compromised by the evaporation of reality because his savior transcends reality, having harmoniously integrated deity with humanity, power with weakness, life with death.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have our Freemason, and a system of belief which requires an initiate to traverse rituals that create wider and wider demarcations between himself and his fellow man, and a greater intensity of bondedness with his superiors and co-initiates. In this system, an initiate’s relative status is determined by the individual’s grasp of symbolic meanings, and the power of these symbols are reinforced by collective belief. </p>

<p>For the high initiate of Freemasonry who sees his status built upon a mountain of symbols, he cannot as easily forego the world; His beliefs are only <em>relatively</em> true, relative to his fellow man, as it were. The highest level of initiation is for the coterie who abandons the symbolic import and recognizes that the symbols themselves are only there to control men, especially lower initiates. But to claim such a belief is to disavow the very cornerstone of their system, i.e. symbolic meanings. How are these men to have it both ways: Control and Meaning? They are powerless to imbue their ancient symbols with power, unless they can follow in the bloody footsteps of their forbearers, and lay the symbols themselves at the foot of a god. Satan allows them to do this with the only grace he can afford to show, by masquerading himself as an angel of light. This is the final symbol: Light. </p>

<p>Only at that point does worship of Satan becomes the top priority of these highest initiates, who look down on the profane, within and without, for believing in a system held together by symbols. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I have family members who are/were masons.  Admittedly, they did not go high within the framework, but still, these were good men.  Some church goers, others not.  I have seen these references about masons being Satan worshippers, and I can tell you that these men weren’t.  I’m having trouble reconciling the masons I know to what they are perceived to be on this thread.  I would say it’s more like a college fraternity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is why they ask initiates to spit on the cross.  If they refuse, then they will not rise very high.  It is all brain washing and mind control, and people fall for it.  It is like people want to be made to feel &quot;special&quot;, so they suspend their critical thinking skills.  </p>

<p>I have done a lot of research the past year or so...  I became awoke because of Pizzagate and the last election.  I knew something was wrong, but I just assumed that politicians were hypocrites.  Little did I know it is more than that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. I believe 32 is as far as many go, because that&#39;s where you are asked to break the cross (you heard spit upon; I&#39;ve heard break), to get from 31 to 32.</p>

<p>If you do break it, they tell you &quot;Wisely done,&quot; and somewhere along the line you get invited to go up to 33. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t break it, they tell you &quot;Wisely done,&quot; but you&#39;re stuck at 32 for the rest of your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spitting on the cross is an old Templar ritual. The supposed esoteric meaning is that the cross is an idol and a Christian should not worship idols. But the real esoteric meaning is merely the exoteric meaning: desecrating and denying Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not told about the Lucifer worship until the 30th degree or so.  I also have family members that were Freemasons.  It is on their tombstones.  I read that Freemasonry was infiltrated by darker forces, and that Freemasonry used to be much better than it is today.  </p>

<p>Today, they have Shriners that like to screw kids and prostitutes.  Shriners are 32nd degree, so I am not sure how someone with such a character flaw can make it that high in the organization without being noticed.  It seems like their screening process is faulty, unless these are the types of men they want to promote.  </p>

<p>I think they do not believe that Satan/Lucifer are real supernatural beings.  Instead, they want to become gods themselves and rule in this material world.  To do this, they need to get rid of the middle class and dumb down the lower class.  They also need to have a huge technological advantage over everyone else.  It is why you keep hearing that there are technologies that are 50 years ahead of what is available to the public.  </p>

<p>The reality is the the Freemasons are being used as dupes, along with many other groups.  They will gladly help bring forth the New World Order one world government for their masters, but then they will not be needed anymore.  They will be thrown under the bus and disposed of because they know too much.  They are being told that they will live comfortably if they just help, but this is a deception.  They are being lied to, and they have always been lied to.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am of the same thoughts. I know people that are masons, and they are really good people. But here’s the kicker, the symbols and rituals are symbolic of Satan, at the root. I don’t think they understand that in the beginning, so they become enmeshed in this society. It is not until much later , higher up, that the true powers that govern this society are revealed. By that time, they have become very successful and completely ingrained, they will at that point accept their choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lucifer is the god of this world:</p>

<p>2Co 4:4  In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. </p>

<p>He has been given the ability to give power to people living our their life in the flesh:</p>

<p>Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.</p>

<p>So he simply offers worldly things.  He fuills the love of money, lusts, fame, etc.  He gives these things in abundance to any who worship him (even if they don&#39;t fully understand it).  He also gives a perverted version of the Biblical story where he is the good guy and God is the bad guy.  High level masons truly believe they are worshiping God.  They get real power from him where Jesus Christ only gives things that are within his perfect holy will to his children who ask.  We cannot get fame or glory.  All glory goes to God, not ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like you too I hope!  If you haven&#39;t had all you sins washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ (The perfect sacrificial Lamb of God) who is God who came to earth in the flesh to die for you personally then why not do it now?  It&#39;s so easy and every religion in the world is set up to pervert it and deceive people into not really understanding.</p>

<p>Simply understand that you are a sinner (we all are), know what sin means (we are cursed and fallen creatures and our sin makes us deserve an eternal lake of fire separated from God).  Once you understand that then realize that God came to Earth and took your punishment for you.  All you need to do is repent and believe his Gospel!  Then you will have victory over Lucifer and all his minions here.  This is the gospel that saves.  Simply repent and believe this in your heart:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>You should know where you are going when your flesh dies.  There is no work to be done, nothing you can do to save yourself.  Jesus Christ did it all already.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions and if you are already saved then that&#39;s awesome.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright.  I figured out Lucifer was real about 8 months ago then got saved by the grace of God when I traced the maze backwards and tried to figure out who they were most against.  If you want truth, read the King James Bible (the one the Vatican burned people at the stake for having/translating it&#39;s predecessors).  It really is the pure word of God.  Lucifer is trying hard to hide that with false science and history.  Keep climbing the staircase seeking truth and you will find Jesus Christ because he is literally the truth.  It will hit you like a ton of bricks like it did me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read the Nag Hammadi manuscripts?  </p>

<p>I am not sure why the King James Bible would be considered the Word of God when it was written by committee by fallen men.  </p>

<p>However, you are free to believe it.  I understand.  </p>

<p>Jesus spoke out against the Synagogue of Satan.  We are still dealing with this today.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah all humanity is fallen but the KJV was translated by saved men under the protection of the King of England.  I got saved without knowing anything translations or what Bible to use.  I believe I was led by the Holy Spirit to the KJV.  Issues of spiritual discernment are hard to convey but I&#39;ve also done some personal study as well and it all matches up.  You can also just look at whole the Vatican was burning at the stake.  Guys like William Tyndale.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read the manuscripts but form what I understand they are Gnostic in nature.  They come out of Egypt which is also where the Catholic translations of the Bible come form (Alexandria).</p>

<p>Here is a good presentation on the issue if you are interested:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Freemasons worship satan at all.  There&#39;s even a question of whether Lucifer is involved in their beliefs because of some of Pike&#39;s writings.  Freemasonry is not a religion.  One must believe in a higher power to join freemasonry.  Though I think the higher levels have been up to some nefarious stuff throughout the centuries, I don&#39;t think they necessitate worship of Satan.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>His faith is not compromised by the evaporation of reality because his savior transcends reality, having harmoniously integrated deity with humanity, power with weakness, life with death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If his faith is based on his ability to use his thinking mind then when the thinking mind an its concepts of reality or saviour or anything else will also vanish. Just like happens when you go to sleep and you enter deep sleep where there is no dream no body and no mind. There is no faith there either.</p>

<p>Only one who knows the nature of their own self and the nature of the creation as the same nature is unchanged during all states of change from waking to sleep to deep sleep to death of the body.</p>
