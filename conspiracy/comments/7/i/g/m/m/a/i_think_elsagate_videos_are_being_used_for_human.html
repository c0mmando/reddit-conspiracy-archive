       I had a series of posts maybe two weeks ago theorizing that the comment sections are being used to either swap cp (media) or display humans for potential trafficking. This is a video from the main channel I've been working with as far as the comments go:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Sorry to ruin the flow of the post but can't not link this. Criticism or doubts are welcome, at this point I feel like I'm going crazy:
      </p>

       They edited the video to focus on the kid......

      <p>
       Here are two introductory(10 min ea.) videos on the subject. The first is if you don't know what these videos contain and the second explains the founders cult, the people I believe are running the trafficking op:

      </p>
      <p>
       Next, take a quick look at my hasty research earlier. The links are ascending according to date posted:
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: So it appears a bunch of the videos have been either deleted or banned in the following links. Not sure what this is due to. It looks like even a few of the actual channel videos have been removed, which is actually kind of weird because 99% of the actual videos I linked weren't doing anything even slightly ban-worthy. Could also be my earlier post which garnered a lot of attention to the videos I linked. Anyway, weird that youtube would ban an "ordinary" home video or that user would delete it if it's a bot or a kid.

       (NOTE: As outlined there was an original post which got some attention on this sub but a troll made me shit myself and delete it. See:

       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so I needed a mental break and hadn't looked at anything since I got trolled, but this morning I got the itch again and started checking videos. I clicked this one(
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWTLiSU2VFY">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWTLiSU2VFY
       </a>
       ) and noticed a youtuber had commented
      </p>
      <p>
       "You are disgusting!!! Get off YouTube you sickos!!! IT doesn't take a genius to know what you mean when you make videos for children with pizza. Go back to your rabbit hole"
      </p>
      <p>
       Typical comment, definitely seen them before. So I checked the next reply which was in gibberish and said
      </p>
      <p>
       "m,j çağ ,,de,ş,.?Y. . B , b m ç,,"
      </p>
      <p>
       Which translates to:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm not sure what to say." So this is initially suspicious as it seems to make sense in response to the english comment. The problem is that I don't think anyone can trust google translate to  effectively translate thai as I personally have seen the same translation come up for completely diferent thai phrases. Anyway, I have found locations in thailand, dates, "buy," and other users have reported wierd translations. However, can't be fully trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, I go to the gibberish YT commenters channel. I find this video(
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBn-EpDZEvo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBn-EpDZEvo
       </a>
       ) which fits the same characteristics of the hundreds of other videos I've seen, maybe 1/2-1/4 are listed in my previous links(although many seem to be deleted now? Odd considering they're just home videos...). The characteristics are as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       -A date for the title, as far as I can tell it is the posting date.
      </p>
      <p>
       -A single or possibly two-three target focus in the video. Note that in the video I posted there are plenty of other children playing, even one that the filmer seems to know, yet the camera stays fucking stuck on the kid in the pink. Same shit for tons of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The ethnicity/language/nationality of the children being filmed ALWAYS corresponds with the channel owners name(i.e. juan pablo is filming a central American kid, korean a korean, etc etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       -They are short, never lasing beyond 3-4 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The videographer is mostly quiet, only interacting with the children when they need to offer direction or respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       -I have also seen a few videos of very old looking women/men. Never have middle aged people other than in a very odd video which was in thai and had a dude biking naked with a helmet on(9 secs in duration).
      </p>
      <p>
       So dig with me here. Let's focus on the gibberish comments first. There seem to be two prevailing theories:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.They are bots commenting to hide artificial view counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        They are children mashing keys.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       They are not children mashing keys. I have seen channel's with 50k+ subs actually respond to other gibberish comments. I have seen literal paragraphs of gibberish among 30+ comment threads, all by accounts from varying nationalities and ethnicity. So if these are kids, why are arabic, korean, etc... sounding channel names(if they were using their parents accounts) typing in english? Also, it makes no sense if you think about it. Have you ever seen this type of button mashing in any other kids video on YT? Go and look, it's exclusive to elsagate videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, next we look to the bot theory, the more compelling of the two. There is no doubt that these videos have artificial view counts. A user on the r/elsagate sub said they knew a channel owner and they would pay a russian based company to send them an initial set of 20k "real views", get it to certain point on the YT alogrithim, pump in another 20-40k of bot views and then it get's to a point where it trends enough that it auto plays for kids, ensuring it comes up on autoplay and creating a cycle of views. However, the comments are not artificial. Or at least not all are.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, look at how old the YT account(omer) with the video of the pink jacketed girl is. It's five years old. Many of these accounts were not created recently. In fact you'll find that very few were created in the past few days or weeks. If these were bots then I would assume we would see at least a decent number of very recent accounts. Next, why do these bot accounts not only have videos but videos of children which ALWAYS match the ethnicity/nationality of the account. Why do home videos which correspond with the channel. An "ultra-real" account meant to evade potential investigation into bot views+comments. Why comment in gibberish and not use real words then? Why not just fill them with videos that can be replicated easily. Also, it appears to me that there is an easily definable set of characteristics to these videos, as listed above.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the bot comment theory and the children mashing theory have MAJOR holes in them. There's more wierd stuff also. I did list it one of my earlier links but one time I found legit cp on a "bot" account. It was of a kid fucking tied up, naked, dirty and crying while what seemed to be adults surrounded him (hmmm....
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/us/inquiry-spreads-on-6-children-and-cult.html">
        http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/us/inquiry-spreads-on-6-children-and-cult.html
       </a>
       ). Add this to seeing YT elsagate channels responding to other users, videos of old women/men with the same format, finding locations IN THAILAND in the coded comments, etc. Not only that, one time I facebooked an english account commenting in gibberish which had this guys face clearly in his YT and found this white dude who had pictures with 7+ adopted kids from various ethnicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think that this is a thai-based human trafficking service which uses the comments either to buy/sell/auction or as a display for the international tourists who want to check out what they may be buying before they make the trip. I think that videos are run by the same people, the finders cult. The videos are part of the op they're running. Will post more when I can, super busy right now.

       My only question is why on earth would anyone engaging in any nefarious activity use a public video sharing service as a means of communication? Why not use hidden .onion sites? Even if theyre using every manner and means possible to hide their identity when posting why have such a public place to post? It makes no sense to give any point of failure in such an operation. Absolute zero sense.

       Well if they used a private website or forum, wouldn't that be a single point of failure? Anyone using it at all is now complicit. With YouTube, each video serves as its own point, with a hint of plausible deniability from just using the same video site that hundreds of millions of other people use daily. It's hiding in plain sight.

       I thought of that angle but it just doesn't really jive with me. These videos are not going unnoticed and the elsagate movement is starting to gain some serious traction so that transcends the "hiding in plain sight" notion once again into stupidity. Theres a tremendous difference between hiding in plain site and communicating in the loudest way possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be the equivalent of doing all of your open air drug transactions in front of a police station.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiding in plain sight still implies that youre hiding your actions just youre not doing them in the shadows. This hides nothing and is the definition of loud. Maybe my fault is in trying to apply logic to the kinds of trash that would participate in such activities.

       I'm the only one I know of that has looked at seemingly innocuous videos on gibberish accounts. Haha so technically the aspect I'm looking has gone un noticed. Not saying that validates my point, just highlighting that while the videos themselves have received tons of attention, the comments have generally been dismissed as bots or children. And I disagree about your concept of what hiding in plain site entails. I had to click through hundreds of videos to find what would appear to be simple home videos. The frequency, eerily similar characteristics of the videos and the lack of convincing counter argument are what lead me to this pet theory.

       Elaborate on the clicking through hundreds of videos that led you to your proof if you dont mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not sure if having to dig that hard to find these "menu videos" really backs up this theory or lends to discredit it. If it takes you that much effort to find these how would any other pedo actually navigate there?

       Did you click on my earlier posts linked above? I kind of explain it in those. So I one day decided to start clicking on channel users to see if they were bots or children. It was on this guys elsa channel "little boy adam". So I noticed that he replied to this one user who comment in gibberish, saying something wierd like "yay yay yay yay glad to have you back :)". The user had some videos with the characteristics I saw. So I was like wtf why is a clear human, who runs the channel replying to either

      <p>
       A. A child mashing a key board
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       B. A bot with a bunch of creepy home videos?
      </p>
      <p>
       This led to more clicking. Now just look at my initial three posts to see the links and more in depth explanation of the hit ratio, etc. It was actually pretty high depending on the channel I went on. Some channels had gibberish but no seeming activity on the user's commenting. Others, like little boy adam, had tons of repeating characteristics to their videos.

       hide in plain sight works better than encrypted shouldn't even exist at all traffic that someone might notice and wonder.

       I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted,  what you are saying not only makes perfect sense but does indeed happen.

       I’m wondering though if these are the pedos who are too dumb to use TOR, kind of like how some people buy/sell drugs on instagram etc. Instead of using onion sites

       Theres plenty of stupid people doing all kinds of illegal activity in stupid ways but again it just doesnt float with what Ive seen of this. Its not like you see an entire stream of a buy, transaction, or any dealing. If it was deals being done you see at most a few interactions between any two people. If this was just stupid people we see more and you wouldnt have any obfuscation with the  potential non-sense "code" and use of other languages that are responding to entire other languages.

       Possibly so there could be widespread communication? I honestly am more against the child mashing and bot theories than I am in favor of mine. This is my most educated attempt at solving it but there's so much to process it hard. Haha especially since r/elsagate is convinced it's bots or children and you get downvoted into the negatives the second you speak otherwise.

       People were wondering why there were elsagate vids of kids getting needles in their bums.  I tried to make the case... its the "perfect" excuse to advertise their naked bottoms without being banned on youtube.  Its all based on selling kids
