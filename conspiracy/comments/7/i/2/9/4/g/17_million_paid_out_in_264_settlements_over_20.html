    <div class="md"><p>Rather than being a distraction, Weinstein was a catalyst. The way the working press operates, in general, is that some specific development that happens to become big news will generate interest, encourage others to come forward with info if story is of that sort, and lead to most publications focusing on the same trend. Had Weinstein story not finally broken, none of this stuff would be coming out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem not to have any idea of what I actually just said. I didn&#39;t say that everyone who was sexually harassed will actually come forward, I said that it will &quot;encourage others to come forward,&quot; which is exactly what has happened, across a variety of industries, having already taken down two major national politicians just in the last week. You&#39;ve also apparently confused the total number of settlements with the total number of those that involved sexual harassment, which are a fraction of that total number. Many of these involve labor laws, medical/family leave, and handicap accessibility, as is noted in the report you got these numbers from. Contrary to your claim that there are 264 &quot;victims&quot;, there are actually 264 people - or less, if some of them won more than one settlement - who got the government to pay them off for some rules violation by Congress and their staff. Bottom line is that you&#39;re providing misinformation to a venue that already has more than its fair share of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, for a second, I mixed you up with James O&#39;Keefe and I was like is this guy accusing me of &quot;providing misinformation&quot;? Like am I being Punked right now or something? So sorry about that, and thank you for sacrificing your freedom for ours.</p>

<p>You are correct - I didn&#39;t notice that it involved other settlements. (I&#39;ll edit my previous comment to clarify.) I never said that you said &quot;everyone&quot;. I clearly was implying that if what you say is correct, there would be many more than there have been. These are the same two that have been kicking around for weeks. You also don&#39;t know for sure that most of the complaints specifically don&#39;t deal with sexual harassment. The pushback received by those who request the actual numbers would lead me to believe that it&#39;s not an insignificant number. I mean, isn&#39;t one more unknown more than enough to be demanding answers? Given statements by congresswomen and staffers, the problem is pretty widespread. My feeling here is that they&#39;re hoping people will refocus on something else and they won&#39;t actually have to air out their dirty laundry. Throw a couple of scapegoats to the wolves and back to business as usual.</p>
