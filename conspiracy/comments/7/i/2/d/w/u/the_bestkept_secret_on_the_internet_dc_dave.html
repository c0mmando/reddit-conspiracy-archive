       Pretty much the only time I see
       <a href="http://www.dcdave.com/">
        "DC" Dave Martin's
       </a>
       stuff on this subreddit is when I post it and I'd just like more people that frequent this sub to be familiar with his work. Martin is for my money the smartest and most incisive voice on deep state events on the internet and maybe rivaled only by James Corbett for volume and quality of analysis. Martin writes a weekly column on his website dcdave.com and the
       <a href="http://www.dcdave.com/column.html">
        archives of his column
       </a>
       are really a treasury of great work and are essential especially for anyone who is curious about the Vince Foster or James Forrestal murders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Martin is far more than just a column-writing pundit, though, as he is also a great
       <a href="http://www.dcdave.com/poet10/010824.html">
        political poet
       </a>
       and he has also written a pair of six-part essays on the
       <a href="http://www.dcdave.com/article1/961127.htm">
        Vince Foster
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.dcdave.com/article4/021110.html">
        James Forrestal
       </a>
       deaths that are bursting at the seams with beauty and depth and old school critical thinking. The Foster essay is really what convinced me that the case wasn't just a suspicious death but a political assassination but it goes much beyond that in scope. "America's Dreyfus Affair" compares and contrasts Foster's death in 1993 and the ensuing official investigations and media coverage with the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair">
        Dreyfus Affair
       </a>
       which occurred about 100 years before the Foster case in France which involved the false conviction of a French artillery officer named Alfred Dreyfus for treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Picking the Dreyfus affair to parallel the Foster affair might seem counter-intuitive at first glance as the basic facts of the two cases are quite different, one being a suspicious death and the other being a treason case, but the real story of both cases revolves around the societies and more specifically the media involvement in the respective investigations. This is illustrated beautifully at the beginning of part I of "America's Dreyfus Affair" with the following quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But the Dreyfus Affair...is not fixed in space and time. The combat of the individual against society, truth against deception, is specific neither to France nor to the end of the nineteenth century.
--Jean-Denis Bredin
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Whereas the Dreyfus affair and the Foster death were both papered over by the press at the outset, the power and ineluctable nature of the truth eventually burst the dam of lies in the Dreyfus affair after many intellectuals and journalists like Ã‰mile Zola continued investigating the case. Dreyfus' conviction was eventually quashed and his military rank and status were restored after it was determined that Ferdinand Esterhazy, another French officer, was the one who sold secrets to the Germans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Martin uses the Dreyfus case to illustrate just how corrupt and useless our institutions are as the media and law enforcement agencies involved in the Foster investigation in late 20th century America are revealed as positively feckless in comparison with those involved in the Dreyfus case in late 19th century France. It's worth noting that the France of ~120 years ago was by no means a paragon of justice and virtue but it is clear that the media of that time was much more willing and able to crack through the protective layers surrounding the truth. Martin drills deep into the double-dealing and guile of media figures who pretended to play the role of Zola in the Foster affair like Christopher Ruddy. Ruddy was an obscure reporter at the New York Post who gained notoriety by being one of the first mainstream journalists to actually spend some shoe leather investigating the Foster death by interviewing first responders to the scene of Foster's death and writing numerous articles about the case that called into question aspects of the official story. Ruddy's career arc is fascinating as he left the Post to work for

       suburban Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, a much smaller circulation paper, to within a few years being installed as the CEO and driving force of Newsmax where he is now a confidant of Donald Trump and an inside-the-beltway player. There are a few interesting instances of similar ascensions of media figures after they'd reported explosive stories on the Clintons, the most prominent being the conversion of
       <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/the-poisonous-politics-of-david-brock/">
        David Brock
       </a>
       from a reporter on the Troopergate scandal to head of Media Matters et al. These men are thus exposed as controlled opposition of some nature in Martin's chronicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The full extent of Ruddy's duplicitousness wasn't fully known at the time "America's Dreyfus Affair" was written in the 90's but Mr. Martin, almost alone among the milieu of critics during the time of the Clinton administration (with a few exceptions like the FBICover-Up.com team including Patrick Knowlton, John Clarke, and Hugh Turley), has continued digging into the Foster case and has published numerous columns chronicling Christopher Ruddy's

       , a Fox News competitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to note that as a fledgling writer and podcaster I have had the good fortune to make Mr. Martin's acquaintance in phone calls and emails. Mr. Martin has taken the time to offer his encouragement and insight to a random person like myself and I'd like to repay that in some measure by spreading the word about his work. He is on
       <a href="https://twitter.com/dcdave2u">
        twitter
       </a>
       and posts links to his work as it is published there. I think in part he is slept on because he doesn't really promote his work and his website's design is pretty retro but these to me just add to his charm.
