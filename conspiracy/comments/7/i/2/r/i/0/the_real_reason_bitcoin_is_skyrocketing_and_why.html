       We will soon see someone become the fastest trillionaire in history.  Why you ask?  Because Quantum Computing can defeat Bitcoin's SHA256 blockchains.
       <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/quantum-computers-kill-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-509053">
        http://www.newsweek.com/quantum-computers-kill-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-509053
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we place so much trust in Bitcoins is because right now, it would take a typical PC 3.17*10
       <sup>
        64
       </sup>
       years to brute force a wallet.  This pretty much translates into never.  But quantum computing changes the game.  Soon, due to quantum computers, 256bit encryption schemes will become easily crackable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter, the CME Bitcoin futures.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who don't know how futures work, it's just a contract to purchase something at an agreed price at an agreed date.  Say you own 1 bitcoin.  I go to you and say, I'll buy that bitcoin off of you in 1 month for $15K.   If you think bitcoins will be priced less than $15k after a month, then you would agree to the contract with me, right?  So we make the deal.  If bitcoins are worth $10,000 next month, I'm out $5,000 because I still have to pay you $15,000 for the bitcoin.  On the other hand, if bitcoins are worth $20,000, you lose $5,000.  Because you still have to sell me that bitcoin for $15,000.  Fair enough?
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, now here's the part that gets tricky.  The thing is, YOU don't have to actually have a bitcoin to make this contract with me.  So what would that look like?  Say you agree to sell me 1 bitcoin in 1 month at $15,000.  Let's say the price of bitcoins at that date is $10,000.  You just made $5k in profit.  Why?  Because you just have to go on the web, buy a bitcoin at $10k and sell it to me for $15k.  Bam.  $5K profit.  On the other hand, say the current market price of bitcoins are $20k.  Well, now you are out $5,000.  You have to go to the web and buy a bitcoin for $20k and sell it to me for $15k.  Loss of $5,000.  Congratulations.  You now know what "shorting the futures market" means.  It's simply selling something you don't own in the hopes that prices will be cheaper when you actually have to deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright, now we know how futures work.  So what's this got to do with the real bitcoin market?
      </p>
      <p>
       We've all seen the dramatic rise in the value of bitcoin this year.  It's astronomical.  Why is this happening?  There are literally 100 reasons people will give you for why this is happening.  And the truth is, all of them are plausible.  But here's what I think.  I think someone, or some govt, is driving up prices for a specific reason.  To short the bitcoin market using futures.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes bitcoins secure?  What makes your wallet that you have on your harddrive or USB drive secure?  SHA256 bit encryption.  The specifics of this encryption is beyond the scope of this post but suffice to say that it would take a long ass time to try to bruteforce guess the password.  What would happen if that password could be broken in a matter of week?  Simple.  Every blockchain currency, as well as all passwords you use, will become crackable.  Now, most servers, such as your bank's or your business, have a safeguard against this.  They only allow something like 5 attempts to be made before they let you try again.  But what about bitcoins?  Umm,.... nope.  You can bruteforce attack bitcoin wallets as much as you'd like simply because bitcoin wallets don't exist on your computer.  It exists in the ledger which everyone has access to.   You only have the password that allows you access to that particular entry on the ledger that proves that you have such and such amount of bitcoins.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you develop a computer that can crack SHA256 encryption in a matter of weeks, how would you use that to make money?  Simple.  Short the hell out of bitcoin futures.  Then release the news that you have a computer that's able to crack SHA256.  Bam.  The value of bitcoin goes to ZERO.  No, I'm not exaggerating.  The value will literally go to zero.   You just made more money than anyone in history in the shortest amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this isn't all speculation.  You can prove me wrong by observing the price of the CME futures over time once it starts trading.  Selling large amounts of futures will drive the price of the futures down and they will trade below market price (current price).  So, even tho 90% of the people think the price of Bitcoins will go up, it could trade at prices lower than the current market price.  This will mean that there is a huge seller of this futures.  It will prove my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this is not what's going to happen.  The futures price will trade at a significant premium (meaning higher than current market prices).  Why?  Because they're gonna drive this sucker to the max.  They're gonna make it go all the way up to $100k while the Quantum Computer is finalized.  Then, they will unleash the greatest trade ever known to man.  A trade that makes Soros' shorting of the GBP look like child play.

       I have similar fears about the quantum computer. Whoever has it first will be able to exploit so many different aspects of life that our entire existence will change. Especially so if quantum computing is held by very few and leveraged as a weapon.

       No.  I can't stress this enough.  Listen.  All other cryptocurrency will rise as bitcoin does.  The difference is, they will rise slower.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you BUY bitcoins, you are gambling.  If you mine bitcoins, then you are making money like no other.  There are plenty of other cryptocurrency that are not restricted to the vulnerability of bitcoins.  Buy those.

       At one point it looked like ASICs were going to take over, and they actually did... for SHA256 coins. But there are plenty of other algorithms that are mineable with GPU (and with some, CPU is still relevant). Their algorithms are coded to be ASIC-resistant, 'cause devs realized that they kinda spoiled the fun (allowing those with the huge investments to rise to the top, rich get richer etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       XMR (Monero) in particular is only about 5-10 times faster on a GPU than on CPU.

       just my opinion but since it just recently got allowed to be traded on wallstreet A) it's going to skyrocket
      </p>
      <p>
       B) wallstreet manipulates stocks to their benefit, raising prices with purchases and sales at just the right moment.

         Ethereum has had two major "hacks", better described as people writing scripts to be run on/with their blockchain that abuse the bad coding of the script-host itself. These people could easily be insiders who have an advantage (being able to read the code they're trying to exploit).

       I think there may be many implementation of security and features prior to a legit quantum computer comes out. However, if there is one being developed in secret by China, Russia, NSA/Deepstate, then for sure your scenario plays out and this will collapse the global markets/USD as well, it's the black swan event

       I wrote the above so that even someone with absolutely no knowledge of futures could understand what I was saying.  Yes, I know how futures work in the real markets.  I was a currency futures trader for a bank many moons ago.

       FYI - The CME Futures are not backed by Bitcoin. They are naked bets. I can't see it having an affect on the btc price, outside of the futures price. Long term it will bring more people to BTC = upward price movement

       It sounds like great insight on the surface, but the reality is that if quantum computers really were on the market we have a lot more than just Bitcoin to worry about.  That would make all encryption useless and governments would crack each others secret files, etc...there are tons of implications this will not happen in December.  Also there are Quantum resistant chains and bitcoin can be modified to be so.

       Never said it would happen in December.  I said the CME is launching the futures market in Dec.  Also, I specifically said they probably will rally the bitcoin to at least $100k before making it crash.

       The quantum computer theory aside, I also think the price is being driven up because people are going to short it heavily. The price increase may be happening without a concerted effort too.

       I agree. We don't know what's really happening.  But if you want to invest in cryptocurrency, look elsewhere than bitcoins.  I like Zcoin.  But that's only because I'm a huge fan of radiolab.

       What's happening is economy 101, the price is dictated by supply and demand, demand is climbing, supply not so much, eventually, because we can adjust to quantum computing long before it is a real life threat, we'll have to share them 21 million btc for 7+ billion people... $100k is still a joke, we'll jump that well within ten years and it won't be the end... and you my friend, will be in hot waters if you go ahead with this seemingly clever plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zcoin, or else, whatever passes the test of time will ultimately be priced by supply and demand against the btc or else gold standard (a coin with 21 million supply will price towards 1 btc, a coin with a 42 million supply will price towards 0.5 btc...), the fewer the coin, the more expansive it will become. I don't know when the market is going to digest this idea and adjust crypto prices, they still compare btc to a stock so it might be a while... but it definitely hasn't yet so there are opportunities to be had on small supply coins with secure networks.

       Kinda like back with the Tulip thing in Amsterdam. It is all over the news so everyone thinks if they buy a few hundred bucks in BTC, they will become millionaires.

       All cryptocurrencies are going up in value right now because of the craze, even the ones that are creatable with a graphics card on a normal desktop.

       Didn't say that.  I said buy the alternatives to bitcoin which are most likely gonna rise with bitcoins, albeit, not as fast.  If you like gambling, by all means, buy bitcoins.  I'm a little risk adverse so that's my style.

       We have quantum crypto algorithms ready to go. Quantum cryptography is going to be a hiccup as there are going to be plenty of people who are slow to adopt the new encryption algorithms, but major players like banks and payment systems will be ready immediately.

       There used to be a story about the Malaysian government's ongoing investigation into some kind of high level international economic corruption. They were catching flak because they wouldn't back down. But they eventually did back down -- right after their two airliners went missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be damned if I can find that story now.

       (It is NOT the 1mdb scandal. Curiously, that story floods the searches when you look for anything related to "Malaysia" and "economic scandal". Planned disinfo?)

       <p>
        Creating a quantum computer is a massive scientific and engineering challenge. As of 2016, the largest general-purpose quantum computers have fewer than 10 qubits. Attacking Bitcoin keys would require around 1500 qubits. Humanity currently does not have the technology necessary to create a quantum computer large enough to attack Bitcoin keys. It is not known how quickly this technology will advance; however, cryptography standards such as ECRYPT II tend to say that Bitcoin's 256-bit ECDSA keys are secure until at least 2030-2040.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a company called D-Wave which claims to produce quantum computers with over 1000 qubits. However, this claim has not been universally accepted, and even if it is true, this is a special-purpose quantum computer incapable of attacking crypto.

       My story is a common one. First heard about bitcoin when it was around $9. Had my card out, was going to buy 100 bitcoin for around $900. Decided against it, thought it was all going to go to shit and I was going to lose that money, which back then was a lot to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to now, I'd be a millionaire. But I don't really beat myself up over it though. Even if I bought them, I'm sure I would have sold them when they hit $100, or $500, or even $1000. Hell, I may have even sold them a month or two later if they doubled. Truth is I had so many times where I've had money problems without the last several years, it's impossible that I wouldn't have sold them at some point for far less than they are worth now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the "what if's" creep in every now and then, like I'm sure they do for most people who heard about bitcoin early.

       Just don't. Making crazy millions off bitcoin required an accident (finding a wallet) or predicting the future (which nobody can do).
      </p>
      <p>
       People said the same thing a few years ago when BTC hit almst $2000/coin and before it crashed to almost 1/10th its value and people lost their hides on it.

       You clearly have no idea what you are talking about since BTC reached $2000/coin only a few months ago (and never crashed, instead it went to $16000). Just so you know.

       It went from near $2000 to just over $300. That is called a crash. Then another round of pump and dump bubble started many months later.

       You are making things up. Bitcoin reached an ATH in 2013 of roughly $1200 on Mt.Gox (now bankrupt), then crashed back to $150. It never went to $2000 until a few months ago (2017) when it started exploding up to $16000 and more. Get your facts straight before displaying your ignorance on these boards. You have no idea what you are talking about and still you want to be right. This is what I call stupidity.

       What you’re not accounting for is that this is actually fixable. There’s already cryptocurrencies that are accounting for this that are quantum “proof” or even using quantum algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin could merely fork to a quantum proof blockchain or apply a quantum algorithm and this article is no longer possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure you’d be able to hack the old ledger, but if people stop valuing it and start valuing the new quantum proof fork instead Bitcoin and cryptocurrency lives on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin is kind of like a hydra, you can’t really kill it. Even as tech advances that can break it, so do solutions to fix it.

       It is prohibitively difficult to fork to something quantum proof. You would have to transition all wallets (somehow ensure 100% of people upgraded in a timely manner). Not to mention all the wallets that are lost, like the guy who threw out a hard-drive with thousands of BTC on it. No way to secure those retroactively.

       It is not only difficult, it's impossible to do 100% because every wallet with bitcoin has to be manually upgraded by the owner, which is never going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're really smart, you'll be looking at finding a bitcoin alternative which is approximately the same but quantum proof. I've done a quick bit of research and this is the only one I've found so far:

       yea I looked at IOTA but from what I could tell it isn't actually a blockchain and isn't really a currency and apparently has centralized control? I'm not 100% sure though but it seems a lot different to bitcoin

       It's definitely a lot different.  It's not blockchain.  It uses something called the tangle.  You essentially act as a miner when you initiate a transaction by validating 2 other transactions.  Your transaction is then attached to those.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as much of a currency as any other crypto.  They've just chosen to focus on machine to machine payments and data transfer because of the necessity for the network to perform a lot of transactions.  That leads to the centralized component, or coordinator.  At the moment, there is a node, the coordinator, that provides milestones, or check points, for the other nodes to verify that a transaction is legit.  The coordinator will be removed (and can be now although it's not suggested) when the network reaches a critical mass of transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of people (think miners) who hate IOTA.  I can't think of another crypto that gets so much hate on Reddit.  Do your own research though.  If they meet their goals they will be the next step in crypto.  Let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

       thanks, I have questions but I'm sure I can research the answers myself, the most obvious question being that if it's not a blockchain, how on earth does it stop double spend and my second question would be how can this relate to real life decentralisation of information spread instead of just relating to a cryptocurrency! that is a problem I would love to see an answer to but it also makes me think anything that isn't truly a blockchain has a real vulnerability.

       What do you mean by a backdoor key?  The SHA-256 algorithm is publicly available, and has been vetted by countless extremely smart cryptographers and security experts across many different countries and companies, as well as every hacker group in the world.  If there were a magic backdoor key it's extremely likely someone would have found it already.  Now granted nothing is impossible, but this probably isn't the attack vector to look for.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the whole point of open source, you don't need to take the NSA's word for anything, you can look at what the algorithm does and decide based on its own merits.

       And where in the world did you get that all modern cryptography is now invalidated from my previous post?  Hint, it wasn't there.  You just want to go to an extreme because you're one of those fuckwads who needs to strawman to win arguments at all costs.  I gave an anecdote why something that was considered super secure by all the expert cryptographers may actually not be and why throwing your weight behind the argument from authority may not be the best way to go about things.

       It's accepted because everyone says everyone else already "tested" it and that means boom, bam it's perfectly secure.  Just like the anecdote I provided.  No one is and will ever be funded to take on SHA-256 seriously.  If a backdoor is ever discovered, people
       <em>
        like you
       </em>
       will just shrug their shoulders and say "well, you should have moved to x, y, or z since SHA-256 is so outdated and you shouldn't ever trust the government anyway".

       Yes and the DoD invented the microchip, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't use a computer because "muh illuminati". There's also SHA-3 which wasn't invented by the NSA, and SHA-3 is pretty much the only way to do secure SHA-512, which will likely be the future of cyrpto, or some form of it, in the future.

       Well, you seem to be using the term "skeptic" properly, which most people don't do. Most people think skeptic = blindly believing the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you doubt there were any planes on 9/11, that's one hell of a theory requiring a good deal of conspiracy. (You may very well be right)

       It's not a book. Its a Q&amp;A that was conducted on AboveTopSecret Forum back in 2006 (I think), with someone claiming to be an Illuminati Insider.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that they knew everything about everything. And even scholars such as Michael Salla cannot refute anything claimed by The Hidden Hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a book. It's like 40 pages, when you print it out on paper though. But it's spaced out in Q&amp;A format. Very good read. Everyone on

       The OP wasn't talking about moving anything. He was talking about someone on the verge of building a quantum computer shorting the future value, and then releasing the fact that they CAN crack bitcoin and making a bunch of money when the value drops.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if a chemist was on the verge of a breakthrough turning something cheap like aluminium into gold, and being able to do it for dirt cheap (fantasy hypothetical situation, I know it doesn't make sense from a chemistry POV). They short the future value of gold. Then they release the fact that they can make gold for as cheap as aluminium. Hell, they can even release the exact process for free. The value of gold drops to almost nothing. The chemist becomes an overnight billionaire.

       Computing power is a powerful resource. There’s a reason Apple and Facebook have built energy independent data centers. All these companies are competing for processing power, and the same is try of nation states.

       Agree, but I do think there is a risk to short term BTC price due to the CME futures. The expectation is that institutional investors will short the fuck out of it because they can, and they know they can scare people by moving an artificial price, then buy up at the bottom.

       Bitcoin is not good because it has a censored community (r/bitcoin), it has been somewhat taken over by AXA insurance group. Taken in the sense that it's being ruined. Since two years it has got high fees and rising fees, and even Steam today stopped BTC payments due to the transaction fees.

       r/bitcoin is not the be-all-end-all Bitcoin community. I would say bitcointalk comes closer to being that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are tons of examples of co-opted subreddits that appear to represent a community, but the "true" or original members prefer a smaller community hidden via obscurity, or not having a public front at all.

       I'm not a shill.  I do know that r/btc is not perfect but it's a little better I would say. Bitcoin Core did not solve the problem that has existed since 2015. The price of Bitcoin also pumped so much in 1 month. About 6000 to 15000 now. More and more people are holding thinking that Bitcoin was meant for that. That's why the fork happened. You can even see proof that they do censor at r/noncensored_bitcoin. And there are also more bitcoin related subs other then r/btc and r/bitcoin.

       The theoretical futures market manipulator would still become a trillionaire though. Bitcoin futures contracts would be related to the current blockchain which would go to zero value. The new “Quantum-proof Bitcoin fork” would be an altcoin whose value is irrelevant to these futures contracts.

       I can only imagine that the futures contracts would have a clause in there for if the blockchain forks so that it would switch to the new one. Given that blockchains fork relatively often, you'd have to be a complete retard to do it if not.

       Even worse FUD in OP's post, Bitcoin by design is quantum resistant. If you are using Bitcoin as it was designed, you only use every address once. The quantum computer can really only bruteforce the private key for an address that was already spent from, as it requires the transaction and the public key to work backwards. Coins just sitting in a wallet aren't in as much danger as there is limited information in the blockchain to work from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the biggest "canary in the mine" so to speak are satoshi's billions sitting there with weaker encryption. If the markets see those coins move, then all hell will break loose.

       Your private key is not used though, until you spend from a public key or sign for a public key. In that sense, there is limited information.

       I don't directly see how. From what I understand, only the miners are concerned with finding nonces. You can re-use nonces, but the end result is hashed along with the timestamp, giving a different result. If someone can find the right nonces faster than everyone else to form legit blocks, then they will simply collect all of the block rewards and fees, while driving the difficulty upwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be wrong, but I don't think nonces are involved at all with client spending from a public address.

       So all the value and accrued wealth on the old ledger becomes useless? This would tank the value of bitcoin and defeat its credibility for people already invested? Sure it wouldn't kill the mechanism of bitcoin but this short selling strategy would still be extremely profitable due to the extreme loss of value. It wouldn't kill the cryptocurrency but it would still make a shit ton of money.

       It is prohibitively difficult to fork to something quantum proof. You would have to transition all wallets (somehow ensure 100% of people upgraded in a timely manner). Not to mention all the wallets that are lost, like the guy who threw out a hard-drive with thousands of BTC on it. No way to secure those retroactively.

       what they don't understand is that ECDSA can theoretically be broken by quantum computers. But, sha256 is a hashing algo, and not a asymmetric key pair generation scheme and hashing algorithms are not factorizeable  which means you can't break them with Quantum Computers. This is why Satoshi  didn't use the public key for an address, but a double hashed (SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160) which you use as a public "address" not a public "key" and the only time your key hits the blockchain is when you spend it. So if you use HD wallets, you are not at risk even with quantum computers.
      </p>
      <p>
       now , if the break ECDSA, internet security as a whole will be broken and we'll simply upgrade to a quantum resistant key pairs which there are plenty of candidates.

       Forking bitcoin is a huge folly.  At what point do you fork?  Why would anyone agree to your arbitrary date?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin Cash pulled off a successful fork because the need was there,  date was announced well in advance and there was a HUGE marketing push to spur interest and get critical mass adoption.  Trying to fork Bitcoin after the public revelation of a 256 qubit quantum computer is going to be chaos.  Everyone will be arguing over the date and there will be millions of forks.

       It depends. If Bitcoin becomes compromised somehow by advancements in quantum computing then there would be an obviously motivation for people to move over, and it would be all over the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said it wouldn't be chaos. There are already many cryptocurrencies that quantum proof, and arguably Bitcoin won't be compromised so easily.

       Wouldn't even be that hard. Quantum algorithms for breaking hash functions can currently only give a quadratic improvement. You'd just need to use SHA-512 instead of SHA-256, and then it would be secure again.

       Until quantum computing surpasses 512 yeah. Ultimately it would make more sense to implement some other kind of quantum proof solution long term but who knows what kind of advancements in quantum computing already exist.

       Interesting theory, but as you mention, shorting requires finding a buyer for your futures. Who would buy bitcoin futures? If you think the price will increase, just buy them immediately, much safer and not that difficult.
      </p>

       In the real world, futures work because barrels of oil are hard to move. Bitcoin doesn't have that limitation.

       Yes but these futures have no delivery. It's a betting platform with no actual settlement in btc. It's not a trick or anything. It's all on the cboe and cme website. But I agree.. could happen that the already mature 30 billion a day real crypto market won't care about the side bet market with no actual crypto settlement.

       That's an odd statement since most futures are settled in cash.

       Correct. And bitcoin futures will be cash settled to. Nobody will ever need to deliver or receive an actual bitcoin

       no, the same logic applies to all commodities. Can you go buy gold? yes. Where do you put, how do you secure it, how will you sell it? All those steps need to be accounted for. Additionally, futures, ETFs and the like allow you go access commodities in units not equivalent to the actual commodity itself. Your one share isn't = to one barrel of oil for example. Furthermore, futures trading opens up the door to
       <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/university/futures/futures4.asp">
        leverage
       </a>
       and this is a game changer here in terms of how quickly we can see the price (and volatility) rise for stock in bitcoin. In essence, you can have market control over a large portion of futures contracts with very little capital to back that that up.

       Does not work that way.  The address and private key are matched via an algorithm that can be replicated on any computer.  If you have the private key, you can easily compute the public address, and verify any signatures made by the person with the private key to that address.  The hard part backward computing the private key given the public address.... but QComputing could make that easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no one computer counting the number of attempts to "hack" a public address.  Anyone can try, but because it is so hard, it is assumed to be safe.  Thus, you could put your computer to the task of "hacking" a public address for the private key without ever connecting it to the internet.

       That makes sense. You can have two private keys, right? I have two through GDAX. That should make the guessing game much harder for a quantum computer, right?

      <p>
       I'm just confused. If you're right, then all bitcoin private keys can be brute forced right now, with enough luck and enough time, with no additional safe guards. That doesn't seem right.

       Not really.  It's sort of like hacking a combination lock, although like million's of times more difficult, so much so that it's impossible for all practical reasons.  Its something like billions of computer years to find the private key given today's computers.  QComputers theoretically changes that guessing game so that is more like less than a month of QComputer time.

       From my understanding, unless you actually hold your private keys then you are relying on factors outside your control. Firstly it could get hacked like Mt.Gox or NiceHash but even if the security itself is flawless, there are other obscure ways they can get hacked- like a rogue employee etc. For negligible amounts the average mom+pop investor could use exchange wallets but from my understanding letting other people hold your private keys defeats the whole purpose of crypto

       It certainly isn't zero threat. Cracking ECDSA today could probably net you a few percent of all Bitcoin in existence. It would also let you run amok on the banking industry.

       But wouldn't even the threat of ECDSA being possibly compromised send the price of bitcoins into a nosedive?  I guess the point I was trying to make in the OP was that bitcoin futures are being set up so that shorting it becomes possible.  Right now, there's no way to short bitcoins.

       Sure... Only, you're missing a few important things:
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't even need to be a quantum computer. Could just be a cryptographic break in x percentage of wallets generation of a cryptographically secure prime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't even need to be planned. This whole thing is mania. Can you name one thing that bitcoin legitimately makes purchasing easier? Like maybe drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Futures require a counter sign. That's the way the contract actually work. How are they going to convince people to counter sign futures for currency with no exchange value?

       I don't know why you are downvoted. Uncle Sam gave a free pass to every criminal in the USA by allowing you to pay taxes on BTC. All you have to do is buy as much as you can in cash (easier in Asia) and then report it as income. You can say you paid $0.03 for them they will never check the ledger.

       That's why it's so good. Monero is more secure if anonymity is what you really want. But we are talking about money laundering and large international transfers and most importantly liquidity... What else would you want to use? btc is perfect.

       The futures settle is USD. That's my point. Why are you going to undersign a future for BTC? It's extremely speculative, it's clearly economic value negative, and it's not a hedge against environment considerations.

       It's a nightmare. It goes against what the futures market was intended for... It's a shitty 0 sum forex play, but without the legal protections.

       If somebody develops a quantum computer they are not going to attack Bitcoin with it. This makes most forms of encryption vulnerable. Such new tech would be saved for later use, not for scamming some billions. The entire Bitcoin marketed is to small to be relevant for geopolitical powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Bitcoin will at some point be a major factor in "inside trading". When a country, for example, would push some kind of positive/negative regulation or major players like Amazon start using it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion it is obvious has a high likelihood to raise its value drastically over the next time, but the counterpoint is total loss so the expected value is unclear.

       Yes, if we get enough computing power to compromise RSA256 encryption then all hell would break loose.  My post above is just one use of it that happens to be 100% legal way to get rich.   Point is, you don't have to actually crack Bitcoins and steal to get rich.  You just need to let the world know that you have a supercomputer capable of it.

       I'm not going to disagree with your overall assessment, but just want to clarify something. Bitcoin wallets are secured through elliptic curve cryptography, while the SHA256 secures the block chain and is used for mining. I think the main weakpoint is the elliptic curve cryptography. Quantum computers are known to break elliptic curve cryptography, so this could be what really breaks bitcoins value.

       While this may be true, there are also other factors.

      <p>
       USDT (Tether.io) is a cryptocurrency that was created by BitFinex to pump BTC. They claim that their cryptocurrency is backed by 1:1 USDT : USD but they can't prove it. They have also sold more then $800,000,000 of USDT and you can't sell them back to Tether.io.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people also are buying Bitcoin just to hold it thinking that the purpose of Bitcoin is to be only a "store or value".
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin (inclduing r/bitcoin), has been taken over by Blockstream, AXA group. They are crippling Bitcoin by rising the fees and telling everyone the solution is coming to lower fees (which was supposed to be out in 2016 but isn't).  That's why Bitcoin Cash was created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, quantum computers could bruteforce a Bitcoin account as it consists of 12 Random English words. And if you use a Bank, you are using USD, money printed out of paper with no proof-of-work. Inflation happens because more dollars are printed. Bitcoin Cash has a limit of 21 million.

       They are not Bitcoin contracts, they are futures contracts traded on the CME priced in USD. They have a future settlement date that has to be honored. There is no way not to to cash out a futures contract.

       This is illogical. The most you can make in a short is double your money. Whatever the price is when you short, the potential gain is exactly the same: double your investment. So it makes zero sense to drive up the price in order to short.

       Thank you. Was thinking the same thing. Betting $1 million on shorts when the price goes from $1,000 to $0 will earn you as much as $1 million on shorts when the price goes $20,000 to $0.

       Exchange futures work on margins, not full value.  Each contract is worth many times more than the margin required. So you can short exorbitant number of contacts with a relatively small investment.

        Now, most servers, such as your bank's or your business, have a safeguard against this. They only allow something like 5 attempts to be made before they let you try again. But what about bitcoins? Umm,.... nope. You can bruteforce attack bitcoin wallets as much as you'd like simply because bitcoin wallets don't exist on your computer.

       Bitcoin Futures contracts will be bet-on and be settled in US Dollars.  I bet all that's going to happen is a week or two increase in price volatility and then the price of BTC will go up even faster when they have to pay all the winners that bet on BTC going up IN DOLLARS.  LOL.

       Agreed. Very important point. Settlement is in USD.  These futures could just end up as gas on the nuclear fire. I hope some smart crypto people put together a USD futures market that settles in btc. That would be a very interesting feedback loop.

       Funny enough, USD has remained so valuable due to it being what oil is traded in. I wouldn't be surprised if people who want the USD to remain strong, are seeing how oil will be not nearly as valuable just before the electric car revolution. They need something else to tie USD to that they expect to have long term value and staying power. Just a thought.

Because you just have to go on the web, buy a bitcoin at $10k and sell it to me for $15k. Bam. $5K profit. On the other hand, say the current market price of bitcoins are $20k. Well, now you are out $5,000. You have to go to the web and buy a bitcoin for $20k and sell it to me for $15k. Loss of $5,000. Congratulations. You now know what** "shorting the futures market"** means. It's simply selling something you don't own in the hopes that prices will be cheaper when you actually have to deliver.

       , which is prohibited by the SEC (even though its sometimes done, just like other illicit/quasi-legal financial schemes).  Shorting means borrowing the shares and selling options against them, or making sure that the shares are available to borrow before "selling" options against them.  If you sell puts or calls when you don't own the underlying security a brokerage will freeze a certain amount of your capital up in case the trade goes bad.

        Under Regulation T, the Federal Reserve Board requires all short sale accounts to have 150% of the value of the short sale at the time the sale is initiated. The 150% consists of the full value of the short sale proceeds (100%), plus an additional margin requirement of 50% of the value of the short sale. For example, if an investor initiates a short sale for 1,000 shares at $10, the value of the short sale is $10,000. The initial margin requirement is the proceeds $10,000 (100%), along with an additional $5,000 (50%), for a total of $15,000.

       I've been in the market for over 30 years.  Whether you are selling puts and calls or shorting stocks you are going to be forced to put up collateral beforehand.  Futures are electronically cleared.  No brokerage is going to let you gamble with their money.  Learn something and perhaps you won't embarrass yourself.

       What makes you think Goldman Sachs or Morgan won't be behind the trade?  Currently margin requirement for Bitcoins are 44%.  You think investment houses don't have billions, to invest in a sure trade?  And that requirement is for individual investors.  Investment banks have much less stringent margin requirements.

       As for your 30 years in the market, good for you.  But that could mean managing your retirement account to being Warren Buffett.   I myself was a currency trader for a Japanese bank for 6 years, then was an equities arbitrage and futures trader for an investment bank.  "Learn something and perhaps you won't embarrass yourself?"  You've never submitted a post in your life.  Why don't YOU learn something and post something original that people can enjoy instead of posting 4000 karma points of comments that's just condescending and quite frankly, not even valid.

       Actually Bitcoin is a occult ritual to open hell, when all the BitCoins are unlocked the doors will swing open.  Earth will get sucked through one piece at a time.  It why we haven't found any aliens, all intelligent live goes extinct after hitting the information age.

       There is no doubt that the price of btc has been being pumped un-organically. The fact it can be shorted like stocks soon is terrifying. The weaker hands will be leveraged out of the market, and banks will control most of the supply. If you're into cryptos you understand that you no longer used btc to pay for things, its just not convenient anymore. Long transaction time and high fees. Steam just stopped accepting this a day ago. But because people are jumping on this train because of fomo, this bubble is getting bigger and bigger. I don't doubt that the price will become an easy 22K in the Q1 of 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the price correction comes, people will jump off the wagon faster than they jumped on it. The fact is, most of the people investing right now don't give a damn about the utility or what it means to have something decentralized, they just want to make a profit. Look at how many new coinbase accounts are being made daily, the most entry level way to get into btc.

       More and more people want sound money, aka like how the dollar used to be tied to gold before the banking cartels took over.  They also want control over their money as they don't trust the banks.  Bitcoin is similar to gold in the sense that there is a finite amount that will ever be created and nobody can make more out of thin air (like the dollar).  This makes the Bitcoin deflationary by design, like gold, and it is secured by consensus making the ledger unhackable.

       the GBP was detached permanently in like the 1930's ( as was most of the world. ) and even though america didn't permanently lose its gold backing until the late 60's it had suspended the gold standard a number of times by then ( and inflated the dollar against the gold standard too. )

       At the moment I think bitcoin is tulips.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was onboard for a while years ago, but eventually sold. The act of buying them convinced me that waiting for confirmations means they are inconvenient to use over other methods when available. I don't see people using them to buy things, only to buy them because they think they will go up in value.  This makes them risky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen the bubble inflate and crash 3 times now. I have seen how it works. When the graph is going straight up, it is all over the news and when normal people are talking about bitcoin it is time to sell, because a crash is incoming. The best time to buy is when people are despairing over the price.

       Seriously, bitcoin started to be slow and extremely costly in everyday use for about 2 years or more everyday use - yes, I used it almost daily in 2012 - 2014. It was always about speculation - damn even the name Bitcoin is a joke, Satoshi Nakamoto is a joke - especially if you are a Slavic speaker - it's a word play of a person who "namotava"/reel people ;D

       If you know anything about quantum computers even if a real one existed near half of it's calculations turn into errors. A quantum computer can't even accurately count to 10 without getting half the numbers wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ask a quantum computer to add 2 + 2 = ? it would probably tell the answer is 5 because 2 + 2 can equal 5 in quantum mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quantum computer might be decent at housing a sentient artificial intelligence but it would be absolutely horrid at any kind of math.

       Kinda funny, a couple minutes prior to reading this I felt compelled to jot down a series of events that I see playing out.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's going to be a perfect storm. After record run the stock market will crash. Money pouring into it bitcoin will keep rising. Physical currency greatly devalued. Severe economic depression. The poor become decimated. People with bitcoin are alone at top. But TBTB control bitcoin. After economic collapse they render it worthless. TPTB alone at top ruling over society.

       Futures don't actually work like that.  The example in my post is a simplified principles of a futures contract.  In real life, no commodity actually changes hands, just the money does.  If I sell you a futures contract I would put say $1000 in to a margins account and you would too.  Think of margins as an escrow account.  Now, as prices of the contract changes daily, the amount of change is taken from the losing account and put into the winning account.  So, I sold you a contract right?  So I'm hoping it will go lower.  You bought a contract, so you're hoping the price goes higher.  Say the next day, the price of Bitcoin futures rise by $100.  The exchange (CME) would take $100 from my account and automatically put it into yours.  So at the end of that day you would have $1100 in your account.

       IBM can already do this if they really want to. Their quantum chips are out available to the public just yet but their quantum API has been available for over a year ( and they also let you purchase time to run your quantum programs on their hardware. )
      </p>
      <p>
       Also on the flip side of this sha256 is still non trivial even on a quantum chip, atleast not until p=np ( and in al, honesty that's not going to happen )
      </p>
      <p>
       And the entire short sell while the stock obliviates has a fatal flaw. You cannot make money on a short sale if the stock gets driven to zero. The market for the stock still needs to exist when you pull out otherwise you just end up owning all the bitcoin andyour bank account is still empty.
      </p>
      <p>
       F a country was to make its national currency bitcoin prior to tephe crash this might still be profitable because you will effectively own a country at this point ( even though the currency has been devalued to near zero they still will have goods that they produce )

       Ok excuse my ignorance, so government/person X is developing a quantum computer, they are currently saying they will sell Bitcoin (they don't have) for X amount at a certain time, then just before this time, they release the quantum computer, encryption is fucked, Bitcoin plummets and they buy up the Bitcoin and sell it for the previously agreed higher price?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, can you see when these future agreements are meant to expire? Thus giving us the timeline of when roughly they will be announcing the quantum computer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if the 256 encryption is then defunked by the quantum beast, surely, even higher grade encryption is also buggered as eventually it will be broken, so the ramifications are far larger, all encryption is now screwed, on everything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't Bitcoin just have to add 2 stage verification or a limit on password attempts to solve this?  I thought about this the other day, my domain names are more secure with 2 stage Google authentication than my bank account within Is just a password...

       My reckoning is that Bitcoin is going to be crashed by TBTB. Governments hated bitcoin when it came out, the best way to make an example is let it get big and have people put money in and then crash it.

       There are two Quantum Resistant alternatives to Bitcoin.
QRL which is a foundation coin, like Bitcoin, uses XMSS which is approved by NSA. NSA stopped using 256SHA a while ago. 
IOTA which is a platform uses TANGLE is also QC resistant. Everything else uses standard encryption 256 or 512. Upgrading these blockchains is not as straightforward as people are making out and trying to convert everyone from a legacy wallet will be a nightmare. QC is coming at some point, so it is worth doing a little research so that you understand how your assets could be affected.

       SHA256 is NOT breakable via quantum computers. Only ECDSA is (via Shor's algorithm). ECDSA is what is used to generate the private-public key pairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum computing means:
      </p>
      <p>
       You can implement Shor's Algorithm in order to break ECDSA (i.e. from a public key, obtain the private key, which will allow you to drain the coins assigned to that public key).
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT the public key is NEVER exposed, UNLESS you sign a message using that bitcoin address, or spend from that address. If you follow the basic recommendation of NEVER reusing addresses (which many wallets like Electrum do), your public key is NEVER exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the bitcoin address, you only get a "shortened checksummed version" in a bitcoin address (shortened via
       <strong>
        hash
       </strong>
       functions SHA256
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       RIPEMD-160).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hashing is
       <strong>
        not reversible
       </strong>
       or breakable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hash
       <strong>
        ANYTHING
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is built-in to Linux OSes and OSX (via openssl or shasum).
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Get the SHA256 of a single word? Sure.
       </li>
       <li>
        Get the SHA256 of a 4GB DVD ISO? Sure.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's basically just a "checksum", and it is NOT reversible.
      </p>
      <p>
       A SHA256 hash is only 32 characters long. If you CAN reverse that, I can give you the 32 character hash of a 4 GB DVD ISO in a single chat message, and you can REVERSE-ENGINEER the ENTIRE 4GB ISO from those 32 characters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this isn't possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR:
       </strong>
       Quantum computers are only a threat to people who reuse addresses.

       Never said the entire world wouldn't be in jeopardy if SHA-256 is defeated.  I'm sure a calamity would ensue.   I'm just scripting out a scenario where the futures market could be used to make someone unbelievably rich.  And legally at that.

       And as I said, SHA-256 is NOT encryption that you can reverse. If it is "broken", then
       <strong>
        collisions
       </strong>
       become possible to create (which as I explained, quantum computers
       <strong>
        CANNOT
       </strong>
       do).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no existing algorithm to break it (unlike with ECDSA, which can be broken Shor's algorithm, which can only be practically implented via quantum computers).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the way they have discovered how to generate collisions in broken hashing functions, is that they can find
       <strong>
        collisions
       </strong>
       , but these are random strings. That is only useful for entering systems that perform "hashed-value validation" (e.g. password-entry)
      </p>
      <p>
       It hasn't ever been intricate enough that a collision can be crafted in such a way, that it would not just be figuring out any random string that hashes to the same 32 character hash, but rather a properly-formatted string.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, they have to generate a collision that generates a block with VALID blockchain transactions, and just the variable "nonce" number is figured out in order to craft a SHA256 hash that falls below the difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, ONLY mining is affected by a SHA256 exploit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum computers can only break ECDSA not SHA256. There is NO KNOWN way to break SHA256 even if you had an actual working quantum computer.

       Consider this hypothetical alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States has had working quantum computers since pre-2008 and has been actively suppressing the development of this technology in the private sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nation State Actors don't need money. The OP might be right, in the end someone could very well cash out and have plenty of capital to fund any number of off the books black projects, but that is a happy bonus and not fundamentally the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If SHA256 is broken it won't just affect Bitcoin. All forms of digital encryption in use right now will either be broken outright or called into question. Your VPN? Worthless. Your open source VeraCrypt? Worthless. TOR? Hah!
      </p>
      <p>
       The ability to break encryption would allow a Nation State to spy on everyone, see every dark transaction in the Blockchain, see every international banking transaction, know where every dollar is going, what every communication says, and know the true identity of everyone who would otherwise be hidden. There is no one they could not hack. There would be no defense, particularly as you believe you are protected and anonymous. It would be a treasure trove of intelligence and influence that would be worth far more than mere money. Here is what the operation /might/ look like:
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 1, Creation: Introduce TOR and Bitcoin. Create the Darknet and let criminal markets take root. Secretly track everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2, Transaction: Conduct drug trades online using Bitcoin, establishing it as a unit of value while also making money to fund other projects through drugs and money laundering. Business as usual for the CIA, just in a new type of market and even more anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3, Profit: Track every move made and build dossiers on the people using Bitcoin. Arrest no one and allow criminals safety. Maintain the illusion that the encryption and safeguards are effective. Bust people only when they screw up in very public ways that cannot be hidden (i.e. Ross Ulbricht). Quietly take out dangerous terrorists and those who fund them without allowing it to reach the mainstream media... or just as quietly fund them, if they serve our interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 4, Trojan Horse: Promote Bitcoin in non-criminal arenas as an alternative to money for people who are subversive or otherwise enemies of western capitalism. Let it take root in the hands of rival Nation States as the difficulty to mine the currency increases (by design) to an inevitable level where that is the only possible way to maintain the system. Allow rival powers (China) to believe that they control the currency and the digital ledger. Allow them to try to weaponize it against western economies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 5, Preparation: Shutdown all the major Darknet players and markets. They have served their purpose. Bust them through lesser agencies who will be used as pawns. By this point, the cryptocurrency no longer requires the existence of a known criminal network to maintain its assumed value. It is also at this time that legislation will be introduced to tax gains made on the sale of Bitcoin, which will further legitimize the currency and divorce it from its shadowy roots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 6, Endgame:
      </p>
      <p>
       Variation 1: Allow Bitcoin to continue until it reaches a point where the difficulty of mining it is so prohibitive, it is no longer worth it even for large interests. Introduce an alternative cryptocurrency (or many) that are appealing enough that people begin to make the switch. This works even better if the alternatives are introduced by rival powers who believe the new currencies are under their control, unaware that we can read and even hack their Blockchains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Variation 2: If quantum technology is on the horizon and it is no longer in our interest to suppress it entirely, cash out as the OP suggested. This would be a major stroke against several possible targets. In this scenario, a private company belonging to an allied foreign power would announce that their quantum computer could crack the Blockchain. They will also introduce quantum encryption to a 1028 QBit standard (which is far below our true capability) to safeguard our digital infrastructure from this same technology. Such a company, for example, could be D-Wave: (
       <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/home">
        https://www.dwavesys.com/home
       </a>
       ). It is at this time that the agencies can clean house and crush anyone they please, if they are so inclined, although this is not their function and I suspect this would not happen to any great degree. A new revolution in quantum computers takes place and western economies boom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other variations are possible depending on how things play out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a fun hypothetical. That being said, anyone who uses such technology simply to make a quick buck is a fool and has no imagination, unless we are talking about one guy in his garage who somehow invented a working quantum computer and is also somehow able to pump the market on his own...
      </p>
      <p>
       And if your are wondering how any agency on Earth could process this much data, that is where quantum artificial intelligence come into play, but that is a much more complicated subject for another post.

       I'm a real,simpleton when it comes to bitcoin and basically most financial crap, but I saw long ago that bitcoin is a scam to get people to buy in (lots of middle class or lower spending all they have on a huge gamble) so they can crash the whole thing and run off with the money.  Its going to be a crippling blow in the already nasty class war that's started.  Just my opinion.  Feel free to explain why I'm wrong.  Just try to be civil.

       Valid concern.  But the whole appeal of Bitcoins as well as other cryptos is that they use SHA256 hash to validate transactions.  It's a process that can not be reverse-engineered or hacked.  The people who rob bitcoins are those who hack in to bitcoin dealers servers and steal their private keys.  It's the fault of the company, not of the way bitcoin works.

       Have you ever heard of a hard fork?  The very second this happens a roll back happens and new protocol implemented.  The hacker will get jack shit.

       "So, if you develop a computer that can crack SHA256 encryption in a matter of weeks, how would you use that to make money? Simple. Short the hell out of bitcoin futures. Then release the news that you have a computer that's able to crack SHA256."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they were "able to crack SHA256" or even if they demonstrated that they did crack it, which they couldn't, but hypothetically, even IF they did.....a roll-back would happen and new quantum resistance protocols would be implemented thru a hard fork.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your hypothetical is a moot point as it isn't going to happen and is completely able to be nullified even if it did.  Nobody is going to care if somebody threatens to do so.

       I think shorting / investing in the bitcoin etf would be easier for 99% of the people out there.  Most people already have ameritrade or investors edge or another type of stock platform they are already familiar with.  I buy and sell stocks on a daily basis but after looking into crypto I just didnt like the whole process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hearing about people losing their keys, or their websites where they stored their coins delaying the process is a big turn off.  Especially for people who invest serious amounts of money.  I know my bank and the laws the bank has to follow.  I can get real time updates.  I hear about people making a bitcoin purchase and waiting days to process or pay large transaction fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a stronger inclination to think that many investors will put money in the cryptocurrency etf and short it.  The government wants bitcoin to fail, and so do banks and hedge fund managers.  They will make many small bitcoin transactions to clog the system, pump articles about its instability and governments could simultaneously ban the use of bitcoin or declare bitcoin users have to pay taxes on all transactions or face fines/charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       The governments and corporations would wipe the wealth from the one group of people who are actually trying to resist them.

       Well written post. A probable future. Whether or not it is because of a quantum computer or some other news, the price will crash after such a quick rise. Everyone knows that there are people out there gaming the system and fueling such buying frenzies, just so they can short the price.

       By that logic, once you've purchased your futures, shorting the market by releasing information about your beastly computer that can crack sha256 would tank the value of the coins, but how does that earn you money? If you were to wait till the value tanked to buy, then you'd have to wait till the market regained value to sell (which it never would if the security is busted.)

       Umm, I think you're getting confused.  When you purchase a futures contract, you make money if the price goes up.  This is often described as a "long position".  When you sell a futures contract, you make money if the price goes down.  It is call a "short position".
      </p>
      <p>
       Futures is a zero sum game.  Every dollar you make means someone lost a dollar.  All futures traded on an exchange is margin based.  That means, everyday, your account will be deducted from or added to the amount of money your contract has gained or lost.  Like a poker game.  Everyone around the table has a set amount and winner takes from the losers.

       I'm not claiming to know a thing about finance, and I thank you for taking the time to engage and correct me. the following is no argument at all, I just simply would like to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say that if you sell low, you make money.. so I have X amount of things, each with Y amount. The market goes down, I sell my X(n) things at market value, X(n) = low number. The market then goes up again, (although this wouldn't happen in his scenario, since his computer proved sha256 obsolete and so nobody would ever use it again, that product would die immediately..) how do I make my money?

       You should do some research first before you post something like this. You keep mentioning SHA256 encryption. First of all, SHA256 is NOT an encryption algorithm, its a hash function. Big difference there as Hash functions are one way functions. These Hash functions are what is used to generate a Bitcoin wallet address by hashing your wallet's public key. These same hash functions are also used on the Blockchain. All that needs to be done is SHA256 will be replaced with a quantum resistant hash function which already exist today. Some these are P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, and P2WSH. The Bitcoin protocol can easily be updated to utilize these schemes instead of SHA256.
      </p>

       It is naive to think that this much would be invested into Bitcoin and blockchain technology if it was at risk of being this easily manipulated as you describe. Don't you think the Bitcoin developers have already considered this? If there was an imminent threat to the Blockchain and Bitcoin by Quantum Computers its extremely likely that the specifications would be updated way ahead of time. In my opinion it's more likely that the price will be manipulated by a pump and dump approach by the WallStreet whales after futures are available.

       For the foreseeable future, yes. Bitcoin is open source so there is no reason that it cannot be improved upon even if the current developers on the project are no longer involved. See

       This isn't speculation. There are commercially available quantum computers. You can buy one today. Universities have them. They're just not very fast.

       If that's what you can buy commercially, imagine what is available today that you can't buy.

       My conspiracy is that the CME is introducing the futures exchange so that the original owner/creator of bitcoin who owns the ~1 million BTC can sell the coins and extract the value of ~$15B.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second those original coins move, everyone will be aware as it'll be headline news. This will cause major fear, uncertainty, and doubt, which will make extracting value from the 1 million BTC difficult as any sign of selling of those coins will tank the price.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private transaction wouldn't make sense either, because whoever receives the coins is going to be left holding the bag in the scenario above.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you do is bring in the CME which provides the liquidity needed and ability to sell BTC without physically moving assets. You slowly start accruing short positions on futures and find someone to bankroll your mark-to-markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have amassed enough future contracts to liquidate your position, you fail to close out your short positions by purchasing offsetting long futures positions, requiring you to deliver the asset.
      </p>
      <p>
       No problem, now you settle all your futures contracts from the original wallet (at least, will originate from the original wallet) owning the 1 million bitcoins, and collect the sales price on the contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all 100% legal and enforceable too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may not spell the end for Bitcoin, but it certainly would cause panic.

       Moore’s Law is a historically-reliable rule that the world’s maximum computing power doubles approximately every two years, meaning computer hardware advancement, like general human advancement through history, grows exponentially. Looking at how this relates to Kurzweil’s cps/$1,000 metric, we’re currently at about 10 trillion cps/$1,000, right on pace with this graph’s predicted trajectory: So the world’s $1,000 computers are now beating the mouse brain and they’re at about a thousandth of human level. This doesn’t sound like much until you remember that we were at about a trillionth of human level in 1985, a billionth in 1995, and a millionth in 2005. Being at a thousandth in 2015 puts us right on pace to get to an affordable computer by 2025 that rivals the power of the brain.
So on the hardware side, the raw power needed for AGI is technically available now, in China, and we’ll be ready for affordable, widespread AGI-caliber hardware within 10 years. But raw computational power alone doesn’t make a computer generally intelligent—the next question is, how do we bring human-level intelligence to all that power?

       Bitcoin, in its current state, can be made quantum resistant with HD wallets. My Ledger Nano S has this feature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worst case scenario, Bitcoin would have to change its algorithm to SHA-384. All that is required is a fork to change its PoW (proof of work) type.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also remember reading that there's a way to send a 'signed' transaction with Ethereum that's quantum resistant (too lazy to look up the specifics).

       That's incredibly interesting, and the implications go far beyond bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only nitpick:  people don't typically take delivery of futures, they are settled in cash.  I think at one time someone tried to take advantage of the discrepancy in the physical and paper markets for precious metals and take physical delivery to settle their futures contract, but they weren't able to do it.  If you're trading bitcoin futures I doubt many, if any, would be able to deliver.

       Also have your Saudi/LV post saved. This one on BTC is awesome too. You should post it on r/Bitcoin or r/BTC but i think they will ban you if you do.

       I think there may be many implementation of security and features prior to a legit quantum computer comes out. However, if there is one being developed in secret by China, Russia, NSA/Deepstate, then for sure your scenario plays out and this will collapse the global markets/USD as well, it's the black swan event

       Computing power is a powerful resource. There’s a reason Apple and Facebook have built energy independent data centers. All these companies are competing for processing power, and the same is try of nation states.

       It is prohibitively difficult to fork to something quantum proof. You would have to transition all wallets (somehow ensure 100% of people upgraded in a timely manner). Not to mention all the wallets that are lost, like the guy who threw out a hard-drive with thousands of BTC on it. No way to secure those retroactively.

      <p>
       And where in the world did you get that all modern cryptography is now invalidated from my previous post?  Hint, it wasn't there.  You just want to go to an extreme because you're one of those fuckwads who needs to strawman to win arguments at all costs.  I gave an anecdote why something that was considered super secure by all the expert cryptographers may actually not be and why throwing your weight behind the argument from authority may not be the best way to go about things.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's a very active computer security community with endless blog posts, conferences, forums, white papers. Pretty much every form of information you could possibly want to consume. If you want to know why you should trust SHA-256 feel free to check it out.
       </p>
       <p>
        No one is asking you to blindly trust anything, but not understanding something isn't a reason to mistrust it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's accepted because everyone says everyone else already "tested" it and that means boom, bam it's perfectly secure.  Just like the anecdote I provided.  No one is and will ever be funded to take on SHA-256 seriously.  If a backdoor is ever discovered, people
       <em>
        like you
       </em>
       will just shrug their shoulders and say "well, you should have moved to x, y, or z since SHA-256 is so outdated and you shouldn't ever trust the government anyway".

       No matter how much power that machine has it still takes about 10 minutes for a Block mined and BTC to be distributed.

       It is not only difficult, it's impossible to do 100% because every wallet with bitcoin has to be manually upgraded by the owner, which is never going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're really smart, you'll be looking at finding a bitcoin alternative which is approximately the same but quantum proof. I've done a quick bit of research and this is the only one I've found so far:

       There used to be a story about the Malaysian government's ongoing investigation into some kind of high level international economic corruption. They were catching flak because they wouldn't back down. But they eventually did back down -- right after their two airliners went missing.

      <p>
       I'll be damned if I can find that story now.
