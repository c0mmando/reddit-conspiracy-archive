<p>However netnuetrality is NOT a trump issue. Trump himspef hasnt even comeout against it. Vno an okld 2014 tweet doesnt count) and in the past when isises have come up therehasalways been debateallowed. For example people still discuss whethersessions is good or bad.</p>

<p>The mods have somehow make their own decision to stop discussion of this isue despite the fact that  Trump hasnt come out for or agaisnt it.</p>

<p>And yyes he picked ajitto head the fcc but thst doesnt mean he understsnds or agreeswith this issue or thst he is getting good info. presidnet Trump never pretendedto be an expert on the internet except to ssy the usa should not have shifted controll of domian regustration to an internetional body.</p>

<p>Of course, as with many things, he doesn&#39;t even appear to understand what net neutrality <em>is</em>. </p>

<p>He plainly appears to think that &quot;net neutrality&quot; means you have to be &quot;neutral&quot; on the internet, politically. Which is all kinds of wrong. </p>

<p>Not a ge eral 2014 anti obama tweet before he waseven a candidate.</p>

<p>I agree President Trump doesnt understand the internet. Very few people older than 50  or younger than 30 do.</p>

<p>Thats why it is so important that thezdonald venue isnt taken over by comcast and verizon shills becuase people in the Trump Administration do look there for information and discussion sourcing.</p>

<p>How the fuck do you know what he&#39;s really being told?!  You&#39;re getting creative here and adding details in an effort to paint trump as the ultimate force for good.  </p>

<p>Let me ask you this:  which is more likely?   That trump just doesn&#39;t give a fuck and let&#39;s whatever happens happen to net neutrality?   Or that a small group of &quot;trusted advisors&quot; got together and lied to the president about net neutrality, and NOBODY 8N THE 100S OF PEOPLE THE PRESIDENT TALKS TO DURING THE DAY CORRECTED HIS STANCE ON NET NEUTRALITY?   You&#39;re just assuming that he cares at all, you&#39;re assuming he was told something false, and you&#39;re assuming that nobody corrected him when he talks about net neutrality. You&#39;re making a lot of assumptions and doing a ton of mental gymnastics just to keep up your image if trump as a crusader for justice.  Use occams razor here.  </p>

<p>When we talk about mental gymnastics in this sub,  your above comment is what we&#39;re talking about.   I knew you guys were brainwashed,  but DAAAAAAMN!!!  You think he let&#39;s reddit dictate his policy,  when he does something you don&#39;t like you just assume someone has lied to him instead of admitting he just doesn&#39;t care.  This is all sad, really.  How did you become so brainwashed to think that trump is a &quot;god emperor&quot;?  How did you get tricked into thinking trump is infallible? !</p>

<p>Even here on conspiracy people call each other shills and although I know they used to hand out bans over it they seem to be a bit more lax now and I think the community kinda deals with it. I&#39;ve heard people on topminds or whatever say that if you went against Trump that some mod on here would ban you but I haven&#39;t had anything said to me and I&#39;m openly anti trump. </p>

<p>There&#39;s been a lot worse in here than &quot;shill&quot;-mark, but the mods are pretty quick to remove such comments and ban users, though a lot of the time it&#39;s very subjective.  I&#39;ve had a few removed which, honestly, I don&#39;t think should have been from an objective standpoint.   </p>

<p>As far as the sub&#39;s mods being &quot;pro-Trump&quot;... Well  that&#39;s just quite funny, because if anything, the supermajority of mods here tend to lean left.  Even moreso since the whole flytape incident.</p>

<p>There are a few, whom I won&#39;t name here, whom are quite obvious in their left-wing zealotry.  Many, many times I&#39;ve seen them remove right-hand submissions while extremely similar ones on the opposite side of the coin are approved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I disagree with the ban, net neutrality is severely misunderstood. Reddit turned super against it and that&#39;s a real question as we&#39;ve seen corporations blatantly manipulate Reddit.  The repeal of net neutrality will most likely not see any difference in consumer pockets, but it may manifest in ISP&#39;s charging media services for their use of bandwidth. It makes sense on the business level. They&#39;re using more of the highway so they charge more....</p>

&quot;Free speech for all&quot; if you go with the narrative, censorship and silence if you simply offer a different opinion. That sadly holds true for most Trump supporters too, you can&#39;t have a rational discussion with one without them raising their voice, etc.

    <div class="md"><p>Read it, it sure does seem to be writing into law protections on the internet.  Here is an excerpt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FCC 15-24</p>

<p>21.
The bright-line bans on blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization will go a long way to
preserve the virtuous cycle. But not all the way. Gatekeeper power can be exercised through a variety of
technical and economic means, and without a catch-all standard, it would be that, as Benjamin Franklin
said, “a little neglect may breed great mischief.”24 Thus, the Order adopts the following standard:</p>

<p>Any person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet access service, insofar as
such person is so engaged, shall not unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably
disadvantage (i) end users’ ability to select, access, and use broadband Internet access
service or the lawful Internet content, applications, services, or devices of their choice, or
(ii) edge providers’ ability to make lawful content, applications, services, or devices
available to end users. Reasonable network management shall not be considered a
violation of this rule.</p>

<p>22.
This “no unreasonable interference/disadvantage” standard protects free expression, thus
fulfilling the congressional policy that “the Internet offer[s] a forum for a true diversity of political
discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.”25
And the standard will permit considerations of asserted benefits of innovation as well as threatened harm
to end users and edge providers.</p>

<p>This is the way the Cult is supposed to work, and it&#39;s the reason Trump was put in power.  It&#39;s a powerful tool, and we see it happen over and over again. If you question the acts of the people in power, then you lose the sense of belonging that have defined many people for the last couple years.

I&#39;m not going to go through the trouble of copying it and re-adding the links and stuff, but if anyone&#39;s interested I made a post earlier outlining, with sources (like actual laws), how none of that is going to happen and having the FTC regulate the internet will be better than the FCC, just look in my post history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Trump supporter myself, I voted for Stein, but I am glad Clinton didn&#39;t win. I started hanging out there when I noticed how much activity there surrounding the Wikileaks releases. I knew they banned people, so I was always careful to not say anything disparaging about Trump. While commenting there, I bit my tongue if I couldn&#39;t justify agreeing with his policies of a given topic, many of which I find abhirrent. Earlier this year, I was banned for saying I agreed with Trump saying we need universal healthcare. I even included links to the articles where he said these things. Trump has praised universal healthcare systems many times, he even admitted the government would pay to cover everyone and that we&#39;d save money. But that wasn&#39;t good enough. I think they just realized I was not a Trump supporter. Or maybe they ban all Trump supporters who want universal healthcare? I wonder what percent that is... A majority of people want it overall, there&#39;s gotta be some people who saw Trump talking about universal healthcare and decided to go with him over Hillary who famously claimed it will &quot;never EVER come to pass&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree one of the main reasons many people voted for Trump was his unusual position on wanting eseential healthcare for everyone.</p>

<p>Many people who were against Trump and for libertarians or jeb corporatiists have become moderators there i think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So for all the people who dont undeerstand...like this critic...</p>

<p>In the bill &quot;the net&quot; refers to the http and other packet protocols which make up the transmission data of the internet.</p>

<p>And the bill says no wire owenr isp like comcast may pick and choose which packets to trasnmit and censor but must make all legal packets the customer wants available to them.</p>

<p>Facebook and google are NOT the net. They are one content provider on the net. The customer can choos enot to use them and ...becuase of net neutrality lawd...chooseinstead to recaive packets from myspace or duckduckgo .  Once net nuetrality falls comcast will no longerbe required to deliver duckduckgo packets if the customer selects them but could instead choose to only make available packets from ComcastSearch!  .</p>

<p>It apprars no one who wasnt a programmer during the 90&#39;s actually understands the internet.  </p>
