    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory.</p>

<p>With the increased talks of Alien disclosure, it seems that there is a conditioning period occurring. It’s almost like they are preparing us for the day when they finally tell us. But...why?</p>

<p>Space and the military. </p>

<p>There is an audit occurring within the DoD, and that the audit that was occurring during 9/11 is connected. The main reason for the audit is to explain trillions of dollars that have gone missing. Money doesn’t just disappear. </p>

<p>I believe that they are building weaponry and advanced spacefaring craft. </p>

<p>...but why the booms? Is there a war occurring in orbit? Possibly. Is it us vs us? Or is it us vs them?</p>

<p>I think it’s us vs them, hence the extra Alien disclosure talk. But here’s my theory:</p>

<p>The US Government, along with the governments of the world, are aware to the fact that aliens exist. Some leaders are told so, and some are not when the rest deem the individual not fit. Like a “we know aliens exist” club, and you’re not invited because you’re dumb//if you can excuse my second-grader analogy.</p>

<p>I believe world leaders in the know, including figures within our government, haven’t filled DJT in on it, as they believe he isn’t capable to keep it a secret, or that he is incapable of helping. </p>

<p>As for the booms. It’s possible that the booms are the Aliens attempting to make contact, or that we are fighting them off from above, for reasons unknown to us. Are the aliens trying to free us from our current human-based-governance control? Or are they legitimately trying to kill us? Are they wanting to help? Who knows.</p>

<p>The booms very well could be biblical, as I’ve heard that we are to hear loud noises from the sky before our demise. Who knows. Maybe the Bible was written with Alien contact in mind. Who the fuck know. </p>
