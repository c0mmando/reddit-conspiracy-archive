I figure it&#39;s all for the next election - the alt right seems to dislike muslims more than they do Jew&#39;s and supports the move.
I assume his religious fanatic fans just see he did something good for Jerusalem and assume it was a nice religious thing.
Posting this because this was the conclusion i came too and i&#39;m curious to see if there&#39;s i&#39;m missing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s thousands of christian denominations. It was inevitable that a few of the major ones unique to america would become subverted by the zionist aipac lobby. In greek orthodoxy we don&#39;t support israel at all although there is an interest in sites located in israel due to their religious significance. Greek tv was also historically very critical of israel&#39;s actions. </p>

<p>For example, while msm in america would show you clips of israelis running to bunkers greek tv would show you clips of dead children and destroyed homes which really put things in perspective when you could consume both sides and make a clear decision of who was in the wrong. Christians in america who don&#39;t have ties to the region are at the mercy of the zionist media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all.  It&#39;s to wipe out radical Islamists.  I am working on a post that details the entire theory, but basically, Trump did this for one reason.  To make the terrorist backing extremists lose their shit and attack/expose themselves.  Mark my words, the extremists are not taking this lightly.  They will soon launch a terrorist attack that will rival 911.  </p>

<p>Trump is fulfilling another campaign promise.  He&#39;s done with ISIS and is now moving to his next target, Wahhabists.   But you can&#39;t invade or attack other nations without a good reason.  Trump&#39;s gonna thwart that attack and use it as justification for solving the middle east problems for good.  This means taking out both the Arab string pullers as well as factions within Israel.  Anyway, look for my post soon!  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t usually comment on the Middle East - way too many unknowns.</p>

<p>But I think this move by Trump is probably part of a grand strategy to produce another Camp David accord, this one bringing in the Saudis and the Israelis. In such a scenario, the Israelis may have insisted on an &quot;opening move&quot; like recognition of Jerusalem. And it could be that we already saw the Saudi request go through after the Bin Salman coup - unlimited military purchases and expansion of their business connections with USA. This gives both parties room to maneuver their people into accepting a big peace deal. The effect would be to isolate Iran and its Shiite proxies which seems to be everyone&#39;s priority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alt-right hates Jews more then anyone </p>

<p>Trump did this because he really thinks he can get a two state solution now that the KSA government is backing it and is supporting Israel </p>

<p>Trump wants the peace process going, in exchange he will back the Sunni coalition of states against Iran </p>

<p>For America this can gain us a lot in the region, particularly if the Sunni coalition continues to grow more unified and stable an embraces western reform, which most of them are </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I do, but I also can read </p>

<p>The most damning condemnations came from Norway and Sweden, not the Middle East(except Iran)</p>

<p>The BDS movement really only is supported by Europeans and their markets- few universities have boycotted Israel in America, virtually none in the rest of the world, including the Middle East </p>

<p>Europe is the source of any Jewish and anti Israel sentiment and it has been for years </p>
