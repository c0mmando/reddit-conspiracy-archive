       You're obviously deeper into this than myself, so maybe you can answer this. Wiki leaks can only distribute information that they are given, is that correct? As far as I know they don't have any spies on the payroll, they don't go out and collect information themselves. Is it possible that Russia, China and Iran have less published about them because of tighter control of sensitive data? There's also a language barrier to consider and I would assume it's more hazardous to your health to leak from any of those countries. Just my two cents.

       I don't know that they actually do. They have a more closed society in general but they're still behind the US in terms of security technology and practices.

       Language barriers I don't think are an issue. Wikileaks can get things translated, I don't think that's an issue.

       Hazardous to your health, I don't know about that either. There's a reason Snowden got the fuck out of the US as soon as he could.

       So cryptic codes that you have no way of knowing the underlying meaning are enough to sway your opinion? How did you conclude Assange is compromised based on a few tweets with hash codes?

       Well asking for 'proof' will get you nowhere here in r/conspiracy. Why do you ask for my answer, dispute my opinion, then treat me like I am the source of all the info? Maybe my opinion formed as a result of all actions taken around the October time frame. Im not gonna sit here and submit my knowledge to you to be torn apart. This is not a conversation as, by your own admission, you dont have any conclusions to share with me.

       So you'd rather read faulty conclusions than engage me in a conversation about what I know?
      </p>

       As for disputing your opinion, this is how a conversation works. You say something, I have the right to ask questions about things I want to verify, find more about, or dispute. Sure, you have the right to not to answer them but at least be honest about now knowing it all and just running with a theory.

       Try not ripping parts of sentences out of the context. Are your arguments that weak so that you have to resort to word play?

       I haven't concluded anything about Assange being influenced/pressured by someone or that his information is false. What I have concluded are that some arguments were based on assumptions and those aren't good enough for me; hence, I keep asking questions. It's fine if you don't have the answer. Neither do I. I'm more interested in understanding thought processes of other users.

       Why do you trust the public so much?

      <p>
       Based on what's being shared not only here but in other forums and on my PR working experience, I am strongly against doing such a thing. Most people aren't properly education in how to evaluate such things. A common tactic is to batch many problems together and spin them as an emotional problem. It buys you time, invites attacks of other parties which then can be used against them, and opens up a possibility to shift the blame on the other guys. I've seen this happen in many places and I'd be willing to bet all my savings this would happen in this case as well.

       So why did you want to admit all evidence to the public for them to decide? Also why did you quote "trust the public"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was never pretending the process is open [whatever that means] and transparent. Anything I implied was only to lead the conversation to forward. I understand that having more information about one of the sides than the other will raise eyebrows and will be spun. That's what I'd do because it's just that easy. In fact I've done just that quite some time ago while working on a case. Wasn't too hard. Any disparity can be manufactured into false evidence even if the amount of information is inherently true. All I'm trying to say what if the circumstances Assange found himself in regarding the available information is true? Sure, I might be wrong but the least I can do is give benefit of doubt.

       I understand you're saying that, and I'm saying I don't care about hypothetical situations. The actual situation is that Assange is a liar, he's made it clear he has an agenda
       <em>
        to which
       </em>
       transparency is subordinate to, and he's made it clear that he uses Wikileaks to further that agenda. I suspect it of him for a long time, but his DM's to Trump Jr. sealed the deal and that was when he definitively
       <em>
        forfeited
       </em>
       the benefit of a doubt.

       I remember reading about Assange planning releases of information weeks in advance. It's all about maximizing the impact and not muddying the water.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's not transparency if someone with an agenda gets to choose who gets exposed and who doesn't
       </p>

       I am confused about your definition of transparency. Can you please define it?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Once you introduce a curator of transparency, then you've just added a new, obscuring layer.

       But someone will have to be the mediator of the information because that's how sharing works. I don't understand you.

       Do you have evidence that he is releasing info for one group and holding back info on the other? What would make you satisfied that he releases info fairly? Equal bits of info per week/month/year/decade? And how to we gauge the "value" of the info being released to be certain it's fair?

       Is this a reasonable request on your part? Wikileaks' internal processes are decidedly untransparent, I wouldn't be able to prove it beyond a doubt without actually hacking them myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The circumstantial evidence is strong though. Wikileaks has been operating for more than a decade, and has taken almost no swipes at all at some of the most obviously corrupt regimes out there (Russia, China, Iran, for instance) while consistently attacking left-wing-controlled governments in NATO countries, leaving far-right parties alone.  The only right wingers they've gone after are Erdogan in Turkey, but it's a rather conspicuous coincidence that it was right around the time Erdogan was making overtures for Turkey to try again to join NATO.

      <p>
       It's impossible at this point, Assange has already made it clear he wouldn't even if he could. To quote Wikileaks' twitter DM's to Trump Jr.:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "If we publish them [tax returns] it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality. This is the real kicker. That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing about Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won't be perceived as coming from a 'pro-Trump' 'pro-Russian' source, which the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That right there tells me that they actively strategize about how to curate releases to create a false impression of non-partisanship. They are not trustworthy. Not only are they biased, they
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       they're biased, and they actively try to hide it
       <em>
        through their leaking practices
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That is to say, their leaking practices are
       <em>
        subordinate to
       </em>
       their political agenda.

       Because he publicly claims his work to be non-partisan, yet twitter DM's with Trump Jr. show he deliberately schemes ways to appear non-partisan as a smokescreen. In short, he's been objectively dishonest about his intentions, and trustworthiness is a very fragile thing.

       This seems unreasonable to you? People like the idea of a transparency-focused organization like Wikileaks. They like finding out what's behind the curtain. However, if wikileaks is partisan, that means they're only ever going to pull aside half of the curtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       People want to see what's behind the whole curtain -&gt; People would want another Wikileaks-type organization if they felt Wikileaks was unwilling to pull aside the entire curtain.

      <p>
       Again, I think this is a reasonable assumption? If I had damaging information on Trump, who would I sooner send it to: someone who I believe is non-partisan, or someone who I beileve supports Trump? I mean comon, this seems pretty simple, what's so nutty about this assumption that the perception of non-partisanship is going to affect what people try sending to him?

       When did I say he did? I'm simply pointing out that he
       <em>
        could

       if he thought he could get away with it, and that he probably
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       because he has the motivation to. Don't try to transform this into me saying he already has, that's a strawman. I never once said he already has.

       I don't "trust the public", I trust myself, not elites who process information and then tell me conclusions without showing me the evidence for them.

       <p>
        Based on what's being shared not only here but in other forums and on my PR working experience, I am strongly against doing such a thing. Most people aren't properly education in how to evaluate such things. A common tactic is to batch many problems together and spin them as an emotional problem. It buys you time, invites attacks of other parties which then can be used against them, and opens up a possibility to shift the blame on the other guys. I've seen this happen in many places and I'd be willing to bet all my savings this would happen in this case as well.

      <p>
       PR thrives on selectively hiding and publicizing information to manipulate perceptions. This is exactly why I want to see it for myself. I don't trust elites to make the call for me.

      <p>
       I haven't concluded anything about Assange being influenced/pressured by someone or that his information is false. What I have concluded are that some arguments were based on assumptions and those aren't good enough for me; hence, I keep asking questions. It's fine if you don't have the answer. Neither do I. I'm more interested in understanding thought processes of other users.
