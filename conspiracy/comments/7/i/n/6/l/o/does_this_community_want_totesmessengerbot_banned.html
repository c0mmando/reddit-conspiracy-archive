       I, for one, think that we should be alerted when a thread is X-posted. I argued this for over a year and was told that totesmessengerbot was disabled because it could leave the sub open to accusations of brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had a fairly organic experiment with this- after the Las Vegas event, totesmessengerbot was enabled. Only recently it was banned again. I didn't see or hear of any brigading that resulted from this sub during the months that the bot was enabled. Has anyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I feel that it is important that folks know who is "participating" in the conversation. I'd be willing to go back to (as our lurkers call it,) my "hall monitor activity" of alerting a thread in the comments when it has been X-posted, but I would prefer we let the bot do the work.

       The problem is that voting and commenting on np links can get you shadowbanned. And maybe I'm wrong, but my gut tells me the people in this sub would be much more likely to face the consequences then those linking here.

       I didn’t realize that, I’m not super familiar with all the rules. I guess I should read those to make sure I’m not in violation. I just always assume that because my actions are never malicious intentionally, that I’m not breaking the rules.

       Because this community belongs to the users as much as the mods. As I've stated in the OP, I was given the reason that we didn't want to be open to accusations of brigading, but it has been shown that that isn't an issue.

       I like TotesMessengerBot.  I think it is good to know what posts r/TopMindsOfReddit x-post right in the thread.  It also gives other community created subs exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole argument that it opens our sub up to accusations of brigading is really silly to me considering what TMOR gets away with.  I have not seen a single r/conspiracy brigade and have experienced TMOR brigades on multiple occasions on r/conspiracy where posts/comments of regulars are down voted to like -40.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the only downside is that TMOR causes people to feel bad.  People can decide whether they read the TMOR threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I wonder why TotesMessengerBot is currently banned.

       Every totesmsgr I saw from TMoR I went over and scorched earthed them.  That lasted a few weeks til they banned me.

       I like the bot so we can torch TMoR but also don't mind forgetting they exist.

       I'm OK with that. I think it's important to see how people outside of the community interpret what is said. Obviously TMOR is going to be more critical than an unbiased observer, but I still think it's valuable.

       No, I think it is absolutely vital to being able to identify when a post/conversation/discussion/debate is not only being watched but influenced by groups that link to this sub for whatever reason they may have.

       It really only serves as a way to let people know they're being mocked, so if knowing that is so important to people, sure use totesmessenger.

       I think most of you are paranoid and overblowing how much brigading and bot use goes on here.

       I'm not "worried" about people that say not nice things. I feel that knowing who is influencing discussion, even passively, is critical to understanding the tone of the conversation.

       We fight anyway. Your comment is evidence of that.

        Why didn't you just ask the mods directly?

      <p>
       Because this community belongs to the users as much as the mods. As I've stated in the OP, I was given the reason that we didn't want to be open to accusations of brigading, but it has been shown that that isn't an issue.
