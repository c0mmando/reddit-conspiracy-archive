       Before, I never thought anything of it. I thought it was a ridiculous theory. Sure, maybe Bush let the planes fly into the buildings, but pulling the trigger on 3000 lives, sealing their fate?
      </p>
      <p>
       I never really gave it much thought, because how could it be? I thought we were supposed to unite together as Americans and fight the bad guys. But how could the bad guys be Americans? Its just something your mind can't wrap around. And I think the same is so for most other Americans. How could someone do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's clarify: the owner of WTC7 asked for permission from the insurance company to pull the trigger?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that the motive for this theory? Is it the same motive among all 3 buildings? Was one motive hiding evidence? Was it to fulfill the plan of taking out WTC so it had to be done no matter what? Did they want to destroy certain offices for certain purposes located in the buildings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please help me understand better. Now that so much time has passed, I think people can start waking up to the truth that has uncovered itself.

       Good question...here's your answer from God Almighty himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelation 13:9-10 (KJV)
      </p>
      <p>
       9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can accept that Almighty God is a Black man and that the white man is responsible for all the water, air and crop pollution...promoting homosexuality, LGBTP(p is for pedi now!) and basically fucking up the earth....stealing all native people's land and natural recources to benefit themselves....then there might be a place for you....
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah 14 1-2  (KJV)
      </p>
      <p>
       For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

       Cool. Thanks for the info. Good to know I can take an active role in enslaving my own race. Couple of follow-up questions if you don't mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Are Jews 'white'?

        <p>
         How could someone assist in their every day lives?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are there any public examples of white people doing the right thing?

       No problem
      </p>
      <p>
       Are Jews 'white'? 
Hell no. Jew is short for the Tribe of Judah. The Prophet Jeremiah describes what the ancient Jews looked like...
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 14:2
      </p>
      <p>
       Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black
      </p>
      <p>
       King Solomon was also from the tribe of Judah. Here he describes himself in the Song Of Solomon...
      </p>
      <p>
       Song Of Solomon 1-5 KJV
      </p>
      <p>
       I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem
      </p>
      <p>
       How about Koreans? Not the ones you see on TV. All the lands of China, Korea and Japan were once inhabited by Negritos (look it up) though....they are also remnants of the lost sheep of Israel!
      </p>
      <p>
       Dark Indians? The Original ones forced way down south...Siddis or untouchables...yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could someone assist in their every day lives? Let them know who they truly are...Most of them have know idea of their true nationality. They need to repent (come back to) and pray to their God!
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there any public examples of white people doing the right thing? No. Everything you know and think is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Job 9:24 KJV
      </p>
      <p>
       24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked
      </p>
      <p>
       All your world leaders worship Satan(if you don't know yet, you will soon)....So saith the Lord God Almighty Power Of Israel!

       No planes hit any buildings on 9/11. This is obvious with the Pentagon, where they can't even show you a picture of a plane hitting the building even though there should be a couple dozen angles of surveillance footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       A hollow plane which flies at (greater than) top speed into one single solid massive steel support column, if you imagine one standing freely in an open field, will be torn asunder and horrifically sliced lengthwise like a cooked carrot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet on 9/11 we are told that the hollow aluminum passenger planes penetrated several such steel towers, which were supported by horizontal steel trusses filled with concrete. And that they did this without even slowing down on the way in.  It's totally physically impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are shown something so absolutely physically impossible as this on television, it cannot be real.
      </p>
      <p>
       And rest assured there were not and cannot have been "thousands of eyewitnesses."

        A hollow plane which flies at (greater than) top speed into one single solid massive steel support column, if you imagine one standing freely in an open field, will be torn asunder and horrifically sliced lengthwise like a cooked carrot.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A couple of issues:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Top speed" as you call it is not the maximum speed achievable, but the maximum speed an aircraft can
       <em>
        safely
       </em>
       fly - that is, before stresses induced in the structure risk causing failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the pilot is going to crash the plane anyway, he's not concerned about whether the speed might cause structural failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next is Newton's Third Law. 'For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction'.  The same amount of energy that was used to tear apart the structure of the aircraft was also dumped into the structure of the support columns. Neither of them could withstand that amount of energy without failing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why both the aircraft
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the columns were destroyed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And that they did this without even slowing down on the way in.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bullshit. Low qualilty video footage of the impacts is not a good source for the measurement of sudden changes in velocity over extremely short periods of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       500 miles per hour is equal to 739.2 feet per second. Filmed at 30 frames per second, an aircraft travelling 500 mph would travel 24.64 feet every frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each WTC tower was 207 feet 2 inches wide. That means that an aircraft travelling at 500 mph would take about 8 frames of 30 fps video to travel the full distance through a WTC tower. That's less than 1/3 of a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, the aircraft decelerated from 500 mph to 0 mph in less than a second.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        It's totally physically impossible.

       No, you just don't understand physics.

       What we were shown was completely possible. Your problem is, you're ignorant enough to fool yourself into thinking you have knowledge.

       There are rebuttals worth responding to, and then there are ones like this. Newton's 3rd Law is precisely why we know the footage was fake. Thinking that equal and opposite forces imparted to two objects would destroy both objects no matter their composition is like saying if you throw a beer can hard enough at a tree it will crumple the can and destroy the tree. It's such a basic misunderstanding that I can only feel sorry you wasted so much effort typing so many words that miss the mark completely.

       Nope. That's the problem with people like you. You think you know what you're talking about, but you don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter which is moving and which is stationary - the result is the same either way. The result, however, is not what you imagine. There are real physical effects that can be calculated. For example, a 757 hitting a building at 500 mph would hit with the same force per square inch as a point blank shot from a .50 caliber rifle. These are the bullets that can punch through an engine block.
      </p>
      <p>
       The frontal area of the fuselage of a 757 is 17,210 square inches. Imagine 17,000 .50 caliber bullets hitting the side of a building at the same time, all within a circle 148 inches in diameter, and then you'll start to appreciate the sheer force involved in this sort of impact.

       If you fire that beer can at a high enough velocity, it will crumple until it can't be crushed any more.... and punch a neat little hole all the way through the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, the force of the impact was far greater than the steel columns were designed to withstand, by several orders of magnitude. The aircraft cut through them like a hot knife through butter... but were utterly disintegrated in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think that 120,000 pounds of aluminium would simply vapourise into a cloud of harmless smoke, but even if the entire aircraft turned into liquid at the moment of impact, it would still be 120,000 pounds of liquid hitting the side of the WTC at 500 mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that would have no affect on the building, you're a total idiot.

       Pentagon was a missile, anybody could see that. Also the hijackers were reported to barely fly a Cessna. So how could the hit a 4 story structure in the middle of the most secure air space in the country?

       There are tons of theories on the WTC but check out the isralie "art students" who had free reign of the building in the weeks leading up to it. Also the reports from first responders stating there were liquid pools of metal months after the towers fell. Also let's not forget the pictures of the support columns with a nice 45° slice in them

       I read it and I'm not convinced. The basic argument seems to be that our military is too competent to be caught with it's pants down. It's the myth of the hyper competent government. I think the CIA knew the attack was coming that is the conspiracy

       Just to clarify, the "Israeli art students" theory is fallacious and based on false information. The art students were not even Israelis but European, Austrians if I remember correctly. Also the boxes that are supposed to for "fuse holders" could have been a number of different items, and the fuse holders which are points out by the theorists according to electricians who have weighed in, are not sufficient for those kind of explosives.

       The the two most important agencies in carrying out 9/11 were the CIA and the Saudi Intelligence Agency. The head of the Saudi Intelligence Agency - Prince Turki, resigned just 10 days before 9/11. The Saudi involvement has been acknowledged in the mainstream media, and yet Turki Al Faisal remains a free man. Turki Al Faisal was actually trained in America by Jesuit priests at the Georgetown University Edmond A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, which is rated as the number one foreign service school in the world. Many Kings and heads of Sate have been trained there. And guess who else was trained at Georgetown? The Director of the CIA at the time - George Tenet.

       Although, I think you are referring to the dancing Israelis thing, which is different, and from what I have seen does not have a whole lot of basis in fact as being an operation for Isralei intelligecne. And nevertheless, the Mossad during 9/11 took orders from the CIA which was admitted by the head of the Mossad during 9/11; the same head of the Mossad who was awarded the CIA Directors award for his service to American-led global intelligence efforts.

       I was thinking of the Israeli art students who went door to door of federal officials claiming to sell their art, which was actually just Chinese art factory reproductions.  This group also showed up at 36 federal black sites and DEA offices, and some were found to have  maps of the floorplans

       No I’m not. He original claim was that it burned for months. I said show me a video of molten metal at ground zero in january 2002 and you showed me a video of molten metal in October of 2001. Big difference. Now explain how that is evidence of a conspiracy, and how it’s not molten steel that was initially lit by the airplane hit and kept burning by a furnace effect created by the 200 foot tall debris pile.

       I didn't bring up any of the points so I can address as many or as little as I please. You say there's no material that will burn for weeks or months without fuel and then you say it burned because of a furnace effect so I'm not sure which you think. The original claim was months so I'm not sure how that equates to 5 months. There is a Fire Chiefs account of fires and melting steel at 8 weeks but I'm not your teacher so go and find it if you really want to but I doubt you do. You want to argue but not listen. If a fire fighter says to me steel was still melting at 6 weeks or 8 weeks I'll tend to think they have no reason to bullshit. You believe what makes you feel safe.

       I don’t dispute 6 weeks because there’s video of a firefighter pointing it out in October or 2001. However that is not evidence of thermite. Explain how it’s NOT anything more than molten steel kept hot by a furnace effect from the debris pile. That’s the most simple explanation.

       When did I say thermite? I wasn't the original person who brought up all of the points. You are confused. I don't have a theory, just that the fires and steel went on over a month and into 8 weeks which means months, (more than 1).

         When we say jet fuel doesn’t burn hot enough to melt steel, that means it doesn’t burn hot enough in
         <strong>
          open air
         </strong>
         to melt steel. Throw in the furnace effect and the temperatures climb drastically.

        <p>
         That metal could have been molten aluminum. He metal seen pouring out of the impact hole was molten aluminum from the airplane. Aluminum’s melting point is only 1200° F.

      <p>
       The 4 or 5 floors affected by the impact and the fire gave way, and the weight of the 30 or so floors above them caused the structure to give way. The top section of the building above the impact floors weighed many thousands of tons. That much weight falling on the rest of the building is what destroyed it.

       Where does it say that this video is from months after the attack? This could have just as easily been from the next week. Whatever that is isn’t spontaneously combusting. It’s on fire because it was always on fire. Regardless,

       Yea, I believe it was underground nuke charges for the purpose of demolition. People really want to believe thermite burns for weeks though. I don't even think nano thermite burns that long. Perhaps they used both a charge and the nano-thermite charges to throw people off on a red herring? Or just to be extra safe.

       You’re saying they used nukes? Then where’s the fallout? Why would they use nukes? Why would they be underground? Nothing we saw shows evidence of anything happening underground. Remember, the WTC is technically built past the Manhattan shoreline. Where it was built is artificially extended shore line. If a large bomb blew up under that, then lower Manhattan would collapse into the Hudson.

       Now you’re just pulling shit out of your ass. Perhaps it was an alien attack. Perhaps it didn’t really happen and it’s all just an elaborate joke on you. This is the Truman show. Nothing is real. Oh wait those were all unfounded postulations and are utterly useless. This is the opposite of science. You’re exhibiting text book confirmation bias. I shoot a whole in your theory, you change your theory so you don’t have to admit it’s nonsense.

       I’m not watching an hour video. You can give me bullet points or a time to skip to. But explain how there’s no nuclear fallout form this nuclear explosion? Why is no radiation observed? Why did no one experience any symptoms associated with heavy radiation exposure? Why did the base of both towers appear completely stationary as the top fell on them? There is no evidence of a massive blast underneath the buildings. How does this explosion bring down one building and not the other? Keeping in mind that they are technically not on the actual Manhattan island but an artificial extension into the Hudson River. Dimitri Khalezov is not a scientist. He allegedly worked for the USSR in a department that detected nuclear tests in other countries. This is a charlatan who wants attention.

       Watch the video at 18:00 and it starts with the explanation of how exactly he calculated the underground explosion. Most of the other video is about his book on the same subject explaining different things. It is worth the watch as his theory is plausible in my opinion. Cliff notes wouldn't do justice to his interview.

       How would they even have access to those samples or know exactly there they come from if they weren’t connected to an official investigation in any way?

Seeing as how nobody else in the world has come to a similar conclusion, they’re probably lying.

         As a pilot, I can promise you that it doesn’t take any skill at all to fly a plane into a building. Making a plane go left/right/up/down is very easy. Anyone with very basic aviation training could do this. With a private pilots license, he possessed more than enough skill to fly an airplane into a building. Again, super easy to do.

       There’s nothing difficult about pointing a plane at something. I’m a pilot. I’ve taken people flying all the time, and with no experience, I can’t talk them through everything but takeoff and landing. Anyone who thinks it’s “nearly impossible” to fly into the pentagon knows nothing about aviation.

       Well it’s a 51:55 video soooo... but you’re in luck because it doesn’t matter. I also happened to be a Navy fighter pilot and I can promise you that there’s nothing implausible about flying into the pentagon. If you give me a more specific time stamp, then I can see what this dude thinks is so important, but he’s probably just an idiot. I’d tell him that to his face.

       Well they didn’t pull 6 Gs so he just made they up. They did a descending turn until they were low enough to nose over. Once again, up/down/left/right isn’t hard with basic flight training. They don’t care about being smooth, or complying with any rules, or worrying about breaking anything. This video is nothing more than a random pilot getting attention for his own opinion. I’m a fighter pilot and I say he’s flat out wrong. You can take that to the bank.

       No one is saying you couldn't fly into the pentagon, they are saying the official story is a lie.  The guy interviewing with Kevin Barnett is a former navy pilot. Not a random pilot.

       "Hey guys, I'm a pilot and it's totally legit that that smear you saw in the pentagon surveillance video is the great ace, Hani Hanjour flying his jet into the building and killing a bunch of inconvenient auditors."

       Why would I believe that? Between building 7 and the pentagon, they exposed their scam. At this point to act like "There's nothing to see here" is just gaslighting.

       Staff members characterized Mr. Hanjour as polite, meek and very quiet. But most of all, the former employee said, they considered him a very bad pilot.

       ''I'm still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pentagon,'' the former employee said. ''He could not fly at all."

       Buuuuuut. Since you don’t answer questions you don’t have answers to, how about a different question? What exactly are you implying with your assertion? He was a bad pilot, therefore flight 77 did not fly into the pentagon? How are his shitty flying skills evidenced of a conspiracy?

       You said it's impossible to crash a plane into the pentagon. But for jetliner to have done what allegedly happened on 9/11 is nearly impossible. The video showing the alleged angle of attack reveals the lie.

       No. Having a question about something does not automatically equal a conspiracy. That’s not logical. But say there was a conspiracy, why would they lie but say bumbling idiot was the pilot? Why wouldn’t they pick a better pilot since they have control of the scenario?

       The pentagon is a very important building. You could make that arguement no matter where it got hit. How do you know he hit an office that was auditing something. What were they auditing? How do conspiracy theorists with no connection to the government know what was going on in there? If some master shadow empire directed the attack, why would they need to fly a plane into the pentagon to stop an audit? How do they not just have the power to stop an audit? What’s being audited that’s so bad, being secretly responsible for 9/11 is better and less risky? You see that’s the biggest problem I have with you people. You consider yourselves such inquisitive thinkers but 10 seconds of thought and your theories just don’t make any sense.

       They just want attention. I read Ralph kolstad’s website. Every point he gives has been long since debunked. He’s also over-inflating his navy career. He couldn’t have flown active duty for more than 10 years and still fly 27 years in the airlines. But he doesn’t want you to know that. He makes no mention of being a navy reservist for half of his 20 years. He is intentionally misleading and therefore untrustworthy.

       Why does anything I wrote mean we exhausted the pentagon thing? And why do you emphasize the heights of the buildings? But since that's important to you, how about the pentagon? Two skinny buildings and one short building. Not bad for noobs.

       The "plane" is moving parallel to the ground facing straight ahead. He wouldn't have gotten in that position. Complete bullshit.

       You should know that flying a large plane near sea level that fast is not the same as flying a Cessna.  But go ahead and keep shitting on guys who make these obvious points because they spent time in the reserves, which he mentiones in the Kevin Barrett interview.

       Was the patriot act part of their war planning? I'm sure they plan to invade anyone who stands in their way. Check out pnac or Wesley Clark.

       They crashed up the street several hours ago. They were on fire for hours. First responders were trying to move eveybody back for some period of time in fear that they could collapse at any minute. This man said nothing that wasn’t obvious to everyone that was there. He’s just eloquent.

       Well they’re attention-seeking idiots who also publicly buy into long-since debunked conspiracy theories, or just don’t have their facts straight at all. I’m here, as a pilot, to tell you that it’s totally possible. I’ve already explained why multiple times. I’ll do it again. Up/down/ left/right ain’t hard. Go see for yourself in a Cessna.

       Why would Hani Hanjour have crased as he did--parallel to the ground right into the auditors? Not real life. Show me a better video of the plane hitting the pentagon if you want me to believe that. And I don't buy the bs that 7 Eleven had better security cameras back then than the pentagon.

       Why would they crash a "plane" into the pentagon? Why not? Better excuse than just saying "Hey guys, don't look at what we did to all that money".  It reminds me of the guy who shot up Alifantis's place, nice distraction.

       You know and interesting question is why terrorists do what the do in general. The IRA figured out a long time ago that killing civilians was a losing strategy. It is as if someone wanted an excuse to start a bunch of wars. Like Wesley Clark told us.

       <em>
        absolutes
       </em>
       - a fast moving, explosive projectile hit both #1 &amp; #2 and yet...nothing hit the entire rest of the Plaza and #7 Poof! When you look at all the missing chunks of buildings 3, 4, 5, 6 your mind really starts ramping up!
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I've no way to prove the death-toll within the structures so I choose not to speculate. Lest we forget, there are First Responders, Citizens and Volunteers afflicted with terrible Cancers from exposure to air quality at Ground Zero - Thanks Christine Todd-Whitman ya cunt!

       Whether or not there were any planes that day seems like a rather important thing to be clear about. Same goes for the death toll. If 3,000 people actually died then we are talking about something very different to a made-for-TV movie, which is what many of us suspect 9/11 to have been.

       I can speculate and theorize all night long but I cannot prove the specific aspects of anything around 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go look and research long and hard into the foot print of the entire Plaza. What exactly do you see? Research what happened to Deutch Bank. Why the hell did that building rust apart from the inside out?
How about the cars and buses that burnt but not the trees? A car was found teetering on a wooden fence! Tiny bone fragments scattered across any number of buildings - wtf blew these people to shreds? How about the Fireman that didn't fit in his uniform, clear down to his boots because he was more like Jelly and some bones?

       The best theory, I think, is that to secure Silverstein's cooperation the planners had to guarantee that 7 was destroyed as well as every other part of the WTC complex. Silverstein had owned 7 for decades already, and wanted to replace it, but the cost of the demolition and asbestos abatement would have been in the billion dollar range. The planners knew all this, so they made him an offer: buy the lease on the rest of the WTC complex, help us gain access to the building interiors, and in exchange we'll demolish the whole complex, 7 included, so you can reap the insurance payout and rebuild the entire thing to your liking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that WTC1 and 7 were supposed to go down simultaneously upon the impact of the first plane as though the plane knocked the North Tower down, and falling debris "took out" WTC7. And WTC2 was similarly supposed to drop upon the impact of the second plane. I believe that the fact that the Twin Towers burned unimpressively for a hour or so before the demolition, and the fact that 7 was so obviously imploded hours later while millions watched were the result of colossal fuckups on the part of the planners. There was never supposed to be cameras trained on the buildings from every angle, nor surviving witnesses from within the buildings. The whole event was supposed to have taken place in just a few minutes on either side of 9 am that morning.

       Look into WHEN the Owner of the towers purchased insurance policies against “acts of terrorism”, how much money and down time IT WAS GOING TO COST HIM to remove all of the asbestos throughout both towers(which were on the list of buildings to be condemned due to asbestos levels), and then how much money he instead MADE that day due to the towers collapsing. That would be a good start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you could look at what happened to the steel beams that were removed from the site after the collapse. Steel structures had NEVER failed like this before. EVER. If a natural failure, this anomaly screamed for further analysis, even from the perspective of public and Government agencies who’s job it is to make sure that a collapse like this never happens again. Why was the steel so quickly removed, shipped out of the country and sold as scrap? Why did the WTC site smolder for another 4 months?

       The official mythology for the cause of building 7's symmetrical collapse is "primarily due to fire" according to NIST.  They claimed one structural column failed and miraculously this caused all other columns to fail simultaneously.

       I think the majority of the problem is what's called cognitive dissonance.  It's a defense mechanism the brain employs when it refuses to accept an idea that contradicts what it already believes.  In this case that a government would cause harm to its own citizens.  We don't want to accept this as possible because it destroys our sense of security.  People don't want to believe this is possible, so they don't even consider the evidence.  They don't want to know the sad truth.

        Above anything, the footage of the collapse.

       <li>
        Barry Jennings, the last WTC7 survivor, reports that a "big explosion" trapped him inside the building. In a later interview, he describes hearing multiple explosions while being trapped. He mentions that when he made it down to the lobby, "there was no lobby."

       I've debated for it too, I just don't bring it up. It does sound like he slipped up though. If he did mean "pull out the firefighters," like people contest, he didn't follow it up with "and thank god we did, or else it could have been worse." People not dying is the afterthought to people being evacuated. Watching the building collapse is the afterthought to the decision being made to bring it down.

       WTC7 was a text book controlled demolition. In fact it's almost a perfect example. Not only that video exists saying the building was 'about to blow up' -&gt;

       There is no building in the world that would take a hit from from an airplane 2/3 or 3/4 of the way up from the base and then fall exactly inside it's own footprint, the same way buildings fall when demolition experts blow them up intentionally. It's that simple. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying or ignorant.

       No one is saying you couldn't fly into the pentagon, they are saying the official story is a lie.  The guy interviewing with Kevin Barnett is a former navy pilot. Not a random pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hey guys, I'm a pilot and it's totally legit that that smear you saw in the pentagon surveillance video is the great ace, Hani Hanjour flying his jet into the building and killing a bunch of inconvenient auditors."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would I believe that? Between building 7 and the pentagon, they exposed their scam. At this point to act like "There's nothing to see here" is just gaslighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       More abou Hani "Red Barron of the Middle East" Hanjour
:
      </p>
      <p>
       Staff members characterized Mr. Hanjour as polite, meek and very quiet. But most of all, the former employee said, they considered him a very bad pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
       ''I'm still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pentagon,'' the former employee said. ''He could not fly at all."

         If their goal was to cover up illegal activity, then why wouldn they just hide where money went and simply not talk about it? Thats way easier than the most complex and involved covert operation in the history of mankind.
