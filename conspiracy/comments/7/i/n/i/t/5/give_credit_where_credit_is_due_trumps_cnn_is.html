       I don't like getting my politics from Washington Post but I do believe their investigative journalism is top notch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Washington Post did a good job at shutting Project Veritas down. Haven't really heard anything from them lately. They dug up tons of information about the girl trying to lie and wrote an article outing them. Even had a video of the woman lying through her teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Washington Post corrected CNN on the story they got wrong a few days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       and Washington Post was the one that broke the 'Clinton Cash' story
      </p>
      <p>
       The editorial board and opinions may be left leaning (Though Trump has written opinion pieces on Wapo before) but their investigative work is really well done.

       I would guess there is a component of the news agenda being driven exogenously, but also this is probably just a symptom of repeatedly making business decisions on a quarterly basis: you compromise your integrity enough times pushing whatever sensational crap will get the ratings (and ad dollars) at the expense of your journalistic reputation, and eventually your core viewership declines.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of like diabetes, where if you eat enough shit over a long enough time, your cells will resist absorbing any more of it once you get too fat.  A fitting metaphor for the USA fake news epidemic maybe.

       The volume is better, and the exposure to more viewpoints is better. It is all around better as long as you have decent critical thinking. That is our problem now. We need to start from a position of mistrust and work the story info to find the facts. If your default position is to believe what you read, you are gonna have a bad time.

       It makes me so angry that all you have to do is label yourself as a "fact checker" and the liberal Pulitzer and every other liberal will act like everything is accurate and can't be argued against. I'm not just attacking liberals, they just happen to be the party that does the fact check bullshit to cover up crazy strong bias

       The same can be said for pre-internet msm news. I mean, is anyone really gonna argue that the msm(both sides) hasn't been attempting to influence people? The internet/social media decentralized said influence stream - though its already being consolidated very quickly...

      <p>
       Imho it is a far worse source of information unless you are already pretty much informed and only seek confirmation from locals (etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In effect social media only amplifies popular statements, hardens the social bubble and takes away the long editioral and all means of developing a balanced argument. Social media news is all headlines and no article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore the attention span with social media news is greatly reduced, you simply consume headlines while you surf the web. If you sit down with the Guardian, the NYT, the NZZ or similar newspapers you are already forced to devote your attention to the newspaper/article and you will devote 5 or 10 or 30 minutes of your time reading the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you might get up and try to fact check the article. Or talk about the article. Or simply dismiss the argumentation in the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social media has none of this. No one reads a 20 pg social media article. Why bother? And bit by bit you turn news which ought to provide a
       <em>
        narrative
       </em>
       (as in: a consistent explanation of why a event developed like it developed)  into a click-bait race for
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        facts
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       and thats the reason which I'm always pissed when someone proudly declares he "red pilled", that I'm a MSM fool and then maybe cites breitbart -.-

       I'd argue it depends on the platform.  Voat, for example, is so egregiously toxic that it is hard to buy into it.  Facebook is dangerously easy to buy into, as is Twitter.  Different platforms have different risks, depending on their ubiquity and their involvement with the deep state.

       People find solace in the "truth", even if there is nothing factual about it. As long as it provides some measure of comfort, an ability to see with even slighter better than usual clarity through the fog of life, then chances are they will cling to that truth in the face of unpleasant facts.

       That simply sounds like attention seeking, to be honest; they did no real work. They just found something they hadn't heard about yet, assumed no one else had and decided to become ever so briefly the center of attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       "LOOK! I found this!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an unfortunate attitude that is pervasive through social media; just spouting off random shit in hopes that someone will be stupid enough to believe it and hit "follow/like/upvote".
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part is in order to beat them, you have to play that insipid game yourself; one-upping them in hopes that people will see the light of fact over some fabricated lie that masquerades as a truth. To not play means the misinformation wins; by going unchallenged, it is an implicit endorsement of its accuracy.

       That's the problem these days. Too much information in not enough time. If I see an article about some important guy in Hollywood that got accused of sexual assault, I'm not gonna question it simply because I don't care at all. I just wish that news channels would just give us the facts and let us make our own opinions.

       I said that dismissing an entire news agency because they get something wrong is stupid. Yeah you shouldn't. Kindly accept the news. You also shouldn't blindly dismiss it just because the guy you like claims it's fake. Especially when he calls all bad news about him fake. It's what cult leaders do to their loyal members. Claim the media doesn't get them and is spreading bullshit about them.

       not because of anything Trump says.  I have avoided consuming that crap for many years, long before Trump.  The only thing Trump changed was he branded them "fake" but he changed nothing in my opinion about them.

       What do you mean by fake? Like every story they report isn't real? Like nothing they say actually happened? Because that's what fake means. That's what you believe? The media just makes up stories all day? Because that's just simply not true. I know Trump isn't a cult leader. But he uses the same tactics to shield criticism that the church of Scientology does.

       Their stories are perfectly real (well, most of them).  The problem is that their reporting is simply propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       In America, "propaganda" is a bad word with bad connotations.  We don't like that word.  So, 90 years ago, Edward Bernays coined the term "public relations."  It means the exact same thing, but it doesn't have all those negative authoritarian connotations.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fake news" is a code word for "propaganda."  For 90 years, there has been only one voice of propaganda in this country, using Edward Bernays' techniques to engineer our society.  In the last 5-10 years, other groups have begun using these same techniques.  Now, there is a "conservative" voice, disseminating propaganda of their own, which is how Trump got elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propaganda.  CNN is propaganda.  Breitbart is propaganda.  They don't "make up stories" so much as make up worldviews, and tell you how to interpret events within the worldview they chose for you.

       Yeah I know what you're saying. Unfortunately at this point, pretty much all news from any source will have some kind of agenda to it. But I don't think the smart move is just to dismiss all of it. I think it's smarter to see what both sides have to say about a story. That way you're taking in as much information as possible to work with.

       I think "agenda" is too soft, though.  It's propaganda.  If it was just "agenda" then it wouldn't be a bad idea to watch lots of sources.  But propaganda is a good deal more toxic, especially if you are trying to integrate multiple disagreeing streams.

       Nah I don't read breitbart. But I'll see what fox news and liberal outlets have to say about an issue. I also listen to a lot of conservative talk radio even though I'm not conservative at all. Not sure why you would get your news from a circle jerk sub like the_donald. That place is a non stop propaganda rally for the president. If you think CNN is pure propaganda then I don't see how you'd think the_donald is any different.

       No, it isn't. "Fake news" means news that is completely made up with no basis in reporting or reality. Things like "Obama is a secret Muslim" or "Planned Parenthood sells baby parts". These are wholly false, entirely fabricated 'news' stories.

       Do you think it’s a good idea to create fervor, alluding that there are people paid here to push some pro-CNN agenda? I know you didn’t distinguish your comment, but wouldn’t it be fair to say that there’s as many trump/ gop shills as shareblue?
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who has been called a shill, been accused of being paid to push my own beliefs and banned because a moderator didn’t like that I took him to task for pushing propaganda, I find it alarming that there’s emboldening of this one-sided narrative.

       Can you name an organization associated with Trump that is equal to Shareblue, CTR, or Media Matters?  Genuinely interested, because every time someone draws an equivalency between the shill camps, it's always "Trump shills" and "Shareblue."  The difference between those is that Shareblue is an actual organization with people on a payroll with an open mission statement of swaying public perception in a particular direction for a specific person, Clinton.  Can you name any Trump organization that shares those traits?

       No genuine r/conspiracy user trusts msm, not one. That's kind of the basic foundation here in this sub. If anyone goes against the basic tenant of this sub by apologizing/defending msm, real users are going to be suspicious that these msm apologists are the proven ShareBlue shills that have taken over reddit.

       I'd sure like to see the evidence for your claim (and baseless allegations w/o evidence from msm doesn't count as proof, fyi) because we have tons of proof of CTR/ShareBlue shills, including what organizations employ/direct them and who funds them.

       I think there’s a vast right wing conspiracy to oppress people of color. There always has been and always will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Donald Trump ran for president because he wanted to line his pockets and there’s millions of brainwashed, alleged “marginalized” white people who are so deluded they actually think he’s going to help them by using the tried, tested and failed trickle down economics.
      </p>

       I think our government covers up the existence of aliens.

       I think that someone stopped the electric car happening, most likely big auto and big government.

       I think the legalization of marijuana would solve healthcare, cancer, ubi and several other problems like education but the white man, ie, the government won’t let us live.

       I’d also like to know what you consider msm and what you consider a decent news source. It seems no journalist or news organization is good enough, even if it isn’t owned by the big five or six (whatever it is.

       There is no decent news source. How can you spend five minutes in this sub without noticing that?!? Not trying to be rude, but no wonder users have called you a shill.

       Not every word printed or said on msm is false.  That kind if black and white thinking is the mark of someone with poor critical thinking skills.  You have to sift thru various sources and put it together yourself.  And use some common sense.

       There's a difference between distrust and belief that everything someone reports is false. Distrust means you don't give them the benefit of the doubt and require them to prove that what they're reporting is true. It simply raises the standard of proof on them so that they can't just say "x is true" with no justification.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the news lies and gets shit wrong as often as they do, they don't deserve this blanket trust people give them. It sounds like bizarre propaganda to insinuate that people should just stop questioning them and believe them without pause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Course, that means none of this "an anonymous source tells me vague thing I interpret as meaning this" crap. The last few stories that required massive corrections due to the base information being entirely false, changing and reversing the entire story, were based entirely on anonymous sources. It's understandable why sources need to be kept secret, but news needs to get it through their thick skulls that anonymous does not mean credible. It's literally the opposite of credible.

       Focus on the message, not the messenger.  Fake news is dangerous when people accept it as true and have a reaction without taking some time for critical thought and consideration of opposing views.  I don't have ultimate respect for any source- I view them all as biased and not completely reliable.

       What does this mean? If we disregard the source of information, how can we tell whether or not something is trustworthy or not? If we focus entirely on the message, how do we determine whether or not the message is true? Doesn't this open up people to believing only those things that they want to believe and ignore the rest of it regardless of truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems like the rationale of someone who believes things they read on 4chan and infowars. It allows people to give credence to state propaganda.

       Truly think about what you're asking. If I completely ignore the source of information and instead view all sources effectively anonymously, I'm unable to determine whether or not something should be considered reliable or not. It requires that I do all research into
       <strong>
        every subject I care to consider
       </strong>
       all by myself. "Developing critical thinking abilities" doesn't come close enough to do what you want me to do. There are entire fields which I am not qualified to investigate. I have not studied particle physics, microbiology, organic chemistry, political science, or any other of a thousand fields of study nearly enough to say that I understand them well enough to
       <strong>
        start
       </strong>
       to apply critical thinking skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say we have two sources: one says "Blargs have a quantum thurk of eleven ports" while another anonymous source says "Blargs have a quantum thurk of negative sixty ports". If we view them purely anonymously then, as someone who never studied Blargs, I can't even begin to apply critical thinking abilities to those two statements to decide which is true. But if I later find out that the first statement came from Dr. Blarg, world-renowned expert on Blargs while the other one came from a lobbyist who seeks to profit from anti-blarg propaganda, then suddenly the truth is easier to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sources are incredibly important because it's impossible for everyone to be experts on everything.

       Are you gonna compare Obama to Trump? Every day Trump attacks the media and wants to revoke parts of the 1st amendment so he can sue them. Obama once attacked 1 network that had ran multiple hit pieces on his birth, wife, children and education.

       Are
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       going to compare Obama and Trump? Nobody in the history of life on this planet has seen an all out orchestrated assault on the character of a single individual as we've witnessed with establishment media on Trump. Obama had Fox to deal with,
       <em>
        sometimes
       </em>
       harsher than he deserves, and literally every single other outlet was speculating whether he'd float or sink if he attempted to go across Lake Michigan on foot. If you aren't aware of how much bullshit he pulled on the American public and the world at large, then that's probably why.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ironic part about all this is it vastly increases many people's faith in the transparency of the administration, since people are actually holding him accountable. That they constantly have to write misleading or outright lying headlines only furthers this. Fucking petty retards shooting themselves in the foot, it's hilarious to watch on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and PS, since we're on a conspiracy sub this is probably as good a time as any to mention that Obama did and does have a ton of shady history with all the topics you brought up. Why are his grades sealed? Why does nobody remember him in class? Why are there 0 pictures of Michelle pregnant? He was a CIA puppy trained from an early age and he duped a whole lot of people. Good. Going.

       You just proved my point my dude. You attacked Obama on personal things like his wife's pregnancy and grades. The current president didn't even release his tax returns. Trump is attacked for saying on a recording that he gropes women. Obama is attacked for being black so he couldn't be born in the US, even after releasing his birth shit, the best part is Trump said these claims, he was this dishonest media you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's play your game and just say that Melania has no pregnant pictures either, they are all just fake and I will never believe they are real. Wow, I'm running in 2020 now.

       It's equally dangerous for the public to unquestioningly accept as fact anything the MSM conglomeration starts barking at them.  As a matter of fact I think the mob is more dangerous than the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president could be taken down legally if the system has a mind to do it.  Cut down as many people as you from the mob and the mob keeps right on marching.

       I was just talking about this the other day, it’s an incredibly alarming trend that has been happening and we can not dismiss it. It is a deliberate form of propaganda, seed doubt in every establishment except your own. It’s just another tool to divide. And the fact that this post is at the top here is incredibly alarming bc it shows just how effect Trump is at getting ppl to not believe anything anymore. The top post of r/conspiracy is someone supporting our president ... Does the MSM lie? Sure. Do they lie all the time? No. It is up to the user to search for facts and constantly reflect their own biases and the biases of the reporting when absorbing news.

       The actual media is doing far more damage to their credibility than Trump is by repeatedly reporting false stories that support their narrative. I don't think Trump would even be on this kick if he wasn't having to constantly defend himself from their bullshit.  If many MSM outlets don't even hesitate to double check their facts before delivering high impact news nationwide than they don't deserve our trust.  They could easily reverse that trend but reputation and being factually correct lately are taking the wayside to sensationalists articles that net them lots of clicks.  It is very dangerous but they did it to themselves for the most part.

       Lol. You do realize that Fox News and Brietbart and Trump and Sarah huckster Sanders are just as guilty as any other msm is of spreading fake news. I guess that’s ok though because it fits your belief system. That was the entire point of my post, we all have biases and it is up to us to reflect on those and to reflect on the biases in our new sources. Trump has to defend himself bc he is the president of the United States and a reflection of us all. He’s an embarrassment. Trump could easily reverse this trend and his reputation by not supporting pedophiles for office, not lying about the tax scam, and many many other lies he he has spun over the years. I honestly never thought I’d see a bunch of people on a conspiracy sub defending the president of the United States.

       I like how you just make broad sweeping generalizations about me based on absolutely nothing.  When did I stick up for Fox News, Brietbart, or Sarah?  I was simply making the point that Trump has had many baseless attacks sent his way by the MSM and what other way to combat them but to announce that they are full of shit?

       Lmao.  So the media doesn't need to be more careful about making sure they are reporting the truth?  They can just keep on posting false stories or sensationalize normal events and the good people of the united states will go back to having blind faith in the media if Trump would just quit supporting pedophiles in office.
      </p>

       All media outlets have an agenda and I for one am happy this whole fake news bullshit backfired right in their face and now people are questioning everything instead of just blindly following the mainstream narrative. It's good for people to observe a number of sources and form their own conclusions.

       Honestly, I don't think you understood the point of my first post.  That the rhetoric Trump is engaging in is an intentional form of propaganda. It is actually a form of propaganda that Putin has been very successful at. You can read more about it here if you are interested in getting your head out of this false dichotomy paradigm you seem stuck in,
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/">

       </a>
       . BTW this was written in 2014, well before "Russia Hacking, Fake News" bullshit. By deeming everything your opponents say as Fake News, you ensure that your base only believes what you say and ignores everything else that doesn't fit into their own belief system, effectively creating a new false reality. This is not a tactic unique to Trump or Putin and has been used successfully throughout history. I made the generalization that you are Trump supporter because of the tone of your comment, and I honestly don't think I am wrong. It is rare for me to see non-Trump supporters complain about Trump needing to defend himself. So I have one question for you, do you believe the media has covered Roy Moore fairly, or do you believe he is just another target of Fake News? Because that is the lie Trump is feeding his supporter, despite very real comments made by Roy Moore himself that supports many of the media's claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Americans see through his lies and the media's lies. You can be critical of the media and critical of Trump, the two are not mutually exclusive. A fact that both you and Trump seem to be unable to grasp. Trump supporters have become so incredibly dogmatic in their approach that anything that is ever negative about their great leader is deemed false, without any critical thinking or analysis. I never once defended media organizations. If you actually read my first post I even acknowledged that a lot of them lie.... But it is a broad overgeneralization, that is not based in reality or fact to believe that every MSM article ever written is false. That is exactly what Trump wants you to believe, so that you will only believe him....
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right all media outlets have an agenda. Trump also has an agenda. Believing everything the president says is not "Americans waking up," its them falling further and further into uncertainty, fear and delusion. I'm done fighting with Trump supporters on a conspiracy sub, its getting so fucking old. This used to be a place where people saw through the false left-right divide, and recognized that both the media and politicians are simply tools to keep us fighting with each other. Now its just full of bullshit partisan politics.

       Trump operates like a cult leader.  That's what all this constant bombardment of scandalous and outrageous statements is about.  It's called intelligence dampening.  It fucks up your short term memory and leaves you emotionally overwhelmed, and when you're emotionally overwhelmed you are very vulnerable to suggestion.  That's also what his constant repetition of leading statements is about.  He breaks people down bit by bit and presents himself as a savior after he's left them feeling helpless without him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way he operates I have little doubt that Trump either studied brainwashing techniques or came about them naturally as an extreme narcissist.

       Their hate for Trump blinds them. They are rabid for anything that could possibly damage him, so the slightest scent of a "bombshell" story is taken as gospel and they blast it out via every medium they have.

       Trump calls every single news outlet that is critical of him fake news. It's not some wise 4d chess move. All news stations will inevitably get something wrong in the course of their life. That doesn't mean they are fake news. It's not like every story CNN comes out with is bullshit. Same goes for Fox, and any other real news outlet. "The Onion" is fake news. There are websites that are actually fake news. Lumping in regular news stations in with these other sites is just a way to blindfold your base to legitimate criticism about you.

       It's not 'fake news' because they occasionally get details wrong. It's fake news because the very foundations of Big Media are rooted in an agenda to enslave the American people. This much is obvious, so why are you obfuscating the truth? What agenda are you pushing?

       The problem is, every side has their own agenda. If you think that any sort of liberal ideas are part of an agenda to enslave the American people, so you immediately dismiss anything without trying to approach it critically, you're doing a disservice to yourself and the country.

       This is exactly what the "liberal media" is doing on stories though. Look at the Mueller investigation, WaPo runs shit like, "Paul Manafort testifies today about his contacts with "XYZ"" but the reactionaries at Fox or shareblue put out "Manafort admits to XYZ" or "Mueller assistant fired for Anti-Trump messages, investigation at stake"

       He throws the word "fake news" around like crazy because it was originally
       <em>
        their word
       </em>
       to try to discredit all non-mainstream media.  In a matter of days it went like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Some literally fake Macedonian websites posted literal fake news
      </p>
      <p>
       -Media made a big deal out of it and acted like Trump won because of it
      </p>
      <p>
       -Media outlets proceed to distribute lists of FakeNews sites the citizens must avoid, with the definition of "fake" broadened to include Breitbart
      </p>
      <p>
       -Trump turns it around and turns the word into a meme
      </p>
      <p>
       It has 2 benefits because it made the msm's "watch out for that scary FAKE NEWS" thing blow up in their face, and it's a perfect vessel for him to rail on the lying press.  And yes we really do have a lying press problem.

       I don't think it's a good thing that these people have written all media off as "fake news". If you familiarize yourself with different forms of news and understand that most people have an agenda to push, it's important to use critical thinking to wade through the shit and get to the base of reports. I prefer to research journalists to see who has the better track record because I think that lends more credibility. I don't really see how the president only supporting media that paints him positively is a good thing and it seems like there's an ulterior motive to make his supporters automatically write off any evidence of wrongdoing. He's been conditioning his voters to do this since before he was elected.

       Yes, well, the only reporters I know who are actually
       <em>
        trying

       to do good work are not really on TV.  Ben Shapiro, Tim Poole, etcetera.  They have their biases and it shows, but they do try to inform and be accurate in their reporting.

       I'm 61 and I red pilled about 5 or 6 years ago. My parents in their 80's are now red pilled. It's a bit difficult for us the way we grew up with no Internet, YouTube, etc. We just believed what we were taught. We thought our government was made up of the good guys. And while I still believe there are many good people working for it behind the scenes, I can also see the evil running the show and the damage we've inflicted to innocent people around the world--and I'm ashamed of it.

       It's great, because now they get to dismiss anything they disagree with as fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people at the point who will disregard actual journalism if it challenges what they think, but instead will believe a post on 4chan with absolutely zero evidence, zero proof. Yes, there is bullshit in the main stream media, there's spin everywhere. Look at different sides, look at the sources. Don't just believe it because it agrees with your point of view.

       don't forget that anytime Fox would report something that Democrats disagreed with their would dismiss it is fake news. And  that for 8 years Obama relentlessly attacked Fox  fake and even tried to ban them from the White House

       Confirmation bias. I'm guilty of it too. It's just so difficult these days to find an unbiased source. EVERONE has an agenda. I'm starting to think there is no one looking out for us. And we're too busy with the partisan shit to see how divided they keep us. Ugh.

       You don’t have to that cynical, trust me. Just realize that
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is “propaganda”. Every argument you’ve had with somebody, every opinion you’ve seen, every news article. Everybody wants you to see things their way. It doesn’t mean they aren’t trying to look out for you, generally, it means they earnestly believe what they say.
      </p>

       Whether or not you agree is the key point. Be aware of your own biases.

       Whether or not they are
       <em>

       Ironically, 'fake news' was a term initially used by the MSM to discredit WL and alternative news sources which were not aligned to their narrative during the 2016 election. Take the WaPos listing of alternative news sites with Russian influence which included non-establishment left and right sites. The article seemed reactionary with a case of desperation and little vetting of the source and motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the election, Trump used the MSM platforms against themselves like he did during the election to takeover the control the meaning of 'fake news'.
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM outlets have done their part in earning the fake news label. Trump is no beacon of truth, but I can't fault anyone for turning away from traditional news outlets, particularly the front pages and op eds. Trump has turned the 'fake news' label into a rally cry for his base.

       No, "fake news" was a term initially used to describe literally fake news, like shit in Facebook about Madonna endorsing Trump. Trump immediately coopted the term to lash out at journalists critical of him, and the Redcaps ate it up. Clearly.

       I don't know if that is the case anymore. CNN and MSNBC probably tell more lies now because their side lost and they are scrambling. Fox does not really need to lie right now.

       What do you mean they have no need to lie? Of course they do, and they do it non stop. They lie to support the GOP and Trump. Even worse is their habit of lying by omission, incessantly avoiding any stories that make the right look bad.

       It's not news when fox lies.  How many times just today has a fox anchor said or insinuated that climate change is a hoax, or that the president is qualified to do his job, or that Roy Moore is not a pedophile, or that the Republican party wants to help the middle class, or that tax cuts for billionaires will help everyone.  Shit, it's news if they tell the truth.

       Yea, they don’t trust CNN but are literally trusting actual fake news.  You know, instead of what Trump seems Fake News, every other post that hits their Facebook wall is from an actual site that produces news that is not real.

       Well most are in meme form on FB.  But they’re on both sides of politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       One from the left shared on my FB timeline this week was that Trump said if he were to run he would run as a Republican because they’re the dumbest voters.  Just google “Trump Republicans dumb” and you’ll see it cited as fake news.  One of the more popular ones that just wont die.
      </p>
      <p>
       One from my right leaning family would be that Starbucks withheld coffee from Marines stating that Starbucks didn’t support the war or anyone serving in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both shared this week, it’s honestly from the older generation.  So if you don’t have older family on your social media, congrats, you don’t have to debunk the BS day after day

       Sounds like fake news isn't the problem.  Sounds more like people believing anything that confirms their biases without question is the problem.  Do people not remember email forwards?  It was the same shit just before facebook.  Back then though you were going to die if you didn't forward whatever obscure message onto at least 20 of your friends.  I never looked at the forwards themselves as the issue but the gullible people spreading it.

       It's funny. I think Trump is an arrogant ass. I don't like a lot of what he has done. I also think he might actually save the western world. If Hillary had won we would have continued down a dark dark path.

       The term seems to be transcending party lines, both sides use it- even here outside of America we see it a lot. The problem I have with it is it’s an easy line to use to dismiss anything that disagrees with your stance

       The problem is that decrying
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       MSM as "fake news" leads a person to other outlets, mainly Russian propaganda (RT) or fringe "news" sites with lunatic theories on why science is evil, vaccinations are bad and why this President/Pope/whatever will be the last one before a major apocalyptic event.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fine to be discerning, just don't tar all MSM with the sae brush because claiming them as misinformation and fake news and then turning to sites that are actual misinformation and fake news is just as dangerous as blindly listening to what someone like Fox News says.

       It would be a good thing if these “independent” outlets that we are being told to listen too, like “infowars”, “project veritas”, and the other bad actors weren’t playing 3 card monty with the fucking truth. There are absolutely no true independent journalism outlets out there without political favoritism. The non plugged in person, that doesn’t bother to look at all sources, and form opinions based on facts and critical thinking doesn’t have a chance. Fuck the whole lot of them.

       In a different light, it's clear his tactic is really nothing more than "No I'm not, you are, No you, No you." It works on people who don't understand the fundamental merits of the situation. He's objectively wrong, but his infantile behavior has a distressingly large number of people fooled.

       The problem is that Trump doesn't use the term "fake news"
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       when describing poorly researched, misleadingly framed, or downright inaccurate stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also uses it ad nauseam to describe
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       stories (and documentable facts) that are critical of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fake news" would be a far more powerful weapon if Trump reserved it only for stories like the CNN/Wikileaks email, and if he deployed it deftly and eloquently (difficult to imagine, right?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, he sprays it all over the walls, covering 50%+ of everything in the news cycle with the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, for every story like this--where he's encouraging critical thinking--there are three where he's saying "you can pick your own facts and choose your own reality!" Which is the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of encouraging critical thinking.

       I have been in my mother's home for just shy of two weeks now. She and her fiancé are in their mid 50's. It is a home that has either CNN/MSNBC on 24/7 - which is a bizarre adjustment for me because before Trump they were into Fox News - and in that short amount of time I've managed to get them to start seeing the agenda behind the coverage. They have even begun to point it out themselves...it's cute.

       You know, in my opinion, this trickles all the way down to parents demanding respect from their children for not talking back to them. Questions like "why?" have been highly discouraged at the very basic level and I'm sure many families still operate this way. Not taking the same traditions that may or may not be working seriously is very threatening to people of older generations because it's not safe. What is known is safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying disrespectful kin are the future, far from it. However, we should not shut down children who ask questions as it promotes independent thought and intelligence.

       It's funny because conspiracy sites originally  coined the term "fake news" to describe the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, with pizzagate, the mainstream tried to use the term to describe conspiracy sites. Which got people more aware of the fact some stories are lies. And then the media continued spewing all their other bogus stories, as per usual, and it completely backfired.
      </p>
      <p>
       It probably would've worked in the old media system, but nowadays people can see where the truth lies for themselves.

       Nope. No credit for Trump.

      <p>
       He’s not doing this to awaken the masses. He’s not out there like FDR talking about propaganda and showing people how to digest news critically so they won’t be mislead
      </p>
      <p>
       He’s attacking them for his own benefit. He’s blurring reality so that it’s hard to get a focus on any criticism of him. As long as you aren’t sure what’s real then Trump can operate with much less resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try it. Bring up any criticism of the man and you’ll be met with an alternate view of reality.

       If anything he’s using all the short comings and corruption of the media/country to catapult himself to the top.

       Or the MSM is garbage regardless of what Trump says ? It shouldn't take Trump calling them fake news before you had that revelation. I would argue that you probably shouldn't trust the government either, even if they do support Trump. Coming to these conclusions yourself is  much better.

       My grandmother believes CNN is absolute truth and anyone who disagrees is a fool.  Most of my friends on social media seem to believe similarly.  There are plenty of people who believe CNN is fair, balanced, and accurate reporting.

       Yes, well, the only reporters I know who are actually
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to do good work are not really on TV.  Ben Shapiro, Tim Poole, etcetera.  They have their biases and it shows, but they do try to inform and be accurate in their reporting.

       That simply sounds like attention seeking, to be honest; they did no real work. They just found something they hadn't heard about yet, assumed no one else had and decided to become ever so briefly the center of attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       "LOOK! I found this!"

       It's an unfortunate attitude that is pervasive through social media; just spouting off random shit in hopes that someone will be stupid enough to believe it and hit "follow/like/upvote".
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part is in order to beat them, you have to play that insipid game yourself; one-upping them in hopes that people will see the light of fact over some fabricated lie that masquerades as a truth. To not play means the misinformation wins; by going unchallenged, it is an implicit endorsement of its accuracy.

       I don't know if that is the case anymore. CNN and MSNBC probably tell more lies now because their side lost and they are scrambling. Fox does not really need to lie right now.

       Not every word printed or said on msm is false.  That kind if black and white thinking is the mark of someone with poor critical thinking skills.  You have to sift thru various sources and put it together yourself.  And use some common sense.
