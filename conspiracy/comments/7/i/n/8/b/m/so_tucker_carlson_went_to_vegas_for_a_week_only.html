       I am also disappointed. Perhaps his digging was interrupted discouraged by higher authorities.

       However, if you're looking for Las vegas investigation the best informations source at this point is Jake Morphonios on youtube, he's been dogged.

       He put out this good video a week ago, very revealing and one of his best to date: Frantic Evacuation Footage Threatens Lone Gunman Theory - Las Vegas Shooting - Part 54 -

       I would assume he is building a larger story for a later date. Many journalists work on stories for weeks even months.

       I've been watching every one of his videos. He's doing a great job. There's so many fake YouTube "journalists" who only want $ or fame who are either making up stuff or passing info off as their own. He seems to actually have integrity. And, isn't asking for money in every video.

       If Tucker Carlson had any balls he'd put Jake on his show. They seem to be the only 2 people that care and Jake has some good stuff to share.

       Seriously, I bet he didn't even have to pay, I bet fox covered his cost.  My wife and I did this a couple months ago.  She had a meeting out in LV (her hotel &amp; ticket covered by her work), so I setup a dinner meeting with a potential client and tagged along (writing off my ticket).  On a side note, the 3 days we were there I talked to about 30 locals and all of them (exept 1) though the story was complete bullshit.

       Yeah, the official story, and it had only been a couple of weeks after the shooting.  I was really suprised how many people would just come right out and call it BS when I mentioned it.

       I think there's more ppl than we think who believe the same. But, since there's really no stories coming out, they don't even have access to comments sections to talk about it. I doubt many think about it on a daily basis or enough to post on Facebook.

       That, or everyone knows it's so bizarre it doesn't even need to be said.
