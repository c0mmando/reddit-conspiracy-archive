<p>However, if you&#39;re looking for Las vegas investigation the best informations source at this point is Jake Morphonios on youtube, he&#39;s been dogged.</p>

<p>He put out this good video a week ago, very revealing and one of his best to date: Frantic Evacuation Footage Threatens Lone Gunman Theory - Las Vegas Shooting - Part 54 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Lx4A7fWSc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Lx4A7fWSc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching every one of his videos. He&#39;s doing a great job. There&#39;s so many fake YouTube &quot;journalists&quot; who only want $ or fame who are either making up stuff or passing info off as their own. He seems to actually have integrity. And, isn&#39;t asking for money in every video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s more ppl than we think who believe the same. But, since there&#39;s really no stories coming out, they don&#39;t even have access to comments sections to talk about it. I doubt many think about it on a daily basis or enough to post on Facebook. </p>
