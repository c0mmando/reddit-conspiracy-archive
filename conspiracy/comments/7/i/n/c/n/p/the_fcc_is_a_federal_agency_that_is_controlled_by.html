    <div class="md"><p>your right. most people living in the time of pre migration to the new world,were in fact living in abject poverty. all across Europe.particularily london. london was a filthy mess. factories and jobs everywhere. people were forced to put theyre children to work right along side of them just to survive. and its because a select few barons owned everything. they worked for them and paid rent to them. its why they left and came to the new world and take they&#39;re chances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In most cases your argument would be completely fair, however, one does not simply go from being a lawyer of a telecommunications company (one that fights regulations from the FCC) to becoming the chairman of the same company he fought against. That&#39;s where most people get off on the wrong foot with this guy.</p>

<p>If he worked as a technical support manager or say somewhere in the corporate level of Verizon then sure, what&#39;s the big deal? But as I said, he is in the position of deregulating a company he used to fight for.</p>
