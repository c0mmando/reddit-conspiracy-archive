       your right. most people living in the time of pre migration to the new world,were in fact living in abject poverty. all across Europe.particularily london. london was a filthy mess. factories and jobs everywhere. people were forced to put theyre children to work right along side of them just to survive. and its because a select few barons owned everything. they worked for them and paid rent to them. its why they left and came to the new world and take they're chances.

       Just because they hold hands and give each other money, and both maximize their gain at the expenses of others doesnt mean there isn't a difference.

       In most cases your argument would be completely fair, however, one does not simply go from being a lawyer of a telecommunications company (one that fights regulations from the FCC) to becoming the chairman of the same company he fought against. That's where most people get off on the wrong foot with this guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he worked as a technical support manager or say somewhere in the corporate level of Verizon then sure, what's the big deal? But as I said, he is in the position of deregulating a company he used to fight for.

       How exactly should we dismantle it? If you have any ideas, I'm all ears. Because voting, prayers, and being upset don't do anything. And as far as I can tell, those are the only things we are allowed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you have some alternative options or ideas, let us know and we will dismantle.
