        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is this a coincidence? </p>

<p>News story causing outrage about police officer executing a young white man begging for his life.</p>

<p>News story causing outrage about the young black girl who filmed the Chicago 4 Facebook hate crime. (Deemed by our judicial system to not be a hate crime)</p>

<p>Stop and think. What does this accomplish? On the surface it appears to be racial division.</p>

<p>My question is, does it cause more division among the lower class? And if so...why?</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the &quot;Embers Project&quot;? I highly recommend looking into it. I also recommend asking some pertinent questions.</p>

<p>Why is the project being funded by IARPA? Could the information accumulated be weaponized against a specific spectrum of US citizens?</p>

<p>Edit: The picture included in the post comes from the Embers Project. It was applied to Venezuela exhaustively to test the program. Shortly after that the project went dark.</p>

<p><a href="https://dac.cs.vt.edu/research-project/embers/">https://dac.cs.vt.edu/research-project/embers/</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s consider a few things. </p>

<p>We know job scarcity is becoming an issue. With the huge advancements in AI and robotics being made its going to affect alot of people very soon.</p>

<p>The majority of those jobs are going to affect the lower class who lack advanced education or training in a skilled trade that robots or automation aren&#39;t capable of doing....yet.</p>

<p>Who tends to use social media platforms as a &quot;viewing experience&quot; more? My personal observations lead me to believe that the lower class does.</p>

<p>I also tend to believe that the lower class, overall..tend to be the ones who react to emotionally charged issues more. Emotional reactions are highly predictable, making them prime targets to manipulate large numbers of people.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider...it&#39;s Christmas time, the shopping season.</p>

<p>Who do you think is going to be experiencing a higher level of anxiety and frustration at this time of the year? Is it even remotely possible that TPTB see this as an opportune time to create more division among the lower class?</p>

<p>These are just some personal observations.. and questions I&#39;ve considered regarding those observations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not telling anyone what the appropriate reactions to these stories are. I&#39;m asking users of this sub to pause a moment...and think..Put aside the obvious emotional responses that any high level AI program running the Embers Project is already anticipating.</p>

<p>Try to have a constructive dialogue. Consider as many perspectives as possible. Strive to understand the real underlying issues causing the frustration and anxiety that make us emotionally predictable.</p>

<p>Avoid being manipulated as much as possible. </p>

<p>Why would ANY company hire Americans when they can hire people who:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Work as long as they want</p></li>
<li><p>Work as many days a week as they want</p></li>
<li><p>Can be fired in a second, because they weren&#39;t true employees anyway</p></li>
<li><p>They don&#39;t have to give any type of leave to</p></li>
<li><p>If they have an accident, nothing can be proven, so the company can&#39;t be held accountable</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Another emotionally charged topic that has caused serious divisive reactions.</p>

<p>Personally..I worked for a company (construction) in Arizona that had to pay a healthy fine for hiring illegal workers. Their hiring practice is still scrutinized by the State two years later.</p>

<p>So there are risks regarding the practice. And there are policies being implemented to a certain degree to deal with the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In construction, their new labor scrutiny may be more related to the contracts they can acquire and what their obligations are under them. I grew up working in an industry that was built on undocumented labor. There simply wouldn&#39;t have been sufficient amounts of native labor available willing to work unskilled agricultural to allow the industry to boom as it did in that area in the last century. It&#39;s not even that there was a preference for undicumented - anyone could walk in and get a job, paid by the lb. I had a friend who did it as a summer job. But most people only did it for a few days before washing out. Because it sucked and basic English skills can get you a still-physical job that sucks marginally less. You certainly wouldn&#39;t move there to do it. Unless you&#39;re moving from a place with fucking nothing.</p>

<p>And employers worried little about fines. That was anticipated potential cost of doing business. The one I worked books for scrupulously withheld and paid taxes on these laborers, though. Because the penalties for skipping that would be business ending. So I agree it&#39;s more tax than not. But also know that the absence of those laborers would simply destroy the local economy. The industry would no longer be workable, the product no longer competitive, and all supporting businesses left to struggle with the economic hole. And this is the class of labor we want to reduce even legal immigration of. So what&#39;s the answer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Valid points. I watched the fiasco of deporting undocumented workers in the Bakersfield area years ago.</p>

<p>They took them to Mexico on school buses..3 weeks later they sent the same school buses down to bring them back.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the answer? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I do know this. America&#39;s steel production is not increasing at a pace that convinces me we are going to see a major uptick in manufacturing.</p>

<p>Personally..I was hoping to see the US  focus on robotics, solar panels, batteries, electric transportation.</p>

<p>These fields are critical to any nation hoping to be competitive in the future.</p>

<p>There are some prominent individuals in the US that are pushing for this...unfortunately they are not having as much of an impact as they could.</p>

<p>America&#39;s foreign policy and fracking practices are proof that oil is still considered to be the security of America&#39;s future. I think it&#39;s either suicidal short-sightedness or a planned agenda to achieve the fracturing of the US.</p>

<p>Anyways..the obvious answer is to increase our manufacturing capabilities in technologies/fields that will be relevant to the future.</p>

<p>Unfortunately..as I stated earlier..it&#39;s doubtful, considering our steel production. And a concrete indicator of any intentions to increase it would be telegraphed by opening &quot;coke&quot; producing plants..which is a mandatory ingredient to the equation. I&#39;m not seeing that.</p>

<p>If they are banking on using other materials besides steel to achieve greater manufacturing capabilities it will cost us valuable time in the overall large scale development of these manufacturing areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. I guess we&#39;ll see more fights at Walmart instead of seeing humans galvanized through interaction at jobs that will promote a stable existence for us, the country and the planet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s rather depressing..even if a &quot;third party&quot; is finally introduced in the US..will they have the backing and cooperation from the corporations that have a stranglehold on this part of the equation.</p>

<p>My point being..even if a third party manages to use this as one of its platforms..what is the realistic outcome of it?</p>

<p>Will it end up being an empty promise due, not to the actual intentions of the party, but the machinations of very powerful entities that do not want to see a third part prevail?</p>

<p>And meanwhile, we just keep losing valuable time as the internal political and corporate wars are being fought.</p>

<p>And I sure as hell don&#39;t want it to continue to a point to where the global community feels they have any grounds to intercede.</p>

The holiday season should be about family and friendship not capitalism. Happy holidays everyone!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real scary thing about AI/Automation is up until now every oppressive order throughout history on some level still needed human beings as the primary substance. You know to grow food, fight wars, craftspeople, skilled builders, wtvr.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re in this bizzare situation where even people are no longer necessary. Wars without warriors where drones just execute people skynet style. Machines doing all the manufacturing, cars driving themselves. Soon They won&#39;t even need us as consumers!</p>

<p>They&#39;re all betting on some sort of trans-humanist nightmare where they all live immortal lives on some sort of Elysium style future. They wish to become like gods.</p>

<p>We should really plan ahead...seeing as how the working class is still making what they need. Put some fail safes in....and use their plan against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get ourselves a Butlerian Jihad. </p>

<p>&quot;The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines,&quot; Leto said. &quot;Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the machines were destroyed.&quot;</p>

<p>We need to meditate and destroy the machine within. All the automatic, robotic, slave to numbers type thinking that keeps our spirit jailed. But stopping the machines is not enough, we have to cultivate ourselves and believe our own abilities to the max in order to compensate for the absence of the mass convenience of the mechanized nightmare.</p>
