        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With MGTOW &amp; 3rd wave feminism, there seems to be a lot more lonely women than before. All my friends are okay with it, like &quot;We don&#39;t need no man!!!&quot; </p>

<p>Here an <a href="https://www.bolde.com/many-smart-gorgeous-women-single-almost-epidemic/">article</a> that I don&#39;t agree with at all, but it&#39;s giving &quot;reasons&quot; why &quot;gorgeous women&quot; are single. It&#39;s written from an ignorant feminist POV. One of the points were &quot;Women are becoming their own husbands&quot;. It&#39;s just sad, like this article is trying to say it&#39;s ok to be super picky, to be a &quot;goddess&quot;.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s another element I think that&#39;s creating more lonely women, is that they are too picky. My friend met an awesome guy, but he has a criminal record for being caught with weed. She stopped seeing him. Another friend stopped seeing a guy because he wasn&#39;t the right kind of smart. And the guy was crazy about her....UGH!! I could go on and on. All the shit about he&#39;s gotta be over 6&#39;0&quot;, gotta be making over 90K, have a house, blah blah blah. If anyone has sources on where this mindset originated, I am all ears. Is it Disney movies? Is it media? What is giving women this arrogance, this view on partner picking? </p>

<p>I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHqHFss1Oeg&amp;amp;t=18s">Jordan Peterson</a> talk about this. I am 34, but was taught CAREER FIRST! I was always barren, so my biological clock was DOA. But for others, I see a huge issue. I have a neighbor who is in her 50&#39;s, and she&#39;s alone. And every time we talk, she mentions, &quot;Well, I need to watch my health, nobody has my back if I were to get sick.&quot; I mean, she picked her life&#39;s path. But it&#39;s just sad, as I see elements of what women are doing now in her. </p>

<p>Just wanted to put some thoughts out in the universe. I am sure there are other threads on this, probably beating a dead horse here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh sure, women were happy being second class citizens, not able to own property, not able to vote, completely dependent and home bound, subjected to rape and abuse with no escape whatsoever. That&#39;s because we aren&#39;t really fully human, right? Some people argue blacks were happier under slavery too, that&#39;s basically what you&#39;re saying. Has anyone considered that women in older generations were heavily indoctrinated to discount, if not ignore, their own happiness and that it was men who carried out the surveys and so didn&#39;t have a clue what they should be asking? I doubt it. Feminism isn&#39;t the problem. The problem is changing the culture to further civilize violent and entitled men, before they completely wreck the planet and destroy us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Marital rape wasn&#39;t outlawed in the US until the 1990&#39;s. DV shelters didn&#39;t exist until the late 1970&#39;s. 90% of rapes are never prosecuted. The comparison studies he&#39;s referring to go back into the 1950&#39;s. I am a modern woman. I lived through and personally witnessed many of the of the changes. When I was a child I was told flat out I was inferior because I was female, I was treated like a servant, as was my mother. I was told my duty in life was to get married and obey my husband. There is so much work left to be done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So women should just settle for men they don&#39;t want to be with?  Some women would regret being alone in their older age, as would men. But some may really like being alone. Being alone is not the same as being lonely. How is having standards for someone you&#39;d spend your life with arrogance? Men won&#39;t settle for fat women, women outside of their race or religion, or women they just don&#39;t want to be with. Women do the same thing. Women deciding they don&#39;t need a man in their life and who aren&#39;t interested in relationships with any person are making their own personal decision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it with my friends, I&#39;m not saying settle for a guy who&#39;s a drug dealer or has multiple baby mamas. I didn&#39;t realize the pickiness until I listened to an incredible interview with a matchmaker. She actually quit, due to the fact women were being outrageous with what they want in a partner. </p>

<p>Men also want partners with the right weight, too, just like women want men of the right height. I just see it more with women now than before, that&#39;s from where I am from. There&#39;s some elements of &quot;settling&quot; with whoever you pick. </p>

<p>I have married friends who are jealous I am single, too. So maybe we all want what we can&#39;t have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So.....women should just get over themselves and settle for guys they don&#39;t want to be with...? We could just arrange their marriages instead if it&#39;s that big of a deal. </p>

<p>I&#39;m married. I didn&#39;t settle and I&#39;m with someone who reaches my very specific standards. I&#39;m not jealous of single people because I&#39;m happy. Married people shouldn&#39;t yearn to be single. I wouldn&#39;t have had a problem with being single indefinitely because I&#39;m not gonna lower my standards because men would see me as ridiculous and impossible to please. I don&#39;t see how your view of women being picky doesn&#39;t reflect on men, yourself in since this attitude towards women is pretty anti woman. It&#39;s like you&#39;re saying we&#39;re not capable of making our own decisions and are hysterical and man haters. No one I know hates men unless it&#39;s one man in particular that fucked them over, and they&#39;d hate another woman for the same reason.  Maybe that&#39;s why you&#39;re single? I&#39;m not trying to be a jerk but this attitude will not help you when you decide to settle down. Harboring resentment towards women will not lead to a healthy relationship. I wouldn&#39;t want to be with someone who thought like this and I wouldn&#39;t settle for it because I deserve better. </p>

<p>The matchmaker thing is anecdotal evidence and if I were a car salesman I&#39;d probably see people as picky too if they didn&#39;t want to buy the cars I&#39;d offer them. Maybe she just took it personally that people didn&#39;t take her advice.  Matchmaking sounds like some ancient shit anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I hear people with these unrealistic “must be” lists, I often ask them how they feel if they were being lined up against some “list” from a perspective partner. Often times these lists are created out of some delusions that the perfect person exists (hint, they don’t). These lists will ultimately have them longing for someone that is not real. </p>

<p>How about just being open to let feelings develop naturally and go with what your heart says, not your list. </p>

<p>As for the “I don’t need a man” argument, no you don’t. You can absolutely go through this life without a partner/spouse. But humans have a natural desire to be with another human. You can deny it, but that doesn’t mean it’s not there. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you want to marry Mr. Perfect, then you had better be Miss Perfect yourself.  </p>

<p>Speaking as a man, when men get into mid-30s, the dating field really opens up.  There are a LOT of women who -- for various reasons -- are now looking seriously for a partner and suddenly finding that there aren&#39;t that many decent men available.  It goes from &quot;not wanting to settle&quot; to &quot;just gotta find a guy who isn&#39;t crazy.&quot;</p>

<p>The competition is real.  Girls who spent their time picking and choosing without working really fucking hard on improving themselves are going to find themselves increasingly behind the curve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. Perfect doesn&#39;t mean a literally perfect person, it means perfect in a way that complements you and your taste. I put effort into looking nice and dressing spiffy because I think there&#39;s a lot to be said about looking your best.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t really speak for the 30 somethings you mentioned, but a lot of women do find their perfect partner at that age since both are more likely to be stable and secure. Women who just lower their standards to a not crazy guy are different than the women I&#39;m talking about because I don&#39;t think a lot of women who hold themselves and their partners to certain standards would suddenly change their taste just to avoid loneliness. I&#39;m talking about women who don&#39;t do that. This is a case by case basis. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t blame someone if they would avoid dating a burger flipper or someone who dropped out of highschool. And I would counter than men would have aversions to dating women who make a higher salary and are more educated than them. I&#39;ve seen this first hand. </p>

<p>Some people do just decide to settle as they get older, but some don&#39;t and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with that and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fair criticism. I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t see yourself long term with someone who isn&#39;t up to your standards and I wouldn&#39;t blame you. </p>

<p>You are certainly correct, but I also determined a long time ago that it is a damn good idea to have a really short list of &quot;required&quot; standards, and then be really open-minded about who you can get along with over a long period of time.  Love and lust are things that can be engineered, and if you don&#39;t understand that then even if you have them at the start of the relationship, almost everyone loses them after a few years (at most).</p>

<p>IMO, my standards weren&#39;t necessarily some long list full of arbitrary or superficial things. Not to say that doesn&#39;t happen, men want double Ds, women want an 8+ inch penis, silly things like that. Looks don&#39;t last forever so that should be bottom of the list, outside of things like obesity or outright being ugly looking to you. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No doubt. We&#39;ve had no issues in the physical love department and it definitely brought us closer in the early stages, we were both able to get to know and appreciate each other. I think if people have that chemistry it actually enhances that aspect. But it&#39;s not as intense as it was of course since adulthood leads to more responsibilities and not as much free time to fool around. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course no one is perfect, but I guess I just mean Mr perfect would be someone who makes me happier in a way I&#39;ve never been, and that making them happy is a large part of that happiness. He&#39;s my best friend and he&#39;s perfect for me and our family dynamic and what a great dad and husband he is only cements that in my heart. And yes, people change, but I think some things are fundemental to who they are as a person. He&#39;s not gonna wake up one day and start abusing me, I&#39;m not gonna suddenly become an unloving mother, he&#39;ll never not be my shoulder to lean on and I won&#39;t ever not be his either. I won&#39;t leave him if he lost his jobs or was disabled in an accident and I&#39;d wipe his butt everyday until the day I died if I had to and I know he&#39;d do the same for me. I&#39;m saying these things because I  knew I wanted a man like him. I almost married someone and settled, but I backed out and it was the best decision I&#39;ve made. Sometimes things like that have to happen before you realize you won&#39;t settle for less than the love you deserve. </p>

<p>The standards I mean aren&#39;t just superficial or materialistic, I think it&#39;s much more and no one deserves someone who doesn&#39;t meet those. If it&#39;s gonna be a forever thing, you gotta do it right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, like others have said, I think the problem is more of a sociological issue.</p>

<p>We have the privilege of being able to aesthetically mold our lives.  Do we want a house?  Do we want stability?  Would we like to experiment?  Are kids in my future?  We, as humans in 2017, have this privilege. </p>

<p>I think the issue is that this privilege is currently being threatened.  It&#39;s quite similar to the &quot;American Dream.&quot;  We are naive to think that our personal preferences coincide with the progress of our species.   But if we take only a trivial scan of just the past 50 yrs, we see that we have largely led ourselves to our own slaughter.</p>

<p>I used to be more on the side that it was a woman thing, but for lack of awareness.  It most definitely, imo, a sociological issues stemming from us not valuing the basic concept of live regardless of our personal input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think the privilege of those things is threatened at all. There&#39;s still families, children being had  (we have a 19 month old) and I don&#39;t think we should live our lives and base our personal decisions over whether or not we&#39;re advancing our species in some sort of animalistic way. We&#39;re definitely not at risk of dying out, birth rates  aren&#39;t static and go up and down historically. There are baby boom and lower birth rates following economic depressions. Infant mortality and women dying during birth was much much higher then and children were raised in poverty needlessly. Not to say they aren&#39;t now, but birth control and family planning has given families the ability to bring kids into this world when they&#39;re stable enough to. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t see it as just a woman thing, because both men and women have their own preferences and standards they expect and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve really not seen the examples op provided being used as examples of deal breakers in the majority of the things women would prefer in men. The 90k thing is just kind of a strawman. I don&#39;t blame anyone for not wanting to be with someone with a criminal record either, it&#39;s not like that&#39;s an unreasonable standard. And the people who can&#39;t find a partner to reach the standards they&#39;ve set themselves would probably be better off staying single because they probably wouldn&#39;t budge on their requirements. Lots of high standards might be hard to come by in a person, but not impossible as long as you hold yourself to similar standards. Like, if an overweight man or woman didn&#39;t want an overweight partner, then that&#39;s hypocritical. Same if they wanted x amount of income or education or what have you. People who wouldn&#39;t hold themselves to high standards wouldn&#39;t meet the standards of the people they&#39;d seek. A professional man or woman with a prestigious career wouldn&#39;t want an uneducated or stupid partner. I&#39;ve been told I had unrealistic standards but I found someone compatible and we&#39;re a pretty good team. Some standards would just be necessary for a relationship to work and being with someone who doesn&#39;t meet them is bad for both parties. </p>

<p>So...men marry down? Why would someone want to marry someone who they feel is below their standards? Women aren&#39;t motivated by some selfish need to be higher class or wealthy when it comes to choosing a spouse. Most people just want to be with someone they love and who they&#39;re compatible and happy with. There are golddiggers, but that&#39;s not representative of women as a whole. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Good for them for rising to the top. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d have to marry down since they&#39;d be surrounded by  men at that level who would probably prefer to be with women on that level with them. There are lots of choices at every level, even if it&#39;s less than other levels. A woman being successful isn&#39;t bad at all. Women shouldn&#39;t stop rising to the top because it might narrow their dating  pool. That&#39;s a pretty antiquated view. Women don&#39;t exist to just become someone&#39;s wife or mother. Men don&#39;t exist to become a husband or a father. We have free will and aren&#39;t beholden to any one lifestyle.</p>

Here in the south I definitely see that, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like that flat across the board. Do these traditional roles you&#39;re talking about mean that women shouldn&#39;t be as successful as men can be just because they should stay home with the kids? Society isn&#39;t going to collapse if women decide they want to succeed in life and have a good career and high income and it&#39;s pretty shitty to place that blame on women who don&#39;t want to conform to &quot;traditional roles&quot;, whatever that means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that article really speaks to that many people. I&#39;m middle aged, professional class, in a more urban coast environment. Which is the demographic I assume this is supposed to apply to. (Availability of suitable partners has certainly been an issue in African Am. communities related to skewed rates in college attendance between genders and a larger societal criminalization of black men we&#39;ve managed that&#39;s created a whole class of felons - but this does not appear to be the subject of this article.) And I don&#39;t see some new influx of single women. Not anymore than were single in the same age group as when I was a kid, anyway, although perhaps less defensive about it. </p>

<p>I think I know more professional couples choosing to be child free in ways I didn&#39;t see much of as a kid than those preferring to remain partner-free. I feel like marriage rates must be down because I know many long term partnered adults who are not actually married, not that they are single for want of any desirable partners. In fact I think I know more single men, but only by virtue of greater contact with the tech industry and knowing more of them struggling socially with Asbergers. I have no reason to think it&#39;s demographically significant. Is there demographic evidence that this is a meaningful trend rather than just the experience of a single writer from an obscure website? Since in the absence of it, my observations are as legitimate as hers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the stand out comment for me.</p>

<p>It does seem like the traditional motherhood role has become stigmatised. I think that is a real shame. The idea that women are judging other women for finding joyful purpose in focusing their energy on the family unit doesn&#39;t sit well with me. It feels counter to feminism. I do wonder if that sort of attitude is driven by guilt about their own life choices. Q</p>

    <div class="md"><p>everything about r/MGTOW/ and r/theredpill is true.</p>

<p>I grew up seeing all the meat head douchebags sleep with women endlessly, while also witnessing the girl chasers do weird things like put the girl on a Pedestal and basically worship feminine energy/the woman.</p>

<p>You can see it virtually every movie, where the nerd never ever gets the hot girl, the douchey meatheads are the heros and archetypes as the guy the every girl wants.</p>

<p>Whats a woman reaches 30, if she hasnt had kids, she&#39;l start looking to settle with a beta provider, and I have seen almost all my friends become this.</p>

<p>I have had the hot women, but also chased some, and eventually settled into mgtow and being a lone wolf who can enter into and leave out of any situation, bar, scene, etc while no longer playing by the rules of any side.</p>

<p>By focusing on my career, investments, hobbies, I&#39;ve paid of my car, house, have money to travel, and I&#39;ve actually found that getting an escort once a month or every other, was a practical and logic choice for me, and it was economical as well.</p>

<p>Though I dont get escorts anymore, I sometimes date here and there, but its always zen and chill. If she wants leave sure, go ahead. If she wants to stick around, sure go a ahead. If she becomes too much, then I put a stop to it and end it.</p>

<p>Imagine you run a business and do 18 hour days with your employees, etc, and sure you can easily score at the bar any night, but a working girl skips the drinks, the bar, the dates, and you go straight to business.</p>

<p>BTW, never said I was an alpha. Ive played the role when necessary, but it breaks my heart treating women like shit. Especially after having a number is awakenings due to qigong and meditation, I wouldn&#39;t want to be an alpha. A lone wolf mgtow is the best of all worlds</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a 36 year old woman, been married, divorced, no kids. I&#39;m seeing the same thing you&#39;re seeing. It&#39;s the destruction of family units. Make people dependent on the government for support, and you can take away more of their freedom. The notion of marriage being a bed of roses with the perfect mate is unrealistic and destructive. People are skipping out the minute it becomes inconvenient. Or people are holding out for that perfect someone. My ex-husband and I are a part of that statistic. Marriage should be about common goals, and obviously love is a big part of it, but love without common, solid goals doesn&#39;t make for a strong marriage. I&#39;m in a solid relationship now, but there are a lot of people out there watching their time slip away waiting on &quot;Mr. or Mrs. Right&quot;. So my take on this is that feminism, and other forces are weakening family units. The middle class has been gutted, so it&#39;s nearly impossible to have a single income family any more. If you break up the middle class, and family units, you have a weak population that&#39;s easier to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! lol I don&#39;t care if people downvote, it&#39;s just funny watching it ping pong. I totally agree with what you&#39;re saying. Media&#39;s influence has not been a positive thing for people at all. It&#39;s like FB. People get depressed because they look at the cherry-picked vacations, weddings and baby pics on other people&#39;s pages, and get depressed that their life isn&#39;t picture perfect. I think this notion of fairy-tale romances is a recent one. Look, being able to be self-sufficient is important, and being emotionally healthy with yourself is important. But to say that &quot;you don&#39;t need no man to be happy&quot; isn&#39;t realistic. It&#39;s not about being beholden to a man, or a woman. It&#39;s about creating a strong family network around you, that you help, and it in turns helps you. We&#39;re social creatures, and to tell us that traditional family units are bad is just downright stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man here, 35 and recently divorced for the first time and I feel your post could sum up the end-phase of my marriage almost to a T. We have two kids that were both under 3 when she said she wanted a divorce earlier this year. It wasn&#39;t an abusive relationship and I provided income for the entire family, combined with subsidies. I was home immediately after work every day to help with the household, run errands, play with the kids - you name it, I did it and happily. She stayed at home and managed our finances, and I gave her a stipend every month for personal spending. We had a plan set in place for her to go back to school once the kids were in day care, and that day wasn&#39;t far off.</p>

<p>Now that we are divorced and some time has passed I believe that she felt like she could do better without me, despite my being a loving and supportive partner and husband in every sense of the word. I think she weighed the value of life without a marriage and all it comes with and compared it to life without one and made what seemed like a practical decision. All in all, I think it came down to money: I just wasn&#39;t making enough for her to feel comfortable as a stay at home mom and she didn&#39;t have the proverbial balls to tell me.</p>

<p>She and the kids struggle a little more now daily since she is now outnumbered, but their needs are met primarily by subsidies, child support and alimony. The kids are in a top-notch daycare and have adjusted to dad being out of the house. She got tuition assistance almost immediately and was able to start pursuing her dream of obtaining a degree and a career she could be proud of.  I got to move back in with mom and start my life over and find out what a primarily Facetime-based long-distance relationship with your children gets to feel like!(<em>spoiler alert: not great</em>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. I am so sorry to hear about your troubles. It&#39;s like people jump into a marriage without even thinking about what it really means anymore. People think they can jump in and out of it without consequence, and generations of kids are growing up seeing that commitment means nothing. One of the problems I think is this weird unrealistic notion of what love is. They think love is being chased down, and fawned over for the rest of eternity by a perfect 10 who will do anything for them, while earning 100k a year. Love is actually commitment in the face of obstacles. Love is common goals. Love isn&#39;t taking off at the first sign of &quot;something better&quot;, or &quot;not good enough&quot;. Obviously people should have the option to get out of an abusive marriage, man or woman. But &quot;not good enough&quot; or &quot;something better&quot;, being the reason to throw away plans in a life-long commitment is fucking stupid. Another thing I have a problem with is why does the woman automatically get custody of the kids? As though a father isn&#39;t as important. Generations of kids with absentee fathers is becoming very telling in today&#39;s society. A lot of men our age that I&#39;ve known, don&#39;t even know basic every day things that my dad knew how to take care of. I know all of this is anecdotal, but men from our fathers&#39; generation are a very different breed from the men coming into their own today. I hope your situation gets better, and I hope that you find a partner who&#39;s down to earth, with whom you can share common goals, and a real love born from commitment to those goals. Make sure she&#39;s not into day-time TV or too many Romcoms lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing that occurs to me. Considering how lately, fewer and fewer women are identifying as feminists, and the realization that feminism has done nothing to improve women&#39;s happiness over the years there will be more and more people who start to think rationally. The younger generations will be looking for the meaning that our generation lost. Try to instill this in your kids. That there&#39;s something worth working for. Men have been getting shit on a lot in recent decades. From alimony, losing custody, down to the point where in places like Spain the way you sit in public transportation is regulated. There was an article about &quot;manspreading&quot; being an issue in NYC.  Think about that. They want to regulate the way you sit. As a woman I got a lot of issues with modern feminism. I was raised to be self-sufficient and independent by my parents and I value that. But the issues that modern feminism is &quot;fighting&quot; over are beyond ridiculous. They make women seem like a bunch of victims that need to become a protected class. Because that&#39;s what we need. To become helpless flowers that can&#39;t be held responsible for anything. Ugh sorry. Rant done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok hits on some good points. I just got out of a 2 year relationship. I did everything I could to make her happy but it was never enough, meanwhile my hapinness didn&#39;t mean much to her. She didn&#39;t think about anyone but herself while I put her first, so I was rarely represented. She was picky as he&#39;ll and had to have everything her way or she wouldn&#39;t participate. She had a lot of good qualities too but selfish, and picky were my biggest ones. Also she was super material.. all of these things being pushed by women&#39;s media and feminist blogs. This isn&#39;t the first girl I&#39;ve met like this, if she&#39;s good looking and you met in the city, 8/10 she&#39;s an entitled stuck up snob. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm. A typical Chinese girl who isn&#39;t from a dirt poor peasant family will have ridiculous requirements for marriage. Like, must have high income, paid-for apartment and a car. And don&#39;t think marrying a farmer&#39;s daughter will let you off the hook--women are in short supply and the bride price has inflated. This is why men in China can&#39;t get married.</p>

It&#39;s a ridiculous double standard, guys have to be long, tan, and handsome with a great job and nice car, and they are expected to carry all the weight.

Or in my case I got tired of apologizing when I knew I was right just to be a peacemaker. She never said &quot;I&#39;m sorry. one time to me in 2 years. I had to fix every problem, every argument. It&#39;s not just this girl either, it&#39;s every attractive chick I date.

<p>Honestly, salaries have gone down since women began working.  When the workforce doubles, you end up getting paid half as much. So in a way it does impact my ability to provide a comfy standard of living to support my family, afford a yearly vacation, and save for retirement.

    <div class="md"><p>I for one know exactly where to start, and I have two points.</p>

<p>One is that the shortening of working days and the increase in productivity should be benefiting our class as a whole, not damaging us. The fact that the opposite is occurring isn&#39;t women&#39;s fault for having the audacity to <em>work</em>. There are far larger economic and political issues at play here. </p>

<p>Second of all, I feel you could make the same argument about any group of people. If we restricted black people, women, people under the age of 25, felons, people below a certain IQ, etc from working, then it would shrink the labor pool and have at least a temporary benefit to you. Of course, you would be horrifically oppressing those people and denying them the right to take care of themselves. You would also be failing to address the root problem which I&#39;ve talked about above. But why is it women specifically who pose a problem here? When you can single out any given group of people if your sole interest is to drain the labor pool for your own benefit? </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/wqNuE">Here&#39;s an image I found that sums up my feelings.</a></p>

<p>Before feminism, women had a strong need and desire to enter into relationships and form families. Women needed men to support them while they had and raised children. At that time, this was seen as the woman&#39;s role. And historically for human history, and biologically, that <em>is</em> the woman&#39;s role. </p>

<p>But feminist society has replaced the man&#39;s role. Women no longer &quot;need&quot; men, and this has drastically changed how women behave and how women seek partners.</p>

<p>On the latter point, today women primarily go for physically attractive men. Over 6 foot, good looking, nice hair and teeth, etc. That&#39;s what they are looking for. The traditional things that attracted women  - status, power, wealth, intelligence - are still there but have taken a back-burner, because the woman is both told those are not important and also has access to state funding, subsidized child care, and career opportunities that were not there before. </p>

<p>So what we have now is a hook up culture. The attractive men are moving from woman to woman and while they will eventually settle down with someone, there are far, far fewer &quot;attractive&quot; men in society than women to go around. If they are all chasing the same thing, what happens?</p>

<p>Then you have women&#39;s behaviour. In a word, women today have become degenerate (generalization warning). They are spoiled, attention seeking, they will spend their youth sleeping around or trying to (chasing as described above), they are vapid and disinterested in politics or spirituality. They mostly have unrealistic expectations with regards to men and the world in general. </p>

<p>The question that&#39;s not allowed to be asked in our society is: &quot;where have all the good women gone?&quot; Where are the women who have values, morality, intelligence, compassion, and want to form stable loving families and raise healthy wonderful children? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly right. That why I put &quot;need&quot; in quotes. They are told they don&#39;t need men, and most buy into the lies, but I believe women need men a lot more then men need women. </p>

<p>Feminism has really sold women a rotten bunch of goods. They have traded raising children for entering into the &quot;rat race&quot; with men, slaving away at corporate jobs they hate to gain material wealth. In short, they have been forced to become men. Colleges and universities are something like 60% female now (and that number is rising).</p>

<p>Men lose out from this too - we don&#39;t get to have families either, but a man can find his passion and pour himself into that work and be content with it alone in a way that few women can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always wondered how r/conspiracy and r/theredpill where so different in that they both recognize basic truth of our modern context, but they aren&#39;t aligned in emotional response.
r/conspiracy is mostly spiritually christian and still feel mercy despite the damage the typical user there also suffers from this &quot;metagame&quot; since it&#39;s made to reward exactly the opposite things the sub values.
On another slide, condoning this behaviour will only propagate it.
Basically until even the nicest guy becomes a fucking merciless demon without empathy this won&#39;t change.
The family is the exact opposite of individualism. On various levels we are pushed to live an individualism which oppose the family values, and into a family to make these values feels opportunistic and individualistic.
And the true catch 21 is that this has been pushed as respectable. So a woman who sees a guy who would like to start a family early is looking at a weakling who wouldn&#39;t know better, or atleast would feel an immense &quot;herd message&quot; inside her of taking control of the dynamic and spin it right for her, which she sees as her right since she previously allowed that right to different men and she finds herself in the dominant position. At the same time, they get old and the balance shift in favor of the man who now finds himself in the position of the woman who made him suffer and he wonders too &quot;shouldn&#39;t i now be an egoist and make her suffer?&quot; because that&#39;s the karma. And the woman who wanted to give the lesson to a weakling is now the weakling who deserves a lesson but it&#39;s too old to stand that.
And meanwhile someone is laughing behind both back. It&#39;s obvious that once you come second you are better not feeling anything, it&#39;s already outside of human scope to have that relationship, it&#39;s only for fun. And the world goes around and around and around.
Also, if you realize all of this early, nothing says you won&#39;t try your luck on someone who is part of it or worse can&#39;t see you are not part of it (Double fail!). And nothing says that the dynamic will shift later since the societal pull will always be there at the edges of your mind.
All considered women don&#39;t have the brain or the will to stand this because when it happen to them they are mostly defenseless. And when the men get on the right track, they basically are already so emotionally damaged to not be able to stand for the damage of another.
So we all go home and buy stupid shit. Or learn to be enough short-circuited emotionally that their past problem becomes their only possible solution.
Men? they will find younger girls to have fun with. Women? they will find an enough desperate man to venture through control and make company to death. Life has already gone at this point.
Life basically slips through the crack of the system before people even understand the system they are in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand:</p>

<p>1] It creates mindless-spenders, who use most of their income on chasing feelings and impulses.</p>

<p>2] you have a conspiracy to make westerns adopt &#39;equality of outcome&#39; ideology, and in such, deconstructive ideology for representative liberalism. </p>

<p>How?  </p>

<p>When everyone is seen as being special by nature of existing, and everyone is seen as deserving just as much by matter of existing, you have a socialist state in construct, allowing communism in time. Communism is possible ONLY, as marxs put it, through revolutionary deconstructions of culture. Now, look up critical-theory and its historic/philosophical relationship with &#39;modern-feminism&#39; (third and &#39;fourth&#39; wave intersectionality[CRIS]).</p>

<p>Conclusion: By creating a &#39;war&#39; and competition between genders, rather than cooperation and unity as a population, you deconstruct the culture and create new mechanistic means to market products to &#39;new&#39; markets (if a &#39;market&#39; is more of a relationship of exchange, than a product itself).</p>

<p>You actually create an absence of love, by building up a vanity in everyone&#39;s latent human value. This world is full of want-to-be American-Idols.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. Perfect doesn&#39;t mean a literally perfect person, it means perfect in a way that complements you and your taste. I put effort into looking nice and dressing spiffy because I think there&#39;s a lot to be said about looking your best.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t really speak for the 30 somethings you mentioned, but a lot of women do find their perfect partner at that age since both are more likely to be stable and secure. Women who just lower their standards to a not crazy guy are different than the women I&#39;m talking about because I don&#39;t think a lot of women who hold themselves and their partners to certain standards would suddenly change their taste just to avoid loneliness. I&#39;m talking about women who don&#39;t do that. This is a case by case basis. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t blame someone if they would avoid dating a burger flipper or someone who dropped out of highschool. And I would counter than men would have aversions to dating women who make a higher salary and are more educated than them. I&#39;ve seen this first hand. </p>

<p>Some people do just decide to settle as they get older, but some don&#39;t and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with that and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fair criticism. I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t see yourself long term with someone who isn&#39;t up to your standards and I wouldn&#39;t blame you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh sure, women were happy being second class citizens, not able to own property, not able to vote, completely dependent and home bound, subjected to rape and abuse with no escape whatsoever. That&#39;s because we aren&#39;t really fully human, right? Some people argue blacks were happier under slavery too, that&#39;s basically what you&#39;re saying. Has anyone considered that women in older generations were heavily indoctrinated to discount, if not ignore, their own happiness and that it was men who carried out the surveys and so didn&#39;t have a clue what they should be asking? I doubt it. Feminism isn&#39;t the problem. The problem is changing the culture to further civilize violent and entitled men, before they completely wreck the planet and destroy us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! lol I don&#39;t care if people downvote, it&#39;s just funny watching it ping pong. I totally agree with what you&#39;re saying. Media&#39;s influence has not been a positive thing for people at all. It&#39;s like FB. People get depressed because they look at the cherry-picked vacations, weddings and baby pics on other people&#39;s pages, and get depressed that their life isn&#39;t picture perfect. I think this notion of fairy-tale romances is a recent one. Look, being able to be self-sufficient is important, and being emotionally healthy with yourself is important. But to say that &quot;you don&#39;t need no man to be happy&quot; isn&#39;t realistic. It&#39;s not about being beholden to a man, or a woman. It&#39;s about creating a strong family network around you, that you help, and it in turns helps you. We&#39;re social creatures, and to tell us that traditional family units are bad is just downright stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not even sure where to start.  It’s definitely a problem though, since work days should be getting shorter but somehow continue to get increasingly longer for less pay.  Not sure how that’s good for society or ‘culture’ as you put it. </p>

<p>Honestly, salaries have gone down since women began working.  When the workforce doubles, you end up getting paid half as much. So in a way it does impact my ability to provide a comfy standard of living to support my family, afford a yearly vacation, and save for retirement.  Which is what the standard of living included in the 50s. </p>

<p>There is a trade-off whether you want to acknowledge it or not.  </p>
