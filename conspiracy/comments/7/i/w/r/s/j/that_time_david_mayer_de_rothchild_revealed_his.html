       I do regularly interact with interdimensional entities. I have interacted with reptilian interdimensional entities as well. Here's where it breaks for me. Reptiles walking around and trying to scare the normies. Or the whole shapeshifting larp... muh.

       This big white reptile buddy. The leader. The big evil cheese. Word is, him and his are under some constraints going forward because they have compelled themselves into service to the creator.

       We don't progress without everyone. EVERYONE. Positive and negative.  the lightworkers are just as bad as the reptilians. It would please me to no end for the 5th density entities like this to wise up the GvsE is the biggest conspiracy.

       If you are serious I would suggest you consider consulting with a psychiatrist. You are exhibiting classic markers of schizophrenia. There are several web tests you can take to determine if you are at risk. I’m genuinely concerned for you.

       So let me get this strait. When I meditate. Which I do frequently. All the activity the thoughts the impressions.The things that happen in a mind when you meditate... You are telling me that's schizophrenia. In psychology I enjoy Carl jungs work. The conscious and the subconscious. Archetypes. All that. Dreams, Waking dreams, ect. More schizophrenia? I have never hallucinated anything except for that time I smoked Salvia. Can you differentiate every thought and snip in your mind. Which ones are yours. Which ones are stories you once heard. Which ones are put there by marketing and advertising. Which ones are things you make up. That's the beauty of regular quiet meditation. You can spend time sorting through it all. Take a moment and read the DSM on schizophrenia. That statement... wraps 2 nice conspiracies into one sentence. Good times on a Sunday night.

       I don't fully buy into this being evidence that this guy is shapeshifting reptilian. But taking into account that inter-dimensional entities probably do exist(according to my research) and that the Rothchilds are one of the most powerful families in the world(also responsible for much of the chaos and destruction that exists on this planet), a clip like this certainly raises some eyebrows. Not saying that your explanation of "compression artifacts" isn't what's actually going on but I am also inclined to consider whether this isn't an actual case of what I describe in my title.

       If you were a member of one of the most powerful families on the planet... and someone caught you red handed on film shape shifting from human to reptile eyeballs, don't you think you'd be powerful enough to have the tape destroyed immediately? I guess you could posit that these shapeshifters don't have the ability to detect when they are changing forms... but then they would most likely be smart enough to avoid public appearances at all lest their ruse be discovered.

       Makes sense but could there be an alternate explanation, like they don't really care knowing that the majority of the masses are so blind that they won't see it(or care), or as the elites love to flaunt their shenanigans(a la "hidden in plain sight"), maybe they are exposing themselves in public knowing this type of soft disclosure will grant them enough plausible deniability?

       lol I'm not saying that it's the explanation, just providing alternatives. But it is true that elite love to

       I'm just saying that as fun and fanciful as thinking about how this guy might be an alien is... the reality most likely is that it's just a glitch in the video feed. I've seen similar things happen hundreds of thousands of times... yeah it's fun to think that maybe Fresh Price really has an additional Carlton head growing out of his neck... or that Anderson Cooper really has a CNN logo tattooed on his face... but that don't make it real.

       I'm all for applying Occam's Razor and not being so open-minded that my brains fall out... so yeah, I see your skepticism.

       But... considering all of occult shit that the elites are into and my research/experiences of inter-dimensional beings, I don't right this off completely as a camera glitch.

       A compression artifact? No, you can actually see the extra eyelid (a nictitating membrane) move. It's not just single frame.

       The compression artefact explanation comes up so often but I've NEVER seen it happen anywhere.

       Ive watched a bunch of his videos and he just seems like hes over compensating for the evil things he probably knows his family has done. I imagine hes kept out of most of it. The guy spent years building a boat out of plastic and then spent months sailing the pacific with it. His main purpose was to raise awareness of how dangerous single use plastic items are to the ocean.
