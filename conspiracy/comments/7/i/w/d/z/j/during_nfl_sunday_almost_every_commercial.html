    <div class="md"><p>Never owned alexa and never will so I can not personally test it and to be honest I don&#39;t have any interest in doing so. But just because it does not send your spoken words into the cloud immediately does not mean it will not send  them later when you call alexa next time.  Smartphones are not sending it immediately either, I&#39;ve tested it myself. I was talking about a certain subject near my phone with wifi/mobile data disabled, enabled it after a while then I already had the targeted ads about that subject by the evening.<br/>
These devices are not made to make your life easier, these stuff were made to collect data for targeted advertisement and other unknown purposes.<br/>
The scariest part is not that tgese devices are literally spying on you, but the fact itself that people are installing them voluntarily</p>

<p>It&#39;s not for me. I saw a Samsung refridgerator the other day with a &quot;family bulliten board&quot; feature built in - also camera to see inside and automatic inventory of content/automatic online re-ordering (we&#39;re out of _______)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, people just aren&#39;t inclined in general to give away excess money. So once you have it, you have to keep finding new ways to use it. Remodeling your kitchen is a pretty common use of excess money. </p>

<p>This is why I don&#39;t believe in the idea that poverty can be solved without a socialized democratic government run by people who actually want to help.</p>

<p>But that being said, something like a Google home is actually a pretty efficient use of money, all things considered. The mini was available from Walmart for $30 with a $25 gift voucher to Walmart that you got after activating it. I wouldn&#39;t really call it a true luxury item.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also add that privacy is a first-world problem. For people who don&#39;t have clean water, they don&#39;t really give a flying fuck about privacy or the government watching them. Except to the extent that people are watching without helping them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no concept of &quot;excess money&quot;</p>

<p>Money represents goods or labor. Resources are limited and time cannot be recovered, so, when most people know jack about finance, there is plenty of need for planning, not waste. Most appliances and gadgets are frivolous time wasters. Consider the electric knife...ridiculous, as is the refrigerator with an interior camera. The huckster at the store said not opening the door saves energy, which is insane, when those efforts could be directed to solar energy, not figuring out ways to burn less coal.</p>

<p>Socialized democracies do not function well...no better than representative constitutional republics infiltrated by corrupt robber barons and politicians.</p>

<p>A free market is a wonderful thing. When the state &quot;gives&quot; things away, the cost is born by another taxpayer.I am glad you got a satisfactory deal on your gadget.</p>

<p>Privacy is a two way street. I bet the first world people in Flint Michigan had a little more transparency from the state that was knowingly poisoning their water. I doubt that there are no concerns about privacy in Venezuela, where the wrong vote can get you killed.</p>

<p>Google doesn&#39;t care about soap brands--- but <em>selling the data</em> (or trading it for favoritism from the homeland overlords) that&#39;s their bread and butter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have one. I honestly don&#39;t care what it knows, or overhears. Let them suspect anything they want. Doesn&#39;t really matter to me. I only got the thing because I was struggling with insomnia and leaning up and checking my alarm clock, and I wanted a faceless, voice-controlled alarm clock that I couldn&#39;t peep at. It&#39;s fantastic for that purpose. If I want to have a private conversation without it ending up transcribed into plaintext on an Amazon cloud server where the CIA or NSA can read it, I can just, like, walk to another room, out of range of the microphones. It is entirely possible to blend in and appear to accept all sorts of monitoring devices in your life, while still having a high level of privacy. The important thing is to acknowledge the various ways you&#39;re being watched and tracked. People freak out about microphones and cameras in their TVs and smart home devices, but the fact of the matter is that most of those very same people carry a smartphone in their pocket and leave location services on, and Alphabet literally knows their commute and their favorite restaurants and grocery stores, with no intervention from the user at all. It&#39;s gotten to the point where someone actually looks <em>more</em> suspicious the further off the grid they are. I mean, most of us talk about casual rebellion against the police state and maintaining our freedoms, but we still have Prime subscriptions and shop at Amazon with that sweet, sweet &quot;free&quot; two-day shipping. It&#39;s like, hello? If you care so much about privacy, why are you giving Jeff Bezos, very nearly the richest man on the planet, even more of your money? Of course these assholes want to know everything about us and our habits. We&#39;re a commodity. That&#39;s how big data works. People&#39;s personal information and their personal preferences are something you can sell to advertisers in bundles and make tons of bread. When you use Facebook and Google Plus, YOU are the product!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the idea, I just think it&#39;s silly that people will happily have smartphones and post their entire lives on social media or whatever, and then turn around and complain that something is spying on them.

    <div class="md"><p>The last time I watched an entire football game was the 1989 superbowl. The 49ers beat the bengals. It was a good game. It was the last one I watched with any interest whatsoever. You see I was 9 years old, and sports were still pretty interesting. However, I got older and smarter and realized it is just a bunch of jerkoff&#39;s fiddling around with a ball. I still to this day will go play football, basketball or any sport I like. I will go play it. I don&#39;t have the time to watch a bunch of roid freaks play with balls for money. Maybe if someone could knock 50 IQ points out of my skull I could sit through a game. </p>
