It happens all the time in the US with anti gay Republicans. Russia even banned a picture of Putin wearing makeup. I think there is something to this one. </p>

<p>What evidence have you guys come across? We should investigate this!</p>

<p>Edit: I’m not saying there is anything wrong with it. I just think Putin should be honest with himself and the people of Russia.</p>

<p>People are trying to bury this. I must be on to something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who cares if he is? I hate to break it to you, but not liking gays does not mean someone is secretly gay. Revulsion to homosexuality is a deep seated defense mechanism that evolved to warn of those who will not breed for the tribe. It&#39;s only in recent years that Western society has more or less agreed that this is ethically wrong, and that we should behave differently and respect gays. But in much of the world, the default attitude is still the norm. Muslim countries still imprison, if not execute, people for homosexuality. Russia is more progressive than this on the issue, but their culture has yet to adopt an open Western stance of the matter.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s kinda more complicated than that though. Ancient Greece and Rome were totally cool with it, as long as you were the one doing the penetrating. That was seen as Masculine and proper, but receiving the action was considered Feminine and unmanly. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the weird Ancient Greek idea of the Pederastis &quot;educative&quot; relationship, where an older male of higher social rank would take a prepubescent boy as his lover (meaning he hadn&#39;t yet grown a beard). introduce him into high society and politics, and the relationship was expected to change into a very close friendship once the boy became of age.</p>

<p>Hadrian and Trajan, both very powerful Roman Emperors with strong reputations in their time and throughout History, had known male lovers and shunned women. It&#39;s not as black and white as you make it out to be. Realistically, it is better seen as an ebb and flow, with sometimes more and sometimes less being accepted. It also has to do with differences in the perceiving of sexuality, the rigid system we practice today in the West was not how it was always seen.</p>

<p>And I support the LGBTQI movement, believe it or not. When I say Putin outlawed Homosexuality in an effort to counter social engineering efforts, I really meant the entirety of the LGBTQI movement. As I said, while I have nothing personal about those who belong in that group, I think the movement itself is being weaponized to stir a divide as well as to destabilize society by normalizing ideas like transgenderism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the argument can be made transgenderism is not really &quot;normal&quot; as it goes against nature. Sex is not a social construct as there are biological markers as a penis and a vagina/a male brain/female brain. Of course there are mutations(hermaphrodites, intersex) but it would be disingenuous to stay this is exactly normal(not to say these folks are not deserving of full rights as humans).</p>

<p>These folks don&#39;t pose a threat directly but promoting these ideas as normal to impressionable minds can have deleterious effects. Take this study for example,</p>

<p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885">Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden</a></p>

<p>where after sex reassignment surgery, more than 300 Swedish transsexuals faced a higher risk for mortality, suicide ideation, and psychiatric issues.</p>

<p>Again, not to say transgenderism doesn&#39;t exist but to politicize it like the radical leftists did in America and in Canada can add to its destabilization, especially of the nuclear family which some argue is the building block of any healthy society(which I happen to agree with.) Putin foreseeing this tactic, just decided to nip it in the butt as they say and take the extreme measure of criminalizing anything LGBTQI related. </p>
