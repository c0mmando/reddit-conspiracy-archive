        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>NASA is trying to prevent Space X from sending a man to space. Why? Because we&#39;ve never been to space. </p>

<p>When the Space X rocket blew up NASA had something to do with that. Does it not seem a bit coincidental that when Space X is launching Facebook&#39;s satellites the rocket explodes? Why did NASA want the rocket to explode? Because this was one of Space X&#39;s biggest customers.</p>

<p>The next piece of evidence is the Van Allen Radiation Belts. NASA claims that sending someone to Mars isn&#39;t as easy as building a big rocket and off you fly. They say there maybe be radiation in space that they don&#39;t know about and that our atmosphere protects us from.</p>

<p>So here is what I think is going to happen:</p>

<p>A) When the rocket launches it explodes
or
B) When the rocket gets out of the atmosphere and the crew inside dies. How? NASA claims a random ray of radiation zaps the ship, killing everybody on board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Rockets explode, it&#39;s called rocket science for a reason, it&#39;s tough. </p>

<p>2) The Van Allen belts do have radiation, but it&#39;s only a problem for long periods of exposure, like the three month trip to Mars. Astronauts have suffered damage to their eyes and hearts from radiation, though it is minute due to the amount of time they are up there. </p>

<p>Check out the year long experiment to see what they discovered, if you&#39;re willing to actually read some research NASA has done to get a different perspective.</p>

<p>“NASA’s focus now is on sending humans beyond low-Earth orbit to Mars… We are trying to develop the technologies to get there, it is actually a huge technological challenge. There are a couple of really big issues. For one thing – Radiation. Once you get outside the Earth’s magnetic field we are going to be exposing the astronauts to not just radiation coming from the Sun, but also to cosmic radiation. That&#39;s a higher dose than we think humans right now should really get.”</p>

<p>if NK is a puppet state of TPTB it would be assisted in private by public companies like SpaceX/Boeing who just started a privatised space race. </p>

<p>something fucky going on in Antarctica</p>

<p>what was funky about people going there to assess the damage being caused by a global rise of sea temperature ? we are losing a war down there , small sea life that eat algae are dying off because of over fishing   ,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/wildlife/krill.php">krill</a> are a small crustacean and the over fishing is cause of many problems  </p>

<p>it is sold in health food stores as a brain booster , people believe it will make you smarter..</p>

<p>there is a great big shelf breaking off , much of the sea life ( both on land and in the water) are suffering , call it a global disaster  thats not being reported as well as it should ..</p>

<p>there is no hole ..</p>

<p>what there is because of the algae bloom is a drop in temperature below the surface of the sea . the sun doesn&#39;t  penetrate it ..  above the sea level this is a disaster . the rise of water evaporation from the ocean chills then falls as snow .  but because of over fishing of krill the algae bloom is out of control ..</p>

<p>do you see the problem ? </p>

<p>water isnt evaporation . no snow . the Antarctic is heating up . its melting .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s retarded. What of that video has you convinced? Fuckin Steve from secure team&#39;s cool video that contains unsourced photos from satellite missions from 50 years ago, that coincidentally can&#39;t be found outside of other sources pushing a similar objective, really has you bought that there&#39;s a giant hole in the earth? Was it the cool colorful lines bringing up unbanked data about flights? Was it the camera guy closing the hatch while flying over sheets of snow and ice without any further context besides &quot;OH YEP MUST BE A BIG HOLE&quot;. They&#39;re trying to pay their bills by keeping tards entertained with pseudo intellect and Tshirts on their website </p>

The problem with Mars is that it won&#39;t be a short trip, so the exposure to radiation and micro-meterorites will be extensive.</p>

<p>Speculative bullshit like secret moon bases and alien technology easily reaches the front page. Actual solid Apollo hoax content never does.</p>

<p>Also, while I&#39;m not ready to take up the mantle of &quot;flat-earther,&quot; I have also noticed that many pro-flat earth posts are clearly made by shills attempting to muddy the water and discredit other flat-earthers. </p>
