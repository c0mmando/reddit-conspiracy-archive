        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I stumbled on this thanks to another redditor posting it, and I literally could not believe it, thought it deserved a bit more exposure, hence this post. </p>

<p>How could the journalist not have pressed him further about this? Newsies was a film full of KIDS, made by DISNEY for f*ck&#39;s sake... And yet the journalist either didn&#39;t pursue that line of questioning, or if he did, he didn&#39;t print it... I don&#39;t understand how his response wasn&#39;t HELL YES, TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE &quot;NEWSIES PROSTITUTION RING PLEASE&quot;?</p>

<p>Here are some edited extracts:</p>

<p>QUOTE:</p>

<p>&quot;Then he got his second big, starring role in what turned out to be the cinematic Three Mile Island that was and still is ‘Newsies’. “You say something bad about ‘Newsies’ and you have an awful lot of people to answer to.” Bale says with a laugh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe it’s me, but I get the sense that no matter how sunny Bale’s sky gets, ‘Newsies’ will always occupy a corner of it like a dark cloud heavy with hailstones. But Bale maintains he’s philosophical about what would have sent other young careers into smoking tailspins. “I look back on it rather fondly now. It was either go to college or go to California and do ‘Newsies’. I decided to the film. Which was an education.&quot; (Bale says).</p>

<p>“Hey want to hear about the ‘Newsies’ prostitution ring?” Bale offers, happily steering the conversation away from himself. “We shot at Universal Studios, and it was a massive production, with hundreds of extras, which is where I got work for lots of my family and friends, even my dog. But apparently there were a few extra kids who were offering their services to anybody who paid, all during the time we shot there. </p>

<p>There was even a ‘Newsies’ pimp ring. They used the sets, wherever–they were using my dressing room on my days off, I heard later.” &quot;</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://baleheadsblog.com/interviews/1991-2/1997-2/movieline-march-1997">http://baleheadsblog.com/interviews/1991-2/1997-2/movieline-march-1997</a></p>

<p>Also in the article he bizarrely refers to himself, TWICE, as having &quot;no penis&quot; or being &quot;smooth down there&quot;, having not gone through puberty:</p>

<p>QUOTE:</p>

<p>&quot;No I didn’t,” He blurts. “I never did. I’m bald down there, like an action figure.”</p>

<p>And QUOTE:</p>

<p>&quot;I ask Bale if there’s anything the fan network doesn’t know about him yet that he’d be willing to divulge. “I have no penis!” he offers.&quot; </p>

<p>Ibid.</p>

<p>He started at age 13 in Empire of the Sun, directed by Spielberg. </p>

<p>He has acquired a reputation for being &quot;difficult&quot;. </p>

<p>More and more stars who have reputations for being &quot;difficult&quot; are coming forward and claiming to be abuse victims, who presumably tried to end their abuse, rather than as performers who are &quot;over-demanding&quot;. </p>

<p>I wonder if Bales&#39; now infamous meltdown on the Batman set could in any way be related to what he is <em>not</em> saying in this interview...</p>

<p>Bale also seemed fairly chatty about his various co-stars:</p>

<p>QUOTE:</p>

<p>&quot;Bale shot ‘Lady’ more or less back-to-back with Christopher Hampton’s little-noticed ‘The Secret Agent’. “Which was fun–Gerard Depardieu belching in my dressing room with just his underpants on, Bob Hoskins yelling, ‘You f*<em>king c</em>nt!’ at the crew whenever he got in the mood...&quot;</p>

<p>Ibid.</p>

<p>Given what is alleged in An Open Secret (that &quot;Kiddie&quot; movies and shows are funded by pedophiles, staffed by pedophiles and made for pedophiles), that Bale then went from Newsies to another dodgy teen movie may been of note...:</p>

<p>QUOTE:</p>

<p>&quot;Following the ill-conceived ‘Newsies’, there was the ill-conceived ‘Swing Kids’, in which Bale played a Glenn Miller-loving Hitler Youth to Robert Sean Leonard’s lispy Hamburg good kid. The movie was unanimously trashed and died an unceremonious box-office death&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, what? Who thought that was a good idea for a film? Who&#39;s the target audience there exactly...?</p>

<p>Anyway, just thought this deserved to be re-examined, as something other than a largely dismissed comment</p>

<p>Edit: ammendment - as a commentor correctly stated, it was the Terminator set, not Batman set</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. I remember that as the &#39;other&#39; story too - within hours of the &quot;Christian Bale is difficult <em>again</em> &quot; narrative that was being pushed, after that strop he threw on set, another narrative appeared, whereby he was in the middle of an incredibly &#39;emotional&#39; take, and his concentration was blown by noise off-set - him yelling for the hammering to stop, for eg. </p>

<p>All I am saying is - in light of his earlier interview where he mentions child prostitute rings and child prostitute pimps (which I quoted in OP), maybe his &quot;legendary&quot; and &quot;epic&quot; meltdowns on set have a deeper, more disturbing cause...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno. I&#39;ve worked stage production and have a friend who is a PA in LA. Filming can easily be 14hr days, with each take requiring a reset on props, etc, and staying in character requires concentration. It&#39;s easy to get heated when someone fucks up.</p>

<p>Not saying that the prostitution stuff didn&#39;t happen, but I don&#39;t see the link with his outbursts. Normal people would have freaked out just as much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just thought I&#39;d add this, because it always creeped me the fuck out:</p>

<p>Steven Spielberg visited the set of Disney&#39;s 1993 film &quot;Swing Kids&quot; multiple times specifically to see Christian Bale. It was a Hollywood Pictures production (owned by Disney), right after he finished production on &quot;Newsies&quot; and about six years after he first worked with Spielberg on &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;. I first read it on IMDb&#39;s trivia page for the film, and I&#39;ve seen some of his co-stars confirm it in interviews. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re missing the point. Bale is talking about producers doing things with &quot;kids&quot; (that&#39;s his descriptor) after hours on a set, directed by a guy who testified on behalf of Michael Jackson. That really rings no alarm bells for you?</p>

<p>That you, Kenny?</p>

<p>QUOTE: </p>

<p>&quot;But apparently there were a few extra kids who were offering their services to anybody who paid, all during the time we shot there&quot;</p>

<p>The important words in that sentence are KIDS and ANYBODY WHO PAID.</p>

<p>You are correct, he doesn&#39;t specifically name producers, my bad. He says <em>it was anyone with the money who fancied a go</em> which is what...better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d dispute you on the insanity claim, but quite obviously, my reading comprehension is better than yours. I said &quot;kids&quot; in my original comment, you disputed it, I showed you the quote where Bale says &quot;kids&quot;, you call me insane. Way to debate</p>

<p>Your bad? This is a huge claim not backed up by the quote at all, but sure the important part is &#39;kids&#39;, because nobody calls 16, 17, 18, 19year olds kids.  Go look at the imdb go watch the movie and realize that almost all the extras and actors are 16 and older.   Your theory has almost no bite when  you take out the producers and the idea that he&#39;s talking about young children which he is almost certainly not. </p>

<p>Sure bud you&#39;re definitely here for an intelligent debate. For real find a professional to talk to.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so weird. Given the that the article was focused largely on the fan clubs who were obsessed with him at the time (it mentions him being more googled/talked about than Leo De Caprio for eg) - maybe it was a joke? Pretty f*ckin&#39; weird one to make repeatedly though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you original poster. I&#39;ve caught very odd things in interviews with Bale, and was disturbed by the Newsies prostitution rumor when I first heard it. Anybody rambler with Hollywood knows it happens all the time. The 1980s was the worst for Hollywood child abuse though. Well, Bale was a child actor. Few escape unscathed by pedophilia . I&#39;m so disgusted by Hollywood. Strangely Bale seems like a totally different person now from his younger self, physically and verbally/personality...most people don&#39;t even recognize him in Empire of the Sun. I wonder why that poster didn&#39;t reply again after claiming they are Bale&#39;s neighbor? </p>
