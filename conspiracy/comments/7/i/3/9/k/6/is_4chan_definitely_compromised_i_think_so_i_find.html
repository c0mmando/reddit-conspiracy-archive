        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know people call m00t a cuck and basically have exodus&#39;d from there to other communities...</p>

<p>but I find it funny when I try to post a meme I have to disconnect from my VPN or else it tells me my IP range is blocked due to abuse.</p>

<p>it makes me feel they want to have direct monitoring on who posts there and what they say, and a direct line to trace it back to the individuals. 4chan, of all places, should support anonymity.</p>

<p>theres no other reason for a discussion community to block VPNs -- especially 4chan where basically normal posts are abuse anyways. its not like they are suffering attacks where people just say horrible things on a VPN specifically.</p>

<p>since I&#39;m not doing anything crazily illegal, I don&#39;t need perfect security, and its still enough security for me. while at the same time, I get to access content from other countries and avoid certain area restrictions.</p>

<p>sure, a VPN in my house would be more secure in a lot of ways...</p>

<p>but I don&#39;t own a server in Canada, Europe or elsewhere in the world, let alone several places, and I don&#39;t want to have to lease the hardware directly myself. would be expensive.</p>
