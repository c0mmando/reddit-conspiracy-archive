       I know people call m00t a cuck and basically have exodus'd from there to other communities...
      </p>
      <p>
       but I find it funny when I try to post a meme I have to disconnect from my VPN or else it tells me my IP range is blocked due to abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       it makes me feel they want to have direct monitoring on who posts there and what they say, and a direct line to trace it back to the individuals. 4chan, of all places, should support anonymity.
      </p>
      <p>
       theres no other reason for a discussion community to block VPNs -- especially 4chan where basically normal posts are abuse anyways. its not like they are suffering attacks where people just say horrible things on a VPN specifically.

       I'm surprised they still exist honestly. I heard the stories when I was in high school; some actually involving people I knew who made poor choices and became victims of revenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know they had some level of lack of accountability because they themselves did not post it and probably couldn't keep track of all the posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       but I guess they did allow it to go on without interference and left it up

       Like he said either a deal or a red flag. They're not dumb. Going after moot is a big sign to keep away. They need to make it appear like it really is that safe hidden place no one knows about and you can say whatever hidden thoughts you have in your mind.

       Great propoganda campaign too, make people think the idea of the fbi showing up was absurd and just a meme. Then again that guy who did say he was going to blow some shit up did get arrested like 10 years ago iirc

       The people in power run the fed, the cia, the media. If they want something to happen they tell the public it's going to happen. If they want it done they just print money, buy it whatever the cost, and get it done themselves.

       All VPNs get banned from 4chan because people use VPNs when posting stuff that gets them banned. 
It might be done intentionally but it's not anything that can be blamed on the admin of the site.

       Sure it's compromised. That's the new censorship. I got banned for a day for mentioning nuclear 9/11. (Not the first place, won't be the last.) But it's still weird enough to the mainstream that you can find some good info there.

       It's possible the IP of the VPN you're using was used by someone else who misused it. Do they block all VPNs? What's to stop you from setting up your own VPN? How would they know if you're using a private VPN?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right that 4chan should support anonymity, but if they just ban IPs that are repeatedly associated with coordinated attacks (like DDoS), I can understand why publicly available VPNs would end up blocked.

       part of my use of VPNs requires a leased line and server mainly because I like accessing via proxies in other countries along with the tunnel/encryption.

       since I'm not doing anything crazily illegal, I don't need perfect security, and its still enough security for me. while at the same time, I get to access content from other countries and avoid certain area restrictions.

       I'm surprised they still exist honestly. I heard the stories when I was in high school; some actually involving people I knew who made poor choices and became victims of revenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know they had some level of lack of accountability because they themselves did not post it and probably couldn't keep track of all the posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       but I guess they did allow it to go on without interference and left it up

       The people in power run the fed, the cia, the media. If they want something to happen they tell the public it's going to happen. If they want it done they just print money, buy it whatever the cost, and get it done themselves.

       Like he said either a deal or a red flag. They're not dumb. Going after moot is a big sign to keep away. They need to make it appear like it really is that safe hidden place no one knows about and you can say whatever hidden thoughts you have in your mind.
