        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I frequent this sub a lot and I try to stay pretty current with what&#39;s being said, but I don&#39;t post very often. Things seem to be on track for the Zionist NWO, and it seems like no real, good progress is being made for the people. </p>

<p>I saw this comment from u/jmais on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7hzmhh/do_not_forget_vegas/">a post</a> about the shooting in Vegas being, basically, forgotten in the news and leaving us with so many questions. It hit me pretty hard. It sounds like an excerpt from an Orwell novel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I bring it up to friends and associates around me in the Detroit area. <strong>No one believes the talking heads. At all. Just stuck in the grind to pay the bills so there&#39;s no time to care about the truth.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things feel so hopeless. I imagine more people are awake and aware of the &quot;secret&quot; goings on than we like to think... But I&#39;m so pessimistic that, to me, most everyone around IRL looks and sounds totally oblivious of how the world really works (and I know there&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t know). How do we get people out of this cycle? We&#39;re doomed if we don&#39;t start organizing to bring these topics and our opinions into real life where things actually happen...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be under the impression that we live in a world with balanced budgets and a naturally limited supply and distribution of currency.</p>

<p>IF you&#39;re paying for property taxes, you&#39;re paying for the hope that schools will churn out enough people to keep real estate values high enough to allow you to retire one day.</p>

<p>If you actually believe your federal or state income taxes are going to pay for anyone&#39;s children then you&#39;re either a moron or a troll.</p>

<p>I personally sacrifice my ability to make a high income so I can actually raise my kids. I don&#39;t mind helping to pay for public daycare even though I won&#39;t use it, because I know that people with a materialistic mindset would sooner let their children go feral than forgo the illusion of security and entertainment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve worked high profile, low profile. Small venue to truly massive. And I&#39;ve made sure to talk to and promote truth, knowledge, and also gaining perspective with as many people as I could. It&#39;s the same everywhere in the country. Everyone is so caught up in their own daily grind they don&#39;t have time to worry about making a bigger stance anywhere but their bills and their kids they had when they were 20. Those who knew then are now &quot;too old&quot; to do much more than say to younger generations &quot; please if you don&#39;t do anything else so SOMETHING&quot; as if its understood that they&#39;ll soon realize how fucked they are and how it has been allowed to happen.</p>

<p>The &quot;progress&quot; of technology and it becoming ever more pervasive into such an environment you&#39;d think it were meant to keep wool over the eyes of those who haven&#39;t yet broken away from such a dystopia. If Japan has anything to say about how meager and cramped they are, not just literally, in how they go about their daily lives with just that then its almost too late.</p>

<p>Occupy WS was a good start. Bad location; Setting up shop in that locale didn&#39;t do it any justice without outside resources. And the longer it stuck around the more it was infiltrated. Finally people had to get back to &#39;life&quot;.</p>

<p>We could try our damndest to actually hold our reps to accountability and transparency, being the more peaceful route it is certainly preferred. However the process is long and tedious and generally bargains can be struck. What it doesn&#39;t do is remove them as a threat. Unless of course that bargain is a complete and total forfeiture of all assets foreign and domestic, aka justice, and reinvested into fruitful programs that rebuild our infrastructure.</p>

<p>I beleive, honestly, there is only one recourse, and no one wants to admit it, and those who see it and are ready for it are afraid they stand alone. But they don&#39;t. We don&#39;t. We&#39;re all in it together. It will suck for a while... a long while, but the sooner people realize what needs to be done the better off it will be in the end. Im not pushing  for it, the scale wouldn&#39;t have to be massive, but noticed, nationwide, and firm in its resolve. Everyone in that steaming cesspool of congress gots to go.</p>

<p>General strike, armed revolution, growing a victory garden and not eating the feed any longer?</p>

<p>What&#39;s your solution, hombre?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of those are viable options. It&#39;s starts with an idea. Plant a seed.</p>

<p>Growing a garden doesn&#39;t put a damper in any plan, but it does help an individual/familial immediate plan. Enough of those going on could lead to more.</p>

<p>A General strike would be a first &quot;big move&quot; towards seeing actual change. Wrench in the gears stops the machine. The machine doesn&#39;t like to stop. It can&#39;t stop. Remedy. Make amends, concede slightly so the machine continues.</p>

<p>Armed revolution would be the ultimate step. The machine must continue, but now it sees it has no choice: stop working, or change how it works to continue working.</p>

<p>Disorder is a plague to the human psyche when it has been conditioned to live within a &quot;box&quot;, even if it is temporary.</p>

<p>No clear cut solution. No obvious path. It just needs to start.</p>

<p>This would actually be the only thing necessary to destroy the machine. If 10%-15% of the population opted out of the industrial farming system it would destroy those industries and failure would cascade through the rest of the system.</p>

<p>10%-15% of the population choosing a different pattern of being is all that is required to radically alter the path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Know the reference and agree. It&#39;s a matter of getting to that point. How long will it take? I mean, as OP stated, and I can confirm first hand, no one believes the talking heads, but they still don&#39;t want to grow their own food, and certainly not go against &quot;the law&quot;. Confrontation and all...</p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s always &quot; what next?&quot; if indeed that were the case. As we have seen the past several years, this &quot;green&quot;, &quot;organic&quot; movement has taken storm, but the players in the game aren&#39;t changing. A pre-emptive strike? </p>

<p>Guess what, there are that many less who will do their own growing because of the option available, regardless of the power or the truth behind it. Because real work is hard and all that jazz.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be under the impression that we live in a world with balanced budgets and a naturally limited supply and distribution of currency.</p>

<p>IF you&#39;re paying for property taxes, you&#39;re paying for the hope that schools will churn out enough people to keep real estate values high enough to allow you to retire one day.</p>

<p>If you actually believe your federal or state income taxes are going to pay for anyone&#39;s children then you&#39;re either a moron or a troll.</p>

<p>I personally sacrifice my ability to make a high income so I can actually raise my kids. I don&#39;t mind helping to pay for public daycare even though I won&#39;t use it, because I know that people with a materialistic mindset would sooner let their children go feral than forgo the illusion of security and entertainment.</p>
