        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Bribing politicians for political favors is illegal, and if a politician takes a bribe in exchange for a favor that could compromise national security it can be considered treason(uranium one) Than how the fuck is it somehow acceptable that campaign donations are considered anything other than a straight up bribe? Since when a contribution to someone&#39;s personal career considered a donation? Can I &quot;donate&quot; to a politicians cocaine and hookers fund and it&#39;s not considered a bribe since I didn&#39;t technically give it directly to them? But a politician can use campaign donations for an expensive dinner party on a private jet without any legal issues. </p>

<p>Too bad everyone is preoccupied busy throwing childish insults between political parties to seem to notice the &quot;public servants&quot; are wiping their asses with tax dollars on their private jets while laughing together about how stupid we are. Seems like either side would rather have the satisfaction of the other side losing than actually trying to make a difference for the lives of their peers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things need to change. We need to cut the monetary strings that TPTB use to control their politician. When asked about the tax cut for the rich, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-collins-donors-trump-tax-plan-bill-2017-11">&quot;My donors told me to pass the Republican tax bill or &#39;don&#39;t ever call me again&quot;</a></p>

<p>To fix this we need to repeal Citizens Untied. Check out <a href="http://www.wolf-pac.com">Wolf-PAC</a></p>

<p>The other issue is the revolving door between government and corporate lobbyist. Good examples of this are the Goldman Sachs executives Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn. Or the GOP megadonor, Betty Devos, or the Verizon lobbyiest Pai who is going to take away our Net Neutrality protections. </p>

<p>To fix this we need to vote for candidates from both sides that pledge to end the crony capitalism. Judge them by their actions, not their words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The descent from democracy into plutocracy is incremental, but the 2010 Citizens United ruling was a key milestone in that process. No other developed country allows personal corporate &quot;sponsorship&quot; of politicians, for very good reasons. </p>

<p>Citizens United was a judicial travesty, and it has to be legislatively repealed before the US can return to a semblance of representative democracy. The problem is that the corruption is now baked into the cake, and 99% of elected politicians will be &quot;contractually obligated&quot; to vote against any change in legislation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh this is one of the things that I actually dont like.  Most people say &quot;give them two terms&quot;.  But what that means is that the house is now controlled by people who have really no idea what is going on, with no older members to show them.  </p>

<p>So laws and bills are going to be passed by corporations or lobbyists because new politicians just go alrighty then.</p>

<p>If we get rid of all the other problems, then I think it would be awesome to have a guy in the House for many terms, especially if their constituents love him/her and they do a great job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your point. </p>

<p>I&#39;m from the UK and it&#39;s such a closed elitist system here. If I wanted to go into politics it would be almost impossible for me financially. </p>

<p>There is an article on one of the Conservative websites that sites a survey saying that on average the Tory MP candidates personally spend over £40,000 when they run for parliament. If they don&#39;t spend it then they won&#39;t get the job. </p>

<p>If we didn&#39;t have the elitist attitude then we could get rid of all of the MPs who don&#39;t work as hard as they should and abuse the perks of the job.Then we could focus on someones passion and drive for the job. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never had a job where I don&#39;t get a proper interview. We vote for MPs mainly based on their party allegiances. We never know if they&#39;re a hard worker  and actually capable of the job. I&#39;d imagine a really hardworking MP does a lot of hours. </p>

<p>The fact that people are stopped from going to the highest levels of politics to  is ridiculous. There are plenty of people in the country who would make great MPs. There is no way they could afford to pay that money plus leave their jobs a few months early to campaign for a job they might get. </p>

<p>There are some politicians that have done this but it is too much of a risk for most normal working people. The politics in the UK is a closed off world for most people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And no one is born a politician it is largely an aristocracy especially in UK and USA where people born into wealth can get those positions. It&#39;s just the new ruling class. You&#39;re either born into it and the wealth it requires or you have to fight and conquer land to rule it. The problem is that no one is born a politician. Being a politician isn&#39;t a part of your soul, everyone has qualities of leadership and intelligence. So then, what matters is doing what is right for the people you represent. For your polis. And you might make a great candidate but unless you have either millions, or your whole life to spend campaigning we may never know. And even if you had either, I&#39;d you didn&#39;t support the right people you may be hindered even more. So little political policy is shaped by doing what needs to be done in our society it is usually the party line. Don&#39;t support one of the two teams and youre fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money in general isn’t the problem, it’s money coming from those who controls the politicians in exchange for favors. If Donor A wants to give $10,000 to a campaign, it should go through a neutral, third party middleman. The candidate’s campaign receives a check from that middleman, not the donor. In addition, that middleman should act as a watchdog. If an individual or a company donates to a candidate, that candidate wins, and works against the interest of the people by unfairly favoring an individual or corporation on their donor list, a mandatory ethics investigation would be launched. It won’t solve the problem entirely but it could help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good point and a good topic of further debate. What would constitute unethical activity or “the people” would need to be defined. Though something like abortion should be protected by personal liberty.</p>

<p>None of this will ever cross the minds or desks of any politicians, but we can go to work on it. Campaign finance reform, education, infrastructure, all of it. Why not? If Congress does not represent us, why not begin to represent ourselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you can give enough money to a candidate that candidate doesn&#39;t need to worry about getting any more of the $10 donations.  Your handful of big donors are all that really matter because if you don&#39;t appease them they are going to send all that money to somebody else who is going to try to take your place.  And they will have a big advantage.  So you stick with the big donors and say what you must to get elected.  None of what you say to get elected really matters though, because you have your big donors to think about.</p>

<p>Now when you ARE a big donor this is not a big expense at all, it&#39;s a bit like that $10 for Bernie from average Joe.  But let&#39;s say you want to up the anti.  Have 10 or even 20 politicians in your pocket.  Hell why not even a presidential candidate? Now that&#39;s a lot of power to get stuff done.  And when something comes up that benefits you it probably benefits your other billionaire friends as well.  With a few phone calls you can easily work together to control the Senate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that simple. We already have a limit on direct campaign contributions, that limit is $2,700 per person. We also have strict quid-pro-quo laws if intent of bribery can be demonstrated. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC">Citizens United v FEC</a> is a difficult case. The &quot;corporation&quot; was a company set up to distribute a film, &quot;Hillary The Movie&quot;, detailing the same things written about in Clinton Cash. This company wanted to run an advertisement for their movie. The main issue in the case was whether the advertisement for the movie constituted as a political advertisement, and thus would fall under limited campaign contributions.</p>

<p>The &quot;corporations are people&quot; bit comes from the balance between first amendment and the restriction we place on political ads. Corporations are just legal entities, the board running a corporation is made up of people, those people have free speech. How/if we restrict that speech when money invested through a corporation is used to promote that speech, is a difficult issue. It also has chilling effects on journalism corporations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Citizens United does <strong>NOT</strong> affect &quot;SuperPACs&quot;. SuperPACs are non-profit legal entities which pay for political advertisements, internet campaigns, etc; but they do not mention specific candidates. These entities thrive on subterfuge and legal whack-a-mole, and the more laws you pass against them, the more you slowly erode free-speech laws.</p>

<p>I support the CU v FEC ruling as it stands; because I would rather let corporations bombard me with advertisements, than let the government decide what information I&#39;m allowed to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are getting downvotes but you are correct in your analysis. Making something like donating to politicians illegal won’t change corruption one bit. It’ll just go underground or through in-kind donations. Money follows power. Wherever the power is will be where the money is found no matter what “rules” we put in place. Maybe if we stopped giving absolute power in our lives to 535 men and women from gerrymandered districts with no hope of state imposed terms limits, we wouldn’t have to worry about corruption. Everyone from the local dog catcher to Trump is corrupt to one level or another. My vote for dog catcher has a lot more weight than my vote for Senator X. Maybe by keeping power at a closer level we can keep a closer eye on corruption and actually “vote the bums out” more often. </p>

<p>I swear this is huge difference. Like the Koch brothers who will give candidates hundreds of thousands of dollars if you support all of their main platforms. And if you are a Republican running for office and say no to the Kochs, they&#39;ll fund a a Republican to challenge you for the nomination to candidacy. And it&#39;s really tough to win when your opponent starts with a couple hundred thousand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately there are private donations.</p>

<p>I appreciate what you said and what you meant, just keep something in mind.</p>

<p>The United States of America is not a pure democracy. A pure democracy is &#39;two wolves and a sheep voting on whats for dinner&#39;, or &#39;two men and a woman voting on who takes their clothes off&#39;.</p>

<p>What the United States is -supposed- to be is a complex republic designed to make any individual group&#39;s ability to gain full power as difficult as possible. Within this complex there are democratic processes, yes, but it is NOT a democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Switzerland is what could be reasonably called &quot;a pure democracy&quot; and manages to be one without any wolves or sheeple, as you infer, which is a far more accurate description of how the the US is actually run considering how very little control or say the average citizens have over how they are governed, how their taxes are spent, and what they&#39;re actually spent on. </p>

<p>In Switzerland it&#39;s all a direct and strictly &quot;bottom-up&quot; exercise of democracy that requires the fullest degree of public consent and co-operation on local, regional, or national issues as all being part and parcel of a one and the same process depending on how far up it has to go for any governmental actions to take place. </p>

<p>As for the vague term &quot;republic&quot;, it has no specific meaning or qualities that you can really say defines any one thing or kind of state in particular.</p>

<p>The world acknowledges the US and North Korea as both being &quot;republics&quot; and from any study of political philosophy and theory they both actually are one despite the vast differences that exist in how they are each governed. </p>

<p>Countries run by aristocracies or oligarchies in which the ordinary citizens only have a very limited or even no role at all to play in how they are governed can also be considered and very often are called &quot;republics&quot; or representative of a &quot;republican&quot; form of government. </p>

<p>If any so-called &quot;republic&quot; has any redeeming qualities or virtues like applying and upholding democratic principles, recognizing the people as the source of sovereign power, or respecting and protecting their inalienable human rights, and entrenching those values in a formal Constitution those are all very separate matters that actually have nothing whatsoever to do with it either being a republic or declaring itself to be one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Especially now, since 2012 I believe, that the contributions are no longer limited to individuals and a finite amount.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons the United States is no longer a complex republic, it is now a simple republic which makes it historically extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>Today a corporation like Walmart can submit an undisclosed amount of money, as much as they want. Candidates don&#39;t actually have to campaign anymore.</p>

<p>Since 2010, assuming you are talking about <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC">citizens united</a>, which basically says that as long as the donation is earmarked for communications and political ads, it&#39;s considered free speech and the amount cannot be restricted by the government. Except that&#39;s money the politician doesn&#39;t have to spend, so the donation is essentially money directly to the politician. </p>

<p>All these little loopholes and avenues and terminology is to me entirely and all together nonsense.</p>

<p>If these people used simple terms to describe what they were doing it would become very clear where the problems lied.</p>

<p>What you just described sounds like a conflict of interest. A bribe is also a good way to describe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I am talking about cases of politicians getting money in donation from corporations. In the Uranium one deal the Clinton foundation received tens of millions of dollars in donation from Uranium one executives shortly after Clinton approved the deal as secretary of state, and just after Bill Clinton had been paid 500k for a speech in Russia.
If you could point me to the direction of donation Trump received in exchange for political favors than I would use that as an example as well. I&#39;m not a fan of either Clinton or Trump as I made it clear in my post that both sides are fucking over Americans. But also like I said, you seem to be more worried about getting angry at Trump than caring that your politicians are fucking you as well. </p>

<p>Since <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC">Citizens United</a>, a SC ruling that giving money to a politician/campaign is technically free speech.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if we didn&#39;t have legal bribery (&quot;lobbying&quot;), then corporations and rich people would just bribe under the table. I&#39;m not saying lobbying us right, but at least it&#39;s all in the open now. We need to change our politicians if we want this issue to change. And for those of you that believed Trump when he said he would change this, I feel bad for you, because he has just made it worse. </p>
