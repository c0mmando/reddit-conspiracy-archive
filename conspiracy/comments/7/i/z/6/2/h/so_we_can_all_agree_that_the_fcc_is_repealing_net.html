       I'm not really into conspiracies and all that but I had to voice myself, and I couldn't think of a better subreddit to do it in. It hit me as I was typing a simple question online, my internet connection failed and it upset me because I couldn't get the answer at that instant. Imagine just trying to search for simple information but not being able to because these greedy pieces of shit sold you for money. I mean, if this shit goes down no more simply asking questions on the internet. It's truly disgusting what our government is doing to it's people. This is how it starts. Knowledge is power. But people in power want to stay in that position. Keep the masses stupid and brainwashed. If you don't think for yourself someone else will think for you. My dad always used to tell me that.

       I'm not sure if that's the only or even the main reason, but I definitely think it is one. Pure corporate greed is at least as strong a motivator as suppression of information.

       Totally. There's many other different reasons with $$$ being the main one. But money IS power, we all know that. So if you don't have money how do you fight back? Knowledge. Being a step ahead of them, knowing your individual rights and how to apply them. People could say to me "there's still libraries tho" and yeah, no shit. But what the library doesn't provide is unbiased and anonymous information. That's the beauty of Reddit. I mean there was that time where there was a shooting going on in a school, I believe. And people inside the school were posting things on reddit. Info that NO news source had simply because they were not there. It's a different hearing an account from a news source rather than a witness. Like war stories. I used to have a history teacher that was in WW2 and let me tell you, half the shit he saw was not in our history books. That's priceless knowledge.

      <p>
       But the corporate greed is dependent on being able to shut down other sources of information... You can only charge a content provider extra, if you promise to give them access that the other content providers can't get.

       Yup, all those protections it claims to have just dont exist also. ISPS already throttle your speed, they already can have wierd packages based on what sites you use, they can already censor what you see and what websites you visit....

       It absolutely has to be. This isn't about charging more money. How many internet providers do you have available to you? Two, at most maybe? If they want to charge more they could just raise their prices. Where else are you going to go?

       Put simply, it's about turning the open "new media" into a slightly different form of the controlled "old media".

      <p>
       Once the rules are in place, the "mergers" will begin and soon there will only be a few "internet conglomerates" controlling everything on the internet - just like the "big six" that control the old media.

       Blocking access to information and knowledge has been around for thousands of years. It's nothing new. It's just another tactic to push us more in the direction they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, we no longer have to rely on what they allow us. Even if they took away Youtube, Twitter, FB and any other major social media site, we would still find ways to affiliate with each other and share information, even if we had to go back to the old BBS days. If everything goes to hell, I'll personally dedicate a $200 used laptop w Linux thrown on it, to run a fake reddit and irc, so we always will have a place to bitch about flat earthers and bigfoot.

       Yeah, you’re absolutely right. Just look at North Korea. That’s the only silver lining I️ see. People aren’t as stupid as we and they may think. I️ think it’s more of the fear. Desperate times call for desperate measures, as they say. In other words, people will always find a way to fight back. Because no human being truly like to be persecuted and controlled.

       They want to make it unaffordable to the lower and lower-middle class, so they can have fun finding employment without access to basic online search functions and e-mail. This is the start of a class war, and now that the internet's news can be censored and any true free press deleted - they can control their stories of "rebellious" and "dangerous" poverty-stricken folk attacking richies and getting curbstomped by the militarized police. Only problem is that Han shot first, but we'll never know because shh! If you even think about how the rich are probably hiring police to cull the poor, the Gestapo will find you and kick down your door!

       It's all smoke and mirrors, and the masses are being tricked. Here is a comment I made in another thread about "net neutrality":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They are all working together for it. Controlled opposition. Facebook and Google wont have to pay more, and Comcast and the others will continue to not have to compete with new startups trying to lower the prices. Everything is a rich man's trick, and you all are playing right into their hands.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It amazes me, how so many people (even here) are falling for it. If we really wanted to address things, to make the internet more open and free, then we would address the regulations already on the books (and get rid of them). You know, like how Comcast can get local politicians to give them a near monopoly in a city.

       The double think people have on this topic, is mind blowing.

       Agree 100 percent. I️ mean, it’s right under everyone’s nose. Made even more obvious by how many damn times this shit has been shut down to the point where they’re just like “ppl aren’t being fooled as easily anymore, but what are hey actually gonna do about it? Let’s just force it down their throats until they digest it and shot it out. Another one for the books”. We’ve been desensitized, which is perfect for them. I️ mean, how blind can ppl really be, tho? It’s painfully obvious what a violation of modern human rights this is! They might as well purchase the sky since they can own everything, apparently. They meaning the elite.

       We all know Comcast, AT&amp;T and Verizon have a monopoly, we don't want the situation too get much much worse by letting them charge extra for different sites and prioritizing traffic.

       to be honest I don't understand net neutrality. Is it where they close down the Internet and you have to pay to get certain information?

     </p>
     <div class="md">
      <p>
       Here is an example to make it more clear:
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone using TimeWarner Cable sets up a web server and hosts a website on it. We'll call that "Site A". Someone else using AT&amp;T sets up a web server and hosts a competing website on it. We'll call it "Site B". Both sites provide the same service - let's say web-based messaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       A third person using Verizon Wireless wants to use a web based messaging service, such as the one provided by "Site A" or "Site B".
      </p>
      <p>
       With net neutrality, Verizon Wireless has to give their user access to either site at the same speed. All hosts are considered equal. The Verizon user can choose to use "Site A", knowing he'll get the same level of connectivity as with "Site B".
      </p>
      <p>
       Without net neutrality, Verizon Wireless can do a deal with AT&amp;T to give their customers' sites preference over TimeWarner Cable. This could mean the Verizon user gets much slower connection speeds to "Site A" than to "Site B". It could even mean he is blocked from accessing "Site A" at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This of course gives "Site B" an advantage, but only if "Site B" remains on AT&amp;T. So not only has AT&amp;T got a captive customer, but the owner of "Site A" now has a strong reason to change to AT&amp;T. This harms TimeWarner Cable, because their connections become less desirable for hosting servers. This could potentially put TimeWarner Cable out of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       So "Site A" moves to AT&amp;T, and now "Site A" and "Site B" are competing on a level playing field again. So the owner of "Site B" does a direct deal with Verizon - no matter what network "Site B" uses to connect, "Site B" will always get preferential treatment over "Site A".
      </p>
      <p>
       As can be plainly seen, this harms not only the end user - whose choices become more and more limited - but harms the owner of "Site A". This smaller service can't afford to pay Verizon for preferential treatment, and thus is relegated to 2nd Class status on Verizon's network, all but guaranteeing he'll fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The upshot of all this is that without net neutrality, the bigger ISPs will be able to put the smaller ones out of business by negotiating preferential treatment with other ISPs. Likewise bigger content providers will be able to put smaller ones out of business by negotiating preferential treatment with the bigger ISPs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be fewer and fewer ISPs and fewer are fewer content providers, until only the biggest corporations remain. You will have less and less options until you become a passive consumer of the content the big corporations want to give you.

       I’ve noticed rise in censorship on the internet since 2015. That’s my main concern. I’ve read multiple explanations of this ‘net neutrality’ issue. Many are worried they may have to pay more for Netflix. I don’t care about Netflix. I want it to be open, and to allow free-speech. I never saw many problems with it until this Title II of the Comm. Act passed. I also agree with the commenter above. This is not something the FCC should be regulating.

       The internet didn't even exist when Title II of the Communications Act was passed. That was passed in 1934.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're referring to is the application of Title II to Internet Service Providers.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A widely cited example of a violation of net neutrality principles was the Internet service provider Comcast's secret slowing ("throttling") of uploads from peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) applications by using forged packets.[6] Comcast did not stop blocking these protocols, like BitTorrent, until the FCC ordered them to stop.[7] In another minor example, The Madison River Communications company was fined US$15,000 by the FCC, in 2004, for restricting their customers' access to Vonage, which was rivaling their own services.[8] AT&amp;T was also caught limiting access to FaceTime, so only those users who paid for AT&amp;T's new shared data plans could access the application.

       I’ve heard this argument/explanation and a multitude of others. It’s quite confusing. I don’t want it regulated in the way that tv and radio are.  I have 3 ISP options in my area and they’re highly competitive. I don’t agree with shady business practices but I like to have choices. Federal agencies aren’t always looking out for our best interests either. 🤷🏼‍♀️

       Not true. Why did the committee refuse to release the 300+ pages to the public before the 2015 vote? Call me skeptical.

       I don’t know if Twitter, YT, etc. will stop their censorship if Title II is repealed. However, I think it will be easier for competitive start-ups to survive. Google, Twitter &amp; YT are against this move. I know that censorship has become worse since the 2015 move.

       This gets to the heart of my concern. Look at what’s happened in Europe. Federal control of the internet means less freedom, investment etc.

       The funny thing is, that report touches on the exact reasons why people want net neutrality. If AT&amp;T is allowed to treat their own services differently, then competition will suffer. I have no idea how they've tricked you into believing that net neutrality stifles competition. We didn't have it before and have been stuck with essentially no choices when it comes to internet providers. Getting rid of it now won't magically cause mom and pop ISPs to crop up. It'll just give current ISPs free reign to throttle competing services. It can only hurt competition.

       I’m more concerned with content than paying more for Netflix. More Federal regulation is not going to prosper a free, open internet. It will just go back to the way it was before 2015 if the chairman passes it. Honestly, my internet bill has not gone down since then. However, I have seen censorship flaunted like it’s cool. 300+ pages of regs. were kept from the public before this passed in 2015. They would not disclose anything, even when prompted by 2 committee members. This shouldn’t even be in the hands of a federal agency. We’re just not going to agree on this. ☮️

       We definitely won't. You're basically quoting the FCC talking points now. None of the articles you've posted even remotely relate to the points you're trying to make. Something tells me you're not debating from an honest position.

       I am honestly concerned. There are ‘talking points’ on both sides of an argument. This is the disclosure that the FCC refused to allow the public to view before the vote in 2015. It bothers me when these alphabet bureaucrats bypass congress when making these decisions. This occurred in 2015. I am not an FCC fan. I want less regs.

       I believe that you're concerned. I wonder why nothing you post, save the regs, are actually related to the arguments you're making. I also wonder why you can't come up with specific examples of anything that supports your fears. It seems like the only reason you dislike net neutrality is because liberal politicians support it. Conservatives are thrilled to get rid of it. You don't seem to be worried about their motivation, even though we know that they've been lobbied to death by Comcast, AT&amp;T and Verizon.

       The lack of transparency in quickly passing Title II bothers me (last post). State regulated internet could potentially lead to a European situation (2nd Article). I have personally experienced censorship in the past year, especially. I did not see issues like that before 2015. It doesn’t feel good to have your voice silenced for no good reason. It hurts, actually. All they want to do is get rid of the regulations passed in 2015. The internet was fine before they were passed. I don’t want Gvmt. Control of the internet. I wish the FCC was never involved in the first place.

       Censorship isn't going away. Twitter, Facebook, and all the other sites out there aren't going to let people say whatever the hell they want anymore. Nothing being done about net neutrality is going to change that. Sorry that hurts your feelings.

       Both sides have lobbyists. I’m unaffiliated but l lean Libertarian. Your internet will be just fine if the regs. are repealed. Maybe the increase in censorship is a coincidence, but the companies responsible are lobbying hard against the removal of these regs.

       It's pure coincidence. No part of net neutrality is being used by those companies to censor content.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the internet will be fine. Content might change and content providers might go under. What I'm absolutely certain of, is that no competition will be added by removing net neutrality. And no innovation will come from removing it. You've bought into the FCC propaganda hard. It's easy to do, but it still sucks to see.

       Is this an ad? I am suspicious of these net neutrality posts since I know there are very large corporation desperate to keep the status quo and their out of control monopolies. Net neutrality is complex and the label is very misleading. I think that internet giants need to be regulated. Yes. They are out of control.

       No.  the FCC is putting it back into the hands of the FTC because the FCC never should have been involved in anything that isn't directly related to the EM spectrum they were created to regulate.

       This is what I’ve been thinking. The term ‘net neutrality’ seemed to pop out of nowhere. I think it has something to do with the change made in Title II of The Communications Act in 2015. The only thing that I’ve noticed about changes in the internet is an increase in censorship. I want the Open Internet back.

       It's funny how we wag a finger at any country but our own when they do something outrageous, but when we do it, it's not bad. Several countries limit their internet and we get mad at them, but we do it and it's to "boost the economy." It's fucking disgusting how much people will let the govt. get away with because they say something that's good whereas they have entirely malicious intents. People will believe anything, and if somebody who's in a high position says "Oh hey this thing that seems bad will help us," people will just eat it up.

       no. it's just money. plain old crony capitalism. they don't care about you or what knowledge you have. the ISPs just want a chunk of that Netflix/Amazon/streaming media cash. now they can get it by threatening to throttle those streaming companies unless they pay up.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only effect we (as customers) are going to see is increased pricing on streaming services. we're not going to get all the tiered ISP pricing or all the other crap that the scaremongers are pushing. our money is a pittance compared to what the streaming services are bringing in. that's the cash cow the ISPs are wanting to get at.

       Agree 100 percent. I️ mean, it’s right under everyone’s nose. Made even more obvious by how many damn times this shit has been shut down to the point where they’re just like “ppl aren’t being fooled as easily anymore, but what are hey actually gonna do about it? Let’s just force it down their throats until they digest it and shot it out. Another one for the books”. We’ve been desensitized, which is perfect for them. I️ mean, how blind can ppl really be, tho? It’s painfully obvious what a violation of modern human rights this is! They might as well purchase the sky since they can own everything, apparently. They meaning the elite.

       But instead, lets make sure Comcast can not only get a near monopoly of the lines, but ensure it can pick and choose what people get to see over those lines based on who pays it the most money.

       I’ve noticed rise in censorship on the internet since 2015. That’s my main concern. I’ve read multiple explanations of this ‘net neutrality’ issue. Many are worried they may have to pay more for Netflix. I don’t care about Netflix. I want it to be open, and to allow free-speech. I never saw many problems with it until this Title II of the Comm. Act passed. I also agree with the commenter above. This is not something the FCC should be regulating.

       I’ve heard this argument/explanation and a multitude of others. It’s quite confusing. I don’t want it regulated in the way that tv and radio are.  I have 3 ISP options in my area and they’re highly competitive. I don’t agree with shady business practices but I like to have choices. Federal agencies aren’t always looking out for our best interests either. 🤷🏼‍♀️

       Not true. Why did the committee refuse to release the 300+ pages to the public before the 2015 vote? Call me skeptical.
