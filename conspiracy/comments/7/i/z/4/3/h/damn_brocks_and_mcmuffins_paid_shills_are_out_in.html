<p>means this:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>to you? Obviously him talking about his public service record is meant as a personality reference for Roy Moore, and that a long career in public service coupled with an accusation without evidence from someone that <em>admitted</em> to forging her key piece of evidence is not enough to condemn someone. If this was a court case it would get thrown out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When asked why he disbelieved the accusations, he cited his military service.

    <div class="md"><p>So if he has a record of doing that it seems like a pretty obvious thing to accuse him of if you want to try to influence an election right? But you said he has a record of getting the parents permission; that tells me he was aware of what he had to do for it to be legal and was willing to do it, it shows that he <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> molest someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP why do you support Putin, shutting down the VA, believe Erdogan is a righteous man, continue to talk about the previous administration as if they&#39;re still in control, support the idea of pizzagate but aren&#39;t critical about the lack of any movement to stop it, and only use <a href="/u/beansprout10282016">/u/beansprout10282016</a> account to post on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>This is just what I&#39;ve gleaned from a passive overview of your account, but I&#39;m sure you have great answers for all of these, I&#39;m especially curious as to why you&#39;ve created a special account that is just used to post in two subs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, Celery, I’m surprised by your question.  To clarify...I did not know that I was supporting Putin.  But I do think he is the right man to lead his country.  Don’t really know much about him.  I believe that all VA services can be reassigned to other, relevant agencies to manage....healthcare, education (GI Bill), home mortgage guarantee, business loans guarantee, etc...and dissolve the entire VA (and their personnel slots).  I don’t know squat about Erdogan!  Turkey’s president?  No opinion whatsoever.  Yes, the previous admin is still “steering the ship” but the new admin is slowing “turning the ship” in the right direction.  This is because the previous admin scattered loyalists (hundreds of them) into permanent government civilian positions in all agencies and they cannot be fired.  They are the worker bees in government.  I do not need to be critical of the movement to stop PG because I see movement towards exposing it.  I am not an expert in any of these subjects, just a citizen with opinions.  And this is not a “special” account, it is my “only”account.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for replying and I&#39;m saddened that you&#39;re surprised by a question that asks for clarification. </p>

<p>Please become more informed with the VA as much of their issues stem from citizens (which I can only hope as an American since you didn&#39;t clarify of which place you&#39;re a citizen of but speaking critically of America I can only presume) not understanding what the Va doesn&#39;t and doesn&#39;t do. Much of it is split in county VA, State VA, and Federal VA. All are separate and run different aspects. If you believe this supports your thought on diminishing the &quot;power&quot; of the VA, again, please become more informed. As a Vet, and I&#39;m sure my fellow Vets will attest, the VA&#39;s issues stem far further than the VA. It&#39;s just easier to blame one source than many.</p>

<p>Apologies if I misread your Putin support, I based it upon this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/636z46/russia_hit_by_terror_attack_shortly_after/dfrsa3c/?context=3">thread</a> </p>

<p>My response to your thoughts on our Government workers as loyalist to the previous administration is that I find it hard to believe that with a record number of civil servants leaving in protest. I can see the counter to this, but if you believe a bigger conspiracy in that they&#39;re there to &quot;steer the ship&quot; counter course, then why put people who would so quickly quit? If it&#39;s a long game, like you&#39;re promoting, then it would imply staunch believers in the cause that wouldn&#39;t waive because the bigger picture. But it sure fits a personal narrative to see the other side. Just a thought.</p>

<p>The Erdogan comment was either deleted/I miss read something/or was deleted. From what I recall it was on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> and stated that Erdogan didn&#39;t deserve the hate for the protestors getting beat up (from <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/turkish-president-erdogans-bodyguards-beat-up-us-protesters-again/">this</a> ) </p>

<p>PG...I&#39;m not seeing anything that moves forward with arrest or even proof. Just saber rattling to get people rilled up. </p>

<p>I asked about the account because Reddit is a huge place with various interests. Yet you&#39;re staunchly enriched in only two subs. If you&#39;re real, in that it&#39;s the only account you use, then the only subs you comment on are safe echo chambers that don&#39;t challenge personal thoughts or critical thinking. If you&#39;re a (American)Citizen like you say, then please take my advice and start extending yourself outside a comfort zone. If you truly believe everything you say, then stand by it but also debate. You want to grow and make change? Then venture away from your own &quot;safe space.&quot;  </p>
