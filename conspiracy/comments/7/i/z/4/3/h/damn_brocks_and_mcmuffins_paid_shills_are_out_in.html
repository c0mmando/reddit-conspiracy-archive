       His public record includes dating young girls and asking their mom's for permission to hang out because he was 30 and they were teens. He didn't deny it either. Literally the only reason you don't care about this stuff is because Trump is behind him.

       I do care.  But not about 40+ years old allegations (that just happen to be puked up now.)  jerry Seinfeld was in his 40s and dated (and married) a high school girl.  Same with Kobe Bryant.  What relevance does this have with Alabama election now.   Why now?  Who would benefit with this lie being believed?

       Ok, so you're going on record here saying that military vets are immune from sexual assault accusations and anything that is past a certain point in time is to be dismissed automatically, right? Because it's only a matter of time before a prominent democrat will be accused of sexual misconduct and when that happens you'll give them the same benefit of the doubt that you're giving Roy Moore right now, correct?

       Wow, where did you get all that?  Your words will not be attributed to me.  There are many military (active!) that have been charged and tried accordingly for sexual assault and they were found guilty and sentenced.  Why all the hate on me for my opinions?  Because you are pushing yours on others?

       WTF? Someone said he's a child molester. You said that it wasn't true. They replied asking how you came to that conclusion, and you said, and I quote: "Because I took a step back and looked at this objectively...and weighed his 40+ years of elected public service. And his accomplishment of graduating from West Point, serving his country in Vietnam, his past public record. Etc... not any side."

       You literally cited his military service as a reason for believing that he is innocent. You just did that a few minutes ago. I provided you the exact quote where you did that. And now you're saying you didn't do that. The comment is still there. I can still see it.

      <p>
       to you? Obviously him talking about his public service record is meant as a personality reference for Roy Moore, and that a long career in public service coupled with an accusation without evidence from someone that
       <em>
        admitted
       </em>
       to forging her key piece of evidence is not enough to condemn someone. If this was a court case it would get thrown out.

       When asked why he disbelieved the accusations, he cited his military service. Since he ran back to his safe space over at The_Donald when questioned about it, maybe you can explain how someone's military service record is relevant to determining if sexual misconduct accusations are true or not.

       So if he has a record of doing that it seems like a pretty obvious thing to accuse him of if you want to try to influence an election right? But you said he has a record of getting the parents permission; that tells me he was aware of what he had to do for it to be legal and was willing to do it, it shows that he
       <em>
        wouldn't
       </em>
       molest someone.

       What child did Moore molest?  Please stop drinking the MSM koolaid.  I think HRC is the most corrupt lawyer/politician to ever walk the sacred grounds of the United States.  And she had enormous help in getting away with most of it...but she will be answering for some of them eventually...shortly, I pray.

       What did he say?  His removal was for fighting for what he believed in...and a rule that PC advocates have shoved down America’s throat without us knowing what was going on in the big picture...chipping away with Christian religion.

       Let’s see he’s said Muslims shouldn’t be allowed in Congress, neither really should women. He’s said the last time the country was great was during slavery. He’s said the gay marriage decision was worse than Dredd Scott. He’s said he might consider the death penalty for homosexuals. Any one of those ought to disqualify him.
      </p>

       And guess what? When you’re a judge you kinda have to follow the law or take appropriate actions to challenge it. You can’t just take matters into your own hands.

       Too bad neither of them have violated court orders, existing law, or the rights of another. They made legal rulings you don’t agree with which can be challenged at the supreme court. Totally different than a judge getting a ruling from a higher court and disregarding it. Sorry you don’t seem to understand how the US court system works.

       Also google whataboutism 😜 were not talking about anyone but Roy Moore and his fitness for office. Other courts have nothing to do with the disqualifying statements he has made or actions he has taken.

       I’m am happy about one thing though, that we can agree to disagree on this.  And I do not claim to know anything about the American court system...I’m not a lawyer nor have I experienced court proceedings...except for jury duty, which they always excused our group for some reason.

       Soros’ organizations are only one part of the globalists “arms”.  There was the previous Saudi “handlers” that controlled our politicians (they are arrested now), and there are some very elite families involved in the control of the banks...all of them.  These “arms” have many fingers that work for them...some rouge CIA folks, rouge FBI folks, rouge DOJ folks, rouge DHS folks, Treasury Dept, State Department, etc..., Antigua, BLM, Muslim Brotherhood, top levels of all American Universities, all MSM, etc....even within the military (small faction).  All the tech billionaires, all Hollywood, all Art communities etc...very scary that America was so clueless of all their infiltration.

       OP why do you support Putin, shutting down the VA, believe Erdogan is a righteous man, continue to talk about the previous administration as if they're still in control, support the idea of pizzagate but aren't critical about the lack of any movement to stop it, and only use
       <a href="/u/beansprout10282016">

       This is just what I've gleaned from a passive overview of your account, but I'm sure you have great answers for all of these, I'm especially curious as to why you've created a special account that is just used to post in two subs.

       Wow, Celery, I’m surprised by your question.  To clarify...I did not know that I was supporting Putin.  But I do think he is the right man to lead his country.  Don’t really know much about him.  I believe that all VA services can be reassigned to other, relevant agencies to manage....healthcare, education (GI Bill), home mortgage guarantee, business loans guarantee, etc...and dissolve the entire VA (and their personnel slots).  I don’t know squat about Erdogan!  Turkey’s president?  No opinion whatsoever.  Yes, the previous admin is still “steering the ship” but the new admin is slowing “turning the ship” in the right direction.  This is because the previous admin scattered loyalists (hundreds of them) into permanent government civilian positions in all agencies and they cannot be fired.  They are the worker bees in government.  I do not need to be critical of the movement to stop PG because I see movement towards exposing it.  I am not an expert in any of these subjects, just a citizen with opinions.  And this is not a “special” account, it is my “only”account.

       Thanks for replying and I'm saddened that you're surprised by a question that asks for clarification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please become more informed with the VA as much of their issues stem from citizens (which I can only hope as an American since you didn't clarify of which place you're a citizen of but speaking critically of America I can only presume) not understanding what the Va doesn't and doesn't do. Much of it is split in county VA, State VA, and Federal VA. All are separate and run different aspects. If you believe this supports your thought on diminishing the "power" of the VA, again, please become more informed. As a Vet, and I'm sure my fellow Vets will attest, the VA's issues stem far further than the VA. It's just easier to blame one source than many.
      </p>

       Apologies if I misread your Putin support, I based it upon this
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/636z46/russia_hit_by_terror_attack_shortly_after/dfrsa3c/?context=3">
        thread
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       My response to your thoughts on our Government workers as loyalist to the previous administration is that I find it hard to believe that with a record number of civil servants leaving in protest. I can see the counter to this, but if you believe a bigger conspiracy in that they're there to "steer the ship" counter course, then why put people who would so quickly quit? If it's a long game, like you're promoting, then it would imply staunch believers in the cause that wouldn't waive because the bigger picture. But it sure fits a personal narrative to see the other side. Just a thought.
      </p>

       The Erdogan comment was either deleted/I miss read something/or was deleted. From what I recall it was on
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       and stated that Erdogan didn't deserve the hate for the protestors getting beat up (from
       <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/turkish-president-erdogans-bodyguards-beat-up-us-protesters-again/">

       )

       PG...I'm not seeing anything that moves forward with arrest or even proof. Just saber rattling to get people rilled up.

       I asked about the account because Reddit is a huge place with various interests. Yet you're staunchly enriched in only two subs. If you're real, in that it's the only account you use, then the only subs you comment on are safe echo chambers that don't challenge personal thoughts or critical thinking. If you're a (American)Citizen like you say, then please take my advice and start extending yourself outside a comfort zone. If you truly believe everything you say, then stand by it but also debate. You want to grow and make change? Then venture away from your own "safe space."

       About the subs that I subscribe to...I subscribe to approximately 20+.  I love lurking them and learning.  They are very entertaining.  I am not out to get into fights or to change people’s minds.  I just like to let folks know what is on my mind about respective posts on subjects I find interesting.
      </p>

       This sub used to be very open to discussion...now, it is only a place to get downvoted to hell for hoping our President does well for our country.  Because of paid shills.  My opinion. Period.
