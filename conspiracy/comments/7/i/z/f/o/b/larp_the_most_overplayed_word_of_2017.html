       It seems LARP has quickly become the new favorite buzzword of the shills and reddit masses. I have noticed great leads, threads, and posts being squashed/ controlled by people yelling “LARP!” A lot of users like Q post are at least good leads to dig into. Whether they are true or false needs critical investigating. Just yelling LARP is pathetic and has no place in constructive debate.

       The term LARP has nothing to do with shill.

       I'd say LARP came from VictoryoftheLight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy was a grandson of some ex FBI agent or something and was making shit up about a stargate in Iran and it being a portal for demons and not aliens. That was what started the LARPS.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was one guy here, he's now been banned, who kept posting the most ridiculous shit ever, in my opinion to make this sub seem bonkers, and would whine when called out.

       Yep. I had heard "larp" in /pol/ a while back, but it didn't ever really get used here at all. As soon as Q was talked about here, however, all the resident trolls can't think of any other word to use when they baselessly try to discredit this anonymous 4chan user.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're seriously working to discredit some anonymous user on 4chan. Why? Why are they so invested to actively troll in the way they do? The fucking anonymous user never even says anything, they just make vague predictions, ask long strings of questions, and post cryptic bullshit that doesn't appear to actually mean anything at all.

       I understand that it is just something one person said, but that doesn't mean that it can't be discussed. If it's true, posting it could be the seed that turns up more evidence- if it's false, the "story" dries up. I mean, we discuss false things here all the time.

       You wouldn't see it so much if people weren't making up shit on 4chan then rushing here to post what they posted there as though it was fact. And then upvoting themselves with alts and calling out people who don't praise they awesome 'investigative powers'.

       On the flip side of the same coin, it is ok to be skeptical of 4chan posts that provide zero evidence to back up their claims. If this sub can point out every time the MSM makes a mistake or intentionally misleads, I think the same standards should be applied to anonymous posts on the chans. I don’t think anyone should be vilified or called a shill for wanting evidence and point out the poisoned well history of 4chan. Not everyone knows what 4chan is or it’s history with trolling social media.

       MSM critique is so strong around here that any time they misreport something, it is used as a baton to beat that outlet anytime some tries to use a different article from that source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, if some anon 4chan post is wrong, it's forgiven and we just move onto the next one with open minds and open hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, if you wanted to secretly start spreading false information, anon 4chan posts would be a good place to start planting the seeds. Let the conspiracy communities think they're onto something first, then leak it to bigger media sources once people are talking about it, confirm their beliefs. Suddenly people who believe "lots of people are talking about this" is good evidence of something being true, they've got news of it coming from both sides, maybe pro-stories coming from anon sources and anti-stories coming from the MSM, so there is a decision to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it's all a ton of disinformation and not enough people thinking critically, just coming up with the scenario they want and forcing facts to fit, and anything that doesn't fit becomes "fake" news.

       What word would you use to describe the astroturf that seems to be actively attempting to destroy all of social media then? Calling people shills is a lame ad hominem attack, but paid shills really are all over social media lying and trolling all of us.

       99% of the time, you can't prove shit about someone being a paid astroturfer. Shill has just been used by anyone to debunk and end the discussion whenever it seems like "well I'm right and there's no way I'm wrong, and if this person doesn't see that the only want they're still disagreeing with me is if they're getting a paycheck".
      </p>
      <p>
       And thus, calls of being a shill. It's worst when a couple people agree, so if you had some buddies on this forum, you could just PM them and say, "Call this dude a shill with me" and then you've totally shut down a differing opinion. In this scenario, no one is being paid but one side has silenced another side.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other problem is the belief that a specific stance MUST be a shill because the hivemind has decided it is that way, like how any Clinton supporter can be marked as CTR and that's that. Easy win for anyone opposed. Once again no proof of actual shilling, but the hivemind implication is that Clinton supporters are all paid by CTR, so that's that.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that accusations of shilling are just as harmful as the actual efforts of media campaigns to sway public opinion, and likely, calls of being shills are coordinated by opposition groups to discredit.

       Neither does lying or making up some story on a forum for "actual" discussion. So call it what it is. And if what "it" is, is LARP. Then so it is.

       LARP also happens to be the most overplayed way of discrediting this sub. And by that I mean people intentionally LARP on here with the intention of revealing it and calling out people for falling for it. This should be a sub for skeptics, not a sub for people who blindly believe anything they read

       Underrated comment. This should be a sub for skeptics. Too much conspiracy theory is blindly believed these days. Used to be conspiracies were well researched, backed up with sources as evidence and peer-reviewed before being accepted. Now all it seems anyone needs to do is produce a youtube video, add some eery music and speak over it all mysterious.

       Their predictions have all been extremely vague to the point of being worthless, but you're accusing them of actually being wrong? What have they been directly wrong about? They never actually seem to say anything clearly and directly.
