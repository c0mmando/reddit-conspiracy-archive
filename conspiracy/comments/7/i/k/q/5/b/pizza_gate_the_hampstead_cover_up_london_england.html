       As a heads-up, I discovered this case only a few hours ago so I am not 100% knowledgeable on the entirety of it, but it really got me fired up and I needed to tell somebody because pizza gate is horrific and I have this burning itch to expose it. I'm really frustrated that
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       was shut down a year ago because when I find compelling pizza gate evidence, I don't really know where to post so
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       seems to be the most fitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I discovered this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nRdzn3tC7Y">
        video
       </a>
       in my suggested. The description from the YouTube channel tells a better job than I. More links and information below.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2014 the video testimony of two children, Alisa, aged 9 and Gabriel, aged 8 was leaked onto the internet. The world looked on in compassionate horror as A and G described to their loving mother and her supportive partner whose strength had earned their trust graphic and appalling ritualistic abuse at the hands of their father and the rest of a widespread cult operating in and around Hampstead, UK – one of London’s wealthiest areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        A and G alleged that their father was the head of a cult that violated children and procured babies for ritual torture, slaughter and consumption. All the staff at their school, Christ Church Primary Hampstead were cult members. The 40 or so children of 20 “special” families were also being abused at the school and in other locations. Abusers included local churchmen, police officers, solicitors, estate agents, Cafcass employees and members of the wider community. The abuse was filmed; child sex abuse videos and snuff movies were being translated and sold overseas. The children were being forced to torture and kill babies; adrenalised blood was consumed. The children did not know that these practices were not normal – because everyone they met was involved. They had not told their mother because their father had threatened to kill them if they did.
       </p>
       <p>
        The children’s testimony is credible and convincing. Many millions of people believe it.
        <strong>
         Yet the local Barnet police did not investigate it:
        </strong>
        instead A and G were snatched into Care as the cover up began.
        <strong>
         They were forced to retract their statements
        </strong>
        and the case was rushed through the Secret Family Courts. The children’s father was granted access to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        A and G had only ever said lovely things about their mother, Ella Gareeva (Ella was Draper but has since changed her name back to Gareeva). They stated clearly that she was kind, generous, loving – a yoga teacher and a vegan. She was not a member of the cult, they explained: the cult had wanted Ella to join but she was too good and pure a person to be recruited. Yet rather than give the children back to Ella and her strong and supportive partner Abraham the UK despatched 9 police officers to arrest her!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The father's name is Ricky Dearman. The case went to court. He argued his wife turned the kids against him. He explained his side in an
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyRG9iHess">
        interview
       </a>
       on BBC news. The judge ruled Dearman not guilty.

       Read the Franklin Cover up by John Decamp if you want to go down that rabbit hole. It disturbed me for months. The Satanic occult run the world, and if you want to go down another hole. Check out why sodomy is the ritual for their religion.

       Im sure there is more info out there but here is a source for now. May not be the disturbing revelation of becoming aware of satanic ritual abuse. But this discusses why pedophilia is used besides for sexual gratification.

       No proper police investigation.

       The police appeared to have same attitude as you and therefore didn’t conduct a thorough investigation.

       How can it be dismissed if the kids claims where never properly investigated.

       is this the first you heard of this? or have you gone and watched all the videos? have you seen the interviews of the kids? did you hear what the kids were saying? did you hear them say it was all made up? by their own admission? i am guessing..............no?

       If we accept that where coaxed to lie by one parent then why can’t we say the same of the other parent?

       It’s been a while since I looked into the case granted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to follow a Facebook group that was looking into it so that’s where my knowledge of the case comes from. Group has been banned. Maybe it was over conspiratorial.

       just as much as the next theorist, i want to believe that key figures in society sacrifice children and eat them in secrecy. they are doing it somewhere, i know it, just not in this case. what messed the kids up, was lies about secret rooms, and obviously, telling the cops the truth. i would be interested to look at the wealth of the parents. also, split up parents = quite the hotbed for accusations and mind poisoning. im no fan of the services snatching kids from parents, but i think il raise a glass to them on this case

       it was bullshit, sadly. which is good in some ways, but sad it takes away from real shit happening. better off looking at the IOW and jersey child abuse shit that actually happened. also, government peadophile stuff happening in north london under the prime minister of the time. mi5 were threatening social workers who were going to expose it

       wow. is this really what the UK is like? from the American perspective, we LOVE the British and a lot of us have aspirations to live there.

       I'd say the most scandalous thing happening here is the government hiding MK Ultra and not convicting the pedo ring in Washington DC because people in the government are apart of it too.

       the father is a liar. really bad at acting distraught. "the tears aren't coming michael". then switches to laughing about the allegations. it felt like he was advertising his cult. he was quite proud of how many hits the videos had gotten. he's a lying sack of shit
