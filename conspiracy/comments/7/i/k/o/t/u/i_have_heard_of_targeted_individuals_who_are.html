       A true target will often notice a pattern when they try to tell people what they are experiencing:  They open their mouths, and whoever is listening assumes that the target is coming down with schizophrenia/losing their mind.  A true target will often doubt their own experiences at first, due to how implausible it may seem that anyone should go so far out of their way to produce the psychological effects that are being tested.

       How are psychological effects being tested? Targeting is much more physiological than psychological.

       I'm not too sure of the details for many of them. It is some time since I read accounts of what happened to these various persons. Possibly. Some of the Project Camelot insiders convey early interference, of both benign and a harmful or thwarting nature.

       Yes, that's basically what  "cursing" someone is. Sending a targeted demonic attack against a person, though the target must also be spiritually vulnerable to that attack.

       People who might possess high intelligence, altruism, willingness to act based on conviction, intuitiveness, and other such undesirable characteristics that must be bred out of the peasant underclass?  Some researchers insist that the targets are chosen in an effort to attain accurate data on a cross-section of all human demographics.  A core-sample of human subjects, so to speak, to see how the program affects different types of people.  I find either to be plausible, perhaps it's a mix of both.

       In an attempt to avoid harassment. I will say if you live in a metropolitan area with skills that may be considered a competitor/threat to certain ABC organizations, there is a chance those organizations may apply pressure to stop you from what you are doing. Subtle pressure. Pressure that can manifest its way through the installation of a string-ray tower within a stones throw away from your home, 2am visits, electronic eavesdropping, all the way to the extent of "hearing" subtle foreign thoughts.  When the paranoia sets in, and no one believes you, you have two choices. Continue to work on your project and endure the prolonged intermittent physiological warfare, or stop what you are doing and keep your mouth shut...I would choose the latter.

       Thanks for the info. I feel like these people have discredited me before I even had a chance to go public. It's difficult to explain that though. They also flooded the conspiracy world with disinfo agents all presenting different pieces of the info I discovered with disinfo mixed in.. right before I was going to go public. But I felt targeted all through my life too. by everyone around me it feels like.

       No problem.   Not that it is right, but in all fairness it is there job to distinguish anything that primarily may jeopardize their job security, or be a threat to security in general.  The best bet is to keep a physical journal, do research your in a pub library, and be on the DL until you are ready to talk. IMO

       (Rant) It is also to ensure "others" do not "self actualize", or develop talents, publicize new ideas, discover new technology, works of art or inventions that compete with their own.  No one should be able to get ahead in this world because of their selfishness, paranoia, and and envy. No accolades, award ceremonies, prizes or cash for you and me.  The elite oligarchy and their *grunts know the power of magic, but if we outsiders know and share that with fellow citizens of the world, efforts will begin to try and discredit, disable, and kill.  And sometimes somewhere along the way, they'll make you have voices (and sometimes visions) in your head that are projected via telepathy and clairvoyance.  The reason voice to skull technology is made public knowledge is to make people believe this is the explanation for voices (having a "scientific explanation"), and discredit the idea of telepathic/clairvoyant sources.  If you know they're real and commonplace, you'll be labeled crazy, and drugged either with or without your consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       *apartment maintenance, the gas meter reader, the guy at the 7/11 cash register, your neighbor, the phone and cable companies, their representatives and installers, store owners, pharmacists, medical personnel, cab drivers, street people, and so on to the point you shouldn't trust many people at all.  If the public knew how insidious the infestation of traitors willing to take money for selling out their fellow human beings is they'd be horrified.  But here's the thing; the elite and their grunts are going down with us, because you don't get to burn down your own environment and expect to survive.

       These programs are real, though the purpose of the harassment may not necessarily be to coerce the target into modifying the behavior.  People like Robert Duncan and Barrie Trower claim that the primary objective of such programs is often to collect data.  Targets are not actually targets, as they would most likely be dead at the instant that the intelligence agencies(that perpetrate this sort of activity) willed it.  What they are are often human experimentees.

       I agree with this. MKUltra Subproject 119 focused on "The remote electronic activation of the human organism." Delgado gave an interview to Cabinet magazine before his death saying he later found he could do everything he could do with the stimoceiver (his term for the brain implant he developed) with EM waves- including controlling a dictator at a distance.

       Long, but Duncan succinctly words why different people of different demographics are selected for the program:

       This is Barrie Trower.  He is quoted as saying that "Humans are like guinea pigs, if they want to experiment on you by the thousands they will. And you can be driven to insanity and death, and you just become a tick in a box, without any so much as a feeling."
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMMEQNnSZIo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMMEQNnSZIo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you, the totality of the tactics used upon people amount to torture.  However, in my experience, most of the individual occurrences used as the meat and potatoes of the program can, when looked at INDIVIDUALLY, be classified as harassment.  I have seen a sort of "Chinese water torture" sort of concept being applied with gestures, suggestions, and more.  For the first eight years of my experience in the program, any effects from DEW technology was negligible.  I would experience very under the radar sorts of harassment.  It had an almost subliminal effect, and my first instinct upon noticing it was almost always to brush it aside and to forget about it, because it was so under the radar and not overt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't pretend to know all of the answers regarding why people are targeted. I have to rely on my deductive reasoning capabilities, my own experiences, and my own opinions.  That being said, what I have experienced is about the least efficient way to kill someone imaginable.  A microdose of Ricin or a psychotronic attack to my heart could have killed me with a very small fraction of the effort required to orchestrate the operation which I have experienced for the past 10 years, and would likely be a lot less likely to be discovered.  I believe that it is quite possible that killing/nullifying/preventing the functioning of enemies may very well be a secondary goal of the current system, but I do believe that the primary goal is for the purpose of data collection/science.  The more data that they have to draw from, the more efficient their future endeavors with convincing people of certain things or soft control of the populace may be.  Perhaps the end game in mind is in fact a more perfect way of taking undesirable people out, but there are far more efficient ways of killing people or getting them out of the game than to construct such a system.

       Gestures like someone walked up to you and made faces at you? Suggestions like someone walked up to you and told you want to do? "and more" is ambiguous.
      </p>
      <p>
       If individuals are following you and walking up to you, that is stalking, not harassment.  If it is a group of stalkers or if the stalkers are taking turns, that is gangstalking, not harassment. Harassment has two definitions: dictionary and legal.  The legal definition of harassment:

        https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5haxa1/wiki_legal_civil_harassment_restraining_orders/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very important to use the correct terms. If you were to report "harassment" to law enforcement and the "harassment" does not constitute harassment pursuant to the legal definition of harassment as defined by state penal code, law enforcement will not take a report.
      </p>
      <p>
       If "harassment" does constitute harassment as defined by state's civil code or penal code and a petition for a civil harassment restraining order is granted, the police will take a report as they have to enforce court orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suggestions are not harassment. Suggestions are mind control. If the suggestions are sent via extremely low frequency (ELF) radar, ultrasound or infrasound, the brain would be zapped. Brain zapping induces brain cell death, cognitive impairments and alzheimer's.  Suggestions are physical torture and slow kill.

       Gestures such as making a "pinch" gesture with the thumb and forefinger, poking the roof of their car, forcing their eyes open in a manner reminiscent to "A Clockwork Orange"(I have seen a marked state police officer perform this one), etc.  This usually occurs when I am driving and they are intercepting my route by driving by in the oncoming lane, and happens with varying levels of frequency.  The number of instances that I have seen these three gestures clear as day number in the thousands.  It is a combination of stalking(they know where I am, and where I am headed), surveillance, and harassment.  They seem to be able to grab my attention somehow or other to notice what is about to occur in the oncoming lane.  Possibly a flash of barely noticeable light(blacklight?)  or possibly through a DEW sort of means.  Sloppy/threatening driving in my close proximity, sometimes by a driver who I recognize as a stalker, is also not uncommon and happens with varying levels of frequency/intensity.  The implication is meant to be that they are surveiling me, know where I'm going, and that I am not safe at all times.  These instances are intended to have a psychological effect.
       <br/>
       Suggestions such as: having actors who closely resemble people who I know(not sure if they use makeup/masks/holographic projections to augment this) acting as though they are in agony, are extremely distressed, are taking place in my stalking/harassment, are going someplace that they are not, or are dating each other romantically.

       The assertion that street theater does not exist in these programs is patently false.  Actors/surveillance role players have read scripts and enacted skits in close proximity to me in stores, in restaurants, on the street, as well as while driving.  Typically now that I'm more educated about the program, they try to keep their antics on the road.
       <br/>
       Your assertion that any corporate entity would be comfortable pissing away the requisite amount of money/resources to create such a program solely for the purpose of altering my behavior strikes me as unbelievable.  It is almost certainly government funded, and is most certainly black budget(meaning that you will not be able to find information on it unless it is leaked).
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point we will just have to agree to disagree, because the tactics employed against me do not seem to be in any way correlated to my actions or behavior.  It also does not seem in the least bit viable that any corporate entity would be able to carry out and cover up such resource intensive program.  Perhaps we are in different circumstances.  Perhaps there are different, but similar programs that exist.  Just remember: data is the currency of the future AND no one blows money like Uncle Sam.

       Constant harassment. But it's not just harassment, it is pure evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay; they will torture us nonstop. And then steal your things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dealt with them. There is only one solution to this. They attack we murder them. They do not stop okay;
      </p>
      <p>
       And they're so fucking afraid okay; they're so afraid of being found out. They like using fake police on you.

       Can we please start arming every TI. and declare War on the new Hitler?
      </p>
      <p>
       These people have enormous farms of young women; connected to this and tortured and used for the program under threat of torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arms + kill them. Leave not one of them. Let the entire country explode.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bring to every University; We all have to be armed and we are all sacrificed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't watch this silently while Hitler tortures and murders hundreds of thousands of human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe we let this happen. And we have one mass murder after the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most fucked up country on earth. Just cut the head of the snake and be done with it.
