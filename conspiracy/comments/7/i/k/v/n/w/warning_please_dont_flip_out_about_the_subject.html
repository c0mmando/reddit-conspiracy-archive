       I just have some questions pertaining to different theory/conspiracy subject matter. I'm just wanting to see what other people think, I'm not trying to argue or make of point of who's right or wrong. Now, moving on!
      </p>
      <p>
       Round earth vs flat earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe what I can verify for myself and I really can't say what the shape of the earth is. However I would like to know one simple question. If the earth really is round then why don't astronauts ever show a full 360 degree view showing that persepective?
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 planes as cause of tower collapse vs bombs
      </p>
      <p>
       I like many fellow American have watched that horrible video numerous times trying to figure it out and each time I come away with more questions than answers and I've heard both sides. My question would be is the narrative projected by the MSM the real truth or is something more sinister the cause?
      </p>
      <p>
       Best one for last....
      </p>
      <p>
       Alien abductions for real or are people just making things up?
      </p>
      <p>
       So this one is interesting to me because it's been reported for a very long time and still to this day. I believe Alien life is real but at the same time I'd need to see one in person to become a real believer. Are people really being abducted or are people just making things up for attention?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not looking for super long drawn out answers I just want to see what other peoples' opinions are. And also, if you care to elobarote on what the benefit would be for each said subject that's opposite of the accepted idea from MSM that'd be cool too.

       I'm not sure what you mean, but I've literally flown from DC direct to Tokyo over the top. Every pilot, and a few million other people from related professions would have be in on it, always, since the beginning and continuing to current day. There's too much math, science and proven dependent science to consider otherwise.

       The two towers were hit by airplanes. I know people who saw it first hand. The Pentagon was hit by a plane. I worked on PENREN in wedge 2 and watched it smoking from my office. Building 7 had cut beams and was blown up with explosives.

       There are probably aliens. We probably haven't met them as they probably would just kill us.

       Good points especially the pyramids. No way we can replicate that these days. About the earth I just mean I've never seen a far away 360 panaramic view from space looking down into Earth, does that make more sense?

       Crazy speeds only seem crazy when you forget the crazy distances involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a simple example, no one alive has seen Pluto complete an orbit around the sun, as it takes about 248 years for Pluto to complete one orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next big jump in distance is the Sun's orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. It takes more than 225
       <em>
        million
       </em>
       years for the Sun to complete one orbit around the galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had a lifespan of a few hundred million years, your perception of the movement of the stars would be very different.

       I like the way you think. I was gonna comment that the mind is an incredibly complex thing that we can’t even begin to understand. People do lie and make shit up all the time, but there are also folks that do suffer from mental issues that talk to beings not there, see things that are not there but seem completely sane otherwise.

        Not many scientists are prepared to take tales of alien abduction seriously, but John Mack, a Harvard professor who was killed in a road accident in north London last year, did. Ten years on from a row which nearly lost him his job, hundreds of people who claim they were abducted still revere him.(2005)

       Vedas are stories, not history. Just like the Bible and all the other religious texts. The 911 question was how/why not if it was real, which it obviously was. It’s two CENTS not DOLLARS (or whatever your equivalent currency and break down is called). 🌏

      <p>
       Taking down the towers allows you a narrative to take out Saddam that's family blood shit. Owner needed to demolish the building anyway its prime real estate and the building is dated. $$$ to demolish. $$$ for insurance payout from a tragic accident.

       All of your answers make sense and go in line with my thoughts. I'm pretty certain too that 9/11 was about keeping the money boat afloat as well as protecting TPTB honey pots.

       If they did, it would be called fake, just like all the other imagery they have shown us that proves the earth is round.

       When does the media

       </em>
       "project" the "real truth"?

        Are people really being abducted or are people just making things up for attention?

      <p>
       There are a range of other options, ranging from "people really believe they have been abducted by aliens, but are suffering delusions" to "people really are being abducted, but not by aliens".
      </p>
      <p>
       If aliens
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       involved, another way of thinking about it is "aliens are sampling a native species, much like our scientists would sample a species of animals.

       Do the chimps believe the other chimps when they claim they were abducted by "aliens"?

       That's pretty good right there. That's basically what I was looking for. Considering ill never be able to get into space I will definitely consider that the best I can get. That's a solid video showing it round. So why would someone put so much time into saying the earth is flat?
