Essentially it points out the main ways Bitcoin may falter and collapse in the near future. One of the most important things he talks about is Bitfinex,  the largest online crypto-currency exchange, and how they have been especially sketchy in the past months, having been hacked too. Something huge is happening with them now and people are losing their money.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="/r/bitfinex">/r/bitfinex</a>. It&#39;s happening there. DDoS Attack and no one is getting their money. The ones who say they are are actually bots, look at their language and replies.  </p>

Not sure how far it will fall, but it is due for a reckoning, and soon. First were the innovators, then the early adopters, then the smart investors, and now the &quot;normies&quot; so to speak have hopped on board. That is usually the point at which any stock or investment starts to tank, as the early adopters and investors dump their stock when they see what they feel is the &quot;high tide&quot;. Of course, this is a self-fulfilling cycle, as the mere act of dumping the currency causes a cascade effect that drive it lower. </p>

Is bitcoin the real deal and will go up to 150K before the year is done like my computer programming buddy said or will all the big boys cash out and smash it?  Can&#39;t see that happening any time soon as so many hedge funds are connected to this.  So I am thinking it will go for a few years and keep growing, it will help the economy and puff everything up into an even bigger bubble and then as soon as the largest stakeholders have the consolidation they desire, they will cash out. </p>

<p>Yep. It’s a speculative bubble that got popular, and now it’s time to pop. It’s being treated like stock or something but was designed as currency. It is not sustainable.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was DESIGNED to be a currency. The fact that it has become a volatile speculative vehicle with high transaction charges makes it unsuitable to be a currency, so now its supporters are moving the goalposts and saying it&#39;s &quot;a store of value&quot;. It can&#39;t be that either, because tomorrow a Bitcoin could be worth $20,000 or $1,000. The value of Bitcoin is based on sentiment only, nothing tangible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short answer is that the price of gold has risen in fiat terms, because fiat has lost value due to inflation. It&#39;s value has not changed.</p>

<p>From memory, the price of gold at $35 oz was set by Roosevelt in the 1930s and became increasingly unsustainable as inflation became a problem post WW2. By 1971, the US was haemorrhaging gold from its reserves (because the set price was too cheap), and Nixon had no option but to close the &quot;gold window&quot; and let the price of gold find its true market rate - over ten times the previous official price.</p>

<p>The price of gold does fluctuate in the short term due to market forces, but if you look at the purchasing power of gold over the centuries, it has been remarkably stable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only insane if you don&#39;t put it in perspective.  It only has a ~$226 billion market cap.  That&#39;s nothing for a globally traded (potential) currency.</p>

<p>You are correct that that&#39;s how it works.  You are incorrect regarding which stage we are in.  Less than 1% of people have invested.  Demand is increasing.  The CME Group cited increasing customer demand as the reason for creating the futures contract.  There&#39;s still a long way to go in crypto.</p>

<p>People need to understand that BTC is based on blockchain, and more accurately distributed ledger technology.  This is revolutionary technology that will change many areas of business and government.  Will BTC be around?  Who knows.  It could fall like Myspace to Facebook.  Regardless, from this craze we&#39;re getting great innovation in the distributed ledger space that will lead to some cryptos emerging as currencies and others as niche problem solvers in industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>man! ... I began to use Btc in 2011 and even got into mining them</p>

<p>TL:DR it&#39;s a difficult currency to use esp when you want to convert it into fiat ... and while it&#39;s &#39;concept&#39; of a decentralized currency who&#39;s &#39;value&#39; <del>is</del> was determined by it&#39;s users is a wonderful idea, it has been corrupted in ways nobody could foresee</p>

<p>In fact, I now am inclined to think Btcs were created as the code for a decentralized <em>computing network</em> .. think AI <em>under the guise of a currency</em> and is now being used as a tool to part the fools and their money</p>

<p>my use peaked in mid 2012 when Btc was around $3-400 and it constantly fluctuated then but not much, but 20% is 20% <em>but nobody talked about trading it</em></p>

<p>Then the silk road was closed and exposed and Bitcoin got a lot of publicity in the process ...</p>

<p>and suddenly <em>all these people</em> &#39;noticed&#39; that the &#39;currency&#39; all these people who &quot;shopped on the Dark web&quot; had this tendency to fluctuate wildly with HUGE swing at times ..</p>

<p>and I watched as these &quot;currency speculators&quot; entered the crypto market and start buying the major crypto at the time and Btcs rapidly passed $1000</p>

<p>then things rapidly progressed from ASICS to fucking mining <em>farms</em>! At this point I knew Btcs had been &#39;taken over&#39; by the banksters and it would never again be the &#39;currency&#39; it had been</p>

<p>Since then I&#39;ve watched as the swings have tended ever upwards</p>

<p>BUT, for every win there is a loss .... and this bubble will burst <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts">just look at how Flat the Btc mining rate is and how steep  &#39;fiat&#39; curves are</a></p>

<p>pop!</p>

<p>In fact, I now am inclined to think Btcs were created as the code for a decentralized computing network .. think AI under the guise of a currency and is now being used as a tool to part the fools and their money</p>

<p>One of the most important things he talks about is Bitfinex,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of speculation about Bitfinex, but none has been proven yet.  I&#39;m not vouching for them, but I think it&#39;s too early to say people are losing their money.  Much of what I&#39;ve seen in people&#39;s complaints have been user errors (i.e. sending ETH from a smart contract, etc...).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>having been hacked too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have been hacked last year.  I was around for it.  They were very creative in their handling of it by creating a token and giving it to people for each dollar that was taken.  They allowed the token to be traded on their exchange (people were speculating as to whether Bitfinex would actually redeem them).  Bitfinex eventually redeemed each token for $1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DDoS Attack and no one is getting their money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anything can get DDoS attacked.  I speculate this was largely to interrupt the rise of IOTA.</p>
