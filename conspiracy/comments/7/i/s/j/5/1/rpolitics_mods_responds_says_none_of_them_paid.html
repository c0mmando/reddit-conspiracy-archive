    <div class="md"><p>For sure, I was a Bernie fan at the time and was happy with the amount of support he was getting on Reddit.  Then in a matter of days it reversed and was obscenely pro-Clinton and they even shut down the subreddit of Bernie supporters.  It was bizarre.  After awhile they re-opened the Bernie subreddit but it had different mods and a more pro-DNC bent to it and less anti-establishment sentiment.

    <div class="md"><p>I remember all that, but I&#39;m only going off my personal experience with the comments I make, and other comments I see made. Theres no doubt that the post seemed to be biased, which could easily be due to a CTR type operation hanging out in /new, but I&#39;ve never had any issue when i&#39;ve said controversial shit in that sub, other than a temp ban for calling a shill a shill. Ultimately, nothing would surprise me, but atleast they aren&#39;t trigger happy with bans, like nearly every other political sub. I honestly believe reddit as a whole is still being brigaded by ctr and jtrig</p>

Your other comment in this thread concerning TD and Trump supporters still has no bearing on my comment or our conversation. You honestly think I&#39;m a Trump supporter, don&#39;t you?

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the viewpoints of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are that far out of line with the average Redditor demographics. There&#39;s only a small clique of people with strong Trump support, and there&#39;s little to no overlap between that clique and the average Redditor.</p>

<p>Add to that the fact that Trump supporters are a bit brash at times and therefore more likely to run afoul of the civility rules for the sub, and that small group gets a little smaller.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>T_D is not &#39;very&#39; small compared to Politics , it has 530.000 compared to 3.5 mil subscribers. It&#39;s 1 in 7. And as such should be represented. </p>

<p>Not accounting that both are &quot;echo chambers&quot;, and the controversy about the real number of T_D subscribers, which was a major topic about after elections time.</p>

<p>You are trying to use logic and reality, as if they are the things that can be applied here.</p>

<p>In reality much less people pro-trump probably use reddit, but the voting numbers are much closer. Take into account older non-internet users, and I think the reality should probably be closer to 1:2 or 1:3. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all been redacted and not organic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go ask how Hillary could delete 30,000 emails under sopena. That comment got me negative -172 in 3 minutes and a week ban for asking weather I was being trolled. This same comment would have gotten positive votes before Hillary&#39;s nomination. The takeover by then CTR and now shareblue is obvious and the mods either did nothing or helped. I think I&#39;m banned for life over there now, as the place is just an echo chamber for fake news. Don&#39;t know how this strategy worked on other people, but I was going to vote 3rd party after Bernie, but they turned me to vote for Trump to stop Hillary. Now I&#39;m a huge Trump supporter. </p>
