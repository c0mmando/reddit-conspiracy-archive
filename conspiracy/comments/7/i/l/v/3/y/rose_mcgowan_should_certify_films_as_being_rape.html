<p>The organisation would make sure rapists were not producing or directing, and that the company did not use NDAs or private investigators to cover up rape, pedophilia and sexual harassment.</p>

<p>Movie companies would pay for the RM sign or whatever symbol is chosen to certify a film as being rape free. This would protect actresses and actors.</p>

<p>Would you support this? In the early stages the organisation might need funding through gofundme to advertise which films were ignoring the certification (and hence should be boycotted). After some time, the organisation would become self sustaining, just like Jews and Muslims rake in millions from their certification schemes. The organisation can also hire private detectives to investigate claims to help police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a period of time when it was common for a girl to say &quot;I&#39;ll cry rape&quot; to get a guy off her back. When he was not doing anything sexual. The very threat of being accused is a threat in itself. The acts are serious, but the abuse of the accusations is sure to come. Should we also have a murder free label? How about embezzlement free? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who actually doesn&#39;t know how many times she&#39;s been raped and/or ruphee&#39;d, this response annoys me. </p>

<p>Yes, there are false allegations or legal abuse. But, in general, rape/pedophilia/human trafficking is occuring and has occurred forever. So kindly, gfy with this kind of comment. Chances are you abused a privilege and don&#39;t like being pointed out that not everyone deserves their attractions reciprocated. I have a stalker right now that I want to scream in his face that just because he finds me attractive should I have to alter my behavior and be constantly aware. </p>

<p>When you actually realize what it&#39;s like to consider your safety on a daily basis, you&#39;d abandon this argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Murder is common in other places. And with crime it doesn&#39;t need to be common to be disruptive. How many burglaries does it take to freak out a neighborhood? What about the serial killer in Florida recently? He only killed 3 people. But the whole town was freaking out. Most guys are not predators. It takes only a very few to get everyone changing their behavior. A lot of successful marriages happen in Hollywood between agents, producers, writers, and stars. There&#39;ll be a lot less in the future. Nobody will dare to make a first move. Just like everyone locks up their houses and are always on the lookout for crime. Crime happens, and the perpetrators should be punished. But the rest of us should not have to change our behavior as a result. </p>
