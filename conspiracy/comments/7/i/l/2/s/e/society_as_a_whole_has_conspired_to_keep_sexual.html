<p>At one point, I had two separate neighbors, who were molested by their uncles. 
My own mother and her sister were abused by their father and shared with his friends. 
My daughter was touched inappropriately by my ex boyfriend, who, himself was sodomized as a toddler by his older step brother.
And these are just the people willing to talk about it.
Even today, anyone who talks about these things in &quot;polite company&quot;, is likely to be shunned.
Sex is less taboo than it used to be.
Sexual abuse is still very much so.
People don&#39;t like to be made uncomfortable, they&#39;d really just rather not hear it. 
So most keep it a secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of what you describe is the cycle of abuse. Part of it is shame, even though it is undeserved shame. People feel ashamed that they have been abused, and it makes it harder to come forward. And then, as you said, they aren&#39;t always met with a receptive audience. Some people would rather pretend this shit doesn&#39;t exist than confront the ugly reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, child sex abuse happens outside of the circle of the elite. What is crazy is that so many of us have been victims, or have known victims and somehow the general public thinks the &quot;elite&quot; are above it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My 20 year old single mother was told by doctors/psychologists/whoever else that reporting my abuse would be more traumatic, I’d have to undergo a rape kit, testify, etc. and probably wouldn’t remember anyway (I was between 1 and 2), so why go through all that? So that’s what she did, she didn’t know any better. No one in my family knew but my grandmother, and I only found out because I found a paper my mom had written when I was in my twenties about the incident. It’s still not something we talk about. I don’t resent my mom whatsoever for not pushing the issue further. She was young and doing what she was told was best. But it’s appalling to me that it was suggested. Doctors were right in that I don’t remember any of it, but the trauma is there and I see how it was behind some weird things I did as a child, and the root of my anxiety and depression. Therapy is awesome and I’ve dealt with it, but fuck. Please do not ever fall for the belief that no memory = no trauma. </p>

They cant recall because they don’t have the language to associate to the memories but the sub conscious never forgets.
