       Not now, but I have in the past. You are depressed. There is plenty of point to life. It just depends what kind of lense you are perceiving reality through. You are the master who makes the grass green.

       you can change it over the short term or long term. learn stuff - new practical skills (anything from hacks, develop hobbies and lose yourself in that activity (music, art, writing, crafting, coding, mathematics ~ wherever you're natural ability lies, or perhaps give something a try you have never learned). read books (science, philosophy, fiction, politics, important theorists of our time, or any subjects you have some interest in). go outside, go into nature, talk to random people.. if nothing matters, then don't be afraid. basically.. anything you spend time doing is experience through another lens, and doing these things will alter the way your brain works, thinks and is conditioned/programmed over time

       No more I wills no more trying just doing. I'm in the same boat. But by doing something, i've been writing it has been helping me change my mood. So there seems to be some truth to VinDiesels comment. At least anecdotal. Good luck, and good will.

       you don't need to say anything, you just do it. don't even think about it. fight the resistance to change. you have got used to that nothingness, but you can get your thirst for knowledge and life back if you allow yourself to. it is a mental block. it's not going to happen by itself, it takes your will and effort in order to reverse your daily routines, practices and factors in your life that perpetuate the issue that you face. how you spend your time day by day becomes ingrained into a routine and practice - if you spend your time unfulfilled, engaged in pointless activity with nothing to show for it then over time you will feel futility in life. you must become aware of the causes so you do not fall into the trap of repeating them. you must take time to reverse the bad habits, and soon you will find that the new way of doing things comes easier, and becomes automatic instead of something you put conscious effort into.

        i find the buddhist noble path is a good basic guide to changing this
       </a>
       . look at your life now and ask yourself - are you happy with the way things are, are you happy with the way you have lived your life to this point? so if it hasn't worked for you up now, what is the harm in changing the way you experience reality and go about your life? you have the power, all you need is the will to do so.

       I'll be honest. I find it hard so hard to do anything like even leaving the house or talking to someone. I find it hard to get the will. I think I will try to take it one step at a time.

       I don't want to overwhelm you with info, but it is hard to break down everything to a simple way, but I have tryed my best. You are right, it has to be one step at a time, brick by brick. Start slow and naturally things will start speeding up over time. You can see big changes straight away, over weeks you can begin to reverse habits.. but acknowledge you may face difficulties and to not let them bring you back down into the hole. I find writing things down helps bring greater clarity.. its like a different voice, it can weigh up more logically and rationally, acting as a passive observer, so you can help better understand what the issues are and from there you can form a plan of action in response. This is just one method I have used, one of many, and it is up to you to explore and work whats best for you... try things you've never tried before

       The challenge is to stay positive and live the golden rule when you are thrown obstacles. No matter your situation you could be helping others, and by doing that you indirectly help yourself (become a better human).

       A lot of people go thru that thinking at some point, it’s ok unless you’re contemplating suicide, or it lasts too long and you can’t shake it, if either of these things happen I advise you to seek help. Good luck

       I think, like the other poster wrote that it’s all a matter of perspective, you can see the good reasons to live or you can see the pointlessness of it. Life is better when you can appreciate it. I think individuals find their own meaning in life.

       I struggle with meaning and purpose, I blame our societal overlords for constructing a system where we are battered with psychological tactics that diminish our personal value. I often romanticize the notion of how good it would feel to have a hand in toppling the system, if it helps. Also there's the majesty of nature like sunrise and sunsets, the joy of sharing moments with animals, the tender caress of a significant other, the righteousness of a hard Day's work, memories of our childhood, ect. Unfortunately all I have is nature and work and subsequently I feel mostly hopeless.

       I wonder this. Maybe part of entering the upper echelons of the alleged secret societies that run the world, and have been doing so for ages, is that you are shown what could be construed as magic. It isn't outside the realm of possibility that there are aspects of our reality that science has yet to even guess at, or that has been kept from us. There are conspiracy theories around the use of science as a new religion to control what we think is possible in reality.

       And what motivates them so? They all seem relentlessly driven in some absolute way that I cannot relate to.  And, at the same time, if we mix in alleged notions of systematic child abuse it raises other possibilities. If we assume all this, its hard to decide if its more likely that these people are motivated purely out of lust for children, or if they think they know of occult blood magic involving children suffering and sacrifice, or if goddamn aliens are getting them to bring them children with promises of immortality or something like that. Epstein didn't
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       an occult temple to diddle children.
      </p>

       In any case, I sympathize. You should read some existentialist literature. Camus being the main one. There is no point to anything, it would seem. But for satisfaction it is possible to make a point up and follow that. So maybe the point could be to work against evil.

       Pleasure, satisfaction, cool stuff to do are all quite subjective so I can't really directly answer that for you. Exercise, growing stuff, making food, making arts, playing with animals, learning, practicing something I just learned, kicking it in nature, finding small wrenches I can throw into the machine from my particular situation are all incredibly satisfying for me.
      </p>

       If you feel bad and nothing seems worth it, it sounds like depression. Unfortunately there is an element of bootstrapping required to get out of that--at some point you have to decide to make an effort to change because nobody is going to bother holding your hand through all the introspection and figure it out for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gonna take a wild guess that your diet sucks. If I'm wrong feel free to disregard, but you might be surprised how much a (self-)lovingly made dinner can help your outlook. I've struggled with hopelessness in the past and knowing I had a good meal at the end of the day to look forward to was enough to get by most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, go on a psychedelic voyage with a pure intent to figure it out and heal, and see if you still feel empty afterwards.

       Cool so every time you think "man I really need to do X" just stop right there and go do it.  Don't second guess it, don't judge it, don't debate, just stop whatever you were previously doing or not doing and go do X.

       Bad food makes you feel bad, straight up. It can be a slow process getting comfortable in the kitchen and then polishing your recipes but when you get there, there's nothing else like it. Eating organic and mostly sattvic is a game changer.

       You can do smaller doses of psychedelics where you don't go in too deep. Some of my best trips were "sub-threshold" mushroom doses. If you're scared of it getting too dark that is one thing, no need to force it, but they can be pretty good for realigning, new perspective and shining some light inside.

       Everyone feels that way at some point. The thing that helped me is realizing it goes both ways. If nothing matters anyway, there's really no reason to fear failure.

       We're all gonna die eventually anyway, might as well go after what you want and maybe have some fun in the meantime. What's the worst that could happen?

       Mood is all that really matters imo . Life can be pointless and you can still be in a good mood and it doesn't matter.  Conversely you can be doing important things and be miserable.  Mood is really the thing.  And it's brought about mostly by satisfying hardwired programming in areas like sex, love, friends, hobbies, interests, accomplishments, work, exercise, diet, weather, etc

       We can either be animals, or we can strive for "higher" things.  The more we indulge in our animal natures, the more pointless and stressful life becomes.  But if we seek the mysteries of life, it can take on more than one lifetime's worth of meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the "sciences" have been propped up to deprive us of meaning.  They want us to think we're just a bunch of animals, groveling around for sex, drugs, and scraps of food until we die.  But we can be better than that.  We
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       better than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty far from where I want to be, as a person.  I've been at the brink too, in a field, without a reason to continue.  But when I came back from that, I caught a small glimpse of the mystery of life, and I've been searching for more ever since.  It's changed my life, and even though I'll probably never "figure it all out", the search, and the things I've learned so far, have completely changed my outlook.  I have a long way to go, but I'll get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I knew you well enough to point to whatever thing it is that sparks your interest, but I don't.  I hope you can find it sooner than later.  Good luck.

       You have yourself. So due to your response, I'm going to weigh in on what
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       believe you should do:
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like you are probably uncomfortable with yourself as an individual, as a person or whatever else. That's bullshit. Take a small step first and go out somewhere that you may not usually go alone, but do it alone. Learn to be comfortable inside your own head again. Take some time away from the electronics (as simple as putting your phone away for a few minutes and surveying the area.) Process everything, pay attention to the senses and be welcoming to whatever fucking ideas fly into your head. Realize that you are The Light, The Truth and The Reason. As am I. As are we.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also try not to forget how to breathe correctly; if you're anything like me: I get tense and forget to take real breaths (lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       I prefer a deep breath through the nostrils into the diaphragm, exhaled through the mouth. Just be mindful of getting good, fresh air into your body.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I meditate, I imagine the inhale as light entering and the exhale as darkness leaving. Sometimes visualization can help. Ultimately just find what works for you.

       Reading some of your replies am I right to assume you feel like this because of the way the World is? I've felt that way for a few years now and sometimes it really is a struggle to do anything. I have a job but other than that I don't really leave my house(or should i say bedroom)
I very rarely go out with friends despite their best efforts(I have anxiety and usually cancel the day before) because i guess I've discussed my issue with the world, with them multiple times and the response I get, from most people actually, is 'Yeah but that's just the way it is nothing we can do' &amp; it deflates me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean we have all these resources &amp; technology but there are so many people struggling. We have people going to jobs they hate, jobs that we could automate.. We have people living on the streets yet empty ones everywhere &amp; 100s of buildings on the high street selling the exact same things. We also have people using food banks or actually starving TO DEATH but how much food is there in the world?? Plenty. &amp; all this is because of our new God, money.
(You mentioned the elite.. Did you know 8 people have the same wealth as the poorest half of thE ENTIRE WORLD??? WAT???)
We have this religion of consumerism where we believe the only way people create new things is with a money incentive. We're free? Throw away all your money.. You'll have true freedom then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to be all doom and gloom cause the World is a beautiful place with plenty of beautiful people. Unfortunately though the not so pleasant folk are running things &amp; they want to keep us down so we don't make a change. Its working for the most part but I think that's the reason so many are fed up. Maybe I'm wrong and living in fantasy land (diet is a huge factor-are you a carnist?) but I feel like us humans could be so much better.

       I've rambled on here probably not making much sense so if you actually read it thanks &amp; well done lol

       Life is pointless if you're not actively participating in it.  As far as I can tell the point of life is to live. Sounds ridiculously simple right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading through your post you describe having to work for other until you die. Not true. You can start a business, create something, be a Youtuber, etc. and not ever have to answer to some boss breathing down your neck. You don't necessarily need to pay taxes anymore if you don't want to. There are ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're tired now but think of it as a phase. You won't be some time from now. You know how when you're sick, and you always remember how you felt when you weren't?  My point is it all passes. Good, bad, it all passes. If it doesn't,  your view of it eventually does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every person, whether good, bad, shy, loud, a degenerate or a saint has a purpose, however miniscule. Why? Because we live amid others. You might not know but something you said, did, acted like, etc. may have set off a chain reaction in someone's life, leading them to change their direction. I can say so because I have, due to strangers. They'll never know but they changed my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are feeling like leaving this plane, wait it out a bit. You'll be glad you did, I promise. Never use a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Internet hug.

       Imagine you had a piece of paper. It's blank and imagine the visible lines to help you write on the paper as society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is a blank slate. It's what you want it to be. Society will continue to exist without you, but it's your choice whether you want to draw on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt like you for awhile. I wondered what life was, but truth be told life is meaningless till we add meaning. Whether it be being with the ones you love, or doing what you love. Life is knowing that we all share the same fate, but what differentiates us is how we reach that fate.

       And this is a much easier pit to fall into when you're not participating in life in a meaningful way, or have no focus. By focus I don't mean you have ADHD, I mean that your life may be lacking something to keep your mind occupied. Activities you enjoy, gratifying work, a goal to reach, or things to look forward to.

       I want to offer my ear, should you want to talk to an objective party, but I'm not sure how that would come across to a person called Doctor Fucks A Lot. Box is open if you'd like to chat though.

       There is no meaning to life or existence. Your just a bunch energy running through some atoms that got randomly squashed together. Existence and nonexistence are the same. Nothing and something compose each other and ecist within one another. Infinity is 0. You are pulled from infinite nothingness into your existence bubble and then it pops and you are back to infinite nothingness.

       Love is the purpose of life brother. To love and be loved. Not as in sexual love but as in family love. If you dont fell loved, adopt a kid, and you will find out that loving and helping is literally the purpose of life. Go out and give love to your closest family. Die old and happy knowing you did good for your loved ones.

       I'll be honest. I find it hard so hard to do anything like even leaving the house or talking to someone. I find it hard to get the will. I think I will try to take it one step at a time.
