       Over 1,000 sealed indictments have appeared in the courts in just these recent weeks. It's my understanding that that only happens when it involves people who are high-profile, or when there is a possibility of that information hindering an investigation or something. (I'm just a lowly redditor, please correct me if I'm wrong).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also take note that this is happening at the same time that Hollywood is being purged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corey Feldman has tried to expose an exclusive "soda pop club" for child celebrities as a pedophile ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bryan Singer has been rumored to engage in sex parties involving young kids for years. (this I first learned about outside of  conspiracy circles, people would whisper about it during my days in film school).
      </p>
      <p>
       And as much as I haaate to think about it, one of my favorite actors, Kevin Spacey, has been exposed as a pedophile. This one is important because he has a relationship with Bill Clinton, who is rumored to be a sex offender, and it's been documented that they've flown together to some private island owned by Jeffery epestein, who is a real SEX OFFENDER by multiple, real counts. But anyway, this is important because it sheds much needed light on all these fucking creeps and they're involvement with the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is connected. "elites", the rich and powerful are fucked up people that think they can do whatever drugs they want, have sex with whoever they want, and not get in trouble. Then they get bored and start raping kids, and it's allowed to happen because that's the culture that they belong to. It's normal to them, just like it's normal to abuse women in Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       And apparently, the US city that has the highest number of missing children is God damned Washington D.C.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've been paying close attention to even MSM, you can literally read with your own eyes that government officials are being brought down on counts sexual misconduct against a child. just look at Roy Moore!!
      </p>
      <p>
       THESE ARE NOT COINCIDENCES ANYMORE.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS ISN'T A THEORY ANYMORE.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's real, it's happening, and we need to wake the rest of the world up.

       Holy shit, that's a really interesting point. If and organization (say for example, the Clinton Foundation, which was not just a left wing org) was really just a big slush fund... they could charge everyone financially tied to it with RICO.

       Possibly, though I'm not sure if donating would be enough to count (considering they are a foundation and all).

       I'm not certain as to the types and extent of any crimes, but there's plenty of reason to suspect them of committing many crimes. If they are named in the investigation, then the investigators would be the ones with that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they are 100% a criminal organization, but there is plenty of information out there to suspect them of pay-to-play schemes, other forms of selling influence, and even possibly human trafficking claims (not some pizzagate nonsense, actual human trafficking).
      </p>
      <p>
       The point was, if it is discovered that it's been acting as a criminal slush fund, then those benefitting from it can be charged with RICO.

       Alan Dershowitz bragged about getting Epstein a tiny sentence.  He is also on the manifest, and has gone to the island.  Dershowitz is the zionists watch dog supreme.  The interviews some half dozen years ago when he was himself accused, are hilarious viewing.  Dershowitz is a hysterically bad liar even though he's a lawyer.  He went on at least a half dozen TV shows to make his own case, and talk about the allegations.  But we are told jews don't have powerful friends in media.  Joe Blow who is accused of something gets on the morning shows alllllll the time to defend himself.

       In the interviews, he lies over and over that he's not on the manifest, just counting on most people to believe him.  He's such a terrible liar, it's just hilarious.  Those poor girls had to massage that ugly freak.

       Agreed. This is still the #1 reason why I don't buy any of the "Trump is a plant" or "Trump is just a typical elite 1%er looking out for his own wealth" arguments. Everyone knows, buying the president is much easier and less risky than BEING the president.

       Precisely. He had the media, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Wall Street and Academia almost unanimously campaigning against him. He was attacked, and continues to be attacked, in every way they can think of. They wouldn’t have done that if they wanted him to win - period. Until that changes, I maintain the view that Trump is good, albeit not perfect, but certainly good.

       Small correction: Epstein's flight log showed that Spacey and Chris Tucker were flown to Africa for a charity event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Bill Clinton
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       appear on the flight logs to Lolita Island. Trump also counts Epstein as a close friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think Spacey assaulted that boy, but there is no evidence of him going to Lolita Island.

       Or it makes me laugh people get their knickers in a knot over Killary and the Uranium when Cathy O'Brien claims her crimes are much more akin to her cohorts on Epstein Island. Uranium should be the least of anyone's concerns.

       I definitely agree that all of this seems to be happening in a very interesting time frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       First we have Q, which is an interesting set of questions regardless of whether or not you believe it's a LARP.  Then Saudi Arabia undergoes a huge purge of its current government and royals.  Then we start seeing this huge number of sealed indictments all over the country.  Now representatives of uber wealthy families are going bananas on Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       While all of this is going on, MAJOR Hollywood A-listers and money men are being accused of sexual misconduct essentially removing the potency of Hollywood being trusted by the public.  So an entire head of the liberal machine...potentially the core of the propaganda we see.... is being systematically chipped away at.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree.  There is just too much of this to be coincidence.  We still know very little, though which makes this frustrating.  It seems like the most potent piece of the puzzle are the indictments.  I feel like when the hammer drops on those, it's going to be a show.

       I hope you're right, but just for clarification, any time there is an indictment and they haven't arrested the person yet and think there is any chance they might run, its sealed.  Also, if there are multiple indictments involving the same crime, which is often, and they aren't all filed at once, which is also common, then the ones they file first are sealed.  Having a sealed indictment doesn't mean that its a high profile case or even a high profile crime, just that the prosecutors want to keep it hidden for now (and they usually err on the side of secrecy).
