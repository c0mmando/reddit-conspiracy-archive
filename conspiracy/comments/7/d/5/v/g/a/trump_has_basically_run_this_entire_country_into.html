<p>You can&#39;t be serious. Obama isn&#39;t responsible for the historic racial divide in America. Just because racism is off the law books doesn&#39;t mean it disappeared. I don&#39;t think any reasonable person expected him to fix racism all by himself. What the fuck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama backed BLM, not the violence. But yeah, racism by white people is still the most prevalent racism. Who was backing the birth dertificate charge? Mostly white people it looked like. KKK can go fuck themselves. Trump is an actual racist, twitter ranting about the birth certificate, taking out full page ads to bias a jury against the central park 5, his father wouldn&#39;t rent to black people, there&#39;s a long line of Trump racism that doesn&#39;t compare to snowflakes getting upset at Obama backing BLM or identifying racism as a problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t be blamed for your parents bad actions. As for birth certificate I think it was mostly his unknown background that made people suspicious. No one from his college remembers him- uh what??? I&#39;m on the thought that his mom isn&#39;t his mom and he&#39;s actually of middle eastern decent. He looks completely (racially anyway) out of place when he is around other African Americans. He doesn&#39;t even look mixed really-I know mixed children can have a wide variety of turn out. That is what I think the whole birth cert was hiding. I did watch the live video of people downloading his birth certificate from whitehouse.gov and opened in photoshop and you can see the layers and duplicated stamp marks that are not possible to even recreate because stamps rely on angle and pressure and human can&#39;t duplicate that let alone more than once on one document. No one cares what race he is. I don&#39;t- he&#39;s just another shitty president along a line of shitty presidents.</p>

<p>One thing I did notice about obama was his unnatural acting talent. He was able to sing live in impromptu gigs on tv, it&#39;s one thing to be charismatic but he was straight up good at acting. That to me is suspicious. Also his ties to the CIA.</p>

<p>Personal note I have only witnessed and experienced myself racism against mixed couples - usually black bashing another black for dating a white, blacks bashing lighter skinned blacks (this happens alot you can even YT black girl fights - usually gang up on the lighter skinned one , blacks bashing (verbally and physically) on whites (knock out game anyone), and personal to my self verbally and sexually assaulting me as a child. I have known white people who didn&#39;t like black people but never would say or act on it cause they knew it wasn&#39;t acceptable. </p>

<p>But mostly my 30+ years and several states I have seen only black on white hate and racists. No white child is taught to cross the street- it is a learned from encounters with violence previously- this is why not all whites will cross the streets but those that do have a valid internal protection reason to.</p>

<p>But we aren&#39;t allowed to talk about it because we might hurt someone&#39;s feelings.</p>

<p>Also obama didn&#39;t give a shit about his own people- esp in Chicago. Those people are dying daily in mass shootings and it sucks! But media doesn&#39;t cover that because they want to focus on white make shooters. This nothing will change in Chicago even now because most people don&#39;t realize how bad it&#39;s gotten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I think Obama can&#39;t deliver change, even on two terms. That&#39;s really up to the people to follow through on. As the president I think he signs bills that congress put forwards, but also the largest legal problems to racism were psuehd out a generation ago. The problems we face today are under the surface ones that you can&#39;t legislate away. The ones that require coordinated action at the grassroots level. Not a top-down one. </p>

<p>What sort of executive order or charge for legislation could Obama have gone with? Legal racism is a thing of the past. People expected too much from him, but we can still see racism in the Birth Certificate shit. </p>

<p>Oh well. Obama bombed more than any other president (26,171 bombs in 2016) so I&#39;m sure plenty of people hated the United States then too, they probably just didn&#39;t live to complain about him. Meanwhile, the media made him appear as a kind, nice gentleman, he even received the Nobel Peace Prize for fucks sake... fuck that shit. And btw I talked to plenty of people when I was traveling in Southeast Asia before the election who hated Hillary Clinton and wanted her to lose to Trump. This was before the primaries when Bernie was still in the race but Hillary cheated Bernie Sanders, so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Trump fanboy, but keeping an open mind. The Saudi development is a shocker for what is says about 9/11, Bush pals and the Clintons, but starving Yemen and making menacing noises toward Iran is sickening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>race relations on a structural level havn&#39;t shifted a ton, but on a personal level there&#39;s so much more race-derived enmity and ill will going on now compared to 2008.

I feel like Obama was good at like, &quot;starting the conversation&quot; but not delivering any actual, you know &quot;change&quot;</p>
