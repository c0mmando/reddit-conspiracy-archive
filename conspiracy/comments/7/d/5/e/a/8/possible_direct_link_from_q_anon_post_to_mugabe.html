        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Breaking news today is that Robert Mugabe, ruthless leader of Zimbabwe, has been arrested in a likely military coup.  See here:  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/world/africa/zimbabwe-coup-mugabe.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/world/africa/zimbabwe-coup-mugabe.html</a>   </p>

<p>Back on November 6, a series of Q posts (which looked a bit out of character for Q as noted by u/ToddWhiskey) said &quot;of all the countries he [Tony Podesta] and Manafort have represented, who does the US MOST want to catch with their hand in the cookie jar?  Any in Africa you can think of?&quot;  </p>

<p>Then &quot;Almost as hard to treat as lead.  Or lithium.  Any countries in Africa doing much speculation in lithium and other rare-earth minerals?&quot;   Link to Q Anon post here:  <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/GylXLHjr/order/asc/">https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/GylXLHjr/order/asc/</a>   </p>

<p>Well, wouldn&#39;t you know it, Zimbabwe is evidently the worlds fifth largest producer of lithium, also known as &quot;white petroleum&quot;. Australian company Prospect Resources will be expanding its operations there, as will &quot;Premier African Minerals&quot;.  Link to this article claiming it may become the biggest producer here:  <a href="https://www.dailynews.co.zw/articles/2017/07/11/zim-to-become-largest-lithium-producer">https://www.dailynews.co.zw/articles/2017/07/11/zim-to-become-largest-lithium-producer</a>.   </p>

<p>Here&#39;s where I&#39;m coming up to a dead end.  I spent some time looking and could not connect Manafort or Podesta to Zimbabwe, Mugabe or lithium.  I also couldn&#39;t connect Podesta or Manafort to Uramin, Inc or Areva (which bought Uramin in 2007 in an ultimately disastrous transaction).  I explored this connection only because it dealt with uranium in Africa, and 2 of Premier African Minerals board members were former executives of Uramin.  Can Anyone find anything good or is this a nothing burger?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a post maybe 2 years ago explaining the connections between the Clintons &amp; Mugabe. I think i saved it, so I will post if I find it. 
Anyway, it basically explained how the Clinton helped keep him in power and it all tied to the Boko Haram taking those girls that vanished into thin air. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why the focus on carbon as the baddie is such a joke.  Let me explain:  what has their solution been?  Carbon trading schemes (which would be the world&#39;s largest commodity - but commodity trading only benefits wall street and is rife with corruption) &amp; electrification which takes lithium thru batteries to store off peak solar etc.   mining completely destroys primary forest ecosystems- which are our planets way of regulating carbon.  Lithium &amp; rare earth minerals are already scarce.  Not nearly enough to supply the world&#39;s consumption without destroying primary ecosystems.  </p>

<p>I smell a scheme here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m struggling with.  Who wanted to keep Mugabe in power then and for what reason, such that Trump/good guys finally oust him now of all things.  </p>

<p>i was told to look at the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative, but I still can&#39;t connect that to anyone involved with Mugabe, Zimbabwe, or lithium (Clinton Giustra are linked through Uranium One, but Q was talking lithium and rare earth metals in the Zimbabwe context, not uranium.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the evidence that Trump/anyone was behind the coup besides the military members that did it? I thought I read somewhere (must have been a different post) that the leader of the coup was just in China, but wouldn&#39;t that mean he was working with China rather than Trump? Unless Trump is working with China? I may have missed some key points somewhere lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mugabe recently thanked Trump for defeating “cruel” Hillary.  </p>

<p>Hillary wanted him out of power when she was Secretary of State.  While she was Secretary of State there were numerous sanctions and the withholding of aid to Zimbabwe I can’t say why for sure but Mugabe blamed the USA for plunging the country into economic ruin.  Hillary wanted to force a power sharing deal with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai so that impoverished Zimbabwe could return to democratic rule.</p>
