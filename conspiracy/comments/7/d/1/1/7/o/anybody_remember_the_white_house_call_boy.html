<p>And here is conspiracy of silence, the full documentary regarding the Franklin Credit Union in the early 90&#39;s/late 80&#39;s.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBSIDQt5Dwc&amp;amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBSIDQt5Dwc&amp;amp;t=3s</a></p>

<p>Gary Caradori, the guy investigating this crime, was believed to have been murdered when his plane was &quot;sabotaged&quot;. He, and his young son, died in the crash. </p>

<p>I highly recommend the book; &quot;Child abuse, satanism, and murder in Nebraska: the Franklin scandal&quot; by John W. Decamp. </p>

<p>Keep letting the pizzagate and pedogate nay-sayers do their thing...We are bringing this to the light</p>

<p>But wealth can give access and influence otherwise unattainable to the average person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enlightenment:</p>

<p>Satan does not exist anywhere but in your own hearts. People who take up the &quot;deal&quot; with Satan essentially make a deal with themselves that they will do whatever it takes to succeed or benefit themselves even if it hurts others. And so these individuals suffer in &quot;hell&quot; for their sins. Their very &quot;sins&quot; manifest thoughts in their minds that allow concepts of inevitable death and not having value to take over. Those who &quot;sin&quot; are already in hell and burn for it until they can deliver themselves out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;onspiracy of Silence, a documentary listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine, was to be aired on the Discovery Channel, on May 3, 1994. This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies. 
Many children suffered the indignity of wearing nothing but their underwear and a number displayed on a piece of cardboard hanging from their necks when being auctioned off to foreigners in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Toronto, Canada. 
At the last minute, before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. &quot;</p>

<p>I think we need a study on that.</p>

<p>We know about pedos constantly.  We&#39;ve known about it constantly.</p>

<p>We turn a blind eye because it is normal and being injected.  Hell being normalized.  Was normalized before and now the internet is normalizing it.</p>

<p>People know it happens and let it.  And we let those who have power let it happen too.  You aren&#39;t telling me our favorite actors don&#39;t know what goes on.  Yet we watch their movies and give them millions.</p>

<p>So, yea great.  It&#39;s back in the main stream.</p>

<p>Tell me where the big names are who come out and actually point a finger?  Anyone?  NBA players.  Hollywood?   Nah?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all bull shit and pointless.  Don&#39;t leave your kids alone with someone I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This story was covered in the book &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot; which should be in every hardcore conspiracy theorist&#39;s library. It is the blackest of the black pill. He was supposed to of come </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How far does this pedophilic underground extend into the halls of power? Are America’s political, corporate and military elite—like their counterparts in Belgium, Latvia and Portugal—hiding a particularly dirty little secret from the American people? A secret that, if exposed, could shatter America’s cherished political and economic institutions and bring the house of cards crashing down? Consider the case of Craig Spence, a behind-the-scenes Republican powerbroker in Washington. In June 1989, the Washington Times published a story that sent shockwaves rippling across Capitol Hill. It seemed that Spence had been deeply involved with a callboy ring that supplied young boys, some of them very young boys, to the elite of both political parties, as well as to visiting dignitaries.</p>

<p>It was reported by the Times that a list of some 200 influential clients included the names of “government officials, locally based U.S. military officers, businessmen, lawyers, bankers, congressional aides, media representatives and other professionals,” only a few of whom were publicly identified. On the guest lists for Spence’s parties were former CIA Director William Casey and former Deputy Director of Intelligence Ray Cline; Congressman Barney Frank and Senators John Glenn and Frank Murkowski; political activist/propagandist Phyllis Schlafly; former Attorney General John Mitchell (who once co-hosted a party with Spence); journalists William Safire, Liz Trotta, Ted Koppel and Eric Severeid; former Ambassadors James Lilley, Robert Neumann and Elliot Richardson; General Alfred M. Gray, the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, and Lt. General Daniel O. Graham, an expert on the ‘Space Defense Initiative’; and former U.S. Attorneys Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing. 1 Spence once held a birthday bash for the notorious Roy Cohn. Lie also boasted of playing host to Rock Fludson and other celebrities.</p>

<p>Among the revelations in the case was that Spence had taken some of his call-boy escorts on private, late-night tours of the White Elouse. The tours, of which there were at least four, were cleared by a uniformed Secret Service guard who moonlighted as a bodyguard at Spence’s parties. Spence hinted that the tours were arranged by the national security adviser to then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, Donald Gregg, for whom Spence once sponsored a dinner. One of the tours occurred just after Spence stopped by the Nightline studio to see his friend, Ted Koppel. Spence reportedly introduced Koppel to a 15-year-old boy, whom Koppel later claimed Spence had introduced as his son. Koppel though had been a close friend for over twenty years and surely knew that Spence did not have a teenage son. Koppel first met Spence in Southeast Asia when Koppel was serving as the ABC bureau chief in Flong Kong, and Spence was nominally working as an ABC correspondent in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Spence openly boasted of working with both the CIA and ranking members of the Reagan and Bush administrations. Fie claimed that he had been involved in covert operations in Vietnam, Japan, Central America and the Middle East. His claims were scoffed at and he was largely portrayed as a self-important blowhard.</p>

<p>DiGenova served in 1975-1976 as counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, commonly referred to as the Church Committee. He later served as U.S. Attorney under President Ronald Reagan. During that time, and after purportedly leaving government service for private practice, he frequently attended Spence’s parties. In December 1988, he accompanied Spence on a business trip to Japan. Toensing, diGenova’s wife, is a former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department and a former chief counsel for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (1981-1984). Both were investigated for their close links to Craig Spence. Both later made almost daily appearances on cable newscasts as shrill proponents of the Clinton impeachment proceedings.</p>

<p>There are indications, however, that Spence was involved in covert operations as far back as Vietnam, where he could well have been working under journalistic cover. An associate of his from that era told the Washington Post-. “Spence pulled disappearing acts in Vietnam—sometimes for weeks at a time...Then he’d turn up, refusing to say where he’d been.”</p>

<p>“The sex? That’s done all the time,” a former Bush economic adviser told the press. “If a foreign diplomat wants a companion, the State Department provides it. It doesn’t matter if it’s a man or woman. They have a special fund set up for that.” What the unnamed adviser did not say was that such services were provided not as a courtesy to the dignitary, but as a way to compromise and control. Allegations quietly arose that the callboy ring, and Spence’s parties, were part of a CIA sexual blackmail operation. Spence’s Washington mansion was said to be overflowing with surveillance equipment, including hidden cameras and microphones and an abundance of two-way mirrors. It was also alleged that cocaine flowed freely at Spence’s parties, and that he could have been involved in bringing drugs in from El Salvador.</p>

<p>The Spence story never really registered on the national media’s radar screen. Despite being a largely Republican scandal, it was completely ignored by such pillars of the purportedly liberal press as the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. The story soon disappeared entirely and Washington and the media proceeded to pretend as though nothing had ever happened. According to a Washington Times reporter, the paper trail was quickly covered up. Some 20,000 documents pertaining to the case were sealed by court order and the U.S. Attorney’s office issued a gag order on the release of information. By the time that Craig Spence turned up dead in a Boston hotel less than five months after the story first broke, he had been all but forgotten. He had earlier told a friend: “I may be disappearing soon. It will be sudden. It may appear to be a suicide, but it won’t be.”</p>

<p>Spence was reportedly found lying on his bed in room 429 of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, wearing a tuxedo and with a telephone cradled to his ear and a Walkman headset around his neck. He had, according to the Independent, “no obvious signs of injury,” and “police refused to comment on the cause of death.” The door to the room was barricaded. Written on the mirror were several messages, one of which read: “Chief, consider this my resignation, effective immediately. As you always said, you can’t ask others to make a sacrifice if you are not ready to do the same. Life is duty. God bless America.” Another was an apology to the hotel: “To the Ritz, please forgive this inconvenience.” A third was an unexplained Japanese phrase: “Nisei Bei.” The hotel registry showed that the room the apparent suicide victim was found in was occupied by “C.S. Kane.”</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Spence had been subpoenaed by a grand jury but had not yet been called to appear. As it turned out, very few witnesses ever did appear before that grand jury Spence had also reportedly agreed to provide Penthouse magazine with “lurid details of Washington’s bisexual wonderland.” His story, needless to say, was never told.</p>

<p>The cailboy ring, oddly enough, had close ties to the funeral home/mortuary business. Robert Chambers was convicted on charges of handling the credit card processing for Professional Services, Inc., an entity that served as a cover for an interlinked network of half-a-dozen male escort services. Chambers was a funeral director and the son of the owner of the Chambers Funeral Homes chain. He was sentenced to serve 41 months. Two of the linked services, Dream Boys and Man to Man, were reportedly run by Henry Vinson, a mortician and the former coroner of Mingo County, West Virginia. Vinson had moved to D.C. after losing his job as coroner for making harassing phone calls to rival funeral homes. While he was under investigation in Washington, his obituary appeared in West Virginia newspapers, apparently as the result of an assisted effort to fake his death. Vinson 14 ultimately pled guilty and received a 63-month sentence. The presiding judge openly criticized U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens for departing from mandatory sentencing guidelines. Vinson’s legal representation was provided by Fox News mouthpiece Greta Van Susteren.</p>

<p>Also implicated in the case was Democratic Congressman Barney Frank, whose D.C. home was used as a base of operations for an escort service from late 1985 through mid 1987. The service was run by Frank’s lover, Stephen L. Gobie, the son of a Marine Corps master sergeant and Pentagon budget analyst. Frank wrote a number of letters to probation officials on behalf of Gobie, who had four felony convictions from 1982. Those letters provided the necessary cover for the ring, which Frank denied having knowledge of. Gobie also regularly operated out of Chevy Chase Elementary School, in collusion with the ‘magnet’ school’s principal, Gabriel A. Massaro, a former school counselor. The school was home to 350 students aged nine to twelve. Massaro vigorously denied that any students were involved in cailboy operations, which he eventually admitted were run from the school. In addition to Barney Frank and Gabriel Massaro, Stephen Gobie had close ties to Craig Spence as well.</p>

<p>14 Vinson later reportedly married Dr. Diane Shafer, who was appointed to fill the Mingo County coroner position that he had once held. Shafer had previously been convicted of bribery in Kentucky. Her appointment came just after the reversal of the appointment of Gerald Chafin, a mortuary owner and former Mingo County Sheriff who had twice been indicted on federal wiretap charges.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the country, a political operative named Larry King—hailed as “the fastest rising Black star in the Republican Party”—was embroiled in another high-level pedophile ring. King, whose operation was based in Omaha, Nebraska, had connections to Craig Spence as well as to Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Oliver North, and various other major players in Washington. The King story first began to emerge with the collapse of his Franklin Community Credit Union, one of many such entities that went belly-up in the 1980s savings and loan scandals. A special senate ‘Franklin Committee’ was established and tasked with looking into allegations of financial improprieties, but soon found itself instead investigating claims of child prostitution, child pornography and ritual homicide. Committee members began receiving anonymous threats.</p>

<p>The investigation led to the doorsteps of some of the most powerful men in Omaha, including newspaper publisher Harold Andersen (a lunch partner of George Bush), local columnist Peter Citron, a judge, the mayor, the city’s Games and Parks Commissioner, a prominent attorney, the former police chief, businessman Alan Baer, and multi-billionaire Warren Buffet (for whose son King sponsored a political fund-raiser). Some of the victim/witnesses identified George Bush as being directly complicit. The scandal was completely ignored by the national U.S. media, and appears to have been covered by the local press for the sole purpose of discrediting the witnesses and denouncing the investigation as yet another ‘witch hunt.’ The case did attract some attention from the European press though. Pronto, Spain’s largest circulation weekly, reported that the scandal “appears to directly implicate politicos of the state of Nebraska and Washington, D.C. who are very close to the White House and George Bush.” The report also noted “there is reason to believe that the CIA is directly implicated,” and the “FBI refuses to help in the investigation and has sabotaged any efforts” by others to do so.</p>

<p>A documentary film crew from the UK’s Yorkshire Television, working in conjunction with the Discovery Channel, worked for months investigating the case. The result of their efforts was a film entitled “Conspiracy of Silence,” which concluded that the child victims/witnesses were telling the truth. The documentary was scheduled to air on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994. Just days before the scheduled airing, the film was pulled without explanation and all copies were ordered destroyed. At least one production copy of the video survived the purge, however, and has been known to circulate among those derisively labeled as ‘conspiracy theorists.’ For everyone else, the conspiracy of silence continues.</p>

<p>The Omaha operation, described in the film as a “large ring of rich and powerful pedophiles,” appears to have been in business for several years—with the knowledge of, and for the perverse pleasure of, a variety of city, state and federal authorities. Jerry Lowe, the first investigator assigned to the case by the Franklin</p>

<p>Committee, reported back: “The allegations regarding the exploitation of children are indeed disturbing. What appears to be documented cases of child abuse and sexual abuse dating back several years with no enforcement action being taken by the appropriate agencies is on its face, mind-boggling.” The investigation revealed that many of the child victims had been recruited from one of Americas most revered charitable organizations—Boy’s Town, with which King had maintained close ties since 1979. Senator and committee member Loran Schmit has said that Boy’s Town was mentioned frequently during the investigation, “but we found it difficult to get information about Boy’s Town.” So too did the film crew from Yorkshire Television.</p>

<p>Republican state senator and Franklin Committee member John DeCamp, in his book The Franklin Cover-Up, presents a compelling body of evidence to document the charges made by the child victims and various others associated with the operation. Equally disturbing is the evidence presented of the massive cover-up that was perpetrated by the FBI, local police, a grand jury assigned to the case, and of course the ever-compliant media. The cover-up involved, according to DeCamp, the untimely deaths of at least fifteen key players in the scandal— including Franklin Committee investigator Gary Caradori, whose private plane was blown out of the sky on July 11,1990 with Caradori and his eight-year-old son on board. Caradori had been threatened frequently, as had the witnesses from whom he was gathering information. His vehicle had also been repeatedly tampered with. His brother claimed that Gary had told him that he had recently come to possess a key piece of evidence (a book of addresses and phone numbers) that was so damaging, “if they knew he had it, they’d kill him.”</p>

<p>The wreckage of Caradori’s plane, as a reporter on the scene noted, was “strewn over a % to 1 mile stretch.” A National Transportation Safety Board investigator acknowledged that the “fact that the wreckage is scattered over a large area certainly demonstrates that it did break up in flight.” Family members claimed that there were items missing from the plane’s wreckage, most significantly Caradori’s briefcase. Within twenty-four hours of the crash, all of his records had been impounded by the FBI. Nevertheless, the NTSB ruled that the crash had been accidental, with no evidence of sabotage. The Franklin Committee—led by Senator Schmit, who suspected sabotage—ordered a private investigation into the cause of the crash. Strangely enough, the man selected to conduct that inquiry was William Colby, a fifty-year veteran of intelligence operations whose career began in the OSS during World War II. Colby’s hiring was urged by his protege, Senator DeCamp.</p>

They inundate us with all these stories and whispers and rumors while all it really seems to ever achieve is mass trauma in the psyche of the population but never change. I really hope things happen this year in favor of the good people of the world and we finally turn the tables on these people or whatever they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enlightenment:</p>

<p>Satan does not exist anywhere but in your own hearts. People who take up the &quot;deal&quot; with Satan essentially make a deal with themselves that they will do whatever it takes to succeed or benefit themselves even if it hurts others. And so these individuals suffer in &quot;hell&quot; for their sins. Their very &quot;sins&quot; manifest thoughts in their minds that allow concepts of inevitable death and not having value to take over. Those who &quot;sin&quot; are already in hell and burn for it until they can deliver themselves out.</p>
