       For those who challenge the official story of the Sandy Hook school shooting, I am curious as to which aspect of the story first raised your suspicions. Additionally, what bit of information cemented your beliefs?
      </p>
      <p>
       For those not questioning the narrative, what “conspiracy” seems most far fetched? Hardest to contradict? What cemented your view that it happened as officially stated?

       A school bus driver drops 6 children off on a random lawn and drives away???? That's the best part. W in the actual F.

       If I were a parent of one of those 6 children I would've sued the fricking school system, the bus driver, anyone. Dropping off 6 little children on a strange man's lawn.

       The footage that day was to clean, and people were literally walking in circles. On top of that parents are smiling and laughing in interviews. Mortician spoke fairly quickly on the bodies that he “examined” considering the time given. Really don’t see how he could’ve examined those bodies in such a short time period.

       He says he didn't finish them all that day and he'll do them tomorrow, which is absurdly stupid. "Dr" Wayne Carver also could not say what the genders or ages of the victims were. He says each child was shot 3-11 times, and when asked where they were shot he said "all over."
      </p>
      <p>
       I show people his press conference right off the bat when explaining the Sandy Hook hoax, because it's really all you need since he is supposed to be the linchpin of the charade, an official-looking medical guy confirming that kids were shot, playing on people's imaginations, yet he does the exact opposite by betraying himself as a fraud with his goofy and ridiculous speech and bizarre behavior that unequivocally proves to anyone with an ounce of common sense that he is no doctor.

       100% agreed, I know that there was little clarification on him only reviewing a few of the corpses. However like you said his quotes are not representative of someone who examined dead children with accuracy. "All over" is a dead give away.

       If you imagine the affluent community Sandy Hook is supposed to be, then look through pictures of that dilapidated and defunct school, it could not be more obvious that it wasn't operational. Million dollar houses in the setting of pristine golf courses and crisp tennis courts yet we're supposed to believe the
       <em>
        school had mold on the walls.

       I was in the UK at the time and it was reported on for several days that it was hand guns that were used exclusively.  Strange that it fit into their current narrative  (stronger laws for hand guns).

       Kinda like the Pearl Harbor movie with a different ending for each market.

       As a skeptic to the conspiracy side of Sandy Hook my main problem is that a whole lot of the conspiracy hinges on people being face blind as far as this person looks like this other person. Coupled with mostly just finding fault in how a given person is interviewed on camera. Grief does strange stuff to people and there is no right way to respond, there is only an expected way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if they were going to false flag an event of this nature they would of gone balls out on the details, leaks, pics and soon. I'm not saying I want to see dead kids, I don't, but there would of been way more impact like "stuff" released. Also the most telling of all, I mean the real bottom line here is nothing happened government wise. Why would they fake an event, go all false flag to this level if they didn't have the rest of the political agenda side of it ready to go? They were just going to wing that part of it?  They were willing to stage a huge fake whatever but did not have the rest of their ducks in a row?
      </p>
      <p>
       What did we really get? Online petition, some executive orders that could of been done at any time Obama wanted to sign them. There was some legislation later on, but that was defeated anyways. So seriously, what the point of doing Sandy Hook in the first place, if one views it as false flag etc?!?! The entire point of a conspiracy is to go from A to B. No mater where one falls in their feeling on say 9/11 it CLEARLY took the country from A to B. Sandy Hook didn't move anything. They hardly even tried and that's why I highly doubt it was faked.

       I wouldn’t discount it (Sandy Hook faked / hoax / False Flag...) solely on that basis.  Its a looooooooong game and A doesn’t necessarily follow B.  Presumably it served some purpose.  It just isn’t obvious what that purpose is/was.  Yet.

       Never mind the fact that you're objectively wrong, and Sandy Hook did lead to increased gun control (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control_after_the_Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control_after_the_Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting
       </a>
       ), staging a fake shooting and getting almost the entire country to believe it was real could be its own objective as a sort of social experiment, or research into trauma-based mind control of a population. This alone is a reasonable explanation for why it might have been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, you're thinking about it the wrong way. You don't have to know why a crime was committed to know a crime has been committed. The evidence alone will tell you it was fake. We can speculate all day about why it was done, but the fact is that no one can demonstrate that any shots were fired or even that the school was operational at the time.

       I few executive orders? Did not need an event for those to happen. Assault Weapon Ban of 2013? Failed and could not even muster full party support in the Senate. Universal background checks? Failed. A few states passed a couple meh level laws here or there, no where in line with the sort of stuff one might expect as a response to a bunch of dead kids. Others states, if I remember right, even lowered over all gun laws. I'd argue we have more gun freedom now then before Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone suggest to me a few posts above that maybe Sandy Hook had other goals. Ok, maybe but it's hardly even talked about anymore outside of being used against conspiracy theory people. Maybe that was the goal all along, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       very little of the conspiracy side of Sandy Hook is even close to being evidence. It's all conjecture, speculation and hearsay. They see a run down school and post pictures of if being ran down. They claim that shows it's a fake location being no school has those sort of maintenance problems. Meanwhile my local elementary school in a neighborhood of million dollar homes was flooding every winter due to bad drains. They were sandbagging doors, every winter, for years. No funding to fix it, like most other public schools. Even part of the roof was peeling off. It also had no play ground equipment for something like 15+ years. Removed the old tire based stuff being it was too risky while having no money for new equipment. That's just what happens at pubic school, unless it's Sandy Hook then it's "evidence" of the location being staged/fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to be fair, given where I'm posting that's 100% ok. I would not be here if I did not like reading the idea and speculations of others towards certain events or actions. That doesn't in anyway make what is said evidence, at all.

       One motive for hoaxing it might be just to SEE IF THEY COULD.
      </p>
      <p>
       A test run for how big of a hoax they could pull off and who would buy it and who wouldn't. Just a big ole social test. It certainly wasn't the first mass shooting, but I we've seen a lot more mass shootings since that reek of false flag (don't have a specific source list to provide at the moment, but it would be easy to put one together).

       maybe, my problem with a lot of false flags claims is this sort of ubiquitous "they" with no clear political agenda or one that just sort of conveniently fits whatever narrative one wants to pitch. Even if the outcome of the event don't even come close to matching up with the agenda of those who are claimed to be behind it. I understand in a vacuum of factual information there is whole lot of room for flex.
      </p>
      <p>
       yet given the easy nature of information flow nobody breaks ranks and blows up a false flag or conspiracy for their own gains at a future date? You have this thermal nuclear bomb level of revelation one could drop at anytime, but it just never happens. Where is the Edward Snowden like person for this or any claimed false flag? I mean any of them over the last decade plus of them being claimed. I honestly think it's just bad crap happening. Being again, nothing changes, no one ever comes forward and the news cycle moves on in about a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the theory here? "They" just keep trying all these false flags even when none of them ever stick, they result in near zero changes and don't even stay in the news. I mean maybe, I don't think so it's not like I know for sure. Yet how do you have it both ways? How are the people behind the false flags such bumbling idiots that they keep doing them little to no effect on anything while also being so good at pulling them off in plain sight?

       I don't disagree with you. I have struggled to figure out the motive and how so many could be involved. At the end, it seems like enough hush money and a few very public heads on pikes might keep participants in line.
      </p>
      <p>
       But WHY. Is it a gun control long-game? Or, to sow deep feelings of danger and discontent even in the most idyllic wealthy areas, like Sandy Hook CT? Those both seem too broad and not directly affected--unless it really is a deep longterm conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's sort of how I arrived at the the "it's a test" theory.

       Emotions are complicated. I was 16 when my brother died of cancer after a 10 month battle. 5 minutes after he was literally rolled out of our house in a body bag, I sat down on the couch, ate cereal, and watched Futurama.

       In SH though he is laughing but then does what actors do to prepare to start and then starts crying. I think if he really did lose a child he would have just started talking while laughing (if coping mechanisms) then naturally his voice and tears would follow.

       Fixed that for you. A false flag is not necessarily a hoax. A hoax is a false flag. I can accept that many of the "mass causality" events we've been presented with are false flags (which can include legitimate victims), but I specifically believe Sandy Hook was a hoax (there were no actual victims).

       I don't go as far as saying there were no victims as the children who were supposed to die at Sandy Hook were likely murdered elsewhere. Think pizzagate.

       How did a kid his size carry the guns and ammo they said he carried.  Also, first his mother was a teacher, then a teacher's aide, then did not work at the school, then no one really knew her well.  From there on, things just started adding up, or rather not adding up.

       I assumed it was real until watching something called We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook, and seeing that there was no images of anything happening -- no surveillance footage of the shooting, and dash cam footage from police cars parked in the parking lot showed nothing and were selectively edited, when there should have been hundreds of people there. Then there is the famous footage of the people walking around into and out of the firehouse, and the lack of motive, and by the time I saw Gene Rosen, Robbie Parker, and Wayne Carver I was strongly thinking it could really be a hoax, which it was.

       For me, it was the interview with Grace McDonnell's parents. I started obsessively watching &amp; reading anything I could find for like 5 straight days. I couldn't stop crying for days after the shooting happened, the idea of so many little kids dying just crushed me, but not one person shed a single actual tear.

       Genuinely asking here. I keep seeing comments suggesting the school had closed a long time ago or was fake. If this really was a fake, or long closed school, how does that go unnoticed? Are there no families of the terminal generation of students who remember it closing then sending their kids elsewhere? Is there nobody in the community who recalls that used to be a school but now it isn’t? Nobody realized there’s no such school there?

       It had supposedly been closed in 2008, and all students were re-allocated to other area schools.  No one can say why people in the town don't talk about it, but the common conception is they were all paid off.

       An entire city of nearly 30,000 people are paid off to not mention that a school was closed, and not one principled person budges?
Furthermore, no evidence whatsoever in writing? No news article, flyer clipping, social media post, etc even mentioning the school in passing?
Is there a counter to this?

       Watch or listen to the interview I linked. There's no appearance of there having been a real functioning school there. If you wanted me to, I could show you videos of me at my elementary school, show you my yearbook, show you pictures of me at the entrance, and produce a great deal of solid evidence I was in school there at the time. No such thing with Sandy Hook.

       I grew suspicious when I noticed the school's windows were sparsely decorated while watching one of the two great documentaries covering this hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's the mountain of evidence those documentaries produce along side such a minute observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no wounded victims, only dead victims. That does not seem plausible.

      <p>
       When the coroner could not state how many were dead, how they died, and that the families were only shown pictures of the bodies.  All while cracking jokes and marveling at an amazing tent.

       When it was stated that Nancy Lanza was a teacher at the school, but then later it came out that she wasn't.

       When the old man down the street claimed that a bus full of children showed up at his door but he never called 911.  Then his story changed multiple times.

      <p>
       When the SWAT team all climbed through a tiny hole in the window instead of someone going in and then opening the main door for the rest.

      <p>
       When they found guns in Lanza's trunk that were supposedly used in his suicidal rampage.

       When photos from inside the Lanza house show each room in various states of order, taken apparently over multiple days while the scene was set up.

       When video of the SWAT storming the school was actually taken at a different school a few miles away.

       He says he didn't finish them all that day and he'll do them tomorrow, which is absurdly stupid. "Dr" Wayne Carver also could not say what the genders or ages of the victims were. He says each child was shot 3-11 times, and when asked where they were shot he said "all over."
      </p>
      <p>
       I show people his press conference right off the bat when explaining the Sandy Hook hoax, because it's really all you need since he is supposed to be the linchpin of the charade, an official-looking medical guy confirming that kids were shot, playing on people's imaginations, yet he does the exact opposite by betraying himself as a fraud with his goofy and ridiculous speech and bizarre behavior that unequivocally proves to anyone with an ounce of common sense that he is no doctor.
