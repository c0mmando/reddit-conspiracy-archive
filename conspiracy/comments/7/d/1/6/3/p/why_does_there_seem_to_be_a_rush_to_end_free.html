        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(I previously posted this but deleted it and rewrote parts. It came off really anti-left the first time.  I meant it to be pro free speech and show the power of letting the people you disagree with talk. But it happens on both sides and I know that. I felt I needed to fix the article to start a real conversation not a left v right one).</p>

<p>Freedom of speech means that I need to protect your right to say what I don&#39;t agree with. It is that simple.
Some how feelings became more important than actions. Words became violence, rather than actual violence being violent. The sad thing is that their are some that preach that we need to show compassion and understanding for all people. There are others that that say some of the most vile BS that could possibly be said about a person or group of people. In reality though they are both doing everything they can to quiet people they don&#39;t agree with, left or right it doesn&#39;t matter. I do not support the KKK, but I would rather have them speak what they think in the open rather than do it when they are alone. If they speak in public everyone gets to see what asses they are. If they say it when they are alone, then their thoughts and messages can grow and become stronger. Whenever a dictator comes into power the first thing they do is limit freedom of speech. Can&#39;t have people who disagree with you talking in public now can you? That would have the possibility of eroding the dictators power.
So everyone can we focus on one thing? Focus on Freedom of Speech? Freedom of Expression? Instead of feelings?
You want to bring the country together? Everyone needs to start to protect free speech and open debate, and let the people saying vile stuff show the world what they are.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I deleted and reposted because I need to be consistent.  It happens on both sides.  I am neither left or right, but lean Libertarian in my beliefs. And Freedom of Speech is one of my passions. But one of the things I hate the most is inconsistency.  It was unfair of me to make it sound like I felt this was a left only problem.  The left may be more vocal now or easier to see, but the problem exists on both sides. Always has in my lifetime.  Both sides limit free speech to keep us infighting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... forget Kuerig.  Focus on your last sentence &quot;I respect their right to be assholes but I am not going to help their cause&quot;.  I agree.  I&#39;ll go as far as let them be assholes......I am not going to stop them, and let everyone see what assholes they are.  Personally I think both sides in your example are assholes....and what they are doing is short sighted and doesn&#39;t deal with the issues.  But I respect that they can and do something I don&#39;t agree with (call for boycott or smash a machine that makes shitty coffee). BUT I will always protect their right to do things I think personally think are dumb.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People spew out all kinds of bigoted shit and then when you call them out on it, they cry that you&#39;re infringing on their freedom of speech. No. If the KKK has some kind of racist rally in public and I have a counter-rally against them, I&#39;m exercising my own freedom of speech, not ending theirs. </p>

<p>Freedom of speech means the government can not sensor you. It does NOT protect your words from being criticized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No shit.  I JUST said that to you. There is a difference between criticizing and shouting down.  There is a difference between disagreeing and heckling.  On both sides of the aisle. Do you see what I am saying? <strong>CRITICIZE CRITICIZE DO NOT STOP OR IMPEDE</strong>.
As soon as you try to stop someone from speaking you are chipping away at YOUR FREEDOM to speak freely.  Because if you are consistent and you want people to allow you to speak you need to allow them to speak also.<br/>
Now if you don&#39;t agree with that statement and want to be inconsistent thats fine.  You go do what you want to do, always know I&#39;ll have your back to say any dumb shit you want.</p>

<p>&quot;First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.</p>

<p>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— 
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.</p>

<p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— 
Because I was not a Jew.</p>

<p>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is exactly more of the same generic &quot;free speech&quot; banter that we see over and over. Anyone who doesn&#39;t know this stuff by fourth grade probably will not learn it.</p>

<p>We have generous freedom of speech in the United States -- probably the best in the world. But only <em>only</em> if we have platforms to actually say things.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why people make fun of so-called &quot;free speech&quot; rallies -- because they are using this general noncontroversial view as <em>cover</em> for another agenda -- for example, Nazis who pretend their free speech is under assault when it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>An adult discussion of &quot;free speech&quot; would focus on monopolization of speech so that only a few oligarchs get control over the vast majority of the information stream -- or where billionaires can fill up all the available free speech with deceptive (or even non-deceptive) campaign ads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a mix of things really... a new generation of people who are bit soft and take offense to everything, plus internet and social media letting people communicate with others or learn about stuff in diff part of the country. Also, teens and college kids..... on the internet, you sorta assume everyone is an adult but many are not, hence trolls being taking seriously. </p>

<p>College kids are idealistic and opinionated, plus they have the free time to organize in protest or just troll/harass people on twitter or something. Sometimes this can be a good thing, but it can also just be wasted effort or even harmful. We have too many people, companies, or organizations giving these people power or influence over them.... when it could be a whiny 18yr old who will think and act completely differently 10 years later once he is a working adult and has a better understanding of the world. </p>

<p>Your &quot;Free Speech under attack&quot; is most obvious in college. All these microaggressions, &quot;safe spaces&quot;, inflated claims of race/gender discrimination, and so on is rampant on college campuses..... they are censoring free speech everywhere instead of promoting a civil debate, and the college admins go along with it so they don&#39;t lose money. </p>

<p>There is no point in trying to change the opinions and behaviors of the older generation, but we can shape the newer one, and it starts in school. I totally agree with open debate but people seem less and less willing to listen to something they don&#39;t agree with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have the right to say whatever you want without the government censoring you.</p>

<p>No one has the obligation to listen, provide you a platform, take anything you say seriously or give you any help or recognition to get your message out.</p>

<p>This post and the previous one is just another feels thread because people feel that whatever they want to say isn&#39;t being merited by others. Not realizing freedom of speech does not involve anyone giving a crap about what you have up say.</p>

<p>If they speak in public everyone gets to see what asses they are. If they say it when they are alone, then their thoughts and messages can grow and become stronger.</p>

<p>So, here&#39;s the issue with this. You&#39;re assuming that the KKK and neo-nazis, white nationalists are coming out the gate screaming about niggers and jews and burning crosses on people&#39;s lawns.</p>

<p>You&#39;re assuming that they are stupid. They are not stupid. They are masters of convincing disaffected and vulnerable people to come to their way of thinking, either directly or by masking their ideas behind suits and nice haircuts and calm, &quot;rational&quot; arguments. But at the end of the day, these folks&#39; end goal is a to make the USA a white ethnostate, and the only way to achieve that is through ethic cleansing.</p>

<p>Obviously, at this point it&#39;s laughable to imagine that they could achieve these goals. But every movement starts small and with little power. At what point is good allowed to stand up against bad? That is, do people have to wait until they&#39;re already powerful enough to commit atrocities (or start committing them) before you can try to stop them?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a German in 1928. Is there any point when it would have been acceptable for him to try and stop Hitler by force before he came to power, or do you feel that free speech is so inalienable that we can&#39;t even suppress it to stop someone who would eliminate it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, It is that inalienable. When you suppress it, you become the person eliminating it. You become the thing you are trying to prevent. You are getting to decide that one group is not allowed to think certain things. The best ideas should win out. If your group is losing, you don&#39;t shut the other group down, you make better arguments. </p>

<p>So, would you say that the holocaust was just, since the people who were against it obviously didn&#39;t make their arguments well enough?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many other insidious ways to shut down free speech. There are two strategies in particular I have noticed becoming more common. One is to accuse people of not using the correct terminology and therefore attack their phrasing of an argument rather than the content of their concern. The other is to cut access to any supporting sources of data that could be used by the opposition. </p>

<p>I have seen the latter used in immigration issues where governments will not collect (or at least claim to not collect) crime data based on nationality. I have also encountered this tactic while trying to research the women in combat debate. Documents and reports that I had read on the internet several years before which were critical of the idea mysteriously vanished, the Wikipedia page had been rewritten and a chapter disappeared from one online book. 
I’m off on a rant now, but yeah, shutting down Milo speeches is only the tip of the iceberg </p>
