       Privacy fears are useless. The war is over. It's been over since before we knew there was a war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ominous "they" . They have us fearing Russians? There's much more information in the sites I mentioned than in a Yahoo breach. The volume of profiling obviously grows exponentially when you add apps to the mix. Tindr, Grindr, Snapchat, Kik, Whatsapp, eBay, Twitter, Instagram etc etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       But just a small handful of websites likely have everything needed to accurately categorize the majority of us in significant and holographic ways. And I can't find any way to gain access to the information in the possession of any of them. I'm in the US and I feel like we have a lot less access than Europeans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone ever try to obtain the information held by any or all of these companies, or companies like them?

       I thought this was interesting.

       Truthstream media did a video about government trolls. They cited a leaked PowerPoint like document that looks like it was meant to train cyber manipulatists.
      </p>
      <p>
       One page that stood out was about controlling the viewpoint. That you could essentially provide a perspective, gain interest, then provide an appeared end point to that interest and people would follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through that you can basically control where the public’s mind goes, what they think, and control what is being talked about and when that story will end from public discord. I’ve noticed this type of manipulation going on for quite a while.

       Ever heard of black mirrors ?
Its a fascinating high tier serie with futuristic looks about technology and soceity. So a really dark vibe of how the future can be like.
Watch the episoide nosedive for a good idea about credit scores and social credits...other episoides are also scary as fuck and realistic.

       They are already doing this is China but to a much more Orwellian degree. Speaking to my colleagues about it, one of them said it's not much of an issue as nobody will take any notice. Unfortunately these are the times we are living in.

       It's literally happening in China now. Mandatory by 2020, and they're thinking about adding penalties for those with lower scores. There is already benefits for those with higher scores, such as queue jumps, discounts on goods, etc. Scores will lower for those who associate with others with low scores, this creates segregation and an 'underclass'. Sadly it's happening whether we believe it or not, and an episode of Black Mirror (can't remember which one) shows the possibility of our future perfectly...this has been in the pipeline for years in China and has already been rolled out.

       The aim is to family every aspect of our lives. Theres a very interesting presentation on the future of gaming from 8ish years ago detailing exactly this, and speculating about the future of gaming, and how it can be applied to every  a day life to maximise profit and productivity - we now live in the future they were discussing.

       Some people genuinely have a desire to reduce fapping. The supposed benefits of not fapping are questionable.

       I'm always reminded of "The Contest" Episode of Seinfeld when I see the sub referenced in passing.

       The 'supposed benefits' come from quitting an addiction. If you've ever dealt with an addiction that you felt was having a huge negative impact on your life and then quit, it is extremely empowering.

       They are definitely not questionable. Maybe fapping itself isn't so harmful but pornography is.

       How dare you? Do you know that gender is an archaic, repressive thoughtform? I'm a cis-identifying, heterosexual, Caucasian male, thus a part of the occupiers of the lowest rung of society. I'm personally responsible for countless horrors-unimaginable throughout history, even before I was born - how, I'm not sure, but the promoted, astroturfed-&amp;-useful-idiot-promoted consensus says it's so, so it must be true! I just wish I could remember the time travel part.

       They literally refer to these things as super powers, that's why OC mentioned it. If you don't want people talking about how your cult claims to give you super powers, don't talk about how you have super powers. It's as simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you learn nothing from Scientology?
      </p>
      <p>
       Porn can have undesirable effects on your psyche. This is well documented by scientific study.
      </p>
      <p>
       Testosterone levels peak after a week of not masturbating, after which point they subsequently drop. I.e. not fapping doesn't benefit you hormonally as has been studied thus far. Masturbating once a week is a good amount for optimum health, although doing so more frequently isn't a death sentence or anything. There is an evolutionary basis for this. Your brain largely doesn't know the difference between sex and masturbation. The increase in testosterone is to compensate for lost reproductive opportunity during a woman's menstrual period, but doesn't last for more than a week, because guess what else doesn't last for more than a week. Women are horniest immediately prior to menstruation. Guess why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nofap is a cult. Sex is healthy, and so is masturbation. You're a physical being. Not eating is just as stupid as not masturbating. Get over yourself and your made up superpowers. Nothing about your pretend sacred practice is going to help you. The placebo effect can be convincing though.

       It's absolute nonsense. Actual scientific study on the matter shows that masturbating once a week will result in peak testosterone levels for males. Females would refuse sex during menstruation (low probability of getting pregnant). This would deny males sex, for this 2-7 day period. The consequence is increasing testosterone to motivate sexual behavior as soon as the menstruation ends, to increase sexual activity to make up for lost time and get pregnant. Nature assumes 75% of your children will die. You're supposed to have 10+ kids to pass the torch in the absence of modern medicine. Remember that when SHTF.

      <p>
       It honestly hasn't really been that long on an evolutionary scale. Human civilization as we could describe it existing outside of the pressure to breed for survivability has only been around for the low tens of thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homo sapiens has been around for 2.5 million years, and these same pressures very well may have impacted the lifeforms we evolved from on an even larger timescale, say 10 million years potentially.

       Yeah. Being horny is a good thing for the survival of the species though. We'll likely have to genetically engineer libido and fertility back into the species eventually in order to survive. I'm sure by then we could just grow humans in artificial wombs, but that is economically expensive and not likely ever to be viable on the scale of billions.

       You're referring to a monogamic relationship, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       But our (the homo sapiens) cultural developement also knows the concept of polygamy. There the female period matters less significantly. Also in nature the concept of polygamy is more spread as monogamy. I think monogamy works much better for us humans and has worked so far, but from our natural conditions we could also stick to polygamy.

       Polygamy does not change reproductive availability in a large group of people co-habitating, as early man would have. You literally had groups of like 40 people sometimes just all living and sleeping in the same cave, or in one or two large structures, all huddled closely together. Women sync their menstrual cycles when co-habitating to that of the alpha female, this is to take all females off the market to secure the progeny of the alpha male. Whether polygamy or monogamy, the result is the same, nature has made sure of that.

       I think it's the cult-like mentality some of those people possess, like they're part of some enlightened group because they've decided to stop jerking it and look down on anyone who
       <em>
        gasp
       </em>
       still views porn.

       It's ridiculous you think that's what NoFap is. While some I'm sure do take it to the extreme, and make the whole thing look silly, try not masturbating for a few days, a week, two weeks, a month if you can and see what happens. I still wank it from time to time, but I once did abstain for a few weeks and the results were a good thing (IMO)

       I have. Felt pretty horny for that week and then afterwards nothing. Looked it up and turns out there have been studies on this and there is an evolutionary basis for this.

       Testosterone levels peak after a week of no sexual activity because of women's menstrual cycles. It is to make up for lost reproductive opportunities. Kinda funny that way. After a week testosterone levels plateau and eventually decrease. This is because your body assumes there are no sexual partners available, and it can't keep up those high test levels for too long, it actually has severe physiological affects (you can't retain fluids well, your prostate will swell, you will produce too much blood which stresses your circulatory system, and eventually your sperm count will drop). Your test levels thus drop. This is why a lot of people on no fap report being irritable after a while. There's a biological basis for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Porn impacts your brain's natural reward system. It can induce ED and depression in some people. Watching less porn is good for everyone. I'd recommend watching it as a warm up to sex or with a partner, but never alone, certainly not regularly. You can regain the lost gray matter from your destroyed reward system by no longer watching porn.

       Now, of course, this isn't a 20/20 expose of getting on watchlists... You're not going to see a smoking gun laid out for you by reporters in the MSM, but the government habit of "punishing" those that leave the matrix is pretty obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       People want to make fun of me for suggesting you do some looking on your own.
The funny thing here, though,  is that you think you're so helpless when it comes to putting a few key words into a search engine.
Why is it that everyone asks for evidence instead of USING THE COMPUTER THEY'RE ALREADY ON?

       Imagine a giant pond covered in millions of paper boats a dark night.
       <br/>
       One boat has a candle on it.
This boat sticks out like a sore thumb, it's a bright light in the darkness, and it slightly illuminates several nearby boats.
      </p>
      <p>
       This boat was a MySpace early adopter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine that same lake years later and almost every boat has a candle of some kind. They're either Facebook users, Google users, smart phone holders,  Twitter posters or just don't try hard not to be tracked.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the boats have candles, the lake is now a blanket of lights bobbing around in the ripples.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one of those boats doesn't have a candle, suddenly they stick out like a sore thumb.
       <br/>
       But that's okay, with every boat around them sporting a candle, you can still see them as clear as day.

       Okay, so I️ have been “off grid” for quite sometime. Not because I’m wearing a tin foil hat, but mainly because it’s a gross invasion of privacy. Are you suggesting that it doesn’t even matter that you’re off grid?

       Well it depends how far off the grid you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have a girlfriend, kids, roommate? Do they use Facebook? Their phones are allowed to record your conversations when you're within mic range of them. Along with gps location.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do they post pictures of you guys together? If some jackass tags you in it, whether you have an account or not, Facebook will recognize your face.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be truly off the grid you
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       the cooperation of the people you are surrounded by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then, walking in public you'll always be surrounded by listening devices. And there is no way to keep any government or app developer from determining your location based on who's phone hears your voice.

       My sister has gone over the top. We are both adults and nearly the same age and get along on almost everything. I'd call her my best friend but with this... we can't have a single Christmas moment or Friday night drinking wine without her pulling out her stupid fucking phone to take a photo or video of it. It makes me want to slap the phone out of her hand and just be like "oh shit, sorry that last sip went down the wrong pipe and I thought I was choking".

       It's kind of game over at this point. Privacy is dead. People should just post whatever the fuck they want anymore because you are going to be thrown into a box on some database sitting in Utah anyway.

       I've always had this crazy dream which I wish everyone would embrace which is you just go off the rails and send batshit crazy emails, make rando posts and all sorts of other things to make their data useless. I don't think it would work but it's nice to think about.

       People get suspicious if you don't participate in the glorious clusterfuck of social media. I say that knowing that I'm typing this on reddit. From personal experience I was interviewing for a job and had everything pretty much locked down than at the last minute the hiring manager threw a couple of last questions at me and one of them was "why can't I find your Facebook profile? Is it under another name?" I actually almost lost the job because of that because I told her I didn't have one and her response was "you are applying to a technology company and you don't have a Facebook profile?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I could have gone on some privacy rant but I didn't feel like it. I quit that job a year later. I should have saw that as a warning sign.

       Even though getting off the grid with each day seems to be, for people who still aren't brain dead at least, the best idea since it can make you 100% system-free, unpredictable, untrackable and independent - ie. a threat to the very system you were born into and told to endlessly worship.

       "Some of the sites checking out Javascript have gone as far as to probe up to 500 fonts, measuring the height and width of strings secretly printed onto a Web page. By using hidden scripts, they extract device “fingerprints” from users’ browsers, giving them a way around both the Do Not Track HTTP header and any legal restrictions on cookies". Perhaps they can figure out something similar with flash....?

       This is wrong.

       You know those little fb, Google, Reddit etc logos you see at the bottom of almost every website that lets you share stuff? This facility allows fb, Google and whoever else to get your data from that site.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they dont need to share the data they already have it! Facebook can see what your doing on Reddit, Amazon, YouTube (google) and god knows what else.

       Yeah but unless you practice good opsec (and even then that's not enough to escape the govt) they're gonna know about you through your browsing of other sites. Just on reddit I'm getting tracked by Google and Amazon, according to Privacy Badger.

       The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch. Among other things, we're looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay.
      </p>

       We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.

       If anything CP starring me would get me a sympathy vote from people. It's way easier to just plant CP on people's computers which they have done before. Like with Stephen Paddock's brother. Even then you can somewhat protect yourself with the right opsec or claim that it was a virus or something.

       Until someone accidentally picks you as a target just for sociopathic fun or you accidentally piss of the wrong person with access to these things and there's no way to defend yourself. People can lie and be disingenious, just because YOU own up doesn't mean someone can't lie about the context of some videos or texts/phone calls you've made.

      <p>
       Say "fuck off" to a mean person somewhere, or leave a boyfriend/girlfriend with connections. Said person uses all this shit to destroy you. Can't do diddly squat. No amount of "but I'm a nobody and own my faults" is helping you in that scenario.

       Think about the larger picture, and also think about that not everyone is literally YOU and CAN'T just "own up", like a politician or celebrity. There's over 7 billion people here.

       Not making any assumptions here, but the common response against anti-privacy advocates is “I’ve got nothing to hide”. Unfortunately it’s not that simple. Everyone is negatively effected by mass spying. When a few people can properly plan out human behavior they can manipulate anything to their own benefit.

       The mass collection in the right hands could potentially make the world better, but the right hands will never have access to this information.

       There are much more issues that are presented, but this alone is enough to wake up to how dangerous all this is. Companies advertising to your interests is one thing, but hidden powerhouses controlling elections, laws, and information is a much darker issue.

       You could be identified from just about any metadata, like for example the timing pattern of you visiting different websites. Even if your IP &amp; MAC, or even the hardware you are using, changed every second, you will eventually leave a pattern that is unique and recognizable.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the eyes of the justice system I guess this won't affect us for a while and you can escape it with something like a VPN to a degree, but my major concern is covert manipulation. At the moment these big corporations that gather up everything they can don't care if you do something you'd want to hide, that's just more good &amp; valuable data for them. Why isn't Apple co-operating with the FBI for example - why do they protect their customers data to such a degree? They want the power to themselves.

       I read a research paper a couple years back that made a frightening conclusion:
      </p>
      <p>
       With 7-9 data points from any of the OP websites, among others, there are tracking algo's that can name you and pinpoint your location over 90% of the time. And that was then. I am certain the numbers have changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may think you have been as anonymous as possible, but the use of IP addresses is only one tiny piece of this puzzle. I don't know the details, of course, but it was compelling and disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as time goes on it will only get worse, from a consumer/citizen POV.

       Unless you go to great lengths to hide your traces, they would be able to find patterns to link everything to your singular 'online ID'.

       It absolutely makes great sense. The way the touch ID technology is designed to store your fingerprint data using a one-way function. I can verify that your fingerprint is the same one used during set up but if somebody had access to the Raw touch ID data, he would be unable to generate an image or representation of a fingerprint. Quite simple.

       I’d bet that Apple, google, Lenovo, HP, Samsung and any other company with a finger scanner/touchID device (like phone, tablet, laptop, PC) has more finger prints on record combined world wide than police departments combined worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information on the devices is linked to other personal information easier too and more easy to access than paper records filed away from decades ago.  These companies run apps that have you bank details, personal details, porn like details.... pretty much everything op mentioned and more.

       It's scary how many people WANT fingerprint on phones. It's bad enough when it's on the back and you can tape over it. But when they implant it in the screen?

       It's not about knowing your face and your fingerprints, that's trivial to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could have claimed to the police
       <strong>
        or your blackmailers
       </strong>
       that it wasn't you who searched for those terms or
       <strong>
        took that Uber ride
       </strong>
       to the sex club/shooting range. Now there is proof that you, and only you, unlocked the phone first and it wasn't a buddy being a dick or someone who stole your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has nothing to do with your security. It was about securing the story of you.

       Does it really matter? “They” know things you wouldn’t want to know they knew already and have since before most of us were born.  I like to add a little spice in my life just to keep “them” wondering.  Search for anything and everything ... job security for “them” entertainment for me.

       I actually downloaded my Facebook account data. It’s what convinced me to delete my account. I was an early adopter of Facebook back when it was university specific, so I’d provided them with a good 1/3 of my life and they noted every movement. It was so detailed, not necessarily in depth, but specificity I was impressed and miffed by it. I told my wife that it feels like having access to another persons cell phone for the last decade; for all intent and purposes I was a dumb kid compared to the dumb adult I am now :)

       Ha! Good question. I don't know, because I don't talk to them now that I'm not on FB ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, their lives are unaffected by it. They continue to scroll their newsfeed and I don't think they really notice I'm missing. I wasn't too active these last several years anyway, so it's not like I created a content vacuum for them to notice my absence. Most of these people have so many damn friends I don't think they'd notice if their spouse left, let alone me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did it for my sanity, so the benefits far outweigh any perceived loss. I've always been a big fan of texting a person or group of friends when I want to share something that pertained to them and you end up doing the same when FB is gone. People are going to bitch about not seeing photos of you as much (if that's what you used it for like I did?) but it's just as easy to send to those who really relied on it if they were out of your region, like my parents. Now instead of posting a photo from a wedding to FB I just text my family and say "Miss ya!" and if they want to save it they can. If not, no harm no foul. Additionally, if I group text I try to observe their preferences as well, so I don't spam superfluous crap. It's just knowing your audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was such a tangent, but hope it helps? I'd recommend you download your history first. Go to your early days and throughout and just look at the data. Most likely afterwards you won't care what your friends think, cause you'll just want to GTFO like I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck!

       and their comment (you replied to it as well), which is very accurate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are very few people these days that don't have a Facebook, or don't shop on Amazon, or don't search on Google. "They" have data on the vast majority of every living person.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is true. I just picked and chose an enemy and it happened to be FB. Amazon knows all my shit, because I live in the boonies and don't have local shopping options, so everything is delivered. Your comment summed it up nicely, "The fix is in and the game is over".

       We should make a point to be clear about what type of AI. So many just laugh when anti-AI talk goes on.

      <p>
       An AI system that has a specific purpose, basically just an advanced system, is likely no issue in most cases.

       A full on AI system that is meant to replicate consciousness is a different story.

       There are already apps and sites that do this. Also, plug your phone in before bed or anytime you don't need it and set it next to a speaker playing some random foreign language radio station. Just fuck with them anyway you can.

       I do Facebook ads for my business and target specific audiences and I can tell you that Facebook alone knows more than almost anyone could imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can target FB ads based on household income, how long you've owned your home, whether you own va rent, the value of your home, your age, your ethnicity, your sexual preference, your current location (YOUR CURRENT LOCATION, LIKE AT THIS VERY MOMENT), what type of vehicle you drive, and much much more.

       Whoa!
I've done similar Facebook marketing too.. age, sex, location, interests, socioeconomic bracket, targeting particular groups.. and that was for actual social marketing/bar/nightlife promotions 12 months ago.. but I haven't seen detail of that magnitude.  How is it possible that all of that detail links back to someone's profile? Is it all linked back to our digital identity that we can't even see ourselves?

       Because they're not just looking at your info, they're looking at the info at every single person that you're connected to.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're also making educated guesses based on that info. Like, you know how people will post stuff like "I was talking about XYZ product the other day and then suddenly I got a targeted add on Facebook for that product! I never did an internet search for it, I just was talking about it!".
      </p>
      <p>
       People assume Facebook is listening to them through their phone or something, but it's not even that. They are just predicting that you might be interested in a product based on your demographic information.

       When you apply for a car loan or cell phone or job you agree to let the company run a credit check or background check on you. You also agree to let those company's share that information with their "affiliates" (read: literally anyone)
      </p>

       They then sell that background check/credit report information to information brokers who sell it to anyone that cares to buy it.

       I've always wondered how Facebook got my real name... I made an account 2007 with a fake name... No other family members had one until 5-10yrs later, I have no credit cards, no license/car, I was living with my parents at the time, and I was on a shared phone plan. Yet if I put in my real name under search, my profile would come up, and I don't have it anywhere on my account/settings.
To this day I still don't have a phone number connected to it, never once downloaded the app, and I'm still using a 2007 Hotmail deactivated address with another fake name that was attached to the email account... The only thing I can think of is facial recognition somehow.

       Don't forget that it's now legal for ISPs to sell your activity to anyone as well. Some things would be obscured if you're visiting mostly HTTPS sites, but they'll still have DNS lookups and domains you've visited and much more for non encrypted connections.

       Then there are the plethora of mobile apps that are recording your background sound "for advertising" and selling that data to large aggregators. So we'll even have to moderate our personal conversations if a device is nearby. How do you reform political parties when TPTB have that kind of leverage?

       Psychopaths have an unusual share of power in this world for a number of well documented reasons. Therefore they have an outsized effect on the outcome of civilization. Example - most Americans believe weed should be legal. That had zero effect on legislation. Most Americans think the middle class could use a tax break and the wealthy should pay a more reasonable amount. Again that won't happen. Psychopaths for better or worse largely control all our destinies. Most people don't want to go to war, most people want universal equitable healthcare... Etc etc.

       Are you familiar with the concept of the Technocrocy, the Technocratic social system or the theory Technocratic Eugenics? Corbett discusses it in
       <a href="https://youtu.be/0wlNey9t7hQ">
        Why Big Oil Conquered the World
       </a>
       . It discusses Eugenics, Carbon Eugenics, and  Technocratic Eugenics. Problem of the last 100 years, of the last 50 years and the next 25 years. The degree of control that can be gained by mass data collection on individuals and populations allows them to predict and fine tune to control our options, behaviors, emotions.

       I'm not neck deep in believing everything available and probably know less than some of the resident thinkers among this sub. Thank goodness. I've a thirst for knowledge, but I read slowly and forget if I haven't read a paragraph sixteen, it sometimes doesn't store in my wheelhouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently I'm combing over the document known as
       <em>
        Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars
       </em>
       , which is discussed in Bill Cooper's
       <em>
        Behold a Pale Horse
       </em>
       , which I haven't read. It's interesting so far. Google it if you're unfamiliar and curious. It was supposedly found inside an old IBM printer obtained at a Boeing Surplus store.

       On YouTube, General Michael Hayden has a few things to say as the former head of both the NSA and the CIA. His Johns Hopkins interview is informative. There's probably some disinformation throughout, but as I said, I'm not the smartest kid in class. I know Jack shit about technology beyond my base user knowledge as a consumer of said technology.

       The top three oil production countries, in order, are Russia, Saudis, United States. Any one of the other producers are less than one half of the production of any one of those three. So if you are going to be looking at oil power, you look at the oiligarchs in those three. Those three are in the midst of an international takeover. Russia, in reaction to US sanctions, has done its best to elect Trump. They and the US executive branch are now allies, where they were enemies before. The US has the head of the largest oil company as its Secretary of State. The US and Saudis were already aligned. Saudi Arabia is now cleaning house and consolidating its internal power structure. These three countries are now in control of a huge chunk of the world's oil production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to say this is about the first oil baron family is frankly a distraction away from the conspiracy staring us in the face. And many in this sub just ignore the oil takeover in progress in the US. The actively promote a narrative where the current administration is the good guy. They wave shiny objects like supposed pedo rings and uranium deals to turn attention away from this coup. And the hatred of Trumps enemies is stoked through continuous memes and stories that pretend that some leftists in Hollywood and Clintonworld are somehow the largest threats right now. Its mostly bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to wake up and pay attention to what's actually going on around the world instead of shoe-horning the world into old conspiracies of Jews and Rockefellers.
      </p>
      <p>
       My two cents.

       Was Orwell 'off' at all, or was his 1984 describing the world as it was during World War II (which had taken place right before he wrote the novel)?

       Just seed these websites with conflicting data, go on amazon and look at whatever random crap, add it to your wishlist or basket, same with reddit just subscribe to random subs, like weird shit on facebook.

       I had a long reply written but it ended up like a rant. Short version:
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook is the one I'd be worried about the most right now. They have more information on more people than any government, but without any oversight or culpability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook and Google want to expand their data so much, they have projects where they bring internet to remote locations with balloons and drones:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://x.company/loon/">
        https://x.company/loon/

        https://info.internet.org/en/story/connectivity-lab/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       and give out internet so you can connect to Facebook:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting watch that touches on the power Facebook has over businesses and governments:

      <hr/>
      <p>
       The good news is it's expensive to use this much data. Takes a lot of hardware and a lot of time. So for now, it's going to be used for advertising.

       This is why nothing about me, what I do, or where I am from is in any way accurate. This is also why I delete my profile every 12 months and start over, with more false information.

       Simply avoid Facebook, use a different search machine (
       <a href="https://www.startpage.com/">
        https://www.startpage.com/

       The digital advertising industry. The data collection is sold to third-party firms. Review the industry map, there are companies that specialize in aggregating data from multiple sources then pairing on unique identifiers to combine databases. They then sell this aggregated data pools to other companies who specialize in analyzing and bucketing the profile categories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once categorized this information can be auctioned for targeted marketing - for example a Hotel chain wants to target their ad to single females aged 20-29 with income over $90k. Then those ads show up in instagram/facebook/etc. Tailored access is available down to that level.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to get better transparency over this the idea might be to figure out who these companies are, then go to work for them. Figure out what level of access to information actually exists. Better yet, any of us employed by or have access to this information already? People inside would be in a great position to discuss how it works internally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meetup.com events in tech centers is an awesome thing. Free beer, free pizza, and a lot of recruiters at many of the talks hosted by companies in the industry. Often eye-opening presentations on how it fits together.

       Don't know why your comment was at 0, because you speak the truth.
       <br/>
       So much of what is known about us stems from what we willingly share, end of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even years ago when family &amp; friends were forwarding those
       <strong>
        <em>
         seemingly benign
        </em>
       </strong>
       emails asking about "everyday" preferences, it struck me as a creepy way to garner information many of us wouldn't normally share. Those questions always began with soft topics, but then escalated to things of a more intimate nature:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "[this] or [that] soft drink?"
       </em>
       <br/>
       <em>
        "[ice cream] or [cake]?"
       </em>
       <br/>
       <em>
        "[going on this kind of date] or [that one]?"
       </em>
       <br/>
       <em>
        "[being in crowds] or [spending time quietly]?"
       </em>
       <br/>
       <em>
        "[having kids] or [living the life of a bachelor/bachelorette]?"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       ...Those always made me think,
       <em>
        Whoever designed these lists is digging for something...
       </em>
       <br/>
       Emails like that heightened my sense about data miners (long before I'd heard that term), and made me question exactly what I was sharing, and what information could be inferred.

       Thank you it is nice to know there are friends out there that think the same. As for why my comment was rated zero is because no one wants to take responsibility, we offer up the information, yet it is the others fault for using what is given to them how they please.......

       Yeah, it has always baffled me to see people expressing disdain or even disgust about how their information is used, but then end with something like, "I'm rarely on fb anymore because of this. Now I only use it for [X]."
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't do anything about fb's abhorrent shadow profiles; but if you continue feeding anything to them despite being knowledgable about their practices, your words are moot.

       Facebook keeps suggesting I friend out of state single mothers (happily married, third child born last week).
Google gives such bad results that I switched to Bing 2 weeks ago. Amazon knows what I purchase because I buy from them. Pornhub serves cuck videos, yet never any good German male on Italian female anal videos. Reddit...I only log in to comment, otherwise I lurk and sort by new. Still  waiting on a call for my face to face background check....

       You could be identified from just about any metadata, like for example the timing pattern of you visiting different websites. Even if your IP &amp; MAC, or even the hardware you are using, changed every second, you will eventually leave a pattern that is unique and recognizable.

       In the eyes of the justice system I guess this won't affect us for a while and you can escape it with something like a VPN to a degree, but my major concern is covert manipulation. At the moment these big corporations that gather up everything they can don't care if you do something you'd want to hide, that's just more good &amp; valuable data for them. Why isn't Apple co-operating with the FBI for example - why do they protect their customers data to such a degree? They want the power to themselves.

       I read a research paper a couple years back that made a frightening conclusion:
      </p>
      <p>
       With 7-9 data points from any of the OP websites, among others, there are tracking algo's that can name you and pinpoint your location over 90% of the time. And that was then. I am certain the numbers have changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may think you have been as anonymous as possible, but the use of IP addresses is only one tiny piece of this puzzle. I don't know the details, of course, but it was compelling and disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as time goes on it will only get worse, from a consumer/citizen POV.

       Even though getting off the grid with each day seems to be, for people who still aren't brain dead at least, the best idea since it can make you 100% system-free, unpredictable, untrackable and independent - ie. a threat to the very system you were born into and told to endlessly worship.

       Ha! Good question. I don't know, because I don't talk to them now that I'm not on FB ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, their lives are unaffected by it. They continue to scroll their newsfeed and I don't think they really notice I'm missing. I wasn't too active these last several years anyway, so it's not like I created a content vacuum for them to notice my absence. Most of these people have so many damn friends I don't think they'd notice if their spouse left, let alone me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did it for my sanity, so the benefits far outweigh any perceived loss. I've always been a big fan of texting a person or group of friends when I want to share something that pertained to them and you end up doing the same when FB is gone. People are going to bitch about not seeing photos of you as much (if that's what you used it for like I did?) but it's just as easy to send to those who really relied on it if they were out of your region, like my parents. Now instead of posting a photo from a wedding to FB I just text my family and say "Miss ya!" and if they want to save it they can. If not, no harm no foul. Additionally, if I group text I try to observe their preferences as well, so I don't spam superfluous crap. It's just knowing your audience.

       That was such a tangent, but hope it helps? I'd recommend you download your history first. Go to your early days and throughout and just look at the data. Most likely afterwards you won't care what your friends think, cause you'll just want to GTFO like I did.

       Good luck!

       and their comment (you replied to it as well), which is very accurate.

        There are very few people these days that don't have a Facebook, or don't shop on Amazon, or don't search on Google. "They" have data on the vast majority of every living person.

       This is true. I just picked and chose an enemy and it happened to be FB. Amazon knows all my shit, because I live in the boonies and don't have local shopping options, so everything is delivered. Your comment summed it up nicely, "The fix is in and the game is over".

       I'm actually surprised Facebook hasn't bought a controlling stake in these companies or purchased them outright.
