       I only got on r/conspiracy for the first time all day about an hour ago, and lots of people are freaking out. There are people discussing bans and shilling, which is pretty normal, but there is also some strange vote manipulation happening. I've watched a comment go from +4 to -8 in the span of 20 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, it is important that everyone, regardless of your political ideology or ideas about this sub, browse by /new first and foremost. Browsing by /new gives
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       the opportunity to set the tone of discussion. It let's
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       fight the shills, bots, and bad actors first hand. It lets
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       control the sub. Forget the front page, by the time a post is there the battle is already over for better or for worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you care about this sub, its integrity, and its well being, you
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       browse by /new. Don't feel obligated to post in every new thread, just jump in where you feel you have something to contibute. Submit articles and self-posts too! Put time and effort into each comment and post submission and help keep this sub alive. Don't leave. I left r/politics when it was subverted, I left r/wikileaks, I left r/sandersforpresident. I refuse to leave r/conspiracy. Don't. Give. Up. This is a multi-partisan appeal. I don't care what your politics are, just engage in a collegial manner and browse by /new, that's all you gotta do.
      </p>
      <p>
       To all you real ones out there- Keep up the fight.

       I'll take your comment as an opportunity to say that it is important to set the tone properly. Simply saying "first" isn't going to help a post at all. We need to make sure we are adding substance to a discussion. I'm assuming you either are or saw the convo with the other poster I had about this very thing...

       That was my way of completely agreeing with you – even to the point that I was on the "New" tab when you submitted it, upvoted it immediately, then posted that to grab humor from an old posting meme, because it was perfectly relevant and supportive of what you were saying. I'm busy as hell and shouldn't be on Reddit at all. Just looking for vids to watch while I work.

       I saw this too.  Now why wouldn't that be reported globally?  Here we all are living under the assumption that the plague fizzled out centuries ago thanks to hygiene &amp; antibiotics... and it still looks like those negate it quickly, which is great.  But why isn't this taught in school, or even discussed on the news?  Apparently Bubonic plague isn't "dirty" enough laundry... or it is so dirty it can't be discussed?

       Not necessarily about the plague it'self but the lack of media coverage.

       Thinking of moving to Steemit for good. At least it's completely uncensorable, since everything you do is coded into the blockchain... plus you can potentially make some money from your contributions.

        There have been many Republicans who have defended his actions

      <blockquote>

        “Take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus. There’s just nothing immoral or illegal here. Maybe just a little bit unusual,” said Alabama State Auditor Jim Ziegler.
       </p>
       <p>
        "It was 40 years ago," Alabama Marion County GOP chair David Hall tells me. "I really don't see the relevance of it. He was 32. She was supposedly 14. She's not saying that anything happened other than they kissed."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Other than being with an underage person - he didn't really force himself," Alabama Geneva County GOP chairman Riley Seibenhener tells me. "I know that's bad enough, but I don't know. If he withdraws, it's five weeks to the election...that would concede it to the Democrat."
       </p>
       <p>
        Alabama Geneva County GOP chairman Riley Seibenhener, who called me back, says he doesn't believe the allegations are true, but if they're true he won't support him - but, at the same time, it's not "forcible rape."
       </p>
       <p>
        "I know that 14-year-olds don't make good decisions," he adds.

       The fact that people can't see the uptick in Biden posts and the agenda behind that is disappointing. They like to dismiss the fact that they're clearly being manipulated.

       If someone is pushing something because they have a political agenda or not does it change the fact that someone's behavior is extremely bizarre at best?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and acknowledge that someone
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       pushing that story hard, I have no problem with that, but don't use that observation to discredit the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the information is able to be discredited, then discredit it on it's own merit. I have a hard time believing that it is possible for any reasonable person to watch those videos of Joe Biden interacting with small girls and think that they're completely normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone might be pushing the story because they want to discredit Biden, but if Biden has done these things and no one's called him out, does it actually matter who is pushing the info? Those videos aren't faked and this isn't a one time "mistake" those videos are showing a pattern of behavior.

       I don't know. Could be he's just socially inept (seems unlikely for someone to make it so far with a career so dependent on social skills), could be he's a predator, could be a lot of things, I don't know but I don't think you can just categorically dismiss any option and it's something to investigate.

       A superlative suggestion, sir. With just two minor flaws. One, it will only be seen by people who already do it. And two, it will only be seen by people who already do it. Now I realise that technically speaking that's only one flaw but I thought that it was such a big one that it was worth mentioning twice.

       Propoganda does this to people.  If you listen to mainstream news all day, then it's hard not to be hysterical about Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are people who see no alternatives to the current two party setup and losing to an arrogant con man has them foaming at the mouth.  Trump is easy to blame, but to quote someone wiser than myself, he is a symptom, not a cause.

       What I can never understand is how you can be in a conspiracy sub, but also be a fully functioning member of current party politics ideology.  It's almost as if there are a ton of people here with less than genuine intentions.

       Getting some downvotes doesn't prove your point you fucking snowflake. Quit being a baby. Trump is a ridiculous president and deserves ridicule. Everything he says just proves how fucking dumb and full of shit he is. The people hating him aren't irrational. He is the irrational one that constantly shitposts on Twitter like a fucking teenager when he is the president of the damn U.S. If Obama did 1% of the ridiculous shit he did, he would have been impeached immediately. Get your head out of your ass.

       Replace Trump with Hillary and you've just described the hive mind of the right wing. How many people's entire identities are based around hating Hillary, the liberals, democrats? We now have the_donald and the_congress who are doing everything they can to spread their propaganda, much of it being spread here.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many on Reddit are doing everything they can to defend Roy Moore? Imagine if the same exactly circumstances surrounded Biden? Do you think there'd be the same doubt? You don't even have to do that thought experiment, because there are some clips of Biden looking like a creep, which they've taken as gospel to mean he's a pedophile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone accuses Moore? They're obviously lying or being paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one accuses Biden, proof that there's a coverup.
      </p>

       The country is fucked. There's no coming back. America has become so divided, people are literally living in their own conformation-bias bubbles.

       Look at his cabinet picks and tell me he is not corrupt. Look at his tax plan and tell me he has the peoples best interest in mind. People are angry at Trump because he got elected saying he would change things for the better, and he isn't. I'm tired of the Trump shills brigading posts and talking about how he is our savior, their only reason being the MSM hates him. His actions don't line up with his words, he is a false prophet.

       And yet here you sit at only 4 downvotes. You are the one that is irrational here, nobody has based their identity around hating Trump. Yeah there are some who are obsessed, but on the other hand you come off as being obsessed by them. Its a weird cycle, just take a deep breath man.

       Visit /new to engage with the community at the most basic level. It gives you the opportunity to start a conversation by being among the first to post in a thread. What you say then and there will influence the trajectory of the post going forward. The tone and direction are already set by the time a post reaches /hot. This is why it's important. It also how you fight shills and bots, by denying them the opportunity to set their agenda.

       The conspiracy twitter account used to be active and had the effect of following the the "new" page.  When it went dead it made it harder for me to follow/view new posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seemed like censorship.

       if you care about this sub, get that twitter functionality restored.  Or provide another feed like way to browse new reddit posts.
