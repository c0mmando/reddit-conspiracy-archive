       Tbh, would u speak out and risk becoming the next Campos? Be called a liar and an actor? Have the Laura Loomers of the world following you and digging up every bit of dirt they can on u or ur loved ones? Plus they probably have lawyers to sue.

       Would you? Even if it could put a target on ur back and those that love you? If they speak out saying it was a set up they become a liability. I think a lawyer and a civil suit is better. Ur not rocking the boat and endangering those you love. Just my thoughts tho.

       I don't think speaking out necessarily implies speaking against the accepted narrative. They could be speaking out to demand answers as to why Paddock was able to port 23+ guns into the hotel, for example. Or they could speak out to demand answers as to why it took so long for LVPD to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       That stuff I would not expect to result in a target on anyone's family because it supports the official narrative. It's just asking for details and maybe setting the stage for compensation via lawsuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not sure the victim's family would even think in terms of their speaking out resulting in some sort of further harm. Remember, this is a national tragedy, even with the questions it raises. Nobody (besides the scant minority in r/conspiracy and similar sites) questions their victimhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chances are the families accept the official narrative, but want some kind of justice, and one way to get that is to organize. I think the OPs point is that out of 20,000+ victim families (remember, even those who weren't injured are still victims) there should be more organizing and cage rattling going on.

       My honest thought is that they have lawyers. Even if they didn't seek out one..you can bet that lawyers came to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm aware everyone there was a victims injured or not. Between lawyers and the overall not wanting to be bashed, followed, maybe harmed or called a liar they stay silent in the public eye. Just because we don't hear them doesn't mean they aren't speaking. Contacting the police and FBI directly may be what they are doing. Victims have received death threats from those that believe it was a hoax.

       That's a major cognitive dissonance for me, too. It's great to hear you say it, because I personally just cannot fathom how someone could withstand just letting it go. I'd go unstoppably ape-crazy if someone did that to my cat, let alone a wife or child!

       But you havent sold your soul.   My friend works in insurance - recently had a call from a client - whos father was in a car accident that was not his fault and was now on life support - asking how much money he would get if he pulled the plug vs keeping him on.

       What possible other explanation is there? Are you expecting us to believe that the families of the victims don't all question the official story and believe that, in fact, a Saudi prince orchestrated the shooting as a way to divert attention away from a gun running operation out the hotel? And that Trump then orchestrated the arrest of that Saudi prince? In what world is this not the most rational explanation for what happened?

       That has become my hypothesis over the past few weeks,  I think MGM and their money is controlling every aspect of this.  The first fucked up thing I remember was the press conference and all the city officials seemingly more worried about Vegas's reputation and tourism revenue than they were worried about getting justice for the victims.

       These same NSA sources are now saying the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas on October 1 was an attempt by mercenaries working for the G4S security company (
       <a href="http://www.g4s.com/">
        http://www.g4s.com/
       </a>
       ) hired by George Bush Sr. to create a distraction in order to kill U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Sultan (MBS).  Trump and MBS were meeting in secret at the suites in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, owned by MBS, to discuss the mass arrest of the perpetrators of the 9/11 terror attacks, these sources say.

       Yeah. Also, Paddock's estate and Live Nation. Doesn't mean they will win but they can sue. I also suspect that many of them saw the circus that was unleashed on Campos and they don't want that to happen to them. People went crazy trying to hunt Campos down. Imagine if the victims were in the spotlight. They would never have a moments peace. They would get followed, accused of lying and possibly even harmed because some feel like they are lying.

       Mafia: Casino is liable for not stopping it, so are doing everything in their power to shut down the flow of info

      <p>
       Govt Involvement: whether it's a fast and furious type FBI arms deal gone wrong, or an actual ISIS attack (as the group claimed) perpetrated by individuals the CIA were aware of, or even tracking, or both, or something entirely different but similar, their would be clear motive for the agencies to want to cover it up or risk Trump being able to burn them to the ground
      </p>
      <p>
       Intentionally created chaos to allow for escape: this comes up with the assassination plot ideas related to the Saudis. While far fetched, The Four Seasons was only a few floors up and owned in part by a Saudi who was arrested during the November purge, so there's definitely some smoke there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying any of these things happened. I'm saying given what we actually know about the case, any or all of these are plausible. Pending more info, I don't believe this was a lone gunman. The authorities are clearly hiding something.

       It's rather tough as a nobody level family to put much pressure on the government without some sort of large scale press support to get your story out there. Vegas is already old news. It's a very sad commentary on how we live our lives now but that's just how it is right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not the newest hottest news story, you're cold product. National news is going to be scampering to get interview with say teachers in that small nor cal town that came under fire today, that's the hot story. Vegas? Until a police report comes out, that's not getting coverage anymore. How the hurricane clean up going? I don't know, don't see any news about it either. How is Puerto Rico's power going? I saw a thread on reddit that it's been 50+ days with no power. I did not know it's 50+ days until I saw the thread being no one talks about it anymore. We have the huge fires out here in California, not sure how that clean up is going. That was few weeks ago, so no one cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should care, everyone should care but they just don't for some reason.

       Blaming it on people not caring is in and of itself a conspiracy. Clearly there are plenty of people still interested in this story. But no reporters doing any kind of legwork to report on it. So the better question is why is that? The state of media and death of journalism is where this blame lies.

       I couldn't agree with this more.  Total lack of investigative journalism on Vegas.  Utter dereliction of journalistic duty.

       I really believe that it has to do with most MSM journalists not giving a shit because it was country music fans who were butchered.

       I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s because journalists hate Country music fans. But, Journalism as a career has collapsed. There are no truly independent major news sources anymore. It’s all corporately owned and controlled. So no one is paying Journalists to be actual journalists anymore. I should know, I have a journalism degree I never used.

       You said that right.  This last election cycle empowered the media in an unfathomable way.  They report on what the fringe want to hear.  It's no longer news.  It's simply opinions and views.

       Sadly you are right.  If it doesn't bring in views or generate clicks z it's old news.  With no new information,  Vegas is old news.  Blows my mind too because you would think the anti-gun crowd would still be calling for gun control,  but even they don't seem to remember.

       When the last shooting happened, CNN covered it and stressed gun control for like a week.

       But otherwise yeah, no one is focusing on it because it pretty much seems impossible to get gun control. House, senate, and executive power are all controlled by Republicans. The next chance at gun control won't be until at least the 2018 election (if that changes anything)

       The few witnesses that came out on youtube and talked about it were apparently getting many warnings from people to "be careful" and "watch your backs" from random people. I think that spooked people, and maybe those people weren't so... random.

       I have high hopes that DJT will give answers to the connections with the Saudi take down and the LVM very soon.  Possibly after there could be suit filed against the Saudi families involved.  Still would not compensate for  their actions but this might would give closure,  in a way,  to face and prosecute the murderers.  Just a. Hope and thought.  Sorry for your loss I hate to speculate on such a sensitive subject.

       I live in Vegas.  There are memorials and such like decals and shirts that's say VegasStrong everywhere.  That being said, we're just as lost about the event as everyone else.  Most people have moved on and don't wanna talk about it but we all still wonder.  Just seems hopeless getting anymore answers right now and I think the city has accepted it for what it is.  Sucks

       Its crazy that when an unarmed minority is killed by a police officer, everybody on my fb is demanding answers, evidence, sharing videos and articles from the families, etc. 
This horrible event occurs and all of those same people are calling anybody who has questions this a crazy conspiracist and to let it go. 
I dont understand people.

       So the multiple families that hired lawyers and filed public lawsuits in the courts of law is not sufficient?  They should have bypassed the courts and just posted on twitter and reddit -- makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a little common sense.  Those people who filed the lawsuit have attorneys.  Those attorneys told them "don't post on social media."  That is what any attorney would tell any client about any case.  I hope you understand that the families have multi-million dollar claims.  When their attorney says "don't post on social media," they follow that advice.

       This isn’t at all what I’m talking about. No one in that article came close to calling out a lack of transparency by the police or frustration at a lack of clear timeline thus far out. I literally googled looking for that sort of thing earlier in the evening before I saw this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not like you would jeopardize your lawsuit by publicly asking for more answers from the police. Families demanding answers has been a key mechanism in forcing facts out to the public. This was the largest mass shooting in our country in living memory. Not just the victims &amp; their families, but the public deserves answers.

       I think a lawsuit has to be precise. Lack of transparency is too vague. For a judge to take you seriously, you can't start talking conspiracy theories. Like with Halbig in the Sandy Hook case. He always made sure to not associate with conspiracy theories.

       the one thing that makes you wonder is how the t_d crowd is silent about it. Because they know they can't approach the theory that if it is a false flag and if the guvmint was behind it in some way, it means that trump, their god emperor, is behind it. they can't come out and start claiming what they did during the Obama years because their comrade is in office so they just push it aside while that thorn in the back of their mind, that their god emperor is a traitor, just can't be removed so they just glom onto more hillary and obama conspiracies. it's sad really but most are not us citizens anyway so they don't give a shit either way.

       If you're talking about a shooting belonging in a political forum, Is r/politics talking about it? Did they ever talk about it? I remember T_D was the only reliable sub talking about it that night after r/news scrapped the main thread because it was linked to a scanner. I also see many recent threads with many comments when you do a search on T_D, they are certainly not silent like other subs that actually should be covering the story.

       they are running around in circles to not call it a false flag or imply any possible admin involvement yet they instantly called obama sneezing a false flag if they could so you know there is some fuckery going on. The story hasn't even been mentioned anywhere recently because they can't disturb their narrative that their god emperor is perfect and untouched by corruption or evil when they know its not the case.

       Just because there is a new president, doesn't mean that he is instantly in charge of the same (likely shadowy) organization involved in false flags.
      </p>
      <p>
       And especially if the objective of the false flags are to promote gun control, it would make no sense for the right to even continue committing false flags.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in no way saying that this is 100% a false flag and that only Obama and the left could be responsible for. But what I am saying, is that just because Trump is president, doesn't mean that all false flags since his inauguration are under his orders (just like it doesn't mean that previous false flags were directly under Obama's orders).

       Way to see what you want to see, and make up an assumption about my motives for posting. The jury is still out on my feelings for the current president. Regardless, every single point I made above still stands. If you'd like to actually respond to one of those rather than just resort to attempted character assassinations, I'd be more than happy to have a real discussion with you.

       A president doesn’t need to know about a false flag. A lot of people think the president is just a face and he has people behind the scenes calling all the shots anyways. I recall a lot of theories regarding bush not knowing about 9-11 until he was told in the classroom. Obviously he was told about a plane hitting the buildings then. But that’s not what I mean. Anyways, the government is a rouge entity right now, the alphabet boys are playing by their own rules. Maybe the Don did have something to do with it, maybe it didn’t. What should concern you is families and citizens not speaking out in Las Vegas. Not what some subreddit is doing.

       While it's not totally disingenuous to suggest a president doesn't 'need' to know about a false flag, you at least made a reasoned and non-insane response in trying to defend that statement. But the td/alex jones/alt right brigade constantly labeled every mass shooting incident or international terror event a false flag during the Obama years and lay the blame squarely on Obama and Hillary. they still do as if Hillary is president instead of a has-been political loser. This happened before, during and now after Obama so no, a president doesn't 'need' to know but it seems to be more convenient when it's a D vs an R president that suddenly they aren't in the loop and it's just a globalist conspiracy to destroy our american way of life and turn the frogs gay.

       I agree with that for sure. People seemed to think Obama was in on the “deep state” and Trump is this outsider. I fell for that thought for a split second. Who’s to say trump isn’t just some Trojan horse type shit? Or a wolf in sheep herders clothing? Don’t wanna make this all about trump, but I want to believe he’s some savior, but if he was going to take down any shadow government he would’ve never been allowed to run for president. Sometimes I kick around a wishful theory similar to Putin’s rise to power. Playing the political game while putting loyal supporters in positions of power. Once you get in good with the corrupt you turn on them. But again, that’s probably the least likely scenario we’re looking at.

       Untrue! People are starved for information about Vegas. Several posts on T_D daily searching for answers. But everything seems to be a dead end. No new info on the net to link. No morsels mentioned on the news. No way to research on your own. People keep asking the same questions over and over again ... and speculating. We are as frustrated as everyone else. I absolutely want the truth .. but keep hitting a brick wall. Obviously I'm biased but the thought that PDJT might be behind the attack has never entered my mind.

       Yeah... I mean, even the MSM is like... WTF?! These are actual reports those people trust. Yet, nothing.

      <p>
       Honestly, do these families and victims just think okay we have a name and are being told he's just crazy, thats good enough?

       The only thing I can think of...

       These people do not want to think about it. They are in denial. They don't care why because nothing will change the fact they lost their family member/friend. I can maybe imagine a fraction of people thinking that way... But certainly not everyone.

       That's what makes me laugh when people churn out the 'think of the families of people who died' when you try debating it with an official story guy.

       There's a whole group going called families for 9/11 truth, just like the architects and pilots group.

       There’s a declassified document on.. I think Cuba? No.. I don’t remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway it details the government suggesting using a false flags to destabilize the area and start a war there, in this document there is a specific statement to make use of crisis type actors, even to the point of having fake funerals.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not some crack theory, this was proposed in the 70’s or 80’s by the US government. So going to the families for evidence is rather shaky as solid proof of anything.

       Conflating people who remain unconvinced one person acted entirely alone in this incident with people who post how no one died and it's all an act, is part of the problem here. People are afraid to be labeled "conspiracy theorists" and that fear has become an effective censorship tool. The public deserves answers, and acting like anyone who still questions what happened here is nuts is a big part of the problem.

       Isn't it odd that this entire story is gone?  They only thing left, is the commercials telling people Vegas is safe.

       It's a massive cover-up.  I am not buying that this is a guy that woke up and went crazy.  I wouldn't be surprised if its akin to the Fast and Furious scandal years earlier.

       He was simply asking questions to the owners of Battlefield Vegas and he got escorted out quite abruptly, meanwhile there's a giant "Vegas Strong" bullshit sign in front of their business gates. It's so dumb.

       Yet you'll just be called  a shill and be dismissed here. Some people will never be satisfied because they thrive off of the need for something to be wrong and wouldn't accept facts if it hit them in the face. Not saying we shouldn't question everything but we can't get tunnel vision by what we think is going on either.

       They can't talk about the case, but they could as a group publicly request more information from the authorities. Having their lawyer on Tucker Carlson was one way to do that. Going as a group to the police station with a film crew and asking when the next press conference will be would be another.

        These same NSA sources are now saying the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas on October 1 was an attempt by mercenaries working for the G4S security company (

Trump and MBS were meeting in secret at the suites in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, owned by MBS, to discuss the mass arrest of the perpetrators of the 9/11 terror attacks, these sources say.

       Nowhere, because they don't exist. Never have. It was just another operation to undermine democracy in the US. Remember MH370 and the relentless families that were demanding answers for months? That's how the families of the Vegas shooting, and countless other mass shootings in the US for that matter, should be behaving. Yet there are next to none, many just behave like bad actors and the whole thing is swept under the rug without any proper answers in a matter of days with the killer almost always being neutralized conveniently right away since dead men tell no tales.

       Sure, some real people usually die in these incidents by being at the wrong time at wrong place as well and that's indeed unfortunate. No disrespect to them. But in the greater scheme of things that is sadly only collateral damage as harsh as it may sound and not the point. Not to mention one thing is what is being told and what actually happened. Majority of these events and their select elements are staged one way or another to push similar agendas.

       MH370 is a little different because the media, especially Don Lemon at CNN was covering the story till the cows came home, I think 3 months? Every. single. night. This story, they were almost told to stfu about it or else, and they supposedly found the killer so it's not a huge mystery with search teams working every day, it's basically just a crazy guy who bought a bunch of guns and killed people so the media can wrap up the story with a nice bow. Some families are just content to believe the narrative because it hurts less than knowing the government killed their loved ones.

       MH370 is a little different because real people died and real families were aggrieved.  Vegas was a crisis simulation so no one was aggrieved and more coverage will just leave more clues pointing to the staging of the hoax.

       It's called "learned helplessness" i.e. "Another Day in America".
      </p>
      <p>
       We are now at mass shootings involving 3 or more people almost every single damn day here, and nothing's changed.  The gun lobby has its hand so far up the asses of our elected officials that nothing will be done about our mass firearm intoxication.  We have no money and apparently no desire to address the mental health of ANYONE living here, let alone the murderous crazies with the guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're already beginning to accept that it's just another day here, nothing's changed and nothing apparently WILL change as a result of children's deaths, mothers' deaths, fathers' deaths, SENATOR's attempted deaths, etc.

       If you start with the hypothesis that no one was shot or killed, then all that we have seen and heard since the event, including the fact that Crisis Cast was recruiting for a large scale drill in Vegas a couple weeks prior, falls into place and stacks up overwhelmingly in favor of that hypothesis. This is abductive reasoning.

       You say demanding answers, but what are the questions?  Reddit inquiries on a conspiracy sub arent necessarily the same as what the families and victims might wanna know.  Maybe they dont care about the same things.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we dont know what the families and victims are being told.

       I don't think speaking out necessarily implies speaking against the accepted narrative. They could be speaking out to demand answers as to why Paddock was able to port 23+ guns into the hotel, for example. Or they could speak out to demand answers as to why it took so long for LVPD to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       That stuff I would not expect to result in a target on anyone's family because it supports the official narrative. It's just asking for details and maybe setting the stage for compensation via lawsuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not sure the victim's family would even think in terms of their speaking out resulting in some sort of further harm. Remember, this is a national tragedy, even with the questions it raises. Nobody (besides the scant minority in r/conspiracy and similar sites) questions their victimhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chances are the families accept the official narrative, but want some kind of justice, and one way to get that is to organize. I think the OPs point is that out of 20,000+ victim families (remember, even those who weren't injured are still victims) there should be more organizing and cage rattling going on.

       Way to see what you want to see, and make up an assumption about my motives for posting. The jury is still out on my feelings for the current president. Regardless, every single point I made above still stands. If you'd like to actually respond to one of those rather than just resort to attempted character assassinations, I'd be more than happy to have a real discussion with you.
