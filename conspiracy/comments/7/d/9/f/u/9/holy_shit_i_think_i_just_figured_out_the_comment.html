    <div class="md"><p>I do think these videos are incredibly weird and watched by millions of kids and pervy adults but I do not really buy this whole coded language theory yet. 
So since these videos are watched by alot of kids, the target market seems to be around the toddler age, so I believe so it&#39;s probably on their parents mobile phone. I see this a lot in the supermarket I work in. So my theory is that alot of these comments could actually just be made by kids scrolling down to the comment section. You have to tap only once in any comment to open up the keyboard so it is quite easy for a child to post  a comment.
My evidence for this is that alot of these so called coded keywords are letters right beside each other on the keyboard.
Take a look at the comments in this link: <a href="https://youtu.be/v1RBbOKC_CQ">https://youtu.be/v1RBbOKC_CQ</a> Most of these comments look like button mashing from toddlers.
If further evidence comes out, I stand corrected but I really do believe that this is the case, especially with the more popular ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I definitely think this could be just a bunch of homeade videos linked to parents accounts which children are using. I&#39;m just putting a theory out there based on simply the large number of videos I saw of children being filmed in off putting ways+how the videos and channel owners just seem to fetishize everything somehow.

    <div class="md"><p>I think most of the elsa phenomena is explicable by unscrupulous creators exploiting a strange facet of childhood psychology. In particular, the psychology of young children for which have been subjected to youtube and ipads as childrearing aids. That psychology is going to be twisted both by the forces of neglect, the sick messaging of the mass media of our culture, and the instant reward feedback dependance and short attention span engineered in us when we use these devices and the web. </p>

<p>Anyway you got all these fucked up forces colliding and then people exploiting the whole mess for profit because that&#39;s the force driving the whole disaster in the first place. And the result looks really horrific and fucked up because because we&#39;re in some late stage capitalism shit now and this is holding a mirror up to the whole pile.</p>

<p>But I do not think what we are seeing is the tip of any wider 
conspiracy iceberg. The thing looming under the surface isn&#39;t a vast plot, it is the terminal sickness of our own society.      </p>

<p>You&#39;re problem on both ends is that you&#39;re assuming you have the answer, and you&#39;re working from there. I&#39;ve given you an incredibly simple hypothesis, rather than dismiss it, test it. How hard would it be to create a cut/paste translation of a simple question, that you simply message to each video creator you&#39;ve linked?</p>

<p>This seems like an obvious honey pot, and besides it being difficult for YouTube to censor when there&#39;s so much content uploaded per minute.. I imagine this far along (this isn&#39;t a new problem), multiple agencies across the planet are likely using this shit in an ongoing investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have more faith in the FBI and their good intentions than I do. </p>

<p>Also, almost all of the problems with YouTube that I see voiced here everyday, has to do with their censorship. You can automate something that detects if music that is copywritten is used, and they can automate what is removed based on complaints..</p>

<p>But what does that lead to? How many posts have <em>you</em> seen about people&#39;s channels being demonetized or removed? Look up how many hours of YouTube videos are uploaded per minute.. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s accurate, but I&#39;m finding between 60-300 hours of video are uploaded <em>per minute</em>.</p>

<p>So what do you expect YouTube to do? Hire millions of people to watch reports of YouTube violations, that&#39;s videos of hours per minute? They obviously have an issue that isn&#39;t easy to solve..</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the answer is, I don&#39;t know if there is one.. I just think it isn&#39;t as simple as people here try to make it sound.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It <em>is</em> strange, don&#39;t get me wrong. But we also don&#39;t know if there&#39;s hundreds of videos or hundreds of thousands. We don&#39;t know how many are posted per day. Likely, if a channel gets removed, they just make a new one.. they don&#39;t depend on subscribers, just that the title gets fed into a playlist.</p>

<p>I think this is a complex problem, but I&#39;ve seen posts about this well over a year ago the worst shit that people have said, videos of scat and other extreme shit, I&#39;ve never actually seen those videos, so I&#39;m not sure if YouTube removed them, or if they never existed and it was just a way to try to make the complaint more extreme.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t watch these videos while logged in, I imagine this far in, there <em>must be</em> agencies across the globe looking into this. I remember posts where people said they reported this shit to the FBI. They absolutely know about this shit. If there&#39;s a legit issue here, I expect to read about a huge bust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not at all what he said. The only thing he downplayed was the pedo-ring theories about the gibberish comments because of a lack of evidence. Which is why I suggested OP send him what he finds. Beyond that, Tim Pool described the videos as disgusting and potentially dangerous/harmful for young children. He framed it as child abuse/exploitation. He then said he was investigating further into the live action stuff that involves real children getting needles and shit. Unless he dropped a video overnight that I haven&#39;t seen yet telling people there&#39;s &quot;nothing to see here&quot;, you are either an idiot or a liar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you know, if you know the ascii characters for each language you can easily write a computer program that would take in strings and translate for you without the need for a thai keyboard emulator.</p>

<p>simple-ish languages like C# (or even C++ but its not as simple) can look at different ASCII mappings based on location -- in C# its built in and really easy to access when doing string operations.</p>

<p>I know your probably not a programmer. but just a suggestion -- because if your really onto some type of code/cipher, writing a translation program would be the best thing to do.</p>

<p>first, youd take the input characters, then youd swap them to be characters out of the thai character set or whatever, then you&#39;d parse it with whatever cipher you think is being used algorithmically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wasn&#39;t talking about google translate. I was specifically speaking about custom programming your own cipher program the same way youd deal with any simple encryption/decryption program.</p>

<p>unlike google translate, it wouldn&#39;t be using some complex system, what I described was very basic. Essentially youd be converting the characters and then hardcoding a dictionary specifying what characters mean.</p>

<p>what this &#39;dictionary&#39; would entail would be similar to a hash table -- except instead of containing the &#39;key&#39; and its representative data value, it would store the hand-typed set of thai characters, and then the English translation in its second element.</p>

<p>this would be much different, much simpler and more effective than google&#39;s. although it literally wouldn&#39;t be a translator for anything that wasn&#39;t ciphered and pre-programmed into the dictionary by hand</p>

<p>although you could also add a client-end option to add a new dictionary value and its meaning.</p>

<p>itd be closer to brute-force than actual translation. Google translate attempts to lookup each word individually and translate it.</p>

<p>Although many of these methods and teachings were not unique to Wat Phra Dhammakaya, the criticism came at a moment when the temple had become very noticeable due to its size, its high-profile supporters, and due to the project of building the Dhammakaya Cetiya at the time, which required a lot of funds. All of this at the backdrop of the financial crisis Thailand was facing at the time.</p>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely there is one big ring running through YouTube it&#39;s just possible that this is a way pedos are using to communicate and find each other. Obviously the real crime and structure of any rings would be outside of YouTube.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, it may well move onto the Darkweb. If you&#39;re a random pedo with no connections it&#39;s not as simple as loading up the dark web and typing in &quot;cp&quot; or &quot;children for sale&quot;, you still have to find a way to initially network with other likeminded people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s really easy, you could be on Tor in the next 15 minutes if you wanted to be. The point is you still have to know where to look, you still have to find Tor domains to connect to or find a community on there, you don&#39;t just open Tor and there is a child porn search engine as your homepage lol.</p>

<p>Buying drugs on Tor is super easy because there are clearnet places (such as <a href="/r/DNMSuperlist">/r/DNMSuperlist</a>) which will give you links to the places where you can buy the drugs. I imagine there is no such resource for child porn (that&#39;s easy to find).</p>

<p>I mean.. They could be dumb as a bunch of rocks, pedos aren&#39;t necessarily intelligent or powerful. You don&#39;t need to be powerful or intelligent to want to fuck kids you just have to be a sicko browsing the internet with an unhealthy focus and desire. IMO if it&#39;s true then they&#39;re not that dumb I think it&#39;s pretty clever personally or at least I can&#39;t think of many better ways to do it. </p>

<p>Another thing to note is that finding childporn on the darkweb is also a minefield. The FBI is known to have 25+ child porn websites on the darkweb that they operate themselves in order to try and catch pedofiles. It wouldn&#39;t be that stupid to revert to hiding in plain site on YouTube which isn&#39;t being nearly closely as monitored for that kind of crime.</p>

While I agree with everything you have said I was really just highlighting the way groups of people decide how true or not shit is.

    <div class="md"><p>The two phrases you returned made my stomach sink. That&#39;s more that enough proof for me that these comments are code of some type.</p>

<p>These videos are made to be seen by children, absolutely. I think it&#39;s a conditioning thing, whatever group is behind this wants children to be more susceptible to sexual themes, violence, etc.</p>

<p>I see a lot of &quot;this = this&quot; type stuff, especially in the colour related videos. I think their idea is that kids will see Elsa/hero shit in a store or something, and then start remembering the conditioning from the videos, sort of like a trigger.</p>

<p>I feel like these guys have a deeper agenda. Remember how incels thought? How they thought all women should be bred in a facility and handed out to men as wives at the &quot;prime age&quot; of 14? What if there were a group of powerful pedophiles (well, we know there&#39;s a ton of super rich pedos) who has a similar ideology? Like that kids should be hyper sexualized so that they were easier to target?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s a crazy theory, but these videos scream conditioning, and they were obviously made for kids to find, very young ones.</p>

<p>Seeing the phrase &quot;princess programming&quot; really confirmed all of this for me.</p>

<p>The same thing happened back in March when YouTube started demonitizing videos that their advertisers found inappropriate or racist. It was a pretty big deal and there&#39;s multiple large channels that did videos about it, like H3H3 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I will tell you I live in Thailand 1/2 the year ( wife is Thai). We have a few young neices like 2 or 3 years old and these stupid videos are all they watch. Literally all day long every day as long as they have their parents cell this is what they are watching.</p>

<p>Seriously my 2 year old Thai neice learned the English words for colors and other English words watching these retarded videos.</p>

<p>She runs around screaming &quot;HELP ME! HELP ME!&quot; parodying what she sees in these videos.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s what someone else said, just little kids that can&#39;t read or write typing babble into the comment sections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why use YouTube? Why not a less popular video hosting site, or even at all? Why bother making a creepy video that would undoubtedly raise eyebrows when it is inevitably discovered. Human trafficking absolutely happens but from a logical standpoint it would make no sense to insert more risk of being discovered, and behind something as flimsy as a translator. Either these people are just as thick as a short plank, or they are confident they will never be caught and rubbing it in our faces, which I doubt would be worth the effort. I&#39;m geuninely asking for insights, I have no explanation of what these videos could be, but a community is forming around the opinion that they are intentionally malicious rather than creepy videos made by trolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate to say it, but from my light digging it does look like kids replying.  For a child to type then press send, has to be a 1 out of 30 or 40 chance, right?  Weird thing i noticed, the ones who reply usually have one or two videos of a kid, with just the title as the date.  Dont know if an adult is recording or another kid is recording but its odd and common.  I&#39;d say to you all, dont go investigating yourself into z jail cell, report these findings to authorities and let them dig deeper.  Its disturbing how youtube allows this through the youtube kid app.</p>

Low and behold, almost every date i typed into youtube like that turned up weird candid young girl videos.  Then in the comments they would just say a time, like :20.  Then when you jump to that time there would be a panty shot or something.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi mate, I hope you&#39;re still reading the comments you receive.</p>

<p>Just a quick question: couldn&#39;t this be a sort of &quot;gang&quot; that trades videos stolen from people&#39;s cloud accounts or, perhaps even worst, videos captured remotely without people&#39;s consent?</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s what it looks like.</p>

<p>Dozens upon dozens of teen women doing what seem like videochats, sometimes clearly attempting to be sexy. Dozens upon dozens of seemingly creepy videos of children, running around and stuff. Home videos, most likely, of children with their relatives in just everyday situations. </p>

<p>Do you think it could be people doing this? Trading homemade (stolen) nude videos, porn tapes, and maybe even CP that they stole but didn&#39;t produce? Or do you think this is straight-up people who captured children and are selling them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could just be users advertising &quot;safe&quot; videos for cp(media) swaps in private convos or it could be human trafficking or it could be both, no idea. It definitely could involve some form of central organization, and I think that may be where the elsagate channels come in. I&#39;ve seen the owners of the channels recognize and interact with certain users so that would support them being the central organizing point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that one Video with the toddler jumping on the bed is really questionable.</p>

<p>The Videos with the Spiderman Boy, well this looks like abuse, but not in a sexual way, more likely to gather some popularity on Youtube and gather money with using the boy for it.
Also people watching those videos or let their kids watch such hillarious stupid shit, well i would really question their cleverness.</p>

<p>The 3rd Youtube link, those People look more like they&#39;re from India/Punjab Region, not really Thai. Also the Playlist on that channel hints to Songs form India. They have a distroting and creepy Feeling, well, but i don&#39;t think they are related to any pedo stuff. In one Video you can see an elder woman sitting on the couch in the background, would be very amateurish.
Also the Jaguar advertise, the cat Video and the Ghee preparation seem to have no relation to such objectives.
Here you also have the photo of a pregnant women on the channel, perhaps the person who&#39;s behind the channel.</p>

<p>If in serious doubt, report to police or other authorities, they have more resources. They could get get hold of IP adresses and traffic data and get support from the police in those countries.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>his entire account is gone, i had the page left open before i went to sleep earlier and i just came back to this.</p>

<p>something tells me it was his own decision, however, for a good reason. other redditors were flocking to the videos linked commenting &quot;we&#39;re coming for you&quot;, causing the youtuber to delete all the giberish comments.</p>

<p>seems likely that he just wanted to hold off on this before some bozo&#39;s could soil the entire op</p>

<p>Maybe I am nieve or paranoid to think that it would be just as possible that this is 20 or so people spamming a load of bullshit on these videos just to propagate the next big &quot;CT&quot; they have uncovered.</p>

<p>No that&#39;s entirely possible, you&#39;d just be stupid to assume that it&#39;s the case imo. It could be trolls, it could be bots, it could be retarded kids or it could be pedos, I&#39;m willing to entertain any of those possibilities. Anyone saying for sure it is or isn&#39;t that must have some information that no one else has..</p>
