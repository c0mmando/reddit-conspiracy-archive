<p>In the crime scene model, I had always assumed that the broken window was behind the beige, dark gray and bunt orange geometric curtains, but the guy who made the video is saying it&#39;s the one directly behind the chair.  I think he&#39;s right.  I</p>

<p>I thing that geometric patterned curtain is covering up a wall and on the other side of the wall is one of those thick white vertical stripes on the facade of the exterior of the building.  If that&#39;s truly the case, then why *didn&#39;t&quot; Paddock move the chair?</p>

<p>It was also nice to see that he finally pickedup on the faqct that 32-134 was a separate <em>hotel room</em> and not just a second bedroom within the suite.  He also asks what many of us have been asking.  If the connecting room door was secured, how did he run back and forth between the two rooms without going through the hallway?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, at least the guy put in some work vs just looking over some other videos and then screen grabbing some blurry low definition blob in the distance and claiming it showed something. My only two issues is the video is a little nit picky about the chair in front of the window. When odds are a person would leave something in front of the window, so you don&#39;t get too close and fall out as you maybe aim/move a little with your guns. It&#39;s not like the extra 2-3 feet are going to make a difference on your shots. </p>

<p>also as I mentioned before in another thread, the whole &quot;door has been secured&quot; could mean anything as far as the two doors between the rooms. Tactical has no idea if there is a 2nd shooter or what is in the smaller room. So even if the door was locked on their side, no one is going to stand in the door way, turn the lock, then swing the door back into the larger room. As that would be blocking all lines of fire from their own tactical team while being framed in the door way as a sitting duck if there was a 2nd shooter in the other smaller room. So you just blow the door open. Giving your team a better element of surprise and way cleaner lines of fire. </p>

<p>I did like the CGI shot of the crowd numbers being even early on I wondered if that was really 22k. My local NBA arena in Sacramento holds I think 10k and the concert did not seem like x2 what I&#39;ve seen first hand as 10k. Yet to be fair there is a difference between sitting in an arena and standing shoulder to shoulder on a lawn. </p>

<p>But they couldn&#39;t have done that even if they had wanted to.  They opened the door on Paddock&#39;s side.  When they did they were faced with another door that would have opened into Room 32-134.  That door had no door knob for the police to turn and then push the door  open into 32-134.  It&#39;s just a blank door with a metal plate where the door knob would usually be.</p>

<p>The only door knob was on 32-134&#39;s side.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s suppose the occupant of 32-134 did <strong>not</strong> lock the door using the deadbolt.  Someone on the 32-135 side <em>still</em> couldn&#39;t get into 32-134 if the door was closed.</p>

<p>Walk outside your home and shut the front door behind you, but don&#39;t lock the door with a key.  Next, try to get back into your home through the front door <strong>without using the door knob.</strong> You can push against the door but that&#39;s not going to get you back inside.  You need to be able to turn a door handle.  And the door that opened into 32-134 didn&#39;t have a door knob on the SWAT team&#39;s side.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see how Paddock could go between rooms without using the hallway. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t know that, at all. </p>

<p>The statement from the police chief is they breached the first door (the main door to suite 135, from the hallway) and found the suspect dead, then encountered another &quot;door that been secured&quot;. That could be mean anything from the door on the smaller room (134) locked from the 134 side to the door on the 135 (large suite) being locked ON the 135 side. As in Paddock shot from the 2nd window in the smaller 134 room, walked into 135 and closed and locked 134 off from 135, from the 135 side. Making it so no one could come in the suite from 134 with out more effort. &quot;...door that been secured&quot; could also mean a door had some sort of home made bolt or bar on them. We just don&#39;t know, we don&#39;t have any real info. All we know is most hotels have two doors between rooms, with a lock on each side. </p>

<p>What is happening is people are just presuming when they hear of a 2nd locked door that it must mean the 134 side locking out the 135 (suite) side. Yet my point is due to the nature of the double door system in hotels and how the tactical team has no idea if there is 2nd shooter or what is in the other room odds are they breech the door between rooms no mater what. Even if the 135 side was locked, with a dead bolt ON their side of the door, they are not going to fiddle with the lock, then try to open the door blocking lines of fire. They just breach pop it open. </p>

<p>We just have to wait until we get more info. For all we know both the 134 side and the 135 side where locked down. </p>

<p>You can kind of figure it out by looking at the photos.</p>

<p>Interior image of a typical Vista Suite showing where the connecting door to the adjacent hotel room was.  (32-135 was a Vista Suite.)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/XF145ur">Image</a></strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a screen shot of how the other room (32-134) looks as you first walk in.  I think the room type is Resort Queen.  Two queen sized beds.  The window that the pink chair is in front of is the window that was broken.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/TKj1Joe">Image</a></strong></p>

<p>The connecting door to Paddock&#39;s suite is on the left with the handle and the deadbolt.  Notice how the connecting door is flush against the wall.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a cropped screen shot from the next day from a helicopter looking into that room.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/QyEwzYo">image</a></strong></p>

<p>You can see the two queen beds and it looks like the pink chair has been placed between them either by the shooter or the police.</p>

<p>As the helicopter moves, you can start to see the connecting room door.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/8xetS3t">Image</a></strong></p>

<p>This is panned over just a little bit more:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/nUhwnm9">Image</a></strong></p>

<p>The door looks to be closed, but it is also recessed in from the wall about six inches.  I think the door we are seeing is the door that was opened on the suite side.  I think the door that should be flush with the wall was the door that opened on 32-134&#39;s side that the police used an explosive to breach.  </p>

<p>As in Paddock shot from the 2nd window in the smaller 134 room, walked into 135 and closed and locked 134 off from 135, from the 135 side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you walk into 135 and pull 134&#39;s door shut behind you when there&#39;s no door knob on 135&#39;s side of 134&#39;s door to pull on?</p>

<p>This is the only possible explanation I can come up with and we have to assume Paddock rented both rooms.</p>

<p>He opens the connecting door to the adjacent room on his side (135.)  He takes the room service cart with the cameras already set up out ito the hallway and uses his key card to open up the hallway door to 134.  He takes the wires to the cameras on the room service cart, and closes the hallway door behind him.</p>

<p>Once inside 134, he walks over and opens the connecting door to his suite and plugs in his camera wires to whatever it was in the suite that he plugged them into.  Now <strong>both</strong> connecting doors 
are open and he can freely pass between the two rooms without having to go back out into the hallway.</p>

<p>He gets out his hammer and breaks out the hurricane force-proof window and takes a few shots at the fuel tanks.  Maybe he runs back and and forth shooting between the two rooms.  Maybe after he shot at Campos, he decides to go back into his suite and close off the other room.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/1nCpCCM">So here&#39;s the &quot;other&quot; non-door knob side of what room 134&#39;s connecting door would look like</a></strong> </p>

<p>I <em>do notice</em> that the lower plate on that door does stick out a little bit.  If it ticks out enough for him to get his fingers clenching the top and bottom of that plate then I suppose he could pull the door shut behind him.</p>

<p>And BTW, I&#39;m not arguing about the tactical squad.  I <em>get</em> what you&#39;re saying.  My argument is about Paddock going back and forth between the rooms using the connecting door and being able to pull one shut behind him when each door only has a door knob on one side.</p>

<p>How do you walk into 135 and pull 134&#39;s door shut behind you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just close it? Simple momentum. Dead bolt it closes? You don&#39;t... What I&#39;m saying is if a person was shooting from 134 and looking to fall back to 135 they would walk past the 134 door (leaving it open maybe), then only close the 135 door. Locking 135 and 135 only, on the 135 side. Being at that point the 134 door is worthless to the person looking to only secure 135, making their stand in 135. </p>

<p>When the police come into the room they only see the 135 door closed and odds are locked with the lock on the 135 side. Yet being they have no idea what&#39;s on the other side shooter wise, they just pop it vs bothering to even try to turn the lock/open the door. They want that big <strong>boom</strong> go go go go sort of move. It&#39;s also possible that knowing the hotel has double doors they pop it just to knock out both doors at once. Again, not knowing if 134 has a person in there or not at the time. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m speculating here as much as the next person. I&#39;m just trying to say that when a statement is made as vague as &quot;secured door&quot; we don&#39;t really know anything. It&#39;s just one more thing in a long line of stuff to keep track of and check once a final report comes out. It really bugs me to not have this sort of info. It&#39;s not that I think there is a conspiracy afoot, I don&#39;t, it&#39;s just annoying to be so in the dark when this is a landmark level case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, I know.. My point is people keep hearing/reading that the tactical team ran into a &quot;secured door&quot; and just presume (as in the OP video) that means the 134 door, locked on the 134 side. When it&#39;s also very possible that the only locked door was the 135 door, with the lock facing the tactical team. Yet being they don&#39;t know what is behind the door, as in a possible 2nd shooter etc they are still going to do a tactical breach on the door vs fiddle with the lock and swing it open. </p>

<p>Much like how they did a tactical breach on the front door to 135 from the hotel hallway when clearly they could get whatever key is needed to just open it. The breach is for tactical lines of fire, an element of surprise and also disorientation of a suspect from the explosion vs really needing to do it &quot;for the lock&quot;. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t understand why people just assume &quot;door secured&quot; means the 134 door and Paddock was running around the hallways etc. I mean maybe, I don&#39;t know, need to wait for a report. Yet the more simple explanation is he walked out of 134, closed and locked the 135 door but the police don&#39;t care how easy it would be to unlock a door, they still blow it up for tactical reasons. After all, they could have just used a key on the front door to 134 from the hotel hallway if they wanted to fiddle with locks and be sitting ducks while opening up doors. It&#39;s also possible none of the damn doors were locked, it&#39;s just what they said being they don&#39;t care if it&#39;s locked or not, they blow it open and go &quot;locked door&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link Mike, i enjoy Blondies videos she doesn&#39;t speculate too much im glad she did one on the blue hose.</p>

<p>This video and her zoom and sharpening work that i couldn&#39;t do definitely helped me confirm breathing device used to counter the smoke in the room .</p>

<p>Before i seen the new video of clear muzzle flash from both windows i had theorised to myself that he broke out the 2 windows purely for airflow between the room to drag the smoke out and keep fresh oxygen coming in.</p>

<p>It would have been smoky already but he had another 4000 rounds of ammo in that room that im sure he planned on using so it could have got a whole lot smokier ... maybe that&#39;s why he stopped shooting? It all just got too much, couldn&#39;t see, couldn&#39;t breath, shoulder was hurting from the bumpstock at 64yr old.... thought he had already killed hundreds if not thousands..   cant breath - fuck it game over.</p>

<p>That rifle on the ground with bipod and scope... that&#39;s one of the few if not only rifles pictured with a proper scope for long range shooting, but yet it&#39;s right by the entrance , inside the guest bathroom instead of anywhere near the window, odd.</p>

<p>Also - Where is the magazine&gt;???? Has anyone posed that question of why the long range rifle with the long range scope is in the opposite place that you would want it, it also doesn&#39;t have a magazine in it?</p>

<p>Well guess what?  If you try to watch that video again, you get &quot;This Video Has Been Removed By The User.&quot;</p>

<p>This video here again though raises similar point about room 32-134..</p>

<p>My only question would be if there was a shooter in 32-134 that escaped how did he escape? The room service cart was in front of the door leading to the hallway.. The only other point of escape was out 32-135, how would you escape without being dressed as a security guard or something (looking at you Jesus) haha</p>

<p>Also strikes me is the room number 32-134 - it has it&#39;s own specific hotel room number which is quite different than Sheriff Joe Lombardo&#39;s explanation of paddocks suite being 1 large suite with 2 bedrooms, for the Sheriff to not have to answer this basic fact or for him to deliberately try to mislead the public with that pathetic excuse for an explanation of the 2 suites makes my mind boggle.</p>

<p>Bingo!  That&#39;s what I thought was odd.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got one room with a dead body, lots of guns and some casings, and a busted window and you see crime tpe like you&#39;re supposed to.</p>

<p>But you&#39;ve got another room with a room service cart in front of it with cameras and wires running underneath the door and a busted out window and there&#39;s no crime scene tape aall.  As far as securing the entire crime scene, it seems kind of sloppy,</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re reading too much into it.  I&#39;ve never seen anyone push a room service cart all the way flush against their door. It would look odd to anyone passing by at that end of the hallway.  Also, it has to be sticking out a little bit for the cameras to be able to capture anyone coming down the hallway.</p>

<p>BTW, if you enlarge that photo and make it really big, you can see what appears to be bullet holes in the tablecloth.  Also - look at that molding halfway up the wall to the right of the door.  Is that a bullet hole?</p>

<p>And how did that silver plate cover wind up on the floor?  Was it hit by a bullet?  I don&#39;t think it could have been from the explosive breach of 135 because if it were, you&#39;d probably see some of those other dishes on the floor, too - possibly broken. </p>

<p>Also - seems like a lot of dishes on the cart to have been a meal for one person.  I wonder if they checked their records to see if he had ordered room service on the day of the shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We hadn&#39;t seen someone run over 10metre of camera cable throughout a hotel room to rig it up with cameras before a mass shooting either... Look where the camera cable by the rifle on bipod leads out too... way out to where the island bar is in the middle of the suite..
It just seems to be out just enough for someone to slip out of that door, almost like someone has opened the door which opens into the room and moved the cart out of the way in hurry and knocked the silver bowl off and in the process knocking the other bowls over top of the camera on top of the cart</p>

<p>The dishes on the cart is either him wanting to be known forever in the conspiracy legends and he wanted us to think it was 2 people or it genuinely was 2 people having their &#39;last meal&#39; so to speak, except one outsmarted the other.</p>

<p>You can kind of figure it out by looking at the photos.</p>

<p>Interior image of a typical Vista Suite showing where the connecting door to the adjacent hotel room was.  (32-135 was a Vista Suite.)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/XF145ur">Image</a></strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a screen shot of how the other room (32-134) looks as you first walk in.  I think the room type is Resort Queen.  Two queen sized beds.  The window that the pink chair is in front of is the window that was broken.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/TKj1Joe">Image</a></strong></p>

<p>The connecting door to Paddock&#39;s suite is on the left with the handle and the deadbolt.  Notice how the connecting door is flush against the wall.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a cropped screen shot from the next day from a helicopter looking into that room.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/QyEwzYo">image</a></strong></p>

<p>You can see the two queen beds and it looks like the pink chair has been placed between them either by the shooter or the police.</p>

<p>As the helicopter moves, you can start to see the connecting room door.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/8xetS3t">Image</a></strong></p>

<p>This is panned over just a little bit more:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/nUhwnm9">Image</a></strong></p>

<p>The door looks to be closed, but it is also recessed in from the wall about six inches.  I think the door we are seeing is the door that was opened on the suite side.  I think the door that should be flush with the wall was the door that opened on 32-134&#39;s side that the police used an explosive to breach.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As in Paddock shot from the 2nd window in the smaller 134 room, walked into 135 and closed and locked 134 off from 135, from the 135 side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you walk into 135 and pull 134&#39;s door shut behind you when there&#39;s no door knob on 135&#39;s side of 134&#39;s door to pull on?</p>

<p>This is the only possible explanation I can come up with and we have to assume Paddock rented both rooms.</p>

<p>He opens the connecting door to the adjacent room on his side (135.)  He takes the room service cart with the cameras already set up out ito the hallway and uses his key card to open up the hallway door to 134.  He takes the wires to the cameras on the room service cart, and closes the hallway door behind him.</p>

<p>Once inside 134, he walks over and opens the connecting door to his suite and plugs in his camera wires to whatever it was in the suite that he plugged them into.  Now <strong>both</strong> connecting doors 
are open and he can freely pass between the two rooms without having to go back out into the hallway.</p>

<p>He gets out his hammer and breaks out the hurricane force-proof window and takes a few shots at the fuel tanks.  Maybe he runs back and and forth shooting between the two rooms.  Maybe after he shot at Campos, he decides to go back into his suite and close off the other room.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/1nCpCCM">So here&#39;s the &quot;other&quot; non-door knob side of what room 134&#39;s connecting door would look like</a></strong> </p>

<p>I <em>do notice</em> that the lower plate on that door does stick out a little bit.  If it ticks out enough for him to get his fingers clenching the top and bottom of that plate then I suppose he could pull the door shut behind him.</p>

<p>And BTW, I&#39;m not arguing about the tactical squad.  I <em>get</em> what you&#39;re saying.  My argument is about Paddock going back and forth between the rooms using the connecting door and being able to pull one shut behind him when each door only has a door knob on one side.</p>

<p>How do you walk into 135 and pull 134&#39;s door shut behind you</p>

<p>Just close it? Simple momentum. Dead bolt it closes? You don&#39;t... What I&#39;m saying is if a person was shooting from 134 and looking to fall back to 135 they would walk past the 134 door (leaving it open maybe), then only close the 135 door. Locking 135 and 135 only, on the 135 side. Being at that point the 134 door is worthless to the person looking to only secure 135, making their stand in 135. </p>

<p>When the police come into the room they only see the 135 door closed and odds are locked with the lock on the 135 side. Yet being they have no idea what&#39;s on the other side shooter wise, they just pop it vs bothering to even try to turn the lock/open the door. They want that big <strong>boom</strong> go go go go sort of move. It&#39;s also possible that knowing the hotel has double doors they pop it just to knock out both doors at once. Again, not knowing if 134 has a person in there or not at the time. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m speculating here as much as the next person. I&#39;m just trying to say that when a statement is made as vague as &quot;secured door&quot; we don&#39;t really know anything. It&#39;s just one more thing in a long line of stuff to keep track of and check once a final report comes out. It really bugs me to not have this sort of info. It&#39;s not that I think there is a conspiracy afoot, I don&#39;t, it&#39;s just annoying to be so in the dark when this is a landmark level case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The statement from the Sheriff also says its a suite with 2 bedrooms, not 2 seperate hotel rooms so are we really trusting what the sheriff has to say about the 2nd door breach?</p>

<p>Especially when it was locked, then it was secured...  Who hired this guy as the sheriff?</p>

<p>Also WTF is the blue hose in the room near his guns and ammo, its clearly not from the hotel and part of his &quot;survival equipment&quot; the sheriff mentioned.. but wtf is it? do we know ?</p>

<p>One person&#39;s theory is that it might be part of a CPAC Machine used for breathing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link Mike, i enjoy Blondies videos she doesn&#39;t speculate too much im glad she did one on the blue hose.</p>

<p>This video and her zoom and sharpening work that i couldn&#39;t do definitely helped me confirm breathing device used to counter the smoke in the room .</p>

<p>Before i seen the new video of clear muzzle flash from both windows i had theorised to myself that he broke out the 2 windows purely for airflow between the room to drag the smoke out and keep fresh oxygen coming in.</p>

<p>It would have been smoky already but he had another 4000 rounds of ammo in that room that im sure he planned on using so it could have got a whole lot smokier ... maybe that&#39;s why he stopped shooting? It all just got too much, couldn&#39;t see, couldn&#39;t breath, shoulder was hurting from the bumpstock at 64yr old.... thought he had already killed hundreds if not thousands..   cant breath - fuck it game over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya wanna know whats interesting about the photo into 32-135..</p>

<p>That rifle on the ground with bipod and scope... that&#39;s one of the few if not only rifles pictured with a proper scope for long range shooting, but yet it&#39;s right by the entrance , inside the guest bathroom instead of anywhere near the window, odd.</p>

<p>Also - Where is the magazine&gt;???? Has anyone posed that question of why the long range rifle with the long range scope is in the opposite place that you would want it, it also doesn&#39;t have a magazine in it?</p>
