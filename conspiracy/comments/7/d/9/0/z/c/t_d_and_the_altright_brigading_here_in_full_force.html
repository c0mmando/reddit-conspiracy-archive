<p>However, instead of driving to the street he stopped the car and parked his car in between the dumpster and the back of the restaurant where there were no lights. </p>

<p>&#39;The area was dark and deserted. I was alarmed and I immediately asked him what he was doing.&#39;</p>

<p>Moore at that point said nothing and began to grope Beverly she claimed, a story she previously shared with her mother and then man who is now her husband.  </p>

<p>&#39;Instead of answering my question, Mr. Moore reached over and began groping me, putting his hands on my breasts,&#39; said Beverly </p>

<p>&#39;I tried to open my car door to leave, but he reached over and locked it so I could not get out. I tried fighting him off, while yelling at him to stop, but instead of stopping he began squeezing my neck attempting to force my head onto his crotch. </p>

<p>&#39;I continued to struggle. <strong>I was determined that I was not allow him to force me to have sex with him. I was terrified. He was also trying to pull my shirt off. I thought that he was going to rape me. I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop. I had tears running down my face.&#39;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah listen to it again, she said in the Senate,
. She wants a shit show, additionally she cannot have that authentication done until the election is over. Weak sauce and when pressed she refused to testify she believed the yearbook was authentic. Hey he may be a pedo but that yearbook is definitely forged, come on it is so apparent. So you then agree Senator Menedez who the justice department has said they believe the claims he slept with underage hookers are potentially true? <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/sd-me-menendez-case-20171012-story,amp.html">https://www.google.com/amp/www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/sd-me-menendez-case-20171012-story,amp.html</a></p>

<p>Look I have 3 points 
1. OP is a douche for doxxing people which he admits to.
2. The yearbook is forged but that doesn&#39;t exonerate Moore.
3. The left is hypocritical since nobody is calling for the head of Menedez.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apologist I clearly state even if the yearbook is fake it doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t guilty so your statement is absolutely false based on what I said. I don&#39;t need a handwriting analyst I have eyes, just look at it. I have seen better attempts by kids trying to fake parent signatures. No she offered to have it authenticated by the senate, huge difference. Guess what when would that happen, oh yeah after the election. It is a stall tactic. So to prove you are not a pedo apologist you agree Menedez should be ousted from the senate based on the justice department investigations, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note to everyone on the Roy Moore stuff:</p>

<p>He admitted it to Hannity on the radio.</p>

<p>So much so that Hannity is briefly acting pissed-off and giving Roy Moore deadlines to deny everything.</p>

<p>Moore&#39;s people are spinning it and deflecting it and attacking the accusers while quoting the Bible. The fact that Roy Moore was a 30 something year old man chasing teenagers is not in dispute. All that is being disputed is exact ages of the girls he dated and meaningless details like how to draw the number seven.</p>

<p>Roy Moore was already a creepy fucker version of the Alabama Taliban. This latest shit just shows how much he embraces the Taliban ideal.</p>

<p>Only in the eventuality of a civil suit which will never happen.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the yearbook is real or not and I&#39;ve yet to see any actual professional analysis. But Moore won&#39;t press the case - win or lose the Senate race. He can&#39;t sue for many reasons, such as being laughed out of court by any actual judge, but the main reason is that a civil suit opens him up to discovery and deposition.</p>
