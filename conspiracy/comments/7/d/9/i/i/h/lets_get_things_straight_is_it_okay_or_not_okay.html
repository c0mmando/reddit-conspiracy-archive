       Because there seems to be a lot of uncertainty if you look at the Roy Moore threads. People bending over backwards to make excuses for him, when they would crucify any democrat for doing the same. I just want to establish a baseline for future discussions. Is it right or wrong for a politician to have sexual contact with a minor.

       I didn't say people were saying it's okay. But check any of the moore threads and you'll see a lot of posts excusing his behavior by saying that it's Alabama, it was a different time, men are attracted to young girls etc. There is also the usual deflection to bringing up
       <em>
        muh creepy Joe Biden.

       Hmm... I really haven't made up my mind on cultural relativism in retrospect when it's not to remove blame but to understand. Is excusing a type of behaviour the same as accepting it?

       That's back to the non-active pedo/hebophilia discussion and is moot. I can't accuse somebody not diddling youngsters of being a child abuser, on the other hand I can't accept people who abuse young people - and the reported behaviour is abusive.

       I checked out some of the images and videos of Joe Biden in regards to creepy uncle. To me it seems that some of the kids try to avoid his (to me) inappropriate attention and while it's not abusive it's creepy as fuck. Not that that's directly related to Moore.

       That's an oversimplification of the problem. But to respond in an oversimplified manner... No. Pedophilies shouldn't be in prison. Abusers should.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before anybody goes off the rail, "abuse" includes a "consensual" relationship between adults and children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Abusers should go to jail, repeat offenders should have their sexual drive chemically suppressed. Abusers who refuse medicinal treatment to curb their abusive behaviour should be removed from society on a permanent basis, either through imprisonment or euthanasia.

       I completely agree with there needs to be some investigating done to definitively say whether the allegations are true or false, not this meandering flood of accusations and speculation that seems to be going on, especially considering the election and how convenient the timing is to me all the more reason it needs to be confirmed either way true or false, if true he deserves to be punished in accordance with the law. (Even though there’s a lot of people including myself who think people who take advantage of and abuse minors get off way too easy. [no pun intended honest]). Why we don’t punish this more severely such as heavier sentences and/or castration is beyond me, as well as why they don’t just hang people that commit those crimes, I’m pretty sure if lawmakers grew a pair and starting hanging pedophiles/serving much harsher punishment, I think it’d be a great deterrent and reduce the amount of children being abused. (Then again why would the politicians wanna do that? If they did they’d have to start going after most of their own and god knows they aren’t, only time you’d get one to turn on others is when they wanted to save their own skin from pulling time and out someone else. The justice system is a joke and broken in many ways, but giving child rapists/pedo’s/ and abusers probation or a year-2 if that in prison compared to other non-violent crime or drug offenses is the biggest crack in the foundation of our justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the gray area of this as far as (to me) it seems nobody is going out of there way to pursue the truth. Sadly with all things in politics &amp; otherwise, there will be people who will still support him even if it is proved he’s abused minors and sexually assaulted women as well as opponents who will latch onto any negative allegations and run with it even if untrue or yet to be proven for financial gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree with the other commenter up top that children CANNOT consent to sex with an adult under any circumstances, the fact that we as a country and society feel that it’s reasonable and needed to have a discussion on the matter about whether or not it’s wrong in some situations, is completely egregious and heinous IMO, it’s simply wrong, a grown man having sex with a 13yo is wrong on every level and terribly sick. This is definitely  one of the lowest points in society where there’s politicians and others who are trying to justify it or rationalize the issue and say it’s not wrong, (or in Moore’s case it wasn’t because he “asked the parents permission &amp; held public office at the time). 
Idgaf who you are, who you know, where you’re from, what office/power/money/influence you hold, taking advantage of children and abusing them

       IMO Age of consent is ridiculous. No one should have to make that type of decision regardless of age. It shouldn't be a question of when a minor has the mental capability to engage in a sexual act with someone who is not a minor. Why is this even being brought up? An adult should NOT have sexual contact with a minor.

       It's important to remember that this issue fundamentally transcends party lines. R's and D's are caught up in this, because it is used as blackmail in Political theatre. For those who do not believe this, here's a quick run down of events and buzzwords you should look into:

      <p>
       Conspiracy of Silence
      </p>
      <p>
       An Open Secret

       The Finders Cult
      </p>
      <p>
       MK Ultra
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many more, and so many layers to each item I listed. This is all part of things
       <em>
        far bigger
       </em>
       than the L/R "divide", which doesn't even exist anymore except on Social Issues to keep the American masses distracted from the elite, ritual magick abusing fuckers that control this country and most of the Western World.

       It's not ok to have sex with minors but the only "evidence" thus far is a note in a yearbook, everything else has been heresay. Sometimes people lie, remember the Duke Lacrosse case?

       The words on the screen aren't what he's saying, they're what you want to hear. It's difficult to make out most of it but it sounds more like "how hard it is being/to be a 13 year old girl".

       Yeah definitely more along the lines of "how hard it is being a 13 year old girl". You really think he would say that with all the people there beside him, his wife listening closely and cameras and microphones all around him?

       The only discernible words are "talk to my daughter Ashley" you can make up anything you want to go after it. It's sounds like more words than "about the film" but even if that's what it was it means nothing.

       After the kiss, which you're probably better off focusing on, it sounds like he says "you're a good little girl". You could twist that into something too. You're really stretching to make something bad out of him announcing "see you back home" where they're probably having a party/gathering after the event and you can hear others acknowledge it.

       The general idea amongst people who know about the
       <em>
        red box
       </em>
       is that there are many worse politicians who skate. These allegations came up during re-election at an opportune political time.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a group of organic efforts uncovered shady dealings in leaked emails and public concern was initiated over Pedogate, across a number of specific, localized areas (DC, Hollywood) the reaction was adversarial and belligerent by the media. They refused to promote or answer any questions, instead, 'debunking' anything related to it outright.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't to say the allegations were true or untrue. It's not about that. It's about an organic public crisis that was ignored, then deflected into political posturing and realigned to Moore and others, promoted and disseminated to alleviate the superficial followers into a sense of justice by singling out low lying fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the optics of the situation or timeline at least.

       Sexual misconduct with a child is wrong. Moore maybe the biggest creep on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But accusations are just that. People are going to scrutinize, and find reason to not believe, if those accusations are from your political opponent. People are going to call you a liar when your lawyer refuses to say evidence wasn't forged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Moore is guilt. If so he should absolutely be held accountable. That doesn't change the fact that they've (accusers, lawyers, etc) completely mishandled the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of his accusers said going to court would take too long, for fucks sake. Too long for what, exactly?

       Only if the politician is a minor himself/herself.  Or if the politician is a hot chick and the minor is at least 14 years old.  I'm sorry but it just doesn't work both ways.  If some hot teacher molested me any time after puberty not only would I not have been traumatized, I would've been a hero.

       a lot of 14 year old girls want to fuck older men, but kids are stupid. They don't have fully developed brains and their full of hormones. So yeah, they probably shouldn't be allowed to consent.
