       I've always been pissed they won't investigate Trump for being a reptilian alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       He obviously comes from a bright planet as his eyes went undamaged looking directly at the Sun during the solar eclipse.
      </p>
      <p>
       His skin color is an unnatural orange, most likely due to different pigmentation. The reptilians can't see that the skin-weave looks off. To them it looks identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remarks about his daughter if he was the father would be inhumane. However, if he is simply a horny alien wanting to experiment with young girls it fits perfectly.
      </p>

       I want the silencing to stop and have my investigation.

       Yes, I would. I've had people sign NDAs for interviewing with companies, and I've signed NDAs just to interview. This includes interviews with companies like Groupon.
      </p>
      <p>
       NDAs are so fucking standard. In fact, they're so common they're becoming really hard to enforce. You fucking sign them when you get invited to alpha tests of video games, for christ's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment you have the potential to come in contact with anything (businesses, games, political campaigns) that have even a tiny bit of someone else's intellectual property, you are going to be forced to sign an NDA.

       If you are

       Next time don't use such literal words as "silenced". People are going to play a game of "aha! Gotcha! Nobody actually stopped you from speaking!!! You're a loser!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of us who have intellectual honesty know what you mean though -- the media, as a whole, was silent about many of the conspiracies under past presidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Fox gave some air time to some Obama conspiracies, but Fox is only a single news source. And not everybody on Fox was on the same page. What we see now is the vast majority of the media, and people, being unafraid of speaking up because they know their colleagues, and their media, aren't going to mock them for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not being forced into self-censorship, which many of the people playing the "aha!" game don't think is a real thing.

       Breitbart, Drudge, Infowars, etc.
People in right wing, conservative media consistently pushed Obama and Clinton conspiracy theories while they were in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially with Clinton, it has become an entire industry. You have entire orgs like Judicial Watch dedicated to following Clinton conspiracies. Guys like David Bossie rose from following Clinton conspiracies.

       So then you agree these guys have the same audience, and trust, as places like CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NYTimes, Washington Post, LATimes, Chicago Tribune, CBS, BBC, The Atlantic, VICE, Slate, Salon, Wired, GQ.. I could go on but you get the point.

       Who do you consider "silenced"? Was Trump "silenced" when he was tweeting about whether Obama was actually American? What about Hannity? Did Fox News get "silenced" about Fast and Furious? Or Benghazi? I seem to recall them running numerous stories about those 2 conspiracy theories.
