       One possible and likely motive for him transferring all his wealth to a foundation is that if he is criminally convicted they cannot go after the funds in the non-profit. Protection from seizure.

       So the fun process of exploring options.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine an individual makes literally tens of hundreds robbing banks, then donates a significant portion of their money to a non-profit or corporation they have influence over. Crimes were committed in acquisition of these funds. The individual is arrested and convicted. Are there grounds to claw back the funds from the organization?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another scenario. An individual is independently wealthy thanks to winning the family lottery at birth. They enjoy a life of leisure and dabbling in access to power and politics awarded by their financial means. They develop a taste for illegal activities that while not profiting from, lead to conviction for crimes and heavy financial burden. Let's say they started MegaUpload as a Dropbox type file sharing service, but managed to piss off the US entertainment industry in the process. They park significant funds in Hong-Kong and other foreign locations and in various organizations under their control. The US pressures New Zealand to raid their home using military assets and proceed to seize and freeze all their assets. Can any funds parked in third parties be clawed back?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe another way. An FBI agent investigating a deep-web criminal enterprise, for lack of a better name let's call it Silk Road. In the process of their lawful duties they collect information using illegal methods, but that's perfectly fine as parallel construction is the norm. They also leverage entrapment in this case fabricating a scenario of high pressure and stress to try to coax their target into taking further illegal steps. They arrest their guy. All the bitcoin held by the fictitious business Silk Road is held onto by the agents involved with the operation. And donated to a non-profit they hold influence over and pay out family members hired to staff of. The agent is arrested for failure to turn over the stolen illegal funds. Can the funds be clawed back from the non-profit they were donated to?

       I don't have strong convictions that how he made his money is from illegal activities. But he definitely seems to be utilizing that money in nefarious ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are some good questions you bring up. Would be great if someone familiar with these legalities could chime in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another possibility of his money getting taken away is from civil lawsuits brought on by people/groups he has harmed and perhaps countries. At the end of the day, even if it is really hard for the government to take away his funds, better to have them locked up somewhere safe where it's protected, and essentially not in your hands anymore, than to be liable and have extraordinary wealth.

       Did he have a headsup the Saudi raid was coming and that their money for Antifa, BLM, etc., would dry up, so he infused their dying paradigm with cash?

       No idea. Hope that fucker dies soon, or, better yet, is captured and publicly exposed and humiliated. Then dies.

       He's probably been diagnosed with an untreatable fatal disease and is donating his money rather than willing it. As we all know, wills are often contested and it's a lot easier to move money when you're alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the funds are illegally obtained, the state can still go after them even after they've been donated. Constructive Trust is one avenue.
