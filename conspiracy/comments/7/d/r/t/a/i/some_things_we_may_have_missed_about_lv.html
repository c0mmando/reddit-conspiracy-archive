        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A couple discrepancies about the suite pop out at me.</p>

<p><a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3541884.1507163544!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/article-bumps1-1004.jpg">http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3541884.1507163544!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/article-bumps1-1004.jpg</a> - look at the chair closest to his feet - see anything weird? look at the table next to the chair. It has a note and a roll of tape, right? Now, look back at the chair. Specifically the left arm (seated person&#39;s perspective) of the chair around wrist level. 2 marks consistent with adhesive about the same width as tape? </p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLlnVRyV4AAsBVB.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLlnVRyV4AAsBVB.jpg</a> - here&#39;s a zoomed in shit quality picture. Same thing. Easier to see in the full photograph that what&#39;s happening on the left side of that chair isn&#39;t on the right. You&#39;re paying $500 a night for a suite, I sure as hell hope the chairs aren&#39;t shit quality..</p>

<p>One other thing. I noticed in a 3D model of the suite posted on here, that chairs location and the blinds for that window are kind of skewed from our inside view. Without the drapes pulled, we&#39;re not seeing that the room that appears on the left isn&#39;t as much as it seems to be. <a href="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/1084068.jpg">https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/1084068.jpg</a> - this picture is from outside. You see the chair? Assuming it wasn&#39;t moved in between the death photos and this picture being taken, that&#39;s a tighter window than implied. Also would be harder to shoot from with those drapes in the way. Shell casings should be to the right of the chair in the photo (at least some of them, I see very few if any) And if the shooter was using the back of the chair as a mount for the rifle, the majority of the casings would be to the right of the chair. </p>

<p>Strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Green tape is painters masking tape, no? To protect one surface while you paint the surface adjacent to it?</p>

<p>By design it&#39;s low adhesive, so it doesn&#39;t damage or leave any residue on the surface being protected. So it wouldn&#39;t necessarily make a particularly strong impression on the arms of the chair if it were applied there.</p>

<p>Nor would it make a particularly effective restraint, unless it was wrapped around dozens of times. Obviously don&#39;t know how much tape was on the roll when it was fresh, but the roll on the table looks like there&#39;s a lot of tape on there — indicating to me that not much tape has been removed to secure something dozens of times round to the armchair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not much of any of the &quot;leaked&quot; photos make sense. </p>

<p>Two shades of the blood around his head. The hand gun appears to have been kicked away trailing blood spots as it moved. </p>

<p>The rifle over the top of his leg, not enough shells on the floor for over 1000 rounds fired. The curtain blowing from wind is not covering the broken window. The broken window is behind the chair OP mentioned as having tape on it. Why not move that chair. The rifles have bipods on them indicating they would be used in a prone shooting position. Cant do this with a chair in front of the window. There should be empty clips somewhere near by. </p>

<p>The door pic, no evidence of blast marks on the door or frame, the glass  light fixtures and exit sign are not   broken. There is no bullet holes in the one door and no where near 200 holes in the door laying inside. Why is just one of the guns labeled with evidence marker. Again a bipod equipped rifle  laying near the entrance to the room. </p>

<p>This whole event stinks of lies. They say he planned to escape yet sealed the stairway door, the easiest escape route from the room. The adjoining room door was locked needed to be blasted open. Locked door prevents a single gunman from moving room to room. </p>

<p>What was paddocks cause of cause of death? where are campos, maryanne, the brother now? Why cant the lawyers gain access to the room? What went on in tropicana? Where is a single ballistics report? Why is the coroner office locked down? Why did lvpd call in a private firm to supply armored vehicles to assist in rescue efforts?</p>

<p>There are many many more questions not being answered.   </p>
