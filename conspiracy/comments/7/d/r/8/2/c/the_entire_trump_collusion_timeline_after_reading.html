       Trump and his allies may have colluded with Russia for different reasons, nevertheless a pattern seems to be emerging in which a conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud the United States becomes more likely on every passing day as more information comes to light.

       OP has a couple dozen sources. This comment was claiming those sources were invalid for some reason. But really was a dumbass lazy ad hominem that merely discredits the entire post without engaging it with logic or reason. “Fake news” and it’s equivalents should not be an acceptable response to a sourced and reasoned argument to anyone who cares about uncovering truth.

       This implicates Hillary and the Podestas, not Trump. His association with "Russia" (and by "Russia" I mean Russia's mortal enemy the Ukraine) was largely through the Podesta group.  Trump might have been colluding with Russians, but this is evidence to the contrary if anything.

       I'm a socialist, and this is a truly wonderful thing. Dismantling the State Department would literally make Trump the greatest President in over 50 years, so I must say, "Go Tillerson!"

       The State Department serves as a mechanism for discreetly funneling tax dollars as corporate welfare to transnational corporations, and as a money-laundering front for the CIA. Every person who has ever served in the State Department, including Bannon, should be tried for treason and publicly executed on C-SPAN.

       It implicates a single one of the Podesta brothers, and not the one associated with Clinton. Nice try.

       As far as I know the main argument is that Wikileaks released the emails, which Russia supposedly hacked and gave to them, therefore they work for the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       This of course ignores the problem that the files were transferred too quickly to have been done over the internet.

       Your timeline leaves omits quite a few bullet points that change the entire tone you're going for.
      </p>
      <p>
       You talk about the meeting between vesselneskaya and Trump team. However, you don't mention that she met with Fusion GPS before and after that meeting. Fusion GPS is the firm that ordered the piss dossier. The owner, Glenn Simpson, has been very shady and just this week, finally testified on capital hill behind closed doors. The firm is notorious for using fake propaganda to take down opponents of their clients. That the trump meeting was set up and pushed from someone meeting with them, after already being paid to find dirt on trump, is pretty telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also mention Manafort. Manafort is indicted on charges unrelated to the Trump campaign. After all this time, Mueller comes out with a charge unrelated to the election? Yeah, that actually proves that the collusion narrative is not what he ended up focusing on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also don't mention that Manafort worked alongside the Podesta group in Ukraine to lobby for the pro Russian President the Obama administration had a hand in overthrowing. During Euromaidan, John Podesta starts working for the white house. Manafort and Tony Podesta continue working for the Ukranian president. After the president is overthrown, Manafort comes back to the states and the government begins to surveil him. They end their surveillance well before the campaign. Manafort goes on to ask to work on Trump campaign and is allowed. The surveillance starts up again after the FISA court turns down the first request. Timing suggests the Fusion GPS dossier played a role in securing the second FISA warrant. The same company also meeting with Vesselnaskaya before her DON Jr. meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, John Podesta, who personally made 37 million in 2011 after Putin invested in his company, Joule energy, goes on to work for Clinton's campaign. Obama and Clinton signed off on an uranium deal that has no shown benefits for the American people. Once again, this is after the Podesta were involved in lobbying for the deal on behalf of the Russian government and the Clinton's received bribes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, No, their isn't some great argument for collusion between the Trump admin and the Russian government. Stop reading propaganda.

       Some sources wouldn't hurt.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple things, Manafort being indicted over money laundering doesn't mean Mueller changed focus and it doesn't prove anything other than that they had evidence he broke the law and wanted to take him down early. Could be because they wanted to get it over with, maybe it was because they want him sweating so he flips. You don't know, no one but Mueller and his team know for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you say John Podesta made 37 million after Putin contributed to "his company". Do you actually mean Tony's company? That John left in the early 90s? Because if that's the case. You're just making tenuous links just because they're brothers and have the same last name. Being brothers doesn't automatically mean you're both in cahoots. If I'm mistaken, please, show me a source the says otherwise.

       I will give you one on Podesta though:

      <p>
       Putin's investment firm apparently is really into green energy interests in the states.

      <p>
       Both Podesta brothers have profited heavily from Russian ties.

       Even according to that article, you're still being misleading. The 30-some odd million went to a company J.Podesta was a board member of, and he had some improper disclosures which is shitty (what's up Kushner?) but obviously there's no punishment for those anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe he made some money, but it's unlikely he made the whole 30-some-odd million dollars in that deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The links between the Russian bank, bis brother, and that company J.Podesta were on should absolutely be looked into.
      </p>

      <p>
       That said, don't take someone asking for sources as some insult to your intelligence. You were being misleading and I asked for clarification so I could see if what you were saying was true or if it was horseshit. You don't wanna give sources? Great. But don't get pissed when someone asks for sources.

       I don't take it as an insult to my intelligence, it annoys me because people don't know what they are discussing and then ask for sources instead of investigating it for themselves. Why would you take somebody else's "sources" as some sort of truth? If you are interested in a subject or something piques your curiosity then you should source it yourself. That's my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Joule energy, there are many articles about Podesta being the front for this company that appears to be a sort of shell or money laundering company. You'd need to dig in and read a bunch of articles and watch interviews to see the layout. However, an easy way to smell test it is to see if it seems reasonable that Putin's bank would invest in a green energy firm here. If you think that is reasonable, then ask why out of all the firms, he chose the one headed by a former chief of staff/ clinton strong arm/ brother of D.C.s most powerful lobbyist/ recent lobbyist for uranium one. Even just a quick think should tell you the situation stinks. However, I do recommend doing your own research on the entire matter. Get into reading about the Ukrainian revolution, who funded it, the controversy around it, what the sides are actually fighting for, what alliances are strengthened. All of it ties together. The same players pop up over and over as you go. The more reading you do, the clearer the picture becomes. It doesn't back up the narrative being pushed... being pushed by the same characters that keep popping up in the corruption.

       President Obama already had his cabinet picked for him by a Citibank executive 2 months before the 2008 election ever took place,and HIllary Clinton regularly received million dollar gifts from dictators less than two years before the 2016 election so there's clearly nothing wrong with discussing tentative policies and appointments before an election. If Trump met with representatives of Russia to discuss the Magnitsky Act, well that's just part of the political process. There's no evidence of a quid pro quo whatsoever. Meanwhile, there are numerous quid pro quos going on with Obama and Clinton.

       And we now know, thanks to Elizabeth Warren and Donna Brazille, that the Democratic Party was completely controlled by Hillary Clinton, meaning she was receiving payments for ambassadorial positions.

        1 - So an investigation since 2015 and a presidential elect learned about it? Not really so unimaginable... Feels like unwarranted Wikileaks hate. Papadopolous going to jail over lying under oath? Seems like a normal conclusion for perjury. Meeting never happened, the woman he was communicating with wasn't even related to Putin or any part of Russian government.

       Ah, Fusion GPS, already shaky ground. However this is the first confirmed meeting between a Russian National and members of Trump's campaign team. Actual evidence against his staff, not him. Even though her closest relationship to the Russian government is representing the son of a Russian politician. Why do they care about the maginsky act so much? Russia and the USA are in bed with each other. They could get around such a law easily. You used three sources to say the same thing. So condensed answer.

       We know from Flynn, DTJr other Trump officials that the Trump campaign made several indications to Russian officials that they would adopt a pro-Russian agenda if they were to be elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that this was followed through to some degree as the GOP dropped Ukraine from the platform due to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that congressional investigation into election tampering has already concluded that Russia did put forth significant resources to support Trump and Bernie against Hillary. We had further confirmation from Twitter and Facebook later on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of these facts, there was bipartisan support for sanctions on Russia for political meddling, sanctions Trump repeadedly delayed past their deadline to implement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty damn clear that Russia gave Trump assistance to help him get elected, it's also clear that the Trump team had indicated to Russian officials the benefits of a Trump presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unclear if there's anything truly illegal and punishable against Trump here. But the whole scenario is obviously detrimental to American democracy.  The fact that Russia managed to help promote someone into power that also happens to be in charge of their punishment feels a lot like a bizzare loophole.
