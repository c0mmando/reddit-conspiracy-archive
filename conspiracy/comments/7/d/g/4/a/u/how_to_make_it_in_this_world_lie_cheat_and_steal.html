<p>This is the message we&#39;re getting every day.  Corruption and exploitation everywhere you look but still we trudge on, barely noticing.  Increasingly it seems that making an honest living, being fair to people and following the correct rules is a mug&#39;s game.  Looking for a job? Lie as much as possible.  Why?  Because you can bet the other candidates will be too.  What do you tell a child as they step out into the world?  Good luck and beware of the scumfucks?</p>

<p>There are no ethics or morals.  Whole countries would collapse if the arms industry stopped selling weapons.  We literally need war keep the economy afloat. Of course people own shares in these companies.  And Monsanto.  Whatever makes them a buck.  Doesn&#39;t matter.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a terrible feeling knowing that everything is so inherently corrupt and my and my family&#39;s welfare depends so much on bullshit.  Lying to yourself as you go to work.  To your colleagues about the latest &quot;news&quot;.  To baby boomer relatives who chide you for not voting.  To your kids when they ask questions about the world.  I&#39;m at a complete loss.</p>

<p>While I am not saying being rich is terrible, I also do not think that kind of lifestyle is completely hunky dorey. The grass is always greener on the other side. It makes you think how a human could lose so much empathy and compassion to pull off some of the shit that these elites do. I believe wealth and humanity correlate inversely at some extent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This economy is highly dependent on war because of the amount of jobs it produces. That‚Äôs inherently so here in the states where we have like 600billion a year being piped into the military. You also have plenty of companies cutting down on labor costs, so yes for the American economy to stay afloat since we have outsourced all our fucking jobs we need war. This is why war will more than likely never end anytime soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surround yourself with good people that value ethics and morality. Encourage good people to seek leadership positions at the local level. Community is the most important thing and people are losing sight of this as we further disconnect from our communities and instead choose to look down at our phones to absorb all the negativity in the world. </p>

<p>It&#39;s no wonder we are all becoming cynical and don&#39;t trust authority. If that&#39;s all we are bombarded by we lose sight of the light in this dark world. It&#39;s always been a battle between good and evil. Evil may have an easier path to success and power, but it constantly has to look over its shoulder to ensure that the righteous won&#39;t catch up to them.</p>

<p>Millenials are being divided by the billionaire boomers that see the writing on the wall. They want truth and accountability for the sins of the past. Similar to the 70-80s we are experiencing the romanticizing of foreign relations, never ending wars, economic disparity, and big business running rampant on the common man. It is in their best interest to keep everyone divided. If they can succeed in dividing the younger generations, then they can continue the cycle of oppression for the foreseeable future. </p>

<p>Next time you see antifa vs alt-right posts think about how minuscule the number of people directly involved with the protests is. I&#39;d guess it&#39;s less 1% of the population actually out in the streets clashing. Yet, somehow we have people on the Internet choosing sides from remote locations and falling in line. Tribalism is back and if you are a part of it THEN YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.</p>
