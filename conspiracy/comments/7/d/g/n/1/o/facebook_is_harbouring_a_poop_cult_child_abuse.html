       Jillian Epperly has created a private- members only "Poop Cult" on Facebook. Within her Poop Cult  Jillian epperly has convinced her minions that The Elite have manufactured weaponized parasites that are dispersed via chemtrails. Jilly claims that the parasites can control our thoughts, emotions, make us crave food and also are the root cause of all diseases. Jillian insists that the only way to heal the body of these programmed parasites is to drink her "juice." Jillian Epperly continues to tell mothers that they are infecting their children with candida and programmed parasites via breast milk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recipe for "Jilly Juice" is: 1 tbs salt+ 2 cups cabbage+ 2 cups water fermented for 3 days and consuming up to 1 gallon of juice per day. 1 gallon of Jilly Juice has an estimated amount of 8 tbs salt.

       Jillian associates vaccines with autism. Jilly says that her recipe can heal everything from a to z and this includes cancer, autism and downs syndrome facial deformities.

       Jilly admits to the Poop Cult!

       Jillian Epperly INSISTS that her recipe is safe to give to children and infants. Jilly continues to defend giving children salty cabbage water and claims parents are protected under "kosher laws".

       In the following video, Jilly gives tips on how to get your kids to drink her juice. In the past Jilly has suggested using a syringe, mixing it in a smoothie, putting it in the ears or belly button, and she also suggests enemas.

       I am sad to report that Jillian encourages parents to give their children her "juice" by any means possible. Bloody diapers have been published within Jillian Epperlys 40,000 member group. Reports of nightmares, chills, shakes, crying, and dairrhea have been reported with children on protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
       This blog post has photographic evidence of parents allegedly bribing their children into drinking Jillian Epperly's recipe:

       There have been many reported side effects associated with "Jilly Juice". Some of those side effects include: seizures, convulsions, tremors, brain fog, nuerological issues, migraines, vomiting, diahrrea, constipation, coma, death. There are many reports of dental issues and one report that someone lost a tooth. Excess salt leeches calcium from the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note that consuming excess levels of salt is poisonous to the human body. There are severe side effects to salt poison. Jillian Epperly has convinced people that any side effects that they experience on her protocol are a sign that the body is starting to heal. Jillian Epperly's mantra is that "Pain Is Healing." This blog post attempts to debunk Jillian Epperly's claim regarding her protocol and the alleged herx detox claims.

       There has been a death associated with Jilly Juice. Bruce Wilmot had stage 4 cancer and Jillian Epperly encouraged him to drink more than a gallon of her salty fermented cabbage water. Bruce developed hyponatremia and bone pain. His Rabbi found him in a coma and he was later admitted into hospice. This is a fact Jillian Epperly continues to deny.

       All proper law enforcement authorities and the medical board have been contacted. MSM and local media have been contacted. Nothing has been done to shut down the poop cul. Jillian's facebook group is flagged every day and none of the child abuse content from her page has been removed. There is still a video on jillians group of a 6 year old child who is  allegedly "intoxicated" from "jilly juice".
      </p>
      <p>
       Jillians poop cult has over 40,000 members. I have proof that jillian hired trolls to infiltrate her group and spread disinformation regarding her protocol. Specifcally, Jillian hired people and told them to pretend like they were pregnant and drinking her protocol. However, Jillian did not pay her trolls and they exposed her.
Jillian admits to recieving landmark cult training and has been accused of brainwashing in the past. Jillians dad worked for Bayer and her mother was a psychologist. Jillian claims that being raised by her parents has given her a deeper understanding of the weaponized parasites that the bio-chem corporations have created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is facebook protecting this poop cult? Is this anotherone of those social media psyops?

       She's kinda half right that all the chemicals are bad but people just need to buy natural food and they're fine.... Just a detox from so many foreign chemicals, basic biology really. Kinda feel like Facebook will actually delete it since they hate any pro organic agenda.

       It has been over 4 months since I have actively been trying to get the group removed and the group is keeps gaining members. 2 deaths associated with the protocol. Numerous reports of seizures. Children are seemingly pooping their own stomach lining. Its pretty comparable to the bleach enema cult at this point.

       True sounds horrible. Go to the media go to Breitbart and show them all the evidence of Facebook ignoring it and they'll probably do some 'zuckerbrrg harboring cult with growing body count ' shit, srs. Hell even send me more info and I'll write something up, but no one will see it if I do it. Go to Breitbart or right leaning outlet. Left msm loves Facebook.

       exposing a real-life Poop Cult is harder than you might think.

       Jillian Epperly is a coprophiliac. She often talks about sticking #3FingersUpHerOwnButt to make herself poop:

       Yes, this is very true. Jillian Epperly advocates abusing salt laxatives. Long term abuse of laxatives will shut down the bowel function and cause constipation. Constipation is a common reported side effect of jillys juice. Her solution is to either drink more salt water to trigger "waterfalls" or pull the poop out with your fingers or give yourself an enema of salty cabbage wine

       Jilly has brainwashed people into feeding their kids salt water. Bloody diapers have been reported on the Jillian Epperly protocol.

       Why does the internet continue to turn a blind eye towards online child abuse?

       Here are a few SS that show that Jillian Epperly hired people to troll her group with misinformation. Jilly didn't pay her hired help and the trolls came forward with the truth.

       Nope, Jillian Epperly's recipe is NOT saurkraut. Her recipe does not follow traditional fermented recipes. Her recipe uses too much salt and also is not allowed to ferment long enough. I am working on getting a batch of jilly juice tested which should confirm there is little, if any, probiotic cultures within her "juice"

       Ha, are you accusing me of being part of the psyops? Because I am definitely NOT an agent. UGH. I joined Jillian Epperly's group and the bitch tried to diagnoise me as having harmful invaders. She then tried to tell me to drink her juice and stop drinking coffee and smoking weed.

       I did more research only to find horrifying side effects associated with Jillys Juice. Despite seizures, convulsions,vomitting,and dairrhea, Jilly keeps telling parents to feed their children her salty recipe. A rational adult can understand the true dangers of giving a child salt water.
      </p>

       I wrote this entire blog to expose the dangers of jilly juice

       The title of her group intrigued me. Jillians group description talks about candida and "programmed" parasites. I also am familiar with fermentation and love Saurkraut, so upon first inspection of her group, I thought it was a fermentation group that had a deeper understanding of candida/parasites.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first joined Jillys group, there were a ton of graphic images and videos of people who had purged the parasites. The video of the 12-year-old talking about passing worms after an enema really horrified me. I started to do more research only to find out many people had been injured by drinking Jilly Juice, and Jillian Epperly banned and blocked people who were hurt from her recipe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you familiar with any of Patrick Jordans content? He alleges that many parasites and diseases have been manufactured and also states that in the manufacturing of these diseases/sicknesses demonic entities are evoked.

       I have one friend on FB who has a huge following also obsessed with enemas and would show pictures of all the tape worms he found in his stool. He did mention that if you didn't use it correctly it would have adverse side effects.

       Jillian tells people to drink up to 8 tbs of salt every day for the rest of their life. This is a toxic amount of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Salt can kill you. Too much salt can shut the kidneys down. Too much salt cant cause hypernatremia.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the health community, many people advocate "salt flushes" to cleanse the colon. Jillians recipe has 4x the amount of salt than the average salt flush. Furthermore, no reputable dr would tell you to indefinitely drink large amounts of salt.
