    <div class="md"><p>RESOLUTION
Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

<p>Resolved, That Donald John Trump, President of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors and that the following article of impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate:</p>

<p>Article of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of the United States of America, against Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

<p>ARTICLE I</p>

<p>In his conduct while President of the United States, Donald John Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed and impeded the administration of justice during a Federal investigation in that:</p>

<p>Knowing that Federal law enforcement authorities were investigating possible criminal law violations of his former National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn and knowing that Federal law enforcement authorities were conducting one or more investigations into Russian state interference in the 2016 campaign for President of the United States, and that such investigation(s) included the conduct of his campaign personnel and associates acting on behalf of the campaign, to include the possible collusion by those individuals with the Russian government, Donald John Trump sought to use his authority to hinder and cause the termination of such investigation(s) including through threatening, and then terminating, James Comey, who was until such termination the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>The pattern of behavior leading to the conclusion that he sought to cause the hindrance or termination of said investigation(s) include the following:</p>

<p>(1) Requesting that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation curtail the investigation of the activities of General Michael Flynn under circumstances wherein it appeared that Director Comey might be terminated if he failed to adhere to such request.</p>

<p>(2) Making a determination to terminate the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and only thereafter requesting that the Deputy Attorney General provide him with a memorandum detailing inadequacies in the Director’s performance of his duties.</p>

<p>(3) Despite offering differing rationales for the termination of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, admitted subsequently that the main reason for the termination was that the Director would not close or alter the investigation of matters related to the involvement of Russia in the 2016 campaign for President of the United States.</p>

<p>(4) Stated that, once he had terminated the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the pressure of said investigation had been significantly reduced.</p>

<p>In all of this, Donald John Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.</p>

<p>Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.</p>

<p>Yes, yes it would. Except instead of hearing anywhere and everywhere that the President should be impeached, we would be hearing about a &quot;vast alt-right wing conspiracy&quot; to bring down the President, and anyone who said anything about Clinton&#39;s crimes would be labeled a misogynist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what leftists will do, and have always done in regards to the opposition. From the French Revolution onwards the main mode of leftism in dealing with dissent is to silence or harass its opposition. </p>

<p>The behavior of the DNC is functionally no different than the KGB or NKVD, or even the Jacobins, except they have less power. When you come to terms that the right vs left division doesn&#39;t exist, you&#39;re almost there but not quite -- the real truth is that it does and doesn&#39;t, it is simply that the left is a completely illegitimate as a political field as its real face is corruption and domination based on over-socialization and self-loathing (which itself is based on feelings of inferiority -- hence the desire to &quot;equalize&quot; and steal wealth). The actuality is that it is the left vs everyone else.</p>

<p>Hell, just look at the reddit admins. They&#39;re die-hard leftists but only in it for the money and social standing, and resort to silencing and harassing right-wing subreddits in very underhanded ways. From Stalin to Spez, from Robespierre to <a href="/r/againsthatesubreddits">/r/againsthatesubreddits</a>, the behavior is always the same.</p>

<p>Because left-wing politics is the politics of the mob.</p>

<p>Despite their special hatred towards Trump for not being a typical republican that is simply a democrat ten years in the past, ask yourself how many former GOP presidents have had articles of impeachment attempted on them by democrats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they are grandstanding.  Because they now realize that after a year of Russia investigations, it&#39;s obvious that Mueller has nothing on Trump.  Because they are desperate.  Because they want to look like they are part of the resistance.  Because the 5 or 6 that stood up yesterday want to get nominated by the DNC in 2020.  </p>

<p>Look at this from an objective view.  GOP controls House and Senate.  GDP consistently at over 3%.  Stocks rising.  Housing rising.  Unemployment at all time low.  Making deals after deals to bring jobs and companies back to America.  Willing to lower corporate tax rates.  Just had an overwhelmingly successful Asia trip.  </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that Trump is responsible for all this.  I&#39;m merely saying this is the current climate.  Good luck Democrats.  Trying to impeach Trump right now is at most, futile.</p>
