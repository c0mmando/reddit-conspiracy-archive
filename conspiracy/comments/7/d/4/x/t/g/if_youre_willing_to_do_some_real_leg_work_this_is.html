        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To provide a little backstory, I moved to LA for about a week, until I decided it wasn&#39;t worth it to pay 1400 a month for a shitty bedroom with no closet space. I lived in a nice area (Brentwood) but it still wasn&#39;t worth it. Anyway, to the conspiracy. I lived in a high-rise right across the street from a high-rise Chase Bank building. Specifically the one on Wilshire in Brentwood. The top maybe 10 floors during the day look like there&#39;s no windows until night the walls become translucent. Here comes the interesting part, on a Sunday night at about 11 o&#39; clock there was no one in the building. Except at the VERY top floor which had become translucent due to the windows at night, there was a table of about 12 people. Mind you sitting around a high end conference setting except with candles lit all throughout the room. So at 11 on a Sunday at the top floor of a Chase bank building, a group of people, meet and do something involving a dark room with candles. I had binoculars but they&#39;re shit, all I could see was what seemed like an important meeting of sorts. Seems theres a conspiracy a foot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Thank you all for this late night birthday celebration, I know we&#39;ve all been working so hard on the new account and the upcoming acquisition, there is barely time to even see our families, but you all still took the time to get a cake for me and light up all the candles an everything? aww geez, you&#39;re the best team!&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Some banker probably</li>
</ul>

<p>lol, but seriously, that would seriously catch my interest as well. my brother lives in a high rise, and i&#39;ve always wondered why it isn&#39;t more common to have a small telescope on your balcony. maybe just frowned upon? idk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was around the end of July if I remember. However I don&#39;t live there anymore. Just imagine being super into conspiracies and you see this. Almost wish I stayed, only to figure out who these people are and what there doing. Would&#39;ve been real investigative work and dangerous, but worth it. If anyone lives in LA, check this out, I&#39;ve provided enough info to figure out where it is. However the vantage from the apartments I lived at is unbeatable. Definitely some rich cult eyes wide shut vibe. Also who has access to the top floor of a Chase Bank building at 11 on a Sunday?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I found some new info, it&#39;s not only a Chase Bank. Since its a high rise it&#39;s also the Consulate General Of Lithuania and Croatia, which may account for the large number of Eastern Europeans in the building I was in. Also a JRK property holdings: <a href="http://www.jrkpropholdings.com">http://www.jrkpropholdings.com</a> </p>

<p>Also this private equity firm: <a href="http://www.caltius.com/equ_secondary.asp?pageID=7">http://www.caltius.com/equ_secondary.asp?pageID=7</a></p>

<p>As well as a Washington Mutual.</p>

<p>Thats all I&#39;ve found so far.
Now someone needs to stakeout and see if the meeting happens every Sunday between 11-12 at the top floor, then follow who ever comes out the building. There&#39;s also a helipad on the roof. </p>
