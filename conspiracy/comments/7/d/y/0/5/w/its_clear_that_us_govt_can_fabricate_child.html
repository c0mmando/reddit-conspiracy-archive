    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s the same thing as when during Stalin&#39;s time, they accused you of being an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;, an allegation thats impossible to disprove if govt presents proof, as there is nobody watching/controlling them - they are the ultimate authority.</p>

<p>literally anything can be fabricated, especially any online communication. if the govt says you wrote something in some online app or chat, and you didn&#39;t, there is no way you are going to prove you didn&#39;t. it&#39;s an insanely dangerous, sad situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good eye.  I&#39;ve realized this for awhile now.  It takes nothing to plant child porn on someone&#39;s device, computer, or hard drive, and is a nearly indefensible strategy to take down anyone or ruin their life.  Sexual assault allegations can be just as Machiavellian as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not just child pornography, they will threaten fake accusations about other things. The Turmp dossier is a very public example of what happens when you remain defiant.  But there are others.</p>

<p>Here is a former government employee who describes the process. She say it happened to her.</p>

<p>Start at 5:22 in the video
<a href="https://solari.com/blog/solari-stories-scandals-control-files-and-blackmail/">https://solari.com/blog/solari-stories-scandals-control-files-and-blackmail/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if you don&#39;t have a control file, you know I always encourage all of our subscribers to watch the movie Enemy of the State because it&#39;s a perfect example of, you know, Will Smith plays a totally clean lawyer in Washington and so he&#39;s got nothing in, his control file is empty, and  yet the intellegence agencies are able to persuade his own family that he&#39;s corrupt when he&#39;s not, his own partners he&#39;s corrupt when he&#39;s not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went through a similar process and so people are not only 
afraid of what&#39;s in their control file, but they&#39;re afraid of spending eleven years in litigation proving that there&#39;s nothing in their control file. </p>

<p>The entire video is pretty good. Here&#39;s more</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, it was several days later, I got called into the Secretary&#39;s office and he said, &quot;Have you found a way to do this?&quot; And I said, &quot;No. There&#39;s no legal way to do this. You can&#39;t&quot;
And he was, litterally - I have never seen a man that frightened in my life - he was scared to death. And I was sure just from watching him that he was under extreme political pressure and I believe blackmail. And he just looked scared to death. And I went back up to my office and one of my deputies pulled me aside and he said, &quot;You know you have to be very very careful&quot; he said, &quot;because you know there&#39;s real sexual dirt on the Secretary. So you have to be real careful.&quot;
...
That was the same time the Franklin scandal hit the Washington Times headlines.
...
We&#39;re literally watching a government that is being run by coercion whether it&#39;s the blackmail or control file or physical violence. If you don&#39;t do what you&#39;re told, there&#39;s really issues of physical violence now.â€‹</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s almost impossible to talk about. Nobody is going to believe a pedophile.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a guy who runs a Youtube channel, HuntingHarleys; he says that something like this happened to him. He talks about it in great detail in one of his videos, so you can see an example of how something like this might play out. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s telling the truth, or not, and that&#39;s part of the problem: once you are accused of this, nobody will ever trust you with anything, ever. I think this is the video where he explains what happened. He rambles on, but he&#39;s a fairly good storyteller, and it&#39;s worth listening to : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3EOjPrExM0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3EOjPrExM0</a></p>

<p>in MN the LaDue case involved some dude selling a 45 automatic gun to a minor LaDue (think Columbine or SHES) and also the same gun supplying dude admitted multiple counts of rape against a 13YO girl, he got <strong>ninety days concurrent</strong> for all offenses, he was going to be a prosecution witness in the LaDue case, but that collapsed due to the falseness/stupidity of the epic opus manifesto aka diary..</p>
