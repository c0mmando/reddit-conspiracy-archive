       SNL can go through its lulls when it's between stars, but right now I'm loving Kate McKinnon, and I've always been a huge Keenan Thompson fan. Plus they've got a pretty strong up and coming cast of young comedians.

       I mean, if you can't decipher the difference between a light weekend skit show and government propaganda, maybe you should get some help. I'm not sure that Kate McKinnon putting a wig on every weekend is the government coming for you.

       Weird post.  The people you refer to who need help are the people who can't figure out how to access entertainment outside of the free stations their antenna provides.

      <p>
       And those people are obviously too dumb to do independent research on anything.
      </p>

       So yeah, it's propaganda.  Doesn't have to be state directed to be so.  Just has to push false information as if it's real.

       Some things in life (especially in politics) are just funny, not everything in life is a conspiracy. I mean, it's pretty much been proven there was collusion between Russia and Trump, so it's not propaganda. Just because they're making fun of a person that you may like doesn't make it false. Are they ignoring or downplaying what's going on with the DNC? Yes, but that just makes it bias, not propaganda. There's a big difference.

       Yeah it's changed a lot...it's not the same anymore.  I can't watch a lot of the shows I used to watch.  SNL got bad awhile ago, but the virus spread fast over the last 2 years.  I've stopped watching maybe 5 shows I used to watch due to the same crap.  I don't watch a lot of shows either, so now I have like 2 shows I check out every once in awhile.

       Like I would kill for even the OLD John Stewart show (not Daily Show).  It's just LAZY resorting to mainly political satire, that's how I see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Living Colour and MadTV did a better job avoiding that pitfall and being a bit more original.

       Most of the show is garbage now, but most of the show used to be garbage as well. One time I tried to watch an old episode of SNL, and it was terrible. Back then you had the occasional good sketch, just as you have the occasional good sketch now, such as the hockey one from this week.

       See to me a big issue with modern SNL is that they don't know when the end the fuckin joke. Like it'll start out humorous (not even full funny) and then drag on until there is literally nothing left to be said about the topic. I mean fuck, get some more creative writers to come up with MORE jokes, not just stretch Armstrong the lame ass ones you got now.

       I agree! And the skit becomes worse if the joke is

        NOT

       funny, being hit in the head with the same stupid joke over and over again gets tiring. I just rewatch the classic skits and watch the new ones on YouTube.

       he usually murders it in frames and cyphers, and I enjoy the hell out of watching it. the Trump rap was pandering garbage that I thought he'd be above but he either went after a check and/or has a tenuous grasp on politics like most of the country.

       It still amazes me that this sub is so pro-government now. I mean it is so many people here shilling for Trump. Like I said above, this term Republican party is arguably the most powerful in American history. House, Seanate, Presidency, conservative Supreme Court, 33/50 governors, most state seats occupied at once by one party in American history. Conservatives are mad, but instead of actually getting upset with the people with the power to change something, they decide to get mad at late night talk shows and sketch shows. They act like they are being so oppressed by liberals. They always have to be the victim, no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually funny that they call liberals snowflakes all the time, but they legit can't handle criticism at all. Literally getting triggered by a late night comedy show doing satirical sketches.

       Yep. They feel like the government is screwing them and they don't want to take it anymore but somehow they got it in their heads that the solution is
       <strong>
        more Republicans
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        a New York businessman
       </strong>
       who will be the heroes for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that the real enemies aren't those in power who are screwing them, but "SJWs on Tumblr" and Hollywood and comedians. That's who's really hurts g them, not their governor, or the President. Noooope.

       Let me explain some very basic things to you or at least to anyone else reading. "New York liberals" and others who want progress do not hate rural people or the south. About 95 percent of everything good in your material life comes from educated urbanites who theorized and built nearly all of what we use and enjoy today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through the innovation and generosity of urban dwellers, the countryside and the south had been provided with so many things to make life easier -- electricity, internet, even farm equipment. Many of these things came upon research and funding of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody has ever asked those outside of cities who received these benefits to do anything more than pay a little bit in taxes. Yet, we, the city people, build the internet, invite everyone onto it and the first thing so many people do is
       <em>
        attack us
       </em>
       like we are enemies. No, we are not enemies. You are the enemies of yourselves. If you don't like city people, then give back that 95 percent of everything you use that city people made -- instead of trying to tear down civilization like the Barbarians did to Rome and the Huns did to Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the benefits we provide. You don't need to bow down and worship us. Just stop trying to tear everything down and things will be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you
      </p>

       See? That’s why people hate New Yorkers, because of that self righteous entitled “I’m the smartest person in the room” mentality. No one cares about you gave them they care about who you are. When they see a majority of the state turn blue for Clinton it’s safe to say the ideals are cucked.

       Not what was said. The facts presented were real. To deal with your question, no, urbanites are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       magically smarter than those other groups listed above. If those people were born and raised in cities, they would be more likely to provide the benefits described. It's not an inherent nature of people -- it is an aspect of a better, more productive environment.
      </p>

       Besides, even if I did say urbanites were "smarter," your response would be feelz over realz. :(

       Not trying to be a dick but what facts did you present in your original summation? You just pulled out a random percentage of things that urbanites supposedly created without any citation, how many of those in the city were born and raised in the country but moved to the city because that's where the jobs are located? Your logic is a bit flawed and your original statement regarding rural folks hating urbanites gave me a chuckle considering the general tone on reddit specifically when it comes to people from the south or rural areas is usually pretty nasty, I've read several comments spread throughout multiple subs on a pretty consistent basis stating that they wished rural people would just die or that they're useless, animals, uncultured etc. etc.

       I presented a commonly-known and plain true conclusion. You can say 95 percent isn't exactly right if you like. Still, it's a long story. Going way back -- things like numbers and letters, extensive languages, law, philosophy, science, even industrial farming -- all created in cities. It's not that city people are better -- it is a matter of both necessity and more minds cooperating. Take farming for example. In the early days, rural farms did not provide food for people. People in growing cities created advanced farming methods around those cities to feed the growing need. It's just the way it is.

       That's great. Since the information revolution spread everywhere, rural people have the benefits of modern society so they have the freedom to choose to move to cities and the skills to succeed there.

       In the world, we see those "red" county maps trying to claim that more of the nation supports those who want to deregulate society and consolidate business and assets of those with extraordinary wealth -- which is an anti-people, anti-democratic agenda. We, the people of the world, built society and made improvements. Now a majority of those in a minority of populations go out of their way to tear down our progress in all areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they often do so on issues of
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       more important
       <em>
        morality
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the cart before the horse. Those who would push to tear down progress want to tear down areas that they don't even live in -- areas that have traditionally benefited their lives. As I said in the first post, this is like the barbarians raiding Rome. An anti-democratic agenda implies means those people think they are more important. I say they are not.

       If 95% isn't exactly right then it's not a fact is it? It's an assumption, that was my point. Reddit is definitely left leaning (which is fine I have no political affiliation) and has a lot of users fromt he city, I don't imagine bots or shills are going to shit on rural people considering there are far more interesting topics for them to direct the narrative. I'm also not sure I've ever met anyone from a rural area try to tear down progress, obviously speaking anecdotally but what gives you that impression? Unless you mean in terms of progress in their areas, in that case I'd tend to agree, they don't want to become the city and I'm fine with that, who really wants some of the most beautiful places in the world to be littered with structural "progress" when it threatens the preservation of beauty? Your very analogy the barbarians raiding rome is just really off putting and demeaning if I'm being honest and perhaps why your original summation wasn't well received considering I don't disagree with you entirely.

       This difference between my claim and yours is that I didn't present it as fact so what's your point? Because people want to preserve their areas that makes them barbarians? No, I don't apply the term barbarian to myself or anyone else because it's a fucking shitty thing to say.

       Barbarians is the perfect analogy. Roman Empire traded with Barbarians, providing economic benefits and technology. Then, Barbarians raided Roman cities and played a big role in tearing down society and bringing the dark ages upon everyone. A loss-loss. That's what these rural (and other) reactionaries are doing today.

       Yea idk man after reading through all these comments, you’re kind of a dick. The technology that you seem to love so much is what is shackling people, what is caging society and consolidating radical view points. You put yourself up on a pedestal it seems, and yet TPTB are using the tech infrastructure against us, the innovative tech that you seem you and your city gifted to the poor people of rurality from the heavens. Yet the same tech forces disinfo and cat videos which further distracts from the issues at hand.

       Dafuq are you smoking, brother? City people built the internet? City people make 95% of everything good? Are you serious? At least 60% of that 95% of everything that's good is food alone, of which next to nothing is produced in the city. That fact alone should make you step down from your pedestal because we're all standing on the same ground here, friend. Or society or "civilization" as you so smugly appropriated for city dwellers is by its very nature a symbiosis of everyone involved, from city folk to country bumpkins. Everyone needs everyone else exactly in the way they are. "Liberals" need "conservatives" too and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disparaging SNL (Smug NY Liberals) is also not an attack on city folk or New Yorkers in general, but a stab specifically aimed at smug urban liberals, an archetype we find around the world, not even only in cities either. It's the kind of neo-progressive drivel that is filled with virtue signaling and yet largely devoid of moral certainties. SNL is just one of many shows that currently milks that kind of ideology for its ratings potential.

       If this is true, then read my salutation, which says something similar. It says "To That

       I’d might be able to stomach some smugness from an urbanite who actually developed one of those technologies, but it more often comes from a barista with a gender studies degree.

       I apologize that the nicest possible way of pointing you toward the reality of life could not be made even more polite. Let's just blame it on the mythological "gender studies degree," and keep tearing things down then. That will help. /smugness

       I live in the south and have a truck and a shotgun. No DUIs though. In fact the only person I know recently who got a DUI was a European citizen here on a work visa.

       Also if someone ever came up to me talking smack about my right to own guns and referring to themselves as an "educated urbanite," I would simply laugh at them because misguided fools like that provide us only with humor, not miraculous inventions.

       My point was that stereotyping people from NYC as "NYC liberal baristas with gender studies degrees who think they know everything" is as harmful as any other stereotype and gets us nowhere.

       No one refers to themselves as these things, we're all multifaceted individuals. There's more to each of us than a mask given to us by people who think we're their rivals.

       I predict cities won't be so useful anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       We needed them back when you had to have a physical presence to work with others. Now we are beginning to have options, as for example, with remote work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to live, in my opinion, is to use technology to connect, but live in the country or in a small town. Visit cities when you want to, yet not be required to live in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buy locally, know your neighbors. Grow as much of your own food as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my plan, anyway.

       Cities were the beginning of civilization. They aren't going away, but I"m sure there are lots of people who would move out and work through connectivity rather than commuting.

       I have to say I sincerely doubt, in that case, that you live rural. The portion of your brain that allows you to hit that 'save' button only one time seems to have been killed off.

       Hahaha, t_d lite is triggered.  SNL isn't a conspiracy, they don't hide their liberal beliefs, it's not a secret Illuminati group funded by Soros.  It's comedy, if you don't like it, don't watch it.  This thread doesn't belong in r/conspiracy.

       Tell me, what's the conspiracy here?  The only conspiracy is this subreddit has been taken over and no longer focuses on conspiracies, rather a bunch of alt right snow flakes bitching about Jews and the libruls.

       My point is that SNL has always had a liberal appeal to it.  They don't try to hide it, they don't spin it or claim to be apolitical.  It's pretty open about it's views.  And this isn't a new thing with SNL, it's always been this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they claimed otherwise, than yes, I could see it being nefarious with its broadcast.  We all have a choice with the media we choose to interact with.  If you don't like the show, don't watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in saying that, I do believe there is propaganda and I believe at times there is involvement with TPTB, but I think SNL is really just the product of the artists and writers and not a tool of the government.

       I find it hilarious that the same people will say snl was funny back in the day though. Even though it was slanted in the same direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I can remember the conservatives when I was younger laughing at our 'organic' food. And making fun of our hippie 60s/70s(90s) music. And calling us loser dope smokers(psychedelics too). etcetc. I could go on. And yet here we are so many years later and it turns a bunch of 'conservatives' kinda dig what we've brought to the table.

       Talking about discrediting the already discredited WikiLeaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upset about a sketch involving people of color doing a sketch in support of Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       And bitching about Eminem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trifecta of Trump supporter trigger points.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not a Trump supporter, please clarify why these 3 things upset you so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       WikiLeaks choose not to publish information about Russia well before Trump decided to run for president.  Assange has been using Russia as his plan b for freedom ever since Snowden took up residence.  I do believe he would rather complete freedom and but just freedom in Russia.  He used his platform to provide information directly to a campaign, not the public, in an attempt for his total freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Obama sketch played into Chance the Rapper's musical strengths, and provided another black cast member in which they could do a 90's style R&amp;B skit.  One of the last lines of that skit said something to the effect that they don't know anything about politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then Eminem.  The Trump supporters are upset because of his latest cipher where he came out in support of players protesting police brutality and explicitly told those Trump supporters that he was not one of them.  But his SNL performance?  His new single, Stan and Love the Way You Lie are about as political as a wet noodle.  He made absolutely no statements in any way.

       They literally did a sketch the episode before this one making fun of the Democrats for overcelebrating the couple races they won on Election Day, and for the fact that the strongest voices in the party continue to be people like Feinstein, Pelosi, and Schumer. SNL very obviously has a liberal bias but they aren’t afraid to make fun of Democrats either

       The last guy who tried to infuse meaning into SNL was Aaron Sorkin, and it didn't work too well for him. They're just people making jokes. That's it. There's no secret cabal of potential SNL writers being bred and trained.

       I don’t ever pretend to not be entrenched in the world view that posts like this are subsequent to divide and conquer from the top down. When a “side” in the Red-Blue narrows is chosen or implied, you bet I’ll call it out. Also, please reread my comment and yours and decide who is telling whom to shut up. You basically proved my initial inferences about who lets SNL get under their skin.

       first, i said pseudo-disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       at this point, i'd say its mostly a reinforcement of certain 'pillars' of culture. Obama is good, Trump is bad, etc. The entire show is based on 'commentary on the day', so by its inherent structure it gets to present a form of 'reality' that may or may not be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the 'pseudo'... if it were obvious, it would be obvious.

       Not quite, I've been a huge Eminem fan since I was twelve when 'my name is' came out. Nowadays, he's just another bought and paid for act like the majority of em. He should've retired about five years ago to be perfectly honest. But this shit with trump is such a pussy way at attempting to stay relevant. 
When it was bush in his sights, he actually was justified in trying to take on the establishment; he had passion, rhythm and flow. Now he has zero, non of that, nada! And much less fans after the whole 'drawing a line in m

       Dont you get it? Trump is triggering all the sjw's and many people in the media criticize him a lot so obviously hes fighting the establishment. Just ignore his actions like selling out the country to corporate interests and giving arms deals and support to authoritarian and repressive regimes all over the world including the saudis.

       Whoah dude who's thrown sand in your vagina? Yes mate I post there, how does that contribute whatsoever to my opinion on music? Yes what I'm saying is, towards bush he was justified but this hysteria towards trump has no foundations especially when he used to be friends with trump, even had a video of them together. Now all of a sudden he's anti trump? Nah mate, you don't change your opinion like that unless you're bought out or told what to believe. Kinda like you friend =)

       So essentially your argument is that his criticism of Trump is disingenuine because they might have been friendly at one point?  Trump and Clinton used to be friends too.  He donated millions to Hillary's campaigns and invited her and Bill to his (most recent) wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think that Trump's actions after being elected President might have influenced and perhaps altered Eminem's opinion of him?  People are allowed to change their minds about people you know... Well, maybe not if you're a T_D cultist where any and all criticism of the Orangutan Emperor is strictly forbidden.

       It's becoming less and less a place for conspiracy or skeptical minded people to join together and honestly discuss things hidden from the public, and instead it's becoming more and more just a battleground for partisan attacks and a proving ground for various targeted conspiracy theories.  Many of the comment sections are just people bickering back and forth.

       To be transparent with you, we are still not 100% certain that you are not a bot. Our analytics show that there are only a small handful of responses you tend to post on reddit -sometimes slightly different variants, but mostly the same. However, we detected enough of a variation that we suspect that it is possible that a human is behind your comments. Although, we strongly believe that even if a human is behind your comments, there is some direction, possibly from, Russian handlers, that is being received with a general script of talking points for you to stick to.

       Well, I think I mentioned this before, my paternal Grandparents family on one side immigrated FROM Belarus, so your "analytics" are right on target -

       Surprised you didnt include your "russian salad dressing" reference as well. In any event, we have been monitoring Russian activity on reddit, and they have gotten very good at a form of mind control. All throughout the election and continuing to this day, Russian bots and paid Russian trolls post on pro-Trump subs. The Donald is completely run by this element. What we have found most amazing is that the Russians have gotten so good at this, that they have been able to get actual people (not bots or paid trolls) to repeat their desired message  -sometimes so close to the original, that it becomes hard for our systems to distinguish between a bot/troll and a victim who has been subjected to a form of control. We believe that you likely fall into this category. I know you will resist this idea, and believe that all of your comments are the result of free thought on y our own part - but we have paid teams of psychologists, anthropologists, linguistics experts and statisticians, that can conclusively demonstrate that that people like you have essentially become unknowing, witless, spreaders of propaganda.

       You can make fun all you want. It is a defense mechanism. No one wants to face the truth that they may have been duped. You are not alone. Many people have were victims of this. Really spend some time on reddit and go over your comment history. Perhaps there is a script you can run that would simplify this task. If you do this, you will see how all of your responses are limited to variants of the same message over and over and over. Almost as if you are repeating a script. As I said before, the vast majority of pro-Trump redditors are either russian bots or russian paid trolls. What is so scary is how the russians were able, and the russian operation then was able to use aspects of their cold-war era mind control experiments, what they call psychotronics, to get people to essentially repeat their message as if they were on autopilot. They have been able to turn normal people into unwitting bots/trolls to the point where comments from these people are nearly indistinguishable from those made by bots/trolls.

       I don't even know what the conspiracy is. The have political sketches criticizing politics and politicians for decades. Also Wikileaks literally colluded with Trump's campaign and planned how they wanted to look "impartial".  Wikileaks kinda discredited themselves. Also, it's in New York city, which is overwhelmingly liberal. And everyone here keeps talking about how bad liberals are, when in fact, the Republican party is one of the most, if not the most, major political parties in the Westernized world. (The only major party on earth who denies Climate change)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Republicans have control of all 3 branches of government, have the majority of governorships, and hold the most seats at the state legislature level than any other party in American history, yet the right keeps bitching about how "libruls" control everything and everyone. Instead of taking a look in the mirror and thinking about who has the real power, Republicans decide to look to late night sketch shows like they have the power to draft bills and pass laws. It amazes me how they think they are always the victims.

       The only good thing about SNL these days is they have Kate McKinnon. She is funny as hell. Besides that it's just become an establishment "old" comedy program trying to cover for the baby boomer generation who still holds most of the power &amp; money.

       No doubt.  I don't like McKinnon sucking up to Clinton, but she is talented and funny.  The unforgivable sin is to be a partisan hack and unfunny, but McKinnon isn't guilty of that.  Alec Baldwin, on the other hand, is trying a little too hard with his trump impersonations.  They can make it a lot funnier if they weren't so heavy-handed.  Trump is already a caricature, it shouldn't be that hard to make a funny skit.
