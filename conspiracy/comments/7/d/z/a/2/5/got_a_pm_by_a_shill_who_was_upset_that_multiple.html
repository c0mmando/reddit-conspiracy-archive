       I'm not sure about shill.

      <p>
       I can't see a situation where shills would get paid to send private messages. There's no PR in things people can't see. They obviously don't care about creating fresh accounts as you can see be the fact most front page posters here are less than 6 months old.

First, I wanted to determine if the average person had a few year attention span. Since you know about them, that answers my question so I'm done here.

       A) I never called you a shill. You called me one. Multiple times. I just asked you to clarify the connection you were trying to make, and you just repeated the same thing three times, denied you repeated the same thing three times, and I was kind of in disbelief and expected you to edit your comments, so I copied and pasted my inbox but was too lazy to format.

       When he said "I've already got 3 pro Trump alts that constantly do the shit you do. That's how I know you." I think he's saying that he's monitoring 3 pro-trump alts, not admitting that he uses 3 pro-trump alts. It doesn't make any sense that someone running 3 pro-trump alts would be complaining about someone being a pro-Trump shill.
