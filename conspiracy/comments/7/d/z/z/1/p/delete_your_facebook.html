As a business owner you have the choice to support Facebook and their shady tactics or not. I replied because they claim to know no businesses that don&#39;t use Facebook. I am pointing out that there are many successful companies that will not support FB. You are obviously a hater and I am sorry that you cannot see outside yourself. </p>

<p>Being in the sub we&#39;re in, I&#39;m surprised people don&#39;t see the problem with this. It&#39;s a slippery slope. Once they have people&#39;s livelihoods relying on their platform, they can do whatever they want.</p>

<p>That&#39;s basically how i got behind the glass. Small band, indie label, distro went tits up and left us out of pocket for thousands of physical copies.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love a stab at the US. For the stuff i do (mostly indie pop/rock or [modern]vintage genres like soul/funk), the UK aesthetic sells. Unfortunately uprooting thousands of miles is not an option.</p>

<p>Depends on if what you sell aligns with their vision. They control their terms and can change them at any time. I doubt they allow just anyone to advertise on their platform. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a advertising marketplace that is controlled by one corporation. You don&#39;t see the danger in that.</p>

<p>You understand we&#39;re comparing apples to oranges right now. If you said that you need to use the NYT for the survival of your business, then we would be comparing the right fruit.</p>

<p>If you compared internet markiting to the other mediums than we would also be on the same page, but we&#39;re not. We&#39;re talking about business that NEED Facebook to survive. If you need one company for all of your business, than do you really own an independent business or do you basically just work for the company that your business is beholden to.</p>

<p>You and your industry seem to rely pretty heavily on it. I&#39;m surprised you run a business and don&#39;t see the risk there, but right I&#39;m just here for my entertainment. I can&#39;t wait until 99% of the entire economy is ran off 3 companies.</p>

<p>Yeah, but let&#39;s be real for a second; it also made us incredibly dependent on it, and thus it has made us vulnerable. Imagine reverting everything back to what we had before. Not gonna happen fast.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m not enjoying the flashy world of the 21&#39;st century, brought to me live on a plastic LCD. But will it be worth it in the end?</p>

<p>So, what, because we have <em>one</em> company developing electric cars we&#39;re all of a sudden saved?</p>

<p>Name me one industry that doesn&#39;t use oil in one way or another. Do you know how we get said oil here? Oil tankers and trucks, just to mention a few. A pipeline can only go &#39;so far&#39; (just see what happened when someone wanted to build a pipeline through syria, jeez...). What do these two ways of transport have in common? They consume what they transport. And not just consume, but you need it in almost all aspects of maintenance.</p>

<p>Not really a reliable method, right? It&#39;s a snake consuming it&#39;s own body for sustenance. Which is not sustainable.</p>

<p>Sorry to pop your bubble, but as nice as Mr Musk and his cars are, they&#39;re not the solution to our problem.</p>

<p>We had peak oil like, what, ten years ago? It&#39;s only gonna get more tense as we can see the end of the supply.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking resource wars, displaced populations and worldwide hunger from lack of supply.</p>

<p>Do you know how long your standard supermarkets supply can last, without refill? 3 days. So when the trucks stop, because the tankers stopped; you&#39;ll have 3 days before <em>everything</em> is gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what one of the creators of Facebook has to say about it:</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion or 2 billion people and ... it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other ... It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it&#39;s doing to our children&#39;s brains.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, ... was all about: &#39;How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. And that&#39;s going to get you to contribute more content, and that&#39;s going to get you ... more likes and comments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s a social-validation feedback loop ... exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you&#39;re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The inventors, creators — it&#39;s me, it&#39;s Mark [Zuckerberg], it&#39;s Kevin Systrom on Instagram, it&#39;s all of these people — understood this consciously. And we did it anyway.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-am-2508003126.html">https://www.axios.com/axios-am-2508003126.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats aweosme! I got into coding because I posted on gameshark forums about videogames and people were posting cool stuff with HTML so I wanted to do it too, once I knew a little HTML I started making websites about whatever videogames I was interested in and started learning about web design, graphic design, and how the internet and computers worked in general and it changed my entire life.</p>

<p>I feel like the way the internet has changed that sort of introduction into a technical education is lost for younger generations. You wont learn stuff like that from looking at facebook, instragram, snapchat, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad but many people simply do not care about anything except their own bubbles of happiness and ignorance. </p>

<p>I have one sibling that sees the world like me and two siblings that don&#39;t want to know what is going on in the world as long as it doesn&#39;t directly effect their little bubble of happiness. I had a discussion with them about this and they are self admittedly too selfish to care about humanity as whole as long as everything in their life is fine they are happy.</p>

<p>I love them but hearing that made me understand why the world is the way it is. They are decent people but they just can&#39;t be bothered or don&#39;t see a point in trying to make the world a better place or maybe they just don&#39;t think its possible.</p>

<p>But either way they think there is something wrong with me and my other sibling for being as obsessed about geopolitical events as we are.</p>

<p><strong>HARIRI DOES PARIS - THE TRUE STORY
It’s not that Saad Hariri was itching for a shopping spree at Avenue Montaigne.
French MSM is spicing up the steak tartare to oblivion trying to spin a foreign policy “victory”. Nonsense.
The true story starts in Abu Dhabi when Sun King Macron was having dinner with all-powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ) during the inauguration of the Louvre in the Sands (doesn’t it sound like a casino?)
What happened is that MBZ grabbed his mobile and secured a meeting between Macron and MBS for the day after. Easy; after all MBZ is MBS’s mentor – and de facto chief strategist.
Macron’s people had been trying FOR WEEKS to get a meeting with MBS. Zayed did it with one single phone call.
Afterwards, MBS threw a breadcrumb to the begging Macron; OK, you can meet Hariri and even take him away. But under certain conditions; French Minister Le Drian had to publicly scold Iran – which he did; and on top of it Le Drian cancelled his trip to Tehran next week to prepare the terrain for Macron’s own visit.
Talk about “French power”.
Additionally, Hariri WAS indeed kidnapped and under house arrest in Riyadh – as many of us reported.
He even begged for asylum in Amman, Jordan. Denied – because the Jordanians are essentially Saudi vassals.
The New York Times BURIED the info at the end of this piece:
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/%E2%80%A6/middleeast/hariri-france-saudi-le%E2%80%A6">https://www.nytimes.com/…/middleeast/hariri-france-saudi-le…</a>
“Mr. Hariri reached out to Jordan with a request to go to Amman as a safe haven, a Western official said. The request was denied, the official said, because the Saudis had pressured Jordan not to accept him. A spokeswoman at the Embassy of Jordan in Washington denied that such a request had been made.”
Who the hell wants exile in the land of King Playstation? Hariri at least is drinking good Margaux.
And the MBS Lebanon power play is an absolute, resounding fiasco.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet can be likened to the public world, i.e. the world outside your door. Facebook is a bar.</p>

<p>Out in the world, your anonymity should be in effect at all times. When you go onto Facebook, that same anonymity should remain in effect until there is sufficient for it not to be. If I decide to carry on a conversation with a bartender or a patron, I do not nor should I have to give my name until I feel comfortable enough doing so.</p>

<p>There is no reason aside from monetary why Facebook does not operate this way.</p>

<p>so instead now i curate the shit out of it and use it to &quot;redpill&quot; friends.</p>

<p>most people think im crazy, but considering how many p&#39;ms i get saying &quot;holy shit i thought you were crazy until....&quot; i get, its making a dent, however small that it is.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve long since given up on the idea anything i do or say is private, when my computer is listening to my every word to generate ads.</p>

<p>i do my best to keep it from being an echo chamber, but its really funny to go look at how little of it shows up in other peoples new feeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been Facebook free since 2012. </p>

<p>I was fed up with Facebook back then. From a technical perspective, the constant updates that were god-awful and destroyed usability and layout. </p>

<p>From a social perspective, it was just a bizarre pool of very weak acquaintances that you don&#39;t even really know or care about, posting inane shit like food and vacation pictures and selfies. And yeah, it&#39;s a system that is incredibly skewed towards feeding women a constant stream of attention that&#39;s not good for any of the persons involved. And the publicized personal drama.</p>

<p>And there are Orwellian concerns with the way Facebook controls and has access and sells your data.</p>

<p>That was back then, in 2012. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine the political postings, the clickbait, the fake news, the censorship, the advertising, the send-us-your-nudes-so-we-can-protect-you type shit that goes on today - And people still use this shit? I feel like the worlds gone crazy, and yet I&#39;m the one that gets funny looks when I have to tell someone &#39;I dont have facebook&#39;.</p>

As will covering your laptops&#39; webcam with tape, talking with everyone in person - as opposed to on your phone.  And while we&#39;re &quot;on&quot; your phone, you may as well stop taking pictures, or even texting, because all that is being channeled into a 500 billion Terribyte server.. for later.. when you get a speeding ticket, or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the beginning, skeptical users have seen the men and money behind Facebook, and the speculation are many.</p>

<p>Facebook has had a $ 13 million start-up capital from the venture company Accel Partners, which offers venture capital to start-up companies.</p>

<p>James Breyer, Accel,  has previously been in NVAC, the National Venture Capital Association, together with Gilman Louie in In-Q-Tel, another venture company founded by the CIA in 1999.</p>

<p>In-Q-Tel is known for working with various types of information technology and information collection, including so-called «data mining».</p>

<p>Breyer has also been in the board of BBN Technologies, one of the companies behind the development of ARPANET, or what we currently know as the internet.</p>

<p>In October 2004, Gilman Louie joined the BBN Board, together with Dr. Anita Jones. Jones had previously worked in In-Q-Tel, and previously served as Director of Defense Research and Engineering in the US Department of Defense. She was responsible for the so-called Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).</p>

<p>In 2002, DARPA established an Information Collection Office (IAO) aimed at collecting as much information as possible, as many as possible.</p>

<p>And the groundwork for an oil free future is already being set with company’s like Tesla </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what, because we have <em>one</em> company developing electric cars we&#39;re all of a sudden saved?</p>

<p>Name me one industry that doesn&#39;t use oil in one way or another. Do you know how we get said oil here? Oil tankers and trucks, just to mention a few. A pipeline can only go &#39;so far&#39; (just see what happened when someone wanted to build a pipeline through syria, jeez...). What do these two ways of transport have in common? They consume what they transport. And not just consume, but you need it in almost all aspects of maintenance.</p>

<p>Not really a reliable method, right? It&#39;s a snake consuming it&#39;s own body for sustenance. Which is not sustainable.</p>

<p>Sorry to pop your bubble, but as nice as Mr Musk and his cars are, they&#39;re not the solution to our problem.</p>

<p>We had peak oil like, what, ten years ago? It&#39;s only gonna get more tense as we can see the end of the supply.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking resource wars, displaced populations and worldwide hunger from lack of supply.</p>

<p>Do you know how long your standard supermarkets supply can last, without refill? 3 days. So when the trucks stop, because the tankers stopped; you&#39;ll have 3 days before <em>everything</em> is gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.. you&#39;re right. Stay on Facebook. Sounds like you fit right in.</p>

<p>I hope one day FB offers a service to all of its users where they can unplug from reality and hook themselves up matrix style to the FB world. Then the only people left walking around are people like me who don&#39;t want to put their entire life/reality on a platform owned and controlled by a toxic corporation. Gotta blindly accept all new technology fearing that you&#39;ll be left behind if you don&#39;t!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About half. But we&#39;re not talking about the internet, we&#39;re talking about Facebook. The internet is a medium with options to create a free market for advertising. Facebook is a company who has the ability to change their terms at anytime. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not knocking using Facebook as a fraction of your marketing plan so long as your business can survive without it.</p>

<p>If your business <em>needs</em> Facebook to opporate than you have a risky business model. There are people on this thread literally saying that they need Facebook to opporate their business. It should be hard to see the risk associated with that. You&#39;re beholden to one company, not an ecosystem of mediums like print, online etc.</p>
