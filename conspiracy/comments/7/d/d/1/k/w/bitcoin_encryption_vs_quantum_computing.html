    <div class="md"><p>Yes I also frequent both subs. It&#39;s ironic how it took so long for r/conspiracy to figure out that Bitcoin Cash is like <em>the</em> driving power to diminish the powers of evil in the world and enhance peace and prosperity, effectively reducing the overall ammount and impact of malicious conspiracy actions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to do via radio, sattelite and sms. But those options are fairly easily blocked.</p>

<p>So yes, we need to make the internet itself more censorship-resistant as well. Make the tubes better. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what Bitcoin is btw, it&#39;s pretty boring. It&#39;s kind of like really efficient tubes through which money flows rapidly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin is far from boring. Block chain has the power to revolution several industries. I kind of gather when you are talking, you don&#39;t really know what you are talking about. Rambling about censorship and tubes..</p>

<p>Like for instance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when I&#39;m talking about Bitcoin, I mean Bitcoin Cash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im not sure this statement makes any sense. I dont mean to offend or anything. Just sharing my opinion on why you are catching down votes .Because bitcoins are cash equivalents. So it doesnt make much sense to say this.</p>

<p>The currency is so new there is no guarantee it will even survive. While having issues that they tried to avoid moving away from bitcoin. Prioritizing transaction speed other decentralization is tricky. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>BTC is the real hard-fork. Not technically, but in spirit. Segwit was an insidious soft-fork and a radical departure from the original Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin whitepaper defined a digital coin as a chain of digital signatures. Segwit completely changes this definition. Therefore BTC is no longer Bitcoin, it is Segwitcoin.</p>

<p>At this point, it&#39;s only politics what is called Bitcoin. It&#39;s not really all that important though. Bitcoin Cash has proven itself to have some spirit, and its main contender, BTC, took a hit. BTC looked weak for a day, and the market noticed.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure BCH will survive. I predict a steady increase in rise for BTC and right now, a bleed for BCH down to the $700-800 level, followed by another spike upwards relatively soon thereafter.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll indeed see, but I&#39;m 90%+ sure the battle of the Bitcoins has already been decided internally. Most big Bitcoin players are fed up with Blockstream&#39;s BS. A lot of the mining power and some very big whales. It will be a very interesting Q4 2017 and Q1 2018.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Segwit got actived on August 1st. That&#39;s why Bitcoin Cash hard-forked away on that day, because the Bitcoin Cash devs and pro-blocksize increase miners did not want Segwit. They wanted to scale asap.</p>

<p>The overall point is that the spirit of the Whitepaper is completely violated by BTC Bitcoin. So yes, technically it is still called Bitcoin, but only by name.</p>

<p>The devs behind BTC:</p>

<ul>
<li>They crippled its blocksize (1mb now, Satoshi started at 32mb and we have run succesfull tests up to 1gb and 380gb blocks). Bitcoin needs to scale <em>today</em>!</li>
<li>They disabled much of the code. Vitalik Buterin was bullied away by the Core devs so he started Ethereum on his own. Initially he wanted to build Ethereum on top of Bitcoin. On Bitcoin Cash, he still can.</li>
<li>Segwit brings with it security risks. Also it&#39;s 50,000 lines of code extra, whereas raising the blocksize limit is 1 line of code.</li>
<li>Segwit brings with it legal implications. The digital signature may not be where it should be, with the future of smart contracts incoming</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh and Greg Maxwell, lead devs of BTC. I&#39;ve read much about him and seen some of his communication. He strikes me personally as sociapathic individual. Do your own research. But when he did work for wikipedia, he was widely regarded as being an insufferable bully.</p>

<p>This is really only the tip of the iceberg, man. There is a ton of disinformation going around about Bitcoin Cash. </p>

<p>The biggest red flag you gotta know, is that the Blockstream devs are funded by Blockstream. Blockstream got 76 million in funding from AXA bank. The AXA bank CEO is also the chairman of the Bilderberg group. </p>

<p>Yeah, think about that. Banks do not like Bitcoin. It erodes their ability to control currency by changing interest rates and <strong>printing money</strong>. And these are the people in charge of BTC right now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna push too hard. Just check out r/btc if you want to learn more. There&#39;s a ton of good people there and good info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respond to much online criticism when talking about the Bitcoin topic. It is often better to respond in an abrasive yet correct manner. But not always. I often do so because there is much active paid shilling going on to keep the original Bitcoin idea down. And I prefer to be strong, yet factually correct in my communication.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not always easy to discern the genuinely interested voices, such as perhaps yours is, from the malicious actors, at times. It was not my intent to end the transfer of information.</p>

<p>All I can say is, if you are interested in Bitcoin, read up on it. It&#39;s really cool and a brilliant invention, but at the same time, it&#39;s also a boringly functional thing. Like the internet.</p>

<p>Check out r/btc. You will find more interesting material there than on r/bitcoin, the subreddit that actively bans users daily simply for stating facts that do not lign up with the Blockstream narrative for btc.</p>

<p>When I say Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, it&#39;s because BTC wants to be a digital gold. But this is just ponzi-material, because Medium of Exchange <strong>always</strong> precedes Store of Value. Bitcoin Cash has both, it&#39;s like the Bitcoin from the year 2012. It&#39;s the only Bitcoin that&#39;s actually usable as a currency and it can and will scale to 5 billion users by the early 2020s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can it be a pump and dump if it&#39;s still 300% of what it was 10 days ago...? I&#39;ve heard the pump and dump argument before, but BCH was at $300 11 days ago, and right now it&#39;s still at around $1000.</p>

<p>Point out one factual incorrectness I have said before calling me a shill. Aside from $$$ predictions obviously.</p>

<p>I own a couple of coins. Bought BCH at around $700.</p>

<p>Oh and I do predict a price drop for BCH to around the $600-$800 level. I think we have support there now. BTC is still number one price-wise, but I predict in Q2 of 2017 we&#39;ll see a flippening. Prices will meet at around the $12,000 to $15,000 level.</p>

<p>BTC is essentially a ponzi right now. It promises <em>only</em> a store of value. But medium of exchange <strong>always</strong> precedes store of value. That&#39;s economics 101. So its value proposition is invalid, any other coin that does both is better. </p>

<p>Anyhoo you seem like you are also into crypto buying, I do of course wish you good luck with your coins. Any time money is involved, things can get heated. But the bottom line for me is that I don&#39;t want anyone to lose money. But I also want to make money. And BCH is the way this can be achieved, after hundreds of hours of research I&#39;ve concluded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I’ve read the short answer is yes, quantum computing has the potential to break most encryption including existing cryptocurrencies. The long answer is it’s complicated.</p>

<p>Personally I haven’t been able to get my hands on a quantum computer as they’re pretty much only available at major tech companies and major nations like China, Russia, and the US. I have however studied them as much as one can without actually having access to one.</p>

<p>As others mentioned, you could fork or update an existing currency to become more hardened to quantum computing but I’m not 100% sure this will work. </p>

<p>The more logical solution is to use quantum computing and develop a quantum blockchain and develop some form of quantum encryption leveraging quantum algorithms to create a quantum resistant system. What that would look like in practice or practicality I can’t say. </p>

<p>When it comes to cryptocurrency today the technology is a mere proof of concept in its infancy. Most cryptocurrency is 5-9 years old, and is technologically ancient compared to what is already in development and with the ICO boom and enterprise companies jumping into the blockchain space as well as advancements in machine learning their will be rapid development of new blockchain tech in the next 1-3 years or sooner. Crypto as we know it today is temporary, the future is about to get categorically unimaginable once you apply quantum computing into daily application.</p>

<p>P.S. As far as we know it was a quantum computer that even enabled Bitcoin to exist in the first place. Keep in mind it’s 9+ year old technology, and we’ve made major strides in both ML and quantum computing since then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fully agree, in fact this is already happening.</p>

<p>If someone did create a decentralized “cloud” quantum computer kind of like a quantum Ethereum you could potentially spin up access to quantum instances from traditional hardware. However, all the quantum processing would have to be handled by actual quantum hardware which of course would be fairly centralized at first. </p>

<p>I really don’t know when consumers will be able to get their hands on actual quantum computing hardware. Dwave systems is probably the closest thing I’m aware of and they pretty much only sell to defense contractors.</p>

<p>If there was a mining incentive for people to build and maintain a decentralized quantum computing system and the mining efforts could pay for the hardware eventually you essentially could offset the overhead cost to bring prices down and enable quantum data centers to be available to the public which would totally level the playing field eventually. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha yeah I’ve played around with these. They’re fairly limited and I don’t believe you can execute custom code beyond certain parameters. That’s not the same thing as having your own quantum computer in your living room and being able to hack it and run whatever you want. </p>

<p>There’s a few APIs from Google available as well but again fairly limited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh... not seeing what good an API is going to do you without hardware... As far as I know, google&#39;s only quantum related APIs are focused on translating current research technology into to quantum compute format. Something I have no clue about since I&#39;m not a science researcher. </p>

<p>If you are a programmer, on the other hand, the proximity of the processor to you has <em>no bearing whatsoever</em> to your ability to compute code on it. So I don&#39;t see why this would be a limitation, nor is running &quot;custom code,&quot; since this sort of thing is only applicable to people with strong computer science backgrounds who are used to seeing machine code anyway. That&#39;s pretty much what you get with IBM&#39;s quantum program, bare machine code. Except instead of binary bits, you get qubits. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it. It&#39;s no different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. Quantum computing isn&#39;t a magical key to opening up classical encryption. It does have the <em>potential</em> to be a much more powerful tool for breaking classical encryption, but i wouldn&#39;t say that it makes it obsolete. At least not yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quantum computers are extremely fast but have major accuracy problems and thus would not be good at cracking encryption. For example if you give a quantum computer simple computations such 2 + 2 the answer could end up coming back as 5 because that is the way quantum mechanics works where particles can exist at two places at once. Normal computers work in terms of absolute true / false but quantum computers work in terms of maybe and shades of gray. This would be useful developing a sentient AI but it wouldn&#39;t be very good at math.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 3 cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin: SHA256, RIPEMD, and ECDSA. Only the last one, elliptic curve digital signature algorithm is seriously vulnerable to quantum attacks. </p>

<p>The good news is that ECDSA public keys are hidden behind the public address which uses RIPEMD. So the keys to an address are only exposed to quantum attacks after the address has been used once. Best practice is to never reuse the same address.</p>

<p>If you want to get more r/conspiracy though, ECDSA was developed by the NSA and has a bunch of &quot;random&quot; constants chosen that some people believe may weaken it against an unknown class of attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe we’re actually agreeing just perhaps not using the same terms. </p>

<p>I agree Google’s APIs are limited.</p>

<p>As for IBM, they’re limited in Qubit capacity and you’re correct they only run basic machine code. There’s nothing else. You can’t for example go run an application to decrypt anything, or use them for mining cryptocurrencies or create a quantum blockchain. They’re just raw basic quantum virtual machines (are they even VMs? Containers?).</p>

<p>Unless you know what you’re doing you can’t really run much on them and they’re super basic in capacity of 5-16 qubits.</p>
