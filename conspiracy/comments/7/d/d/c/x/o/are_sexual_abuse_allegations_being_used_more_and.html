       minutes after seeing this Al Franken news, there's an outpouring of seemingly right-oriented people immediately jumping at the chance to attack Franken on a political level. The more these sexual abuse accusations happen, the more traction they get in the media (which is, of course, good, because sexually predatory behaviour should be brought to light) but it raises the question of ..Are people going to resort to this sort of attack for defamation simply because they know people rabidly consume it? the media loves this shit. just my two cents
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: i know this half assed post will get totally shit on. I'm not implying sexual abuse accusations are false or predicated on the intent to defame. many powerful people get away with awful shit.

       Still trying to find someone that carried their yearbook to work in the middle of the year to their job.  I'm also wondering if this was this person's yearbook from the previous semester or if she attended the only school I've ever heard of that publishes their yearbook before midterm.

       Idk but given our current political/social environment there's probably a good mix of call out culture and legit sexual abuse.

      <p>
       The issue is people believe the victim or people don't believe the victim. Extremes created to protect the egos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's people who use females as emotional/sympathy  props while ignoring the damage to females and the dismissive nature towards men.

       No basis for this but, i believe these sex scandals are going to flood the news cycles to really muddy the waters surrounding the pedogate stuff...  People will get sick and tired of hearing about the latest sex scandal between a teenager and politician/celebrity that they will pay less attention over time. Seems like there is an effort to focus on cases that deal with minors but not young children... almost normalizing the behavior or conditioning us to actually get tired of hearing about it. To the point that covering up a pedogate conspiracy would be much easier. Just my thoughts.

       Ive been thinking that these have been a placed distraction. Dont get me wrong, Im glad these people are getting caught, but these stories are sweeping the headlines while other issues are getting swept under as conspiracy. I would think that there would be somebody who a team of people behind making these the leading stories.

       I look at the facts I come across from every source and make my own determinations, the facts are not so steady in Moore's case, just look it up mate
