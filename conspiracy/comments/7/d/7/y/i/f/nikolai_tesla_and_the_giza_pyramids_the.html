Wide-Spread of Wireless Power
No pollutants left behind, no external fuel source needed, potential to bring an end to coal, fossil fuels, etc.</p>

<p>the region between the ground and the edge of space traps a great deal of energy.</p>

<p>Cosmic Rays (Radiant Energy) that supply the energy needed will not affect how the device performs, however, the abundance of Cosmic Rays varies from season to season, day to night?? Unlimited??</p>

<p><em>“cosmic-ray motor” Tesla designed, thousands of times more powerful than the Crooke’s Radiometer</em></p>

<p><em>Inspiration</em>
    Nikola Tesla created the Tesla coil which draws energy from zero point energy, which is the empty space around us, so as I sit here in my bed, the empty space around me has the power, if I were to inhibit its energy into the device we would invent as Nikola Tesla did, it has the power a function a watch, a remote control car, provide electricity to a  small village in Africa, or even New York City, the way the device works is the output of electricity is greater than the input of electricity to power it, hence creating free energy as you can loop it. Moreover, you can adjust the amount of energy you want to draw from the empty space (zero point) as it is infinite</p>

<pre><code>Nikola Tesla got his inspiration from the pyramids: We were taught in school that the pyramids were tombs for leaders, however, its not the case at all, these pyramids would actually power Egypt, the outer casing was limestone which has high insulating properties, which prevents the electricity within the pyramid from being released without control, the stone blocks inside the pyramid was another form of limestone, which contained crystal and metal, allowing for maximum power transmission, the floors were made of granite, slightly radioactive, which permits the air inside the shafts from ionization, so if you look at an electric cable, the conductive and insulation materials in the same way as the pyramids, where the pyramids stand there are underwater channels which rise above the limestone layers, spaces in between filled with water, these special layers of rock transmit energy upwards towards the surface AKA Aquifers, with high volumes of water passing thru the aquifers, it produces an electric current known as piezoelectricity, the underground chambers are granite conductors for the piezoelectricity, which then the electric current is conducted up the pyramids granite, an electromagnetic field then surrounds the pyramid converging at all four points at the base which is then transmitted into concentrated form to the top of the pyramid where a gold cap stone sits, gold being an excellent conductor of electricity, (Captsone no longer there on pyramid), the gold capstone facilitated a conductive path for the transfer of negative ions into the Ionosphere, charging the space around us. An identical form of this technology employed  5,000 years ago by the ancient Egyptians was used by Nikola Tesla
</code></pre>

<p><em>How was Tesla doing it</em>
He is directly converting ionized particles generated by radiant matter. Tesla Radiant Energy is directly converted to electrical power.</p>

<p>Tesla believed that the Sun generates highly charged particles and that radiant matter is a re-transmitter of energy, it is this transfer of energy that could be used for practical purposes.</p>

<p><em>How the electrically charged ions work</em>
Tesla’s intent was to condense the energy trapped between the earth and its upper atmosphere and to transform it into an electric current. He pictured the sun as an immense ball of electricity, positively charged with a potential of some 200 billion volts. The earth, on the other hand, is charged with negative electricity. The tremendous electrical force between these two bodies constituted, at least in part, what he called cosmic energy. It varied from night to day and from season to season but it is always present.</p>

<p>The positive particles are stopped at the ionosphere and between it and the negative charges in the ground, a distance of 60 miles, there is a large difference of voltage – something on the order of 360,000 volts. With the gases of the atmosphere acting as an insulator between these two opposite stores of electrical charges, the region between the ground and the edge of space traps a great deal of energy. Despite the large size of the planet, it is electrically like a capacitor which keeps positive and negative charges apart by using the air as a non-conducting material as an insulator.</p>

<p>The earth has a charge of 96,500 coulombs. With a potential of 360,000 volts, the earth constitutes a capacitor of .25 farads (farads = coulombs/volts). If the formula for calculating the energy stored in a capacitor (E =1/2CV2) is applied to the earth, it turns out that the ambient medium contains 1.6 x 1011 joules or 4.5 megawatt-hours of electrical energy. In order to utilize this high-voltage energy you must do two things — make an energy sink and then devise a way of making the “sink” oscillate.</p>

<p><em>Diagram of Radiant Receiver</em></p>

<p>This is a diagram of Tesla’s first radiant energy receiver. It stored static electricity obtained from the air and converted it to a usable form. </p>

<p><em>How it stores and uses the energy captured</em></p>

<p>From the electric Potential that exists between the elevated plate (plus) and the ground (minus), energy builds up in the capacitor, and, after “a suitable time interval,” the accumulated energy will “manifest itself in a powerful discharge” that can do work. The capacitor, says Tesla, should be “of considerable electrostatic capacity,” and its dielectric made of “the best quality mica, for it has to withstand potentials that could rupture a weaker dielectric.”</p>

<p>Tesla also refers to the ground as “a vast reservoir of negative electricity.”</p>

<p>In 1901 Nikola Tesla was one the first to identify “radiant energy.” Tesla says that the source of this energy is our Sun. He concluded that the Sun emits small particles, each carrying so small of a charge, that they move with great velocity, exceeding that of light (Infinite). Tesla further states that these particles are the neutron particles. Tesla believed that these neutron particles were responsible for all radioactive reactions. Radiant matter is in tune with these neutron particles. Radiant matter is simply a re-transmitter of energy from one state to another.</p>

<p><em>Radiant Energy System</em> (Cosmic rays form of Radiant Energy)</p>

<p>The radiant energy system is a self-oscillating capacitive system. Once it is set into oscillation, very little power is expended in keeping it going. Because it is an electrostatic oscillating system, only a small amount of charge moves through the system per cycle, that is, the coulomb per seconds = amps are low. If the charge is used at a low rate, the energy stored in the system will be turned into heat at a slow rate enabling the oscillations to continue for a long period of time.</p>

<p>*Special Coil Design (Many times more energy than the conventional Coil)</p>

<p>Tesla’s “COIL FOR ELECTRO MAGNETS,” patent #512,340 is a very special coil design because, unlike an ordinary coil made by turning wire on a tube form, this one uses two wires laid next to each other on a form but with the end of the first one connected to the beginning of the second one. In this patent Tesla explains that the double coil will store many times the energy of a conventional coil.[1] Measurements of two coils of the same size and with the same number of turns, one with a single, the other with a bifilar winding, show differences in voltage gain. These bifilar Tesla’s coils can be explained solely on the basis of their electrical activity. A bifilar coil is capable of holding more charge than a single wound coil. When operated at resonance, the distributed capacitance of the bifilar coil is able to overcome the counter – electromotive force (e.m.f.) normal to coils, inductive reactance.</p>

<p>Because of the electrical activity, a bifilar coil does not work against itself in the form of a counter – e.m.f., the potential across the coil quickly builds to a high value. The difference between the turns becomes great enough that the energy is practically all potential, at this point, the system becomes an electrostatic oscillator.</p>

<p>Minimal work is done in my radiant energy system due to the absence of wasted displacement currents. As small heat losses occur, oscillations are maintained by surplus charge generated by atomic catalytic reactions, energy is siphoned from the kinetic moments of these charges. Very low energy expenditure allows power delivery to an electrical load over an extended time period without an external fuel supply. After an initial input of energy from an outside source, the radiant energy electrical generator will operate as a very efficient device.</p>

<p>Aquifers = Special designed coil???</p>

<p>Limestone (insulator) = Atmosphere (insulator) </p>

<p>What we know so far….</p>

<p>Radiant Energy receiver needed to supply energy to capacitor, gasses in atmosphere act as an insulator for the electrically charged ions (prevents loss of electricity), plate catches radiant energy (refer to diagram) (+), while the device is in the ground (-), potential difference charges the capacitor (Made of the finest Mica and should be “of considerable electrostatic capacity&quot;), after a suitable time interval, the accumulated energy will “manifest itself in a powerful discharge” that can do work. <strong><em>Tesla gives various options for the switching device. One is a rotary switch that resembles a Tesla circuit controller, another is an electrostatic device consisting of two very light, membranous conductors suspended in a vacuum. These sense the energy build-up in the capacitor, one charging positive, the other negative, and, at a certain charge level, are attracted, touch, and thus fire the capacitor. Tesla also mentions another switching device consisting of a minute air gap or weak dielectric film that breaks down suddenly when a certain potential is reached.</em></strong> </p>

<p>Switch Needed?</p>

<p>Supply line feeds to Radiant Energy Reciever</p>

<p>But Tesla&#39;s &quot;solar panel&quot; is just a shiny metal plate with a transparent coating of some insulating material which today could be a spray plastic. Stick one of these antenna-like panels up in the air, the higher the better, and wire it to one side of a capacitor, the other going to a good earth ground. Now the energy from the sun is charging that capacitor.</p>

<p>&quot;The plate used to attract Radiant Energy should present large as well as practicable…the surface should be clean, highly polished and amalgamated.” - Tesla Patent</p>

<p>More Insulated, Higher voltage?</p>

<p>Surround Tesla coil in dome size “Plate” used for attracting radiant energy and storing it, bigger area/higher output.</p>

<p>Reasons for many pyramids; could only power so much due to the size of the “plate” or in this case, limestone.</p>

<p><em>From Patent</em></p>

<p>Rays or radiation of the above kind fall upon the insulated body <em>plate</em>, connected to one of the terminals of the condenser while the other terminal of the same is made by independent  means to receive or carry away electricity, a current flows into the condenser as long as the plate is exposed to these rays, thus an indefinite accumulation of electrical energy is present in the condenser.</p>
