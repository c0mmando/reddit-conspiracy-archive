<p>Y’all, this anon is EXACTLY correct. I’m sorry, but please do not include or reference me or anything I’ve said, in any further posts. <strong>I do not support anything outside of the ORIGINAL “Q” posts.</strong> Admittedly, I don’t know Q, I do not think I know this person and I can assure you, anyone who is implying or claiming to have the kind of access that Q does, would NOT say anything beyond or further than the original posts.</p>

<p>At the #130 mark of these threads, I started to notice an agenda-driven underbelly of a few ID’s that seemed to follow from thread to thread, purposefully injecting bullshit rhetoric into still valid, innocent discussions. Since that time, anons no different, credible, valid or “in the know” than any of the rest of you, started driving this conversation. Even coordinating OP’s to pre-create the next threads, right after a current thread had just been added.</p>

<p>OTHER ANON’S took it upon themselves to DECIDE FOR THE REST OF YOU, what THEY deemed valid, credible and “correct”. THEY have been telling and confirming to YOU, what is “TRUE” and “CONFIRMED” and sadly, THEY are NO ONE to do so... even worse?! Many of YOU participating every day/night, don’t even realize what’s going on. These people have taken it upon themselves, in some theorhetical name of “Q” and “truth” to attempt to “preserve” some “message” this Q person was giving (as conveyed and confirmed by them, without the rest of y’all’s input, don’t forget), on some quest to save the fucking world. They have actually justified the coordinated and orchestrated dissemination of disinfo in an attempt to keep you on “task”, “on the right path” all while convincing YOU, “you’re holding the line” and “containing” the nay-saying shills, even the many who have an innocently derived difference of opinion, or valid argument against something THEY’VE SOLELY DEEMED, “correct” or “confirmed”... </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/GrIaEuHL/order/asc/">November 15</a> 1 post in CBTS #360</p>

<p>For those who feel “meg” made sense, then I’d like to say this...</p>

<p>Know why I used to actually like this post that showed up in the better part of the first 130+ threads or so?! &gt;&gt;149565587</p>

<p>Because it USED to say, “-DISREGARD MEGAANON”. I LIKE that. I liked that YOU didn’t just believe and swallow anything you were fucking fed. I like knowing I had to work for shit here. I liked knowing you’d make educated, well-sourced and documented, verifiable, credible arguments and rebuttals. I liked that YOU were discussing these things in REAL TIME, and while yes, as a community, your anonymity allowed you to remove the traps of hive-mind mentality.</p>

<p>These last 200 “containment” threads are NOTHING MORE THAN HIVE-MIND driven propaganda. Whether “Q” is ever right, I’m ever right, it doesn’t even fucking matter because YOUR PURPOSEFULLY coordinates bared, manipulated AND injected SPIN, has TAINTED any validity or relevancy that credible posts or anonymous posters, brought to the board.</p>

<p>Those of you who took it upon yourselves to orchestrate this clusterfuck, thinking you’re all ”Kek’s” for doing so, as you pat yourselves on the backs, should realize you’ll never be anything more than the fucking shills and LARPs you accuse others of being. When this is all over and the unassuming are now aware leading y’all to make you ways back over to your normally frequented “trip” loving Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, etc. sites you troll for “information” on, please remember YOU WERE NEVER RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU’VE WASTED THE LAST 2 WEEKS OF EVERYONE’S TIME AND ENERGY ON. You were NEVER part of a solution... YOU ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE FUCKING PROBLEM.</p>

<p>I will never post in these fake ass threads about “Q” AGAIN, y’all. Know this so you don’t believe anyone claiming to be me. You’re being played and the longer you pander, longer you’re in the hive, oblivious to what YOU’RE MISSING. </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/NZ3XEuME/order/asc/">November 15</a> 6 posts in LARP SALT THREAD</p>

<p>Here’s the thing y’all... original Q is kinda no different than I am. I’m called a LARP, he’s called a LARP, potato, potado. Someone came on here as an “Anon”, made a few posts a few times and left. Simple as that. Who he is, what he does, where he’s been, no one knows. What the original Q said wasn’t all necessarily incorrect or wrong. In fact, I get a lot of shit for saying things some of y’all have said you already know. Posts like mine and like Q’s originals, aren’t meant as “breadcrumbs”, with efforts to “connect dots” for YOU. They’re meant for others.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t Q, or me, or anyone who y’all have ever considered a LARP on here, for that matter. The biggest problem with the last 200 threads is that since roughly the 130’s through 140’s, a group of fucking anons deemed themselves, responsible and accountable for being the authority on all things Q.</p>

<p>They took everyone’s equality of individuality as “anons” and purposefully made them and organized team. THEN, they created fake Q posts, fake trips, faked and pre-“baked” threads, etc. to push an agenda and narrative THEY deemed “right” and “correct”.</p>

<p><strong>Many of the links that the original “Q” made were correct.</strong> In fact, many of you should’ve already known and linked these things. Again, these weren’t necessarily intended for YOU, they’re intended for those on here that need the push. In many ways y’all act as “Q” when you individually and anonymously “connect the dots” correctly for others. The issue is not the mass, open and public discussion and thought sharing of individuals... that’s the POINT of the board and boards similar. The real issue with the CBTS is that a certain group of well-intended but horrifically fucking wrong individuals, took it upon themselves to instigate and perpetuate the intentional dissemination of made-up bullshit, sprinkled with legitimate fact, to get innocent people... </p>

<hr/>

<p>... desperate and already in search of truth and transparency, like so many of us, to not only join but tirelessly contribute to a hive-minded, agenda-based narrative, those outside of this little colluding group, had no real clue they were actually contributing to.</p>

<p>I tried to interject a few times when I felt like I could do so effectively, without being shilled to death. I tried to point out the Q parts that were already factual and why they were important, while also calling out the parts that were being purposefully created and injected, like ALL of the “trip Q”. Hell, half of those colluding to spread bullshit don’t even realize THEY were roped into it because even “trip Q” wasn’t the original Q. I realize I’m a shitty /pol/ poster. I don’t meme, I don’t know all the “terms”, etc. BUT, I NEVER lead y’all down 400 thread fucking rabbit holes over the course of 2 fucking weeks, dropping bullshit on purpose to distract you. I join already existing threads and post anything relevant that I KNOW I can contribute to. Nothing more, nothing less, take it or leave it. It’s what I always say. I never lurked or posted here for hive mind discussion. If I wanted that, you’d find me on fucking twitter and YouTube, I guess. Ever see reddit posting caps of shit I’ve said there, here?! No because I don’t post there.</p>

<p>Sad thing is this... if Q had any legitimacy to him, we’ll never know. So much had been missed on here the last two weeks it’s not even worth discussing anymore. It’s relevancy has passed.</p>

<p>Just remember, FBI, CIA and Fed will never look or function the same again (in a good way) when Trump is done. Anyone screaming a happening, has NO FUCKING CLUE, what’s ACTUALLY happening, let alone when. Anyone who knows a thing or two, wouldn’t be dumb enough to say it on here unless they’re on a one-hit-wonder post, incarceration or suicide mission. Trumps presser today was routine. You know this... </p>

<hr/>

<p>EVERY PRESIDENT recaps a foreign trip themselves, upon their return. It’s stabdard. It’s procedure. Does Trump like to be coy and mysterious in vague phrases, tweets, etc.? Yes! Does he use his OWN handle to say or convey things to you indirectly and directly? Sure does... it’s not like the media does him any favors, right?!</p>

<p>Most of y’all already know what’s real, what isn’t, what could be such and what shouldn’t be even considered, right? Stick to your individual, Anon guts, post what YOU think is real, what YOU think is fake, valid, credible, plausible, etc. and let your independently driven, generalized mass consensus, drive the conversations. Do it this way, all the time and you’ll only force these paid shill organizations to have to overstaff and work overtime.</p>

<p>Remember y’all, when 1,000 educated, well-informed individuals, freely and rightfully vocalize their OWN opinions, formed on facts, valid sources, credible information, etc. you’ll eventually come to a consensus and conclusion, that reflects the individualized contributions of the overall mass. When individuals independently contribute to the greater mass, it creates a far greater, stronger more powerful and impactful movement than hive mind, mentality.</p>

<p>Know why it’s actually easier to red pill people than you might think?! Because even as Mockingbird shows you, when people in masses are told something repeatedly and redundantly, sure after a while they’ll go along and say they believe it, but in reality, unless they’ve actually researched it, educated themselves on it, have a vested, inquisitive interest or concern in it, etc. for whatever “it” is, they don’t care either way. They’re not married to the answer they’ve learned and regurgitated in the hive. They’re not vested in it, they’re not committed to it. They don’t give a shit until you ask them to explain or support the reasons they believe whatever they’re saying...</p>

<hr/>

<p>Can you give me an example of an Anon ever on here, not on an arrest or suicide mission, who’s actually given y’all something as substantial as you deem a “happening” like you’re looking for, where what they said would happen, actually happened, during the exact date/time they said it would happen, just the way they detailed it would?!</p>

<p>I’m curious because I’ve been here for the better part of 3 years and I haven’t seen a fucking thing. I’m just genuinely interested in what I’m missing that y’all have apparently witnessed first hand and consider legitimate.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The same people who believed someone posting on here nicknamed “Q” was fucking posting “secretly” taken pictures out of AF1 windows, during active cruise time, are the same people screaming fucking LARP when someone with legitimate shit to offer, might actually do so, without selling themselves or those around them, down the fucking river to do it.</p>

<p>Those are the people you should be concerned about and suspicious of.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anon: &quot;Q is a LARP and you&#39;re not fooling anyone anymore douche. The more you guys push the more people wake up the Jewish control over us. Don&#39;t you get it? There&#39;s a fucking reason Jews have been expelled 110 times in 2000+ years. The problem is the Jews and nobody else.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ll wait brah, do you really think it’s just that simple? I’m genuinely asking. I agree, (((they))) have an undeniably, historically proven, huge role in all of this, but if you stop there, without giving credit where credit is REALLY due, you’re missing the biggest picture, which will allow (((them))) to continue, for hundreds of years to come.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/Zc%2FkCIgG/order/asc/">November 15</a> 6 posts in Megs, the FLOOR is yours... </p>

<p>Ha! I was scrolling through Roy threads and saw this as I scrolled right by thought, “that looked like my shitty tile”. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Umm, who is that? Why do y’all keep spreading bullshit like this?! Like whoever said I was Huck Sanders?! KellyAnne? It’s dumb... </p>

<hr/>

<p>The initial threads on the first Q Anon were interesting. But sadly I realized the threads had been spun and tainted with bullshit on purpose by a group of anons who deemed themselves to be some self-nominated patriots of the thread and they ruined it all. I posted about my discontent earlier and I’m upset for those who were innocently unaware they were contributing to a massive thread that was purposefully turned into a LARP, by those who choose to LARP in a name of “containment”. They’re still doing it, creating those CBTS threads, now trying to be blatantly obvious as to their explanations of why they did what they did. It was a bullshit experiment and it still is. I can’t even understand how anyone is reading the shit these people are posting and blindly swallowing it.</p>

<p>They’re not helping anyone. At this point, they’ve made it too much fucking work to actually confirm what came from Q, what was their concocted bullshit, etc. Half the “answers” to Q references they’ve deemed “confirmed” as “correct” on the spreadsheet are actually wrong so I got pretty tired of watching it all happen.</p>

<p>Too many things are actually happening right now and they’re important yet being missed. I can’t take the blind hive mind. I’m more pissed about the innocent people who came here and had no clue what was going on within the threads. People are really being caused to stress and worry on such an uncalled for and unwarranted degree.</p>

<p>A majority of the actual Q posts are fantastic. It’s a shame these idiots ruined the whole point of it all. I don’t want to be associated with it anymore. </p>

<hr/>

<p>[ <em>Now she&#39;s asking a Canadian anon about me! Help! Scared, Todd is scared! No, I was not in that thread!! Please leave that leaf alone! Also, I don&#39;t think you are Hope!!! I mean you are hope but not that Hope and you&#39;re certainly prettier than Hicks!!!</em> ]</p>

<hr/>

<p>I wonder who that good brah Todd is?! Like Todd Whiskey or something?! Is he in this thread?! Todd, you here boss?! &gt;&gt;149619065</p>

<hr/>

<p>I’m not Hope, can’t hook you up.</p>

<p>I don’t know what your role is. I don’t come here to dictate roles, though yes, I do like to encourage things that could help, for those who ask. I think everything y’all have been doing (pre-CBTS) is fine, no?! Isn’t it why people with things to say might wanna come here, in the first place?! Why are y’all so eager to bend yourselves when just doing what you have been doing, is probably what brought people here and compelled them to “help” in the first place?</p>

<p>I think sticking it to the MSM is great. You keep them on their toes. “Citizen” info researching, archiving, sharing and discussing is great too! Keeps the real “investigators”, on their toes and forces them to answer your masses. I think talking about these things you question with your families, friends, neighbors, etc is great! It’s your freedom and right to do so and it shouldn’t be stifled or threatened. Silence is scarier than hard, well educated conversations. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Let me say it again, when I say or imply, “falling for”, I’m not talking about the Q directly related, initial posts. Whether a LARP or not, it doesn’t matter... the content IS mostly true and you can fact check and source it all via already publicly documented and accessible resources and materials yourselves. You didn’t need Q for that. In many ways, you don’t need me for that, either. The problem that’s frustrating which compelled people (like me) to post on here for instance, is when you see 10 separate threads on 10 different topics at the same time, all related and no one connecting the dots between.</p>

<p>This is how these citizen-driven investigations start to die out. People get so driven into one specific thing, they don’t pick their heads up until another “happening” happens. The research and documentation is great and needed, but if it doesn’t get y’all anywhere, what’s the point?</p>

<p>It’s like every time everyone gets all wrapped up in another thing, they realize 3 weeks in that Pizza, trafficking, etc. ties in. Uh, yeah! It does. Dig enough into all these things and you’ll see all the same names, same agencies, departments, directors, congressmen, etc. for decades, or their plucked and groomed predecessors. The swamp is dirty, it runs deep and in reality, it doesn’t take many to keep it churning.</p>

<p>I don’t know what else to say... </p>
