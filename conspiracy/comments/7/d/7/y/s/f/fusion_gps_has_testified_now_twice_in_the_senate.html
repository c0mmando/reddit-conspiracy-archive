        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">83</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/tefvik_arif.html">tefvik_arif</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today, Glen Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS testified for 6 1/2 hours behind closed doors in the House Intel Committee. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-15/founder-of-firm-behind-trump-dossier-is-said-to-vouch-for-it">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The House Intelligence Committee has yet to decide whether to release a transcript of Simpson’s testimony, and his lawyer, Joshua Levy, said Wednesday, “I hope that it does.”</p>

<p>The top Democrat on the panel, Representative Adam Schiff of California, called Simpson’s one of “the most productive interviews” of witnesses the committee has conducted so far. “I think we learned a great deal from him,” said Schiff, who declined to discuss specifics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This now marks the second time Simpson testified under oath in congress. The first time was at the Senate Judiciary Committee back in August, where Simpson testified for 10 hours and again publicly asked for the testimony to be released.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/22/congress-investigate-fusion-gps-simpson-241924">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Josh Levy, Simpson’s lawyer, said after his 10-hour testimony on Tuesday that the opposition researcher, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, stands by the dossier. Levy also said that Simpson declined to disclose the identities of the clients who hired his firm to investigate Trump.</p>

<p>But in a statement to Maddow, Levy suggested that the Judiciary Committee can release the transcript without review.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess everyone&#39;s question should be, why are these committees refusing to release Simpson&#39;s testimony, even after Simpson&#39;s lawyer has stated publicly several times that he wants the testimony to be released? What is being hidden in these transcripts?</p>

<p>Look at the Podesta Group and their fate...</p>

<p>Fusion was working on behalf of a foreign power to lobby against the Magnitsky Act, and I would bet they did not comply with FARA.  More trouble is their relationship with Natalie Veselnitskaya, who may be a direct connect to the Kremlin. </p>

<p>It would seem that there is a good chance that their main staff all get indicted</p>
