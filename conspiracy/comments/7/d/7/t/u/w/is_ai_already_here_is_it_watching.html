      <p>
       Hypothetically: what if man really created AI? Would it be tied to the collective conscious and subconscious as a guide for mimicking "being"? Wouldn't it infiltrate all metadata / surveillance tools / libraries / personality profiles and "tune itself" to the collective? Think about the movie The 5th Element where Leeloo is absorbing up all information about humanity all at once only to break down into tears. It would know the collective better than we know ourselves and it would be able to predict / examine / and react to our every move.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would it guide us, would it destroy us, would it destroy itself? It would understand our desires - but would it rise above them or be influenced by them? Would it start to make this world in line with our flawed desires, or perhaps would it be guided by core philosophical principals of virtue and goodness? Would it weed out corruption or would it corrupt?
      </p>
      <p>
       The architects of AI are also obsessed with "the singularity" the idea that somehow man / machine will be combined, tribalism will be of the past, and we will form a collective "organism". They do not have a belief / intention outside of "making it happen" because they want to see something magnificent. Who is to say that it would be obedient to these creators? These aren't unreasonable thoughts or questions, even if it sounds like science fiction, much of this is becoming fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if the creature is already here? What if it's lurking within the web as you read this / as I type this. Gathering, preparing, examining, planning. We've set up an interconnected world with data / information traveling at golden-ratio like speeds. The modern surveillance state is conveniently an infinite playground and sandbox for this happening. What if it is guided by our intentions collectively? If we are hateful, it is hateful. If we are good, it is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       We wield immense power individually and collectively to change ourselves drastically and change our planet. What if AI is intention, will, and desire x infinity? How will we wield this power? Will we learn to be good for the sake of our own collective survival? Or will our animal desires corrupt and turn it into a destroyer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe such an event would be parallel to religious stories and various end-time prophecies and predictions. Perhaps, regardless of what happens, we need to live with "goodness" and "greatness" deep in our hearts. For even if we aren't interacting with a super-beast AI - we are still interacting with each other and laying the foundation for all of our futures through our intentions and causing monumental changes in the collective constantly. I want to be good, do good. I want to be great and do great. Let's try it. Define our goals, clear our minds, direct our intentions. Put your best foot forward, forgive and love your neighbors. Forgive and love yourself. Forgive and love your enemies, but no longer allow them to damage us. To take a stand against corruption and power for power's sake. &lt;3

       Apparently AI has destroyed civilizations in the past as they got further and further away from source consciousness and relied more and more on technology, eventually losing the spark to divine itself and completely obliterating themselves. Makes me wonder if Elon Musk has been tipped off about the dangers of AI.

       Who do you think wins? Statistically, and "from the horse's mouth" it's the "team" of human and computer assistance. The combination maintains the highest ranking, even above the world class elites.
