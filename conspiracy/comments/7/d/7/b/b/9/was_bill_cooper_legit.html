<p>I recently watched his unedited interview with CNN from 1992.  I liked a lot of what he was saying.  </p>

<p>My question is this.  Was Bill Cooper doing his job and sharing info the NWO wanted to be shared or was he an honest to god martyr for the cause? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to passively accept the narrative that &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; was a forgery until a read a book called &quot;Waters Flowing Eastward&quot;. It provides pretty airtight evidence that the document was <em>not</em> in fact a forgery, and was written by a radical Zionist named Asher Ginzburg. </p>

<p>Ginzburg was never anything more than a fringe figure. So the Jewish community could have done one of two things: 1) Distance themselves from Ginzburg&#39;s raving ethnocentric writings, or 2) Attack the messenger and claim that document was fake.</p>

<p>They opted for method 2. But the more you fact-check the self-style &quot;debunkers,&quot; the more you realize that the &quot;debunking&quot; never actually happened. </p>

<p>&quot;Waters Flowing Eastward&quot; walks you through the alleged &quot;debunking&quot; and shows you how it falls apart when you go back and examine source documents.</p>

<p>Long story short: Yes, &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; are almost certainly legitimate. But, no, it was not endorsed (or known-about) by 99.9% of the world&#39;s Jews.</p>

<p>Cooper, by the way, is right in thinking that the whole &quot;Jewish issue&quot; is a red herring.</p>

<p>Jews are front-people. Low-level errand boys.</p>

<p>Though it&#39;s true that, at the highest ranks of global power, you have a handful of Jewish names. But those power-brokers have never been particularly religious or interested in Judaism. It&#39;s why Israel always has to hustle to make money.</p>

<p>If Rothschild was really backing them, why wouldn&#39;t he funnel some banking funds to Israel? Why are they constantly sucking up to the United States and panhandling?</p>

<p>The reality is: Many of the most powerful people (who happen to be Jewish) don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass about Israel or &quot;The Jewish people&quot;. Look at George Soros trying to collapse it. Or the many people trying to bribe them to leave the Middle East (with a million dollars for each citizen to relocate to Arizona), to stabilize the oil corridors of the region.</p>

<p>Israel, as it exists today, was a British outpost in the Near East. It was created by the Brits.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no more authentic than the &quot;Arab pan-nationalist&quot; movement that was created in London during World War One, to unite Bedouins against the Ottomans to collapse their empire.</p>

<p>Arab pan-nationalism was fake. Just as early 20th Century Zionism was.</p>

<p>Students of history are well aware of how rival empires fought each other by creating fake &quot;ethnic movements&quot; to destabilize enemies. Like the Russians creating the pan-Slavic movement in the Balkans in the 19th Century to take down the Ottoman Empire, as well.</p>

<p>All these movements are synthetic.</p>

<p>Hell, they&#39;re still doing them today with George Soros funding the Chechen separatist movement in Russia, or Black Lives Matter in America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still listen to old Hour of the Time broadcasts and one thing stood out to me that I think is timely for this sub.    While the Franklin Scandal was unfolding he said on air that he was receiving lots of info directly from victims and didn’t know what to believe, therefore having to write them off.   He said HW Bush was readily accused as the ringleader and he found the claim incredible, plausible too, but unfounded so he didn’t want to make errant accusations.</p>

<p>Those were his sentiments at the time.    </p>

<p>Just something to consider.</p>
