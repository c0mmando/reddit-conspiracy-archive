       I think if we can get the masses to at least understand the basics of their scheme, then we have a better shot. Arguing amongst ourselves regarding political affiliations and DC rhetoric isn't going to a change anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all seem to agree that the system in place is largely corrupt and only benefits a few at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites use their left right dichotomy to blur and conceal this simple realization;
       <strong>
        The world's wealthiest people convene in secret and hoard the resources for themselves, and the politicians are merely a display for the peasants
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire lower/middle class needs to realize this, unite, and organize against the elites, and it can be done. This is our shot.

       That would still be better than a worker's revolution run by the lowest IQ segments of our society, Marxists pretending to be anarchists so they can recruit children that want to be edgy and piss off daddy.  Then while little Gordy gets his anarchy tattoo he can memorize Marxist talking points and educate us all about the proletarians and explain the platitudes using the exact same terminology we have all been hearing from 17 year old LARPers for decades.

       "ANARCHY!" Shouted Bobby, as he drove the wrong way thru the closed Burger King drive thru. Bobby was feeling very proud that he snuck out of his parents gated community and after this daring Burger King stunt, little Bobby was considering buying a forbidden monster energy drink with the coins he pilfered from mommy's change jar.

       It's that or pay their wages while they find a new job. What is the community around them going to do, with all these unemployed factory workers?

      <p>
       The payment comes from the renegotiated contracts from the demand that would have supported the overseas plant. Why were they moving the plant overseas, just to cut costs and hurt the worker? Nah, make the customer pay, a rise in value should be passed onto the workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, what is the community going to do with all these unemployed factory workers? What is the province/state going to do for their people? How does the nation provide them with something else, a new job stream? It's not just a problem for the worker, the neoliberal ideology leaves people behind, TPTB leave them to rot. How is a town to survive if its main economic driver leaves? Where do these supplies come from?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they come from inside the state, then it should be less of a problem, outside, yeah a bit harder.

       I feel like you're confusing me for an Authoritarian Collectivist. But, no, I don't think the farmers should be forced, it should be in their interest to show solidarity with the factory workers. If not, well a state that will starve factory workers in a workplace occupation is evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       You like evil states? Cruel countries that look at a workplace action and decide to murder them?

       IDK, diff workplaces have seniority roles, but also it can be a rotating job since no one wants it.

       Maybe a definition of the players.  Like The U.N.. And each Nations particular Leaders and how they connect to each other.  The core of this structure is families, and global enterprise/ conquest.

      <p>
       Has this even been done? Think of a family tree that starts about 4000 years ago.

       The world is already under a 'one world government'. It's laws are via treaties and the laws of commerce. So many people are chasing their tails with this one. You need to understand this and accept it in order to play parallel in their game. You cannot take the elites down however, there are things we could do. Learn international law and commercial law. Everything is based on the laws of the sea and commerce.

       No, they are still working toward the ultimate goal, which is total control over every aspect of our lives, and a single global currency. They also wish to merge countries into unions.

       Real talk - what is the future of humanity if we keep on going? Isn’t it an idea of one big country, we’re all in it and we can all travel freely and if there’s still currency then it’ll be universal?? I️ get that if the current people with all the money continued into an omniscient global cabal it would suck - but why is the idea of one set of rules equal to all humans such a bad concept? If technology provides stable living environments for all peoples one day, would we still want arbitrarily drawn countries? Won’t current religion and ideologies and nationalism die off if humans stay alive another hundred years or two? Seems like they’re on the way out anyway.

       YES. WORD. I'm also enjoying all the speculation around Q and Trump, but we need to realize that, even if there's truly an effort to undo the money slavery, it might fail – or might be replaced with something worse if they're either part of that ruse or get knocked-off before it can be realized. My inner jury wants to be hopeful about this, but that can breed a dangerous complacency. Thanks for your post.

       Obviously what’s going on is elementary simple. By putting opposing views against one Ana other you guarantee that extremes on both ends will double down for their sheepish beliefs. After this, those more moderate voices will be left with the terrible choice of agreeing or going against what they view as their group. Obviously the easy route is compliance. Once the extremes and moderates have been involved their is nowhere noble for the WOKE crowd to dwell. As terrible as loud voices arguing a point are, there is clearly no platform for quite valid arguments at this point.

       Is it even possible to create a party specifically for the middle ground fact-oriented group? I think practically no but do so hope it could happen. A government party that fights against stays quo first and foremost and then stays true to their beliefs no matter how much noise there will inevitably be from the soapbox mainstream media polar ends of the spectrum. As unlikely as it is, I would be proud to be a part of it and as the fallacy of pseudo important social media opinions is exposed more people could be enticed to join. An avalanche starts with a small slide but the unstoppable will of gravity inevitably picks up reinforcements and gathers momentum. This is how I see a change happening. With the founders expecting to be written off as pariahs but continuing to fight the good fight.

       God bless, not the USA, but humanity and all that we can accomplish when righteous folks band together to create something which we all instinctively know is right. Join me, humans and let’s thrash and expose this poorly fabricated reality of “right and wrong.”
