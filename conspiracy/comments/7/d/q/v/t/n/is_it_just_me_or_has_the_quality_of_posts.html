       Just saw a post where some guy found a random picture of a notepad with bullshit equations on it.. and haven't seen anything higher quality than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has there been anything good I've just missed? All the posts trying to tie it to Saudi princes seem like bullshit.. there must have been someone who's posted something and actually put some effort into it, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are we giving up? I mean.. I'm not, but it seems LARPing is taking over at this point..

       because they've maintained absolute silence. it's there only strategy. somebody fucked up big time on this operation and their best bet is to remain silent so we don't figure it out. really our best bet at this point is probably some of these lawsuits in action against MGM that will force Jesus to testify, and evidence to leak. Not saying play the waiting game in the meantime, but, not much to go on. Suggestions are appreciated.

       If you go into my post history, I made a pretty high effort post about how Campos had a lot of least leeway. I tried reposting it when I was drinking recently, and got a much more negative reception (although the quality was likely lower from editing while drinking).
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen anyone talk about the 60 minutes interview sheriff Lambardo did, when he didn't have FBI guy standing over his shoulder. It had more discrepancies than any of his previous press statements..
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously someone fucked up, obviously that's why they went dark..I just feel there's enough evidence to figure it out, but it's being tainted by trying to tie it into random shit like Saudi princes.. basically low effort posts are making it more difficult.

       Yes, random. Not everything that happens around the planet can/should be tied to other random shit around the planet. That's the kind of illogical thinking that gets conspiracy theorists in trouble, rather than looking for patterns, they randomly pick something and call it a puzzle piece. That's not how it works.

       because it's a glaring discrepancy that doesn't often happen at this magnitude; and if exposed could garner positive change in the world.. maybe that's why? who the fuck cares if TPTB move on from a subject.

       It’s rhetoric; of course we need to dig into this. There is so much that doesn’t add up here, but it literally has occurred 100 news cycles ago and no one cares. In my opinion it could be the JFK of our time.

       I think someone compared two videos that don't seem related. But, I'm tired and drinking, and that video seems like a low quality effort to be relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was trying to exploit this, i would also use videos and make a low quality intro/extro to get views. But I'm not trying to make money off of this, I'm just simply looking at the facts, and ignoring people that sell out for money.

       First you shouldn't attempt to paint me with such broad strokes. I don't mock all conspiracy theorists. I only mock some. Also, I don't defend msm so much as I don't demonize it like others here. As for ole' Wolfgang Halbig, I don't know much about him, but what I am researching suggests that the guy is a complete crackpot. But, if you have video interviews with the townspeople Newton staying that the shooting was a hoax, please share because although I don't believe  in your theory, I still keep an open mind.

       I should paint you with broad strokes because you come to this sub as a professional "debunker".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious when you dismiss any source out hand if it is not a big recognizable 3-letter mainstream organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make an unreasonable argument that unless we have personally gone to the location and spoken to the people who live there, that we shouldn't form an opinion.  In other words, you are mocking all secondary research.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you want primary research, which Wolfgang Halbig has done.  You say you don't know much about Wolfgang Halbig (so you yourself have not done any research at all on the topic), yet at the same time you also arbitrarily claim to know he is a complete crackpot without giving any reason or evidence why.  So you mock primary researcher for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is so obvious you are only here to discredit conspiracy theorists.  I would say you are that which is protected by Rule 10.

       Lolz, I'm a pro debunker now? Awww, shucks.  That's kind, but I'm still just an am. I appreciate your encouragement to turn pro, though. I don't dismiss any source that doesn't come from the msm. I dismiss any source that doesn't provide solid, substantial, objective evidence as proof. Is that too much to ask? I, certainly don't think so. As for Wolfgang, I admit I don't know much about him. I simply stated that what I had read gives me the impression that he doesn't know what he is talking about. Although, I did state that I would be open to changing my mind about the shooting if someone had evidence such as video's of the townsfolk of Newton stating that the shooting never happened. I feel like that evidence would definitely be available if it existed. I find it hard to believe that no one investigating this so called hoax has taken the time to go interview persons who were in and around the school that day.

       And what is it that you have read that discredits Halbig?  He's worked in law enforcement, as school principal, and as a school district director of safety.  Nothing in his background suggests he's a "crackpot".  I'd like to hear what you have read that suggests he doesn't know what he's talking about.

       I'll repeat, I don't think you gone beyond reading MSM headlines regarding Sandy Hook.

       I could do a Google search with the phrase "debunking Wolfgang Halbig" and send you the results, but I doubt you would accept those results. As I have said before, I am open minded to things if people provide solid, substantial, objective evidence to back their claim. I suggested that video of people from the town, school, local law enforcement, stating that the shooting didn't happen would definitely make me question the official narrative, but you just seem to want to  deflect rather than produce the evidence. Interesting.

       So you want to see video of people who participated in the hoax to admit that it was a hoax.  You are not a very smart man, are you?

        Here you go, though.
       </a>
       As for the lack of video evidence of people in the area at the time stating that the shooting never happened being because everyone was a part of the hoax? OK. You got proof of that?

       First you said he read somewhere that he's a crackpot.  Then you said he doesn't know what he's talking about.  Now you have to google "debunking Wolfgang Halbig".  Seems you can't get your story straight.  Seems you haven't read anything about him at all until now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite revealing of your agenda that you enter "debunking Wolfgang Halbig" into the search field rather than simply "Wolfgang Halbig".
      </p>
      <p>
       The first hit on your search is from
       <a href="http://www.crisisactorsguild.com">
        www.crisisactorsguild.com
       </a>
       .  You are a fucking joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides those actually participating in the hoax, why would anyone else in the town know?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watched either "We Need to Talk About Sandy Hook" or "Dear Wolfgang"  you will find tons of evidence that it's a hoax.  But I know you haven't and you won't.  You're not interested.  You're on a mission here.
