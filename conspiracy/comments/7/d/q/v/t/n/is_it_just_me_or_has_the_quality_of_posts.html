<p>Has there been anything good I&#39;ve just missed? All the posts trying to tie it to Saudi princes seem like bullshit.. there must have been someone who&#39;s posted something and actually put some effort into it, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because they&#39;ve maintained absolute silence. it&#39;s there only strategy. somebody fucked up big time on this operation and their best bet is to remain silent so we don&#39;t figure it out. really our best bet at this point is probably some of these lawsuits in action against MGM that will force Jesus to testify, and evidence to leak. Not saying play the waiting game in the meantime, but, not much to go on. Suggestions are appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you go into my post history, I made a pretty high effort post about how Campos had a lot of least leeway. I tried reposting it when I was drinking recently, and got a much more negative reception (although the quality was likely lower from editing while drinking).</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen anyone talk about the 60 minutes interview sheriff Lambardo did, when he didn&#39;t have FBI guy standing over his shoulder. It had more discrepancies than any of his previous press statements..</p>

<p>Obviously someone fucked up, obviously that&#39;s why they went dark..I just feel there&#39;s enough evidence to figure it out, but it&#39;s being tainted by trying to tie it into random shit like Saudi princes.. basically low effort posts are making it more difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, random. Not everything that happens around the planet can/should be tied to other random shit around the planet.

<p>It&#39;s obvious when you dismiss any source out hand if it is not a big recognizable 3-letter mainstream organization.  </p>

<p>You make an unreasonable argument that unless we have personally gone to the location and spoken to the people who live there, that we shouldn&#39;t form an opinion.  In other words, you are mocking all secondary research.</p>

<p>So you want primary research, which Wolfgang Halbig has done.  You say you don&#39;t know much about Wolfgang Halbig (so you yourself have not done any research at all on the topic), yet at the same time you also arbitrarily claim to know he is a complete crackpot without giving any reason or evidence why.  So you mock primary researcher for no reason.</p>

I, certainly don&#39;t think so. As for Wolfgang, I admit I don&#39;t know much about him. I simply stated that what I had read gives me the impression that he doesn&#39;t know what he is talking about. Although, I did state that I would be open to changing my mind about the shooting if someone had evidence such as video&#39;s of the townsfolk of Newton stating that the shooting never happened. I feel like that evidence would definitely be available if it existed. I find it hard to believe that no one investigating this so called hoax has taken the time to go interview persons who were in and around the school that day. </p>
