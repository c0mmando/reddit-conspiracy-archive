<p>My theory is that Alex Jones used to work at Time Warner for most of his career. You can see he used to mimick CNN talking points. He was huge anti police and anti USA government anything. Now he&#39;s completely different. Either he still works for time warner and they want him to anger people and push people to do something bad that they normally wouldn&#39;t do, or he doesn&#39;t work for them anymore and works for some other MSM company. I&#39;m calling on all Alex Jones current and former employees to speak out. It&#39;s time to lift the vail and expose this psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all fairness I hated bush and am pro-trump. Trump claims to be anti-establishment. It&#39;s only been a year and in about 6 months to a year I&#39;ll determine if he was just another puppet. I anticipate he will be. If the illuminati wanted to get their puppet into office they certainly would pick someone like Trump because people were starting to wake up to the typical politician&#39;s ways. Then again, by observing the typical politician&#39;s behavior after trump was elected I almost wonder if it was supposed to be rigged for Hitlery and somebody unrigged it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fundamentally do know how government budgets work. They&#39;d have to lower spending with tax cuts which if they do that I don&#39;t have a problem. Also, with tax cuts more money gets spent and more people spend money so it very easily evens out. You clearly don&#39;t know how economics works? </p>

<p>You can&#39;t understand why because you and me don&#39;t think the same. Donald Trump is a puppet? Well certainly not to the Rothschild&#39;s because Lynn De Rothschild absolutely hates Donald Trump and is on the same wavelength as you.

    <div class="md"><p>except time and time again trickle-down economics has been proven to not work. When their given money corporations don&#39;t have a tenancy to not reinvest that money into the corporation since money reinvested in the company isn&#39;t taxed anyways.

<p>What it does do is drain money going to poorer communities who, instead of hording money like the rich, immediately spend every cent they have, circulating it through the economy. Cutting social programs to pay for tax cuts for the rich is one of the worst things you can do to improve the economy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re regurgitating the young Turks talking points which are completely false. Lowering of the taxes worked pretty well for Raegan eh? They literally named an economic strategy after him because the country was absolutely killing it. Since Donald Trump shadows Reagan in many many ways I see Trump&#39;s tactic towards economics being the Reaganomics procedure. Tax cuts don&#39;t work?  JFK knew the only way to get an economy really thriving was to do a bottom to top tax cut. Which means the best democrat president ever gave corporations, &quot;the top 1%&quot; tax cuts. More taxes are only good for more gov spending and in reality why does the government need to spend more of my money??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually regurgitating pretty much every economics&#39;s talking point. For instance, They point out that Reagan thripled the size of America&#39;s debt, drastically increased income inequality, wages stagnated, and poverty increased. It was such an embarrassment that it was called voodoo economics, before trying to bring it back as trickle down economics, then supply side economics.</p>

<p>A government taxing and spending money accomplishes two thing. First it accomplishes goals such as building infrastructure,  maintining services like the DMV and a public education system that work to improve the welfare of its population. The second being that it redistributes money which naturally soaks up to the upper classes down to poorer people who then spend that money and have it circulating through the economy. </p>

<p>Clearly taxes get spent on your typical roadwork and infrastructure I didn&#39;t think I had to say that I guess I just thought that was common sense no? So you&#39;re trying to say that with a tax cut we wouldn&#39;t have money to build infrastructure and give poor people food stamps? I&#39;m pretty sure we would. The government would just have to stop spending money on stupid stuff. People would still get taxed no matter what and lowering that rate would not impact any of the things you listed above. Poor people would still get their food stamps and benefits, infrastructure would still get built, roads would still be maintained. It seems to me like you might be misinformed on tax cuts. I&#39;ll send you a link of common disinfo on tax cuts. I can also send you my intro to economics college book if you need it? Free of charge even!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if you could read you&#39;d see that I&#39;ve been saying the whole time that the government can and should cut their spending. You&#39;re like arguing with an angry 6 year old. You misrepresent my statements which I think they call straw man not? The government can cut taxes and be able to build the roads give poor people money and everything that they absolutely must have money for correct? The government doesn&#39;t need more money. That&#39;s been my argument from the beginning. With tax cuts they&#39;d still have the appropriate funds to do everything you&#39;re whining about. Up until Obama&#39;s poor regime more
Americans were middle class than low income. Obama changed that and 50% of Americans became low income. Why? Largely because the only job opportunities were fast food and service. When you have insanely high taxes at the corporate level factories move to China. You think that doesn&#39;t impact an economy? Look at China&#39;s growth and our diminish. You claim to know it all but you clearly are blind or something if you can&#39;t see how high taxes and regulation destroy economies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you realize that even if corporate taxes becomes zero, those jobs aren&#39;t coming back right? Not only has Voodoo economics been proven time and time again to do nothing about unemployment or provide pretty much any benefit to anyone but the rich. But even if we forced corporations to expand they&#39;re either going to </p>

<p>A) expand in places where they can pay slave wagees
B) expand by investing in automation </p>

<p>Also, the government currently doesn&#39;t/can&#39;t provide  for as  you said &quot;build the roads give poor people money and everything&quot;. Our infrastructure is in the shit and our working poor have medical and wellness indicators that are more in line with a 3rd world country then to the world&#39;s richest nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The interesting thing is, that Alex Jones&#39;s JRE Episode is behaving really weird on all platforms in terms of views and publication. I watch every episode and never get to that one (despite having the most views on the channel) on the sidebar. Same thing on ITunes, it never entered the charts. 
So there is some reason to assume he said some secret stuff, which is disturbing since he was talking about &quot;them, wanting to switch dimensions at the right time by drinking baby blood&quot;.</p>

<p>I also never understood how he managed to enter Bohemian Grove without an invitation and live to talk about it, let alone having a career after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Alex Jones was what he says he is he would be dead by now. Bill Hicks was the definition of woke and he spoke out about everything. He even predicted 9/11 happening and he was killed by the government. Alex Jones would be dead by now if he wasn&#39;t controlled op. He&#39;s what people like to call a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; meaning he will tell you half-truths and will mislead you intentionally. </p>

<p>Joe Rogan is in the club too and that&#39;s why Joe and Alex are tight but Alex probably had too much to drink and smoked too much weed at JRE and said too much. Now I don&#39;t think Joe and Alex will ever be seen on a show together agin even though that was the most popular podcast. That&#39;s half speculation but it&#39;s more than likely true. If not, at some point in time Alex must&#39;ve left time Warner and went independent and that&#39;s why MSM and everyone actually hates him now. Cause before MSM actually didn&#39;t have problems with him and they kinda got along so I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a weird situation. I listened to that JRE podcast and it was actually pretty good other than Alex Jones always interrupting people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah hold up there. You just jumped to way too many conclusions about what I believe. I do believe trump is for the people. Alex Jones is spreading half truths and yes compared to MSM he&#39;s telling the truth but I don&#39;t like telling the truth more than phony lying organizations. I believe people deserve the whole truth. He lies about having sources telling him things and say they&#39;re &quot;anonymous&quot; the same way the MSM does. He also tries to say he broke every big story out there when he didn&#39;t. There&#39;s many YouTube channels out there that are fair towards trump and give you some actual truth. When have you heard Alex Jones criticize trump? Cause believe me Trump hasn&#39;t been perfect and trump deserves to be criticized when he does something bad. Alex Jones is good for getting people to see that things aren&#39;t always as they seem and he wakes people up but after people finally awake they should probably start looking for other channels that will give you whole truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The good definitely outweighs the bad just be weary when you hear Alex Jones say things and I know it&#39;s difficult to fact check every single thing he say but the big things jones says definitely try to see if you can find multiple truthers saying it.

What if antifa would&#39;ve protested on that day and some far out there person heard Alex jones say nov 4th antifa apocalypse and they started shooting antifa? I feel like that&#39;s what he&#39;s there to do. He&#39;s there to get commotion goin.</p>

<p>I already know that pizzagate shooter madman was a false flag because coincidentally the only thing he hit was a comet ping pong computer server. Lastly, you have no argument from me that pizzagate is real but Alex Jones was wayyyy behind the rest of the truther community on reporting about pizzagate, and he retracted and apologized like the scam artist he is. </p>
