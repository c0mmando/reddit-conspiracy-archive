       So u/demandcollect pm'd me late morning(EST) in thai "stopdigging stopdigging (x20)" and I freaked out. I deleted my account and one post(other two on r/elsagate are still up). I just found this old account, the new one I made couldnt post due to community rules so sorry if I left anyone hanging. I will edit my old post into this I guess. Thanks a bunch to the users that took the time to save my stuff, I really appreciate it. And damn u/demandcollect I love a great troll but if my phone hadnt been somehow still recieving messages on my android dropdown and I hadnt seen your last pm I would have destroyed my laptop and fled the state.

      <p>
       DISCLAIMER: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTACT OR BULLY THE CHANNEL USERS. PLEASE HELP TRANSLATE OR FIND EVIDENCE WHICH EITHER PROVES OR DISPROVES THIS THEORY SO WE CAN GET OVER IT.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it isn't a bot army, at least I don't think so. You have to use a thai keyboard emulator(link:
       <a href="https://www.branah.com/thai">
        https://www.branah.com/thai
       </a>
       ), only in pattachote(edit: it varies) I think but possibly both formats. I've only tried out a few comments but it seems very promising.
      </p>
      <p>
       See my earlier theory(See here :
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElsaGate/comments/7d6r4e/elsagate_bot_video/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/ElsaGate/comments/7d6r4e/elsagate_bot_video/
       </a>
       ) that the comment section is being used to sell/swap/buy cp or support human trafficking. Tons of short videos of kids linked to creepy gibberish speaking accounts with no views. Lots of them are creepy as shit(see here:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLaywoHRYWc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLaywoHRYWc
       </a>
       ). And here's the thing, look at the name of the dude who owns the channel: Daniel Thomas. Definitely not thai. Or this:
      </p>

       Initial YT Link:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL893RsGWmI">

       </a>
      </p>

       [Victoria Mccoy]: “xjdjd shops﻿” translation="I love you"
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvqEXsurRVw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvqEXsurRVw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is the case then this should be busted wide open. I've only been looking at this stuff for two days and don't have enough time to process this stuff fast enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: so far I have tested a few, the first one i tested was "ny" which translated to "reply." That poster had four homeade videos on their channel. Will keep updating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Update: Okay, so look at this channel:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSFyhdhgHdyFzn45ljBFqw">
        https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSFyhdhgHdyFzn45ljBFqw
       </a>
       The user commented "may" in thai. They have a bunch of videos including march and april but no "may." What if "may" is the child they're selling?
      </p>
      <p>
       Update #2: So this stuff is translating, and it may be promising. I just got a location (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phra_Dhammakaya">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phra_Dhammakaya
       </a>
       ) from one of the comments on an elsa video and then a commenter reply who had more videos of kids. Interesting
      </p>
      <p>
       Update #3: Okay so im done searching comment sections on YT for the night, Ive been looking at this stuff all day and it's still gonna be there tomorrow. Will stay on reddit though, I just need to calm myself down so I can sleep eventually. People should start checking the comment sections(need a place to start? Check my previous posts linked above).
      </p>
      <p>
       Update #4: Okay, I just woke up and want to make some things more clear. First, the "method" of decoding I'm using is very simple: type comment into thai keyboard emulator and then throw the results in a translator. Second, if you do want to help me figure out if this is an international pedo ring or just a bunch of random home videos then please DO NOT contact them, assist in translating or searching for videos. When I was doing my sleuthing I noticed that not every elsagate channel and not every comment section were the same, some seemed to have more videos and comments while others seemed to have more normal comments. Third, I'm super overwhelmed by this stuff and this is just a pet theory. I posted it to this sub(I was just messaging with a few users on r/elsagate before) so it could be vetted. If you see holes in it, post it. If you see potential connections, post it. I would say my "hit" ratio on the suspicious videos/activity was maybe 1 out of every 30 suspicious accounts. These guys are super wary also. I made a post about some cp I found and it was gone an hour later, channel still intact. I think the guy got tipped off by the maybe 20 extra views all at once.

       What's bizarre is that a lot of those videos have millions of views... Wtf. That's a hell of a lot of views for some random kid's "morning routine".

      <p>
       Even if this were some sort of masked child ring, you wouldn't expect the viewpoint to be that high. Hell, you'd almost expect the views to be relatively low because they'd be trying to do it on the DL.

       You could also set up a business, llc of some sort, that collects the money.  Also they may have signed up for it in a foreign country who has different laws for taxes and being self employed.  That's part of how its still going on.  That and Google just not doing shit about the videos.  But god forbid you use 3 seconds of a song in a video

       Not to mention that this was these YouTubers calling out what was most likely another piece of their system that has since changed slightly. Those videos of the very young kids just using their webcams. Those comment sections used to be filled with middle Eastern and Asian accounts talking about how sexy these 9 year old girls are. One commenter even said something something to the effect of "insert YouTubers name who made videos about what these videos wanting this horrible thing to go away" won't ever stop us. No one can keep us from these beautiful girls."

       If Youtube are taking 45% of the ad revenue (which seems to be the going rate from what I can tell), they are possibly making way more money than anyone else from these videos.

       Holy hell. The comments alone prove how big of an issue this is. I am using this video for all the shills that claim people are making weird videos just for the money. I think the pedophiles are paying people in third world countries to make this garbage since they can get it on the cheap. I need to vomit now.

       So my post and the r/nosleep post are completly seperate posts. I think mine was earlier but essentiallly they were aroudn the same time. Neither of us knew about each others posts until another user linked my post to his in the comment section. Then the OP commented on my post which alerted me to his post. It was kind of the final nail in the coffin for me when I read it. Very disturbing. Even the injections made sense in a very, very bad way. Look at some of the kids pupils(freak family is a good example). Super dilated. As soon as I saw them I thought they were on drugs but this, in conjunction with the theme of vaccinations present in some videos, confirms it for me. Everything else he described, eslecially the color coded aspects, was eerily accurate.

       I have pm'd with the user and he says it's real. If you watch the videos you'll see that his assesment of the themes, patterns and characteristics present in the videos are accurate. It's either a very elaborate troll or it's true.

       It is over dramatic and straight out of a horror movie some of the shit he was coming up with. Time will tell i guess, but i took his story with a grain of salt - i don't think it is beyond possible that somebody analysed these videos and wrote what is essentially fan fiction about them...

       NoSleep is difficult to understand for people who don't regularly visit it. It's not just a subreddit for scary stories. It's actually the world's largest roleplaying community. If you read the official rules of the subreddit, the first rule is that
       <em>
        everything here is true
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a horror author. I found out about Elsagate because someone talked about it in an AskReddit post. I started googling it, I watched a hundred videos on it, and decided I thought this was important enough that tons of people should see it. So I wrote a NoSleep story that wove the facts of Elsagate into a creepy story.

       That's what I thought. People participating in the role play by commenting as if it was true. You shown awareness about this issue by weaving the themes into your story. So after
       <a href="/u/Opco10">
        /u/Opco10
       </a>
       said you told him the story was true, I started to get spooked. You would be  the key in the investigation if the story was true. Glad it is not.

       No, I think you are misunderstanding what he said. He asked me if the videos were real. And they are. I furnished plenty of evidence, and also in the story I tell people how to find the videos. (One of the rules of NoSleep is that you cannot provide links or even video names/channel names on youtube, so you have to beat around the bush and say "here is what I typed in to find this video...")

       Maybe you should stick to telling the truth when youre trying to make people care. throwing in bull shit about secret agents trying to kidnap you or your niece makes it easy to call you an asshole pulling our legs. he was asking about your story cause it smells of bullshit anyone can go on youtube and find out these videos are real. but your account is just some guy jumping on the bandwagon making it much harder to make any claim credible

       Ahh, makes sense. Sorry for the confusion guys, I didnt know the rules of the sub. The minute details like the color coded objects and rooms, seperate animating tasks and elsagate descriptors were on point. The very ending did leave me feeling like I finished a good novel but the other parts had me freaked out.

       No Sleep is for stories either real or fictional, the point is that you are supposed to treat all of them as though they are real in the comments. So a lot of them are fictional obviously and include great creative writing. But it's also a good place for people with real creepy stories like this one, or I've seen others about people being persecuted for having found out something, to share under the guise of it potentially being fictional as a sort of protection.

       Fuck sake that topmindsofreddit is such bullshit, they link you there to insult you and shout you down. Then BAN you for defending your point. I got banned for stating a fact.
Sure it was a fact that would upset people but it's a fact none the less. Just because something offends people doesn't make it untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm banned or else I'd be arguing with those wankers now. They are re trying to say we are only going after brown people for elsagate

        the "method" of decoding I'm using is very simple: type comment into thai keyboard emulator and then throw the results in a translator.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It appears that pretty much any combination of random characters entered in the emulator result in a relatively legible translation.

       I got sick to my stomach the other night.  My toddler wanted to watch 5 Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed, and after a search one of the results showed a thumbnail of five kids in costumes.  Sure enough, they did do the 5 monkyes song, but then the video turned weird with them tying each other up with duct tape.  I had to turn it off because I could tell it was heading in the wrong direction quickly.
