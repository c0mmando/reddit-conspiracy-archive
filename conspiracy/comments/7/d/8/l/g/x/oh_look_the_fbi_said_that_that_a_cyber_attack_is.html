<p>sure, terrorists and criminals (intelligent ones) use it. but without it, you give those terrorists and criminals more power than ever before, at the same time as allowing the eye of sauron to inspect everything you do as a business or individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bull shit. businesses rely on it for privacy -- without it I could sit online stealing credit card #s and SS #s from google, amazon, ebay, etc.</p>

<p>I would be rich off ill begotten gains overnight. </p>

<p>Corporate spies could easily take advantage of it, especially from outside the country.</p>

<p>and that&#39;s not even getting into personal uses.</p>

<p>truth is encryption USED to be illegal and considered a war asset in the early days of computing, and a legal case brought to the supreme court legalized it.</p>

<p>does it hamper law enforcement? sure it does -- but most criminals are too stupid to use it and don&#39;t spend the extra $$$ to secure their shit -- look at the dumbass who came to America for a beard competition and got busted for selling darknet drugs because he brought his unencrypted laptop.</p>

<p>so most criminals don&#39;t know shit about computers -- except for the cyber criminal experts who probably also work in the field and have a real education.</p>

<p>without encryption, literally none of modern life is safe. even modern credit cards swiped IN THE STORE.</p>
