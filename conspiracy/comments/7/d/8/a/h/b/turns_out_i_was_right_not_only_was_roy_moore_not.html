       pedosta has been proven to be a pedophile along with alefantis and epstien and hastert and menendez. Much MUCH MUCH different than someone coming out with an october surprise 40 years later a week or two before an election dont be a retard. You know I am right. It is different and not just because of feelings it is because of context and evidence. So far we have a doctored yearbook and allegations just like Herman Caine got. Funny thing is Gloria Allred works for someone in the Deep state republican side of things. I just havent done my homework to figure out who is still in office from the Clinton days and narrow it down from there.

       im done. We are passing at high speeds in opposite directions on the same road. You are all about painting with a broad brush and ignoring the actual conspiracy here. I am seeing it play out in front of us. The deep state is trying to Deep Six Moore. This is how they do it. Its fucking Gloria Allred for fucks sake. I wouldnt let her represent me pro bono if she was the last attorney on earth because she has been proven to be a regular Al sharpton every time and full of shit.

       I'd put podesta, alefantis and menendez in the same boat as Moore. None of those people even have victim accusers. Ultimately, we're not litigating Moore, we're determining if he's fit to be senator on the court of public opinion. I'd pushbfor none of the above being senators and if any could be tried in a criminal or civil court I'd be interested in the result.

       This guy is asking you to trust his character. He was removed from office
       <em>
        twice
       </em>
       for these reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        for disregarding a federal injunction.
       </li>
       <li>
        demonstrated unwillingness to follow clear law.
       </li>
       <li>
        abuse of administrative authority.
       </li>
       <li>
        substituting his judgment for the judgement of the entire Alabama Supreme Court, including failure to abstain from public comment about a pending proceeding in his own court.
       </li>
       <li>
        interference with legal process and remedies in the United States District Court and/or Alabama Supreme Court related to proceedings in which Alabama probate judges were involved.
       </li>
       <li>
        failure to recuse himself from pending proceedings in the Alabama Supreme Court after making public comment and placing his impartiality into question.
       </li>

       America was founded a christian country there is no amount of mental gymnastics in the world one can do to change it. He disobeyed an unconstitutional order to remove the ten commandments from in front of a court house and refused to be silent about it. I hate the church but I respect the man for standing up for what he believes in and I love America and am not stupid enough to try to lie to myself that this isn't a christian nation founded by christians who believed in god. Separation of church and state meant the Church can't be the state not that the state can't have religion. The second Ammendment isn't for hunting either. It also means all guns. Jefferson had Cannons in his front yard. There should be no restrictions.

       Not only do I know my history, I know my bible. Neither the constitution nor the Bible supports what you're saying or Roy Moore's methods/character. I would love to have a productive debate about this, but since you said I hate Christians, am misguided, and then started talking about the second amendment and Jefferson having cannons in his front yard, I'm not convinced you're a good candidate for a back and forth.

       This is the most sane discussion point by anyone on this Moore situation. Only thing you missed was when he wrote that people of Muslim faith should not be allowed to be publically elected officials. It's amazing that anyone lends him any credibility. Ultimately, it's simply breitbart/bannon talking points that cause people to support him. You know the same breitbart/bannon funded by far-right Israeli advocates, makes one wonder which is truly the "deep state": far-right Zionist thugs or people concerned of a creepy outdated a thought being a representative of our senate...

       I am 100% convinced that that's why they support him. All of these "anti establishment" are different from the "establishment" how exactly? Do their views and policies differ? Not in any tangible way as far as I can tell. All the poor uninsured, uneducated voters worry about is whether or not they will be able to exhibit racist behavior without fear of repercussion. That and simply wanting to piss off the "libruls".

Or pictures of pedo symbols all over the place with moore in them. With them drawn on his fucking hands . No you got shit. Thats my point. Completely different. You will not be able to deflect all the molesty rapeyness of the Pedostas and the Clintons and the Hollywood machine onto this administration via guilt by association to a so far innocent man.

       In case there was ever any doubt that Pizzagaters never gave a fuck about the victims, this should really kill it. It was never about the (non-existent) kids, it was about politics and personal egos. No one cares about the victims, which couldn't be more obvious now that there are actual some victims to care about.

       I personally don't know much about the Moore case. All I heard was people have accused him. Is that correct? Does he have anything hanging in his house that would suggest he's a pedo? Like art depicting children in their underwear with red buts? Does he attend spirit cooking parties? Do you have any evidence, even if it's circumstantial. If so, I'll take a look and possibly jump right on board with calling this guy a pedo. If it's just accusations, I'll hold my judgment until I hear more about the accuser. I'm not saying their lying, I'm just saying, I have no idea if they are lying. Don't say the yearbook because someone forged my signature before. It is possible.

       I'm just asking if anyone has evidence. Even circumstantial evidence. I don't believe in political parties. I don't care if their dem, rep, lib, or anything. I'm an independent who thinks corruption doesn't choose a party. But you didn't answer any of my reasonable questions. When I first stared looking into pizzagate, anyone and everyone that I ask about it, had a mountain of circumstantial evidence. Surely you can provide what I'm asking for. It would greatly increase the awareness if you did.

       So, according to you, the word of actual people attaching their face and name to actual accusations is worth less than some emails about "spirit cooking"? Or about the kind of art someone collects?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're okay with calling someone a pedo and attacking him based on art and emails about 'spirit cooking', without any attackers coming forward or any other evidence, but you want to hold off on any judgement when there are actual women coming forward, telling their stories and openly weeping while doing so? Is this an accurate summarization of the stance you are taking here?

       I'm not on r/conspiracy because I trust the MSM and our government. They are pushing this hard. Every time I ask for circumstantial evidence, something he does, like spirit cooking,nobody ever gives it to me. I can't compare this to pizza gate because it's totally different. The news is telling me this guy is a pedo. That's all. Why would I trust the MSM. They covered for James Alefantis. They had him on TV and didn't ask him about any of the things I was concerned with. Now their telling me this other guy is a pedo. If you can't show me something, I'm not going to  help feed the machine.
