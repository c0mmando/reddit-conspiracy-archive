       I have seen a lot of suffering over the years. 99% of the people I have known fall into one of these categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Work like a slave only to have enough money to cover the most basic needs. These people suffer because they are tethered to their homes since they can’t move without spending money which they don’t have.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People who refuse to work like a slave for chump change simply because it is not worth it. These people gave up and oftentimes live for free at a family members home or are simply homeless.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People who suffered too long and broke down to become a criminal which may lead to temporary money but eventually lands them in jail plus they have to deal with internal misery because nobody really wants to sell their soul by becoming a criminal.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Everyone is fooled into thinking that this is “the best we can do” but don’t be fooled. We, as a society, have the ability to generate a very wealthy planet where everyone, except for the people who refuse to participate, can live very good, satisfying lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, almost all economic hardship is artificially implemented by the oligarchy cabal. This hardship has created a domino effect of many disasters including the rise of criminal enterprises, lots of theft, the ability for people to be bought out/bribed, income inequality, mental suffering, physical health problems, and many other problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this is horrific in the eyes of the 99%, for the Oligarphy, this is equivilant to hitting the lotto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: (From a reply below that got buried about people unwilling to work like slaves being lazy).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Oligarphy wants you to call your fellow American lazy pieces of shit. Why? Mind control. Nobody wants to be a lazy piece of shit so everyone will willingly work for a shitty $15 an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Work in itself is wonderful. People would gladly work for $35-$45 an hour regardless if it is waiting tables or picking up trash.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that people aren’t getting enough to even survive after 40 hour work weeks. Paying these people $15 an hour is a goddamned joke. They aren’t lazy at all. They are just manipulated into thinking they are lazy. These Americans are in fact realistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cabal wants to control your behavior. In your case, you are brainwashed to think anyone who doesn’t work a whopping 40 hours a week for $15 an hour is a lazy bastard. What you don’t realize is that we can all work 20 hours a week and have much more than we would under the 40 hour work week. It’s all a matter of optimizing the economic system which pHDs within government have already figured out but it is against the cabals will to implement this beautiful system into society.

       Lots of lazy people living off of others. Way too many lazy people. They'd be 'voted off the island' a long time ago if the people had any say. Then after that, yes, your utopia can exist. But, right now, there is a just an overwhelming fuckload of lazy and worthless piles of shit living off of others in one way or another.

       Well put. Nowadays working hard and going the extra mile is considered the default. If you don't do these things then you are lazy and have no work ethic. It is nothing more than fair to be paid what you put in.

       Can you please define what you mean by Oligarphy? You’ve used that word several times now. It’s not an actual word, but I’m not sure if you are maybe trying to coin a new term or aw just misspelling oligarchy every time.

       I’m not trying to discredit you, I genuinely want to know. Your main points are completely valid, other than that. I think it’s a good post but for that one word..

       And we have a system in place designed to keep it that way. The Fractional-reserve banking system is rigged to keep all the money at the top and keep us all in debit. And they need to grow the debit to keep the system working.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the "Tea Party" congressmen all voted to increase our debit by $1.5 Trillion. This is a burden the 99% will bare. And who will benefit, the bankers who control us with their debit and the top 1% who see most of the benefit of this "tax cut".

       Don't forget about the income tax, that's a big tool of suppression. most people making $10 an hour would have about an extra hundred a week to play with if there wasn't an income tax. you wanna boost the economy over night? get rid of the income tax.

       This is basic economic theory that was taught in Soviet Union to EVERYONE. Of course, teaching this in US would be disasterous for the elite, thats why education here is such SHIT.
