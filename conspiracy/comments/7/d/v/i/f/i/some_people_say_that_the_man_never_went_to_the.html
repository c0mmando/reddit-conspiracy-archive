       Unless Russia was in on the conspiracy, they would have called our bluff immediately. I have heard not one compelling reason to keep them from immediately telling everyone we never went to the moon, aside from the E.T. cover up theory. We were in a Cold-War that amounted to 30+ years of dick waving, they would have cut ours off the first chance they had.

       What about this, what about that. Same argument, different forum. Regardless of whether or not you believe anything that has ever happened because you weren't there to witness it doesn't mean it has anything to do with events 60 years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, they lie to us constantly. Yes, we are right to doubt events as we are told they happened. No, JFK can't be the last one to try to save us and the guy that threw us under the bus simultaneously.

       When you listen to Don Petit talk about how the technology was destroyed to get back to the Moon, it makes one wonder how they ever chose him as a spokesperson in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Petit did his Rocket payload chalkboard talk and you pause to think there's gotta be some strange agenda afoot. Dude is a strange duck and why him as a spokesman?

       While the NASA Fan Club will come in and defend the millions per day given to ISS as a mere

       There was a post in here the other day about a find in Antarctica. Fossilized trees were found! If one has really looked at NASA they will know that the US and some astronaut ambassadors
       <em>
        gave Moon rocks
       </em>
       to other Nations. When they were taken for
       <em>
        evaluation
       </em>
       for Insurance purposes it was discovered that the Moon Rocks were fossilized trees.

       Well there ya go eh. Learn something new everyday. So it seems they've given us a floating microphone, a real life best ever space invader ship that has dodged space junk for years, all whilst seemingly looking as robust as some glued matchsticks and aluminum foil.

       Some may argue the value of tax payers money for such things or a lack thereof but the best is yet to come....NASA hairspray. Thanks to years of testing and the consistent always erect wild hair cuts of the female ISS participants.

       It is all bright and shiny! I like the

       the best! Do you think there's more action and motion on the Space Needle or the ISS?

       I mean there's at least a convincing reason  of why they would lie about it. Sometimes conspiracies don't have any plausible explanation for why there's a cover up and that bothers me.

       What about moon rocks, they did bring a lot back, and have allowed thousands and thousands of geologists to examine them, You think they all would have to be on the conspiracy as well. I think its ridiculous to concentrate on the very small things that make you wonder and focus on tangible proof we went to moon with actual rocks from there.

       Photos and videos of the Apollo program were faked, that much is irrefutable for anyone who looks objectively at the available evidence. 
Now, what conclusions one will make from this fact is up to you. Some say that NASA faked the images and video because they are hiding aliens or other secret things on the moon. Others say NASA faked the images because they never went at all.
