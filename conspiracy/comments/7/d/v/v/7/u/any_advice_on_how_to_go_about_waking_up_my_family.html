I think I&#39;m the only one of the lot that has even the slightest idea of what might be happening in the world. </p>

<p>Everyone in my extended fam is liberal, while my parents are viewed as more your typical southern bible thumper types. There&#39;s tons of potential political tension, so how do I proceed? Which conspiracies do I focus on? Which are the most important to help my family members start a journey into a legitimate search for truth? I know I&#39;m not going to change anyone&#39;s mind; I&#39;m hoping to plant seeds</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask them questions about their beliefs, don&#39;t accuse them of being dumb or being a sheep. Be legitimately interested in their opinions. Do you think the Uranium One controversy is a big deal? Why not? Have you heard about the Awan brothers? No? Why not? Lead them to questioning their own beliefs. They won&#39;t &quot;wake up&quot; right away but if you lead them to questioning the official narrative enough times, they&#39;ll start questioning it themselves. They might even get angry at you the first time if they get caught in something that doesn&#39;t make sense. That&#39;s a good sign, but don&#39;t push on, let them come to their own conclusions. We all arrive at the truth sooner or later, but we all take different paths.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you <strong>must</strong> risk ruining dinner with loved ones because the truth is important to you (and believe me, I know how it feels) approach it thusly:</p>

<p>1) Find something INNOCUOUS, small... unimportant and almost comical in its context BUT bulletproof in &quot;meme magic&quot; (this being the &quot;seed&quot; of a new idea you intent to implant in another person, the seed itself need not be immortal, but it does need to be well evolved and hardy.)</p>

<p>I suggest: laughing together at, yet coming to no conclusive agreement upon a recent photograph (whether is is fake or not, truly is unimportant as the ends justify the means do they not?) with a gopher in a photograph on Mars!!! Ridiculous, funny but no one will know for sure. In the (Maybe) one or two people in the room who are susceptible to questioning authority, they may feel compelled to talk to you later or ask you about things...</p>

<p>It is possible to succeed without ruining dinner... but it is an art and must be done subtly. It reminds me of the scene in Stranger Things Season 2: The conspiracy theorist drinks straight vodka and almost pukes. As he pours tonic into it he thinks and realises, if the story about aliens murdering a girl is turned into a &quot;toxic waste spill&quot; killing a girl - he can water down the truth and still get justice.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
