       Someone posted that Wendy Williams looks like a man so I replied with this post, which was upvoted:

      <p>
       It's one of those things that everyone would claim they already knew if it was openly revealed in the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the obvious fact that she looks like a
       <a href="http://www.theglamourouslife.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wendy_williams_man_3.jpg">
        man

       <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/15/video-undefined-2163630300000578-282_636x358.jpg">
        ring finger is longer than her index finger
       </a>
       which indicates that she was exposed to a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_ratio">
        high amount
       </a>
       of testosterone in the womb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying there's anything wrong with her being trans. Maybe when the establishment media decides the moment is right to focus on that agenda they'll make a big celebration of it and she'll talk about her nightmare of having to live a lie etc etc.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Nothing about my post disparaged Wendy Williams or trans people, but I was permabanned from
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       for "Hate speech".
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire thread (and several others) were filled with hateful comments toward Williams, but you are not allowed to discuss why she looks like a man in drag.

       If you think Wendy Williams is a biological female who just happened to be exposed to high levels of testosterone in the womb and has a chin that clearly shows evidence of teen stubble (zoom in on the first picture), you're absolutely entitled to your opinion.

       That said, there are many reasons a non-trans woman could have any or all of those traits.  She's also got a kid and there's at least one pic of her pregnant and showing her belly.

       I don't care either way, but it's at least as strong as any of your pieces of evidence.  The

       have a 2d:4d ratio that is &lt;1 and ~5% of women have a ratio &lt;.912, so the fact that hers is like that doesn't mean much.  Outside of that, you didn't provide any evidence, other than "she looks like it."

       Anyway, that's all the thought I'm interested in putting into the history of some woman I'd never heard of before your post.

       A single photo from a supposed nine month pregnancy of what could extremely easily be a prosthetic is not "at least as strong" as anything, or even slightly approaching evidence of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I showed you a picture of a cow with 20 legs would you consider it to be reasonable evidence of anything? Are you aware how amazingly easy it is to manipulate photos these days?

       But her ring finger is longer than her index finger, not shorter, which is in line with the vast majority of males, not females.

       Ultimately I think it's perfectly reasonable to discuss whether Wendy Williams was born a man, and that Reddit is forcefully preventing this discussing.

       She’s not the one who has to prove she isn’t trans. You’re the one saying she is. So either prove it which you haven’t and most certainly cannot since you don’t speak for her or are her current attending physician.
      </p>

       But hey, you got your attention over at videos until you were banned and then came here to make an irrelevant post for more attention.

       This thread isn't about "Wendy Williams is trans". It's about "Reddit is banning people who discuss whether Wendy is trans when hate speech about her character is absolutely fine, saying Nancy Grace looks like a man is absolutely fine, and speculating over whether celebs are gay is also absolutely fine".
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are we specifically not allowed to speculate over whether Wendy Williams is trans?

       You can post hateful comments about Wendy Williams as much as you like, but as soon as you mention that she looks like a man in drag or post evidence explaining why that it, your comments get removed for "hate speech".
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen many comments in
       <a href="/r/videos">

       where people have said Nancy Grace looked like a man without getting banned.

       In my opinion Reddit is clearly preventing discussion concerning the obvious. If you disagree that's fine.

       I don't think it's a conspiracy against me personally. I think Reddit is forcefully controlling what is allowed to be discussed by banning people, and discussing whether Wendy Williams was born a man is clearly not allowed to be discussed, while posting strong insults about her character is allowed to be discussed.

       If you think this is completely irrelevant and unworthy of discussion, maybe you should take your own advice and find something more interesting to spend your valuable time on.

       So you're saying it's not possible for transgenderism to be related to any kind of conspiracy, such as Reddit forcefully preventing discussion over whether a given celebrity is transgender?
      </p>
      <p>
       People are allowed to openly discuss whether or not celebrities are gay on Reddit. Can you please take the time to explain why such discussion is not allowed concerning people who show signs of being transgender?

       It's pretty clear that you have a problem with trans people. If you didn't think there was anything wrong with it you wouldn't have put so much effort into "proving" that she's trans.

       It took barely any effort at all. Someone pondered why she looks like she used to be a man, and I answered their question.

      <p>
       As far as I'm concerned, it's plainly obvious that she was born male. It's not a matter of "why I care". People constantly openly discuss whether or not celebrities are gay and I don't see this as being any different.
      </p>

       The only problem I have is being banned for "hate speech" when the entire thread was full of hateful comments.

       That said, there are many reasons a non-trans woman could have any or all of those traits.  She's also got a kid and there's at least one pic of her pregnant and showing her belly.
