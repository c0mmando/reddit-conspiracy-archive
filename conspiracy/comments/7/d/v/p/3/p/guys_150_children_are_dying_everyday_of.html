    <div class="md"><p>I think people care but we have become so desensitized by reading about stuff like this on the news. We just need to be shaken out of it by reminding ourselves that these are children suffering on a massive scale. We can&#39;t care about things like pizzagate/pedogate and turn a blind eye something like this.</p>

<p>The people in Yemen have no one but the good people in the civilized world to advocate for them. They are on their knees asking someone to hear their desperate prayers. All we have to do is bring this up to one or two people that may not have heard about it as uncomfortable of a subject it may be. If enough people shake themselves out of the charm of desensitization, I believe that it&#39;s a start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both PR and Yemen are not getting the attention that they deserve. But PR was hit by a natural catastrophe and our govt as lackluster their efforts may be, are doing something about it.</p>

<p>Yemen&#39;s crisis is mainly due in part to our support of SA&#39;s bombing campaign and blockade against the nation. They are literally blocking any form of support whether it&#39;s food or medicine from entering into the city. They have quite literally weaponized hunger and disease(cholera) with our support. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s also hard for people to empathize with those so far away with no social connection, remember reading something about a monkeysphere theory I believe that dealt with this? Could have been something else but I don&#39;t have the time to read up right now, I think that people care but I don&#39;t think that people care <em>enough</em> to do anything about it really. Getting it into mainstream news is nice for awareness but what is it really going to do unless people are out there en mass protesting on the streets? Truth is the government could give two shits less what we think, there is no repercussion for them except maybe a little media outrage, then what? It&#39;s a shame that innocent people are out there dying and our government can help to prevent that but why would they considering they&#39;re the ones supporting it.</p>

<p>Its not good for anyones mental health to focus on every single atrocity that happens. We are desensitized because you literally cannot care about most of the world. If you spent every day of your life sad about dying kids in the world, well you&#39;re not ever going to do anything but cry about all the dead kids.</p>

<p>Hell there are American citizens that are homeless and starving yet we dont care about them. Why should the people in the US care about people in Yemen if we dont even care about the people here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saudi Arabia provides America with oil and intelligence services, we also house huge military bars in their country </p>

<p>Iran actively opposes American interests in the region and funds terror organizations.</p>

<p>The new king of Saudi Arabia is actively disbanding the terror systems and corruption that had infested the kingdom for years.</p>

<p>The current war coming with Iran is inevitable, Obama did this with his pivot to Iran during the Isis crisis in his hope that Shia leadership would resolve the issue, it has now led to a broad coalition of Sunni states, plus Israel, to align. In the end it will probably make for a more stability eventually unlike the complete chaos we have had for the past decade.</p>

<p>An international aid group says an estimated 130 children or more die every day in war-torn Yemen from extreme hunger and disease.</p>

<p>Save the Children said late on Wednesday that a continuing blockade by the Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen&#39;s Shiite rebels is likely to further increase the death rate. It says over 50,000 children are believed to have died in 2017.</p>

<p>The U.N. officials said more than 20 million people, including 11 million children, are in need of urgent assistance, with 7 million totally dependent on food assistance. The U.N. has called it the &quot;worst humanitarian crisis in the world.&quot;&quot;Even with a partial lifting of the blockade, the World Food Program estimates that an additional 3.2 million people will be pushed into hunger. If left untreated, 150,000 malnourished children could die within the coming months,&quot; the officials said.</p>

<p>The US is a major part of this Saudi lead coalition that has bombed Yemen for the past two years. These strikes purposely targeted the electricity grid which disabled the water treatment facility. This has caused a million people to contract cholera, one of the worst diseases to die from. If you were truly a non-interventionist, you should be heavily critical of what we are supporting over there instead of blaming the Yemenis.</p>

<p>What? The Saudis are way more Islamic fundamentalists than Iran. The Saudis just gave woman the right to drive (with a man in the car) and stone people regularly. Iran is no picnic, but compared to Saudi Arabia it is super modern and progressive. </p>

Over half of Iranian college students are women, they can drive and vote and work, and have a less restrictive dress code than SA. It also has some semblance of a democracy, unlike the SA kingdom. </p>

<p>Do you seriously know nothing about the countries except for a few recent news articles? Iran has become much less fundamentalist in the last decade, but even before it was in no way comparable to SA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The coalition closed all air, land and sea ports to stem the flow of arms from Iran on November 6, after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired towards its capital Riyadh. It has since said that aid can go through &quot;liberated ports&quot; but not the key Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah.</p>

<p>Now United Nations sanctions monitors have told the Security Council in a confidential report the coalition is threatening the peace, security and stability of the country by blocking humanitarian aid.</p>
