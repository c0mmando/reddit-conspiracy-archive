        The Conspiracy of Death
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was a little girl, I remember I was lying in bed with my mom, and I suddenly realized I had a heart beat. I woke her up frantically, almost hitting her, and I asked her what it was. She told me it was my heart and to go back to bed. It was probably the first time I was fully aware that I was ‘alive’.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is odd to me is many live as though they are not going to die. It is interesting that the same themes seem to persist in literature and history throughout time, but they are largely ignored. The themes I am talking about are the typical ‘money cannot buy happiness’ and ‘be kind to others’ and so on. These themes are manifested in nearly every important text on this planet, but many still choose ignorance. No matter how many read these texts, no matter where they come from, most refuse to listen to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Death is something I think about a lot – not because I am depressed necessarily, but I realize that my life is fleeting, and there is an urgency in a way. Either there is something or nothing after we die, and I lean on the side that there is something.
But this post is not going to be a preaching post; rather, I wanted to discuss that possibility that there is a conspiracy to make us think about anything other than death. Further, I think there is a larger conspiracy involving immortality, science, and technology, and I wanted to discuss that in this post, as well. Finally, if we do have free will, I think we should use it to live as though life has meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Comfort
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the downfall of our nation (United States) will be comfort. Despite stresses and circumstances in life, many in our nation experience great comfort. Most have food, water, and shelter, and most have time for entertainment and pleasure. Before I move further, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs show that most of our basic needs are being fulfilled:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/conation/maslow.html">
        http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/conation/maslow.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even those who live in poverty (speaking of US) still have access to most of these things – though maybe more inconsistently.
For example, I lived with my ex in extremely impoverished conditions (no heat during winter at times, running water issues, outhouses even!). This experience changed my view of poverty greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       When his family got their monthly paycheck, they immediately spent it on whatever joy and pleasure they could, whether that would be eating out or going to the movies. While they suffered somewhat the rest of the month, they had that moment of comfort and pleasure, and they
       <em>
        lived
       </em>
       for it. In fact, I would say almost anything, to them, was worth that brief moment of comfort and pleasure. As one of my students put it, they were living for the ‘present.’
      </p>
      <p>
       That does not seem bad, right? Aren’t we told to not worry about the past or future, and just focus on the now? There are many famous quotes on living in the present:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.habitsforwellbeing.com/20-quotes-about-living-in-the-present-moment/">
        https://www.habitsforwellbeing.com/20-quotes-about-living-in-the-present-moment/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is truth to that, but I think it is misleading, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we are focused on comfort and pleasure, at times, we are fulfilling our present needs (which are influenced by the past), and avoiding our future needs (in some ways).
      </p>
      <p>
       In our current society, I do not think we have any issue focusing on the present. We have countless means of pleasure to keep us entertained and distracted. “Amusing Ourselves to Death” has some interesting perspective on this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        “Americans no longer talk to each other, they entertain each other. They do not exchange ideas, they exchange images. They do not argue with propositions; they argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        “Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the wiki about “Amusing Ourselves to Death” if you are interested:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a comfortable society, we are amusing ourselves to death. Porn, food, entertainment, sex, drugs, alcohol, celebrity worship, vanity, exercise, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I am not saying that there is not a time and place for entertainment, as many misinterpret my posts in extremism. What is life without some fun? However, it is when ‘fun’ overtakes everything in life, and we forget to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that whatever our ‘vice’ is, it is really just a means of distraction from death, or the thought of life. In other words, many are afraid to be alone with their thoughts. Students, in fact, cannot be alone with their thoughts for more than 2 minutes:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/TECHNOLOGY/STUDENTS-CANT-RESIST-DISTRACTION-TWO-MINUTES-NEITHER-CAN-YOU-1C9984270">
        https://www.nbcnews.com/TECHNOLOGY/STUDENTS-CANT-RESIST-DISTRACTION-TWO-MINUTES-NEITHER-CAN-YOU-1C9984270
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, comfort is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       bad. Still, it is a problem when people become so comfortable that they ignore the problems of the world and the evils of society. I believe that many simply do not believe in conspiracy theories because they may not have many chances to see the ‘discomfort’ that many experience. Sure, they may watch some videos or read some news articles, but ultimately, they can always go back to their comfort to avoid the suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are we distracting ourselves from? Could it simply be we do not want to be alone with our thoughts? Could it be 'they' do not us alone with our thoughts? If we are not entertained to death, we are working ourselves to death, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Materialism and Consumerism
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting to me that so many
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that we are infiltrated with materialism and consumerism, but still, many do not seem to care.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Christmas approaches (my least favorite holiday), I see how materialism and consumerism is used to help us avoid more profound questions of life and death. The new car, the new clothes, the new computer, the new phone…well, they will all make us feel more comfortable for a while, at least.
Unfortunately, most of the material world that people cherish so much is empty:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/physics-atoms-empty-space-2016-9">
        http://www.businessinsider.com/physics-atoms-empty-space-2016-9
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, energy exists, and it cannot be created or destroyed:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://futurism.com/the-physics-of-death/">
        https://futurism.com/the-physics-of-death/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while our material world is largely ‘empty’, something matters – something exists (whatever it is!)
      </p>
      <p>
       More and more try to find meaning through materialism and consumerism:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/uae/rising-materialism-a-threat-to-life-satisfaction-finds-uae-study-1.609455">
        https://www.thenational.ae/uae/rising-materialism-a-threat-to-life-satisfaction-finds-uae-study-1.609455
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, study after study (as the one above) shows, it simply does not make people happy. Again, thousands of foundational texts tell us this, but we do not listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fame, the fortune, the products, are NOT the meaning of life, but they certainly serve as distractions in the meantime.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Nihilism
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Death is a daily part of our lives, yet the only time we hear about it is in an abstract way, or unfortunately, a way that makes us more disconnected to it.
       <em>
        333 people died in bombing.
       </em>
       <em>
        15 dead after explosion.
       </em>
       *
       <em>
        27 died in gun fire.
       </em>
       You get the idea. Death, at times, seems beyond us. But I would argue, death is a part of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are not distracting ourselves to death, or buying the latest Apple gadget, or eating or drinking or whatever (insert vice here), we simply may evade talk about death altogether. Discussions of death are reserved for the religious zealots, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nihilism is on the rise in our society, in the world in general. While it may not be fair to equate atheism with nihilism, it is no surprise that atheism is on the rise:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/">
        https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Without God, what
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the meaning of life? It is no surprise that many have turned to nihilism, and pop culture is a reflection of that. In Rick and Morty, for example, the ultimate belief is that there is no meaning in life:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoyFaj8gbV8">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoyFaj8gbV8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the beginning of the video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV!”
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn’t that summarize our current cultural state?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could sit here all day and post the millions of references to nihilism in our culture, but the point is that many feel that “God is dead” and Nietzsche was right after all. If not, God is at least dying:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-god-dying/">
        https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-god-dying/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Nevertheless, the authors caution about drawing the Nietzschean conclusion that God is dead: “This does not mean that religiosity and religious behaviour have vanished or will vanish completely from people's lives: between 40% and 80% of European citizens exhibit at least a medium degree of religious belief according to the centrality index of religiosity.” Still, the trend is unmistakable in another statistic from the study. The percentage of people who said that they are “not religious or not very religious” is significant, and the figure for the U.S. (around 31 percent) matches that of other studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       A 2012 Pew Research Center survey, for example, found that the fastest-growing religious cohort in America are the “nones” (those with no religious affiliation) at 20 percent (32 percent of adults younger than 30), broken down into atheists and agnostics at 6 percent and the unaffiliated at 14 percent. The raw numbers are staggering: with the U.S. adult population (age 18 and older) at 240 million, this figure translates into 48 million nones, or 14.4 million atheists/agnostics and 33.6 million unaffiliated. That's a powerful voting block."
      </p>
      <p>
       Many believe that nothing matters, and that belief continues to grow, but what if something
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Immortality
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What is strange is that people DO want to live forever. Many want to live beyond 100, and I do not blame them:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/11/-sp-live-forever-extend-life-calico-google-longevity">
        https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/11/-sp-live-forever-extend-life-calico-google-longevity
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, though, if we were not as bombarded with distraction, would we really need to live that long? It seems that we just want to prolong the inevitable. Have you ever waited until the last minute to do that assignment? It seems like it procrastination on questions of life and death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, many believe that cyborgs are our future:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/02/21/516484639/are-cyborgs-in-our-future-homo-deus-author-thinks-so">
        https://www.npr.org/2017/02/21/516484639/are-cyborgs-in-our-future-homo-deus-author-thinks-so
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And apparently there is a 25-year wait for immortality:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.livescience.com/6967-hang-25-year-wait-immortality.html">
        https://www.livescience.com/6967-hang-25-year-wait-immortality.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever your beliefs, people want to extend their lives physically, but they refuse to look at the possibility that immortality could exist beyond death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, could it be possible that immortality is our current physical bodies is NOT possible? What if we are being lied to? Should we trust the science that told us we would have flying cars and hover boards by now? But again, even if it is possible, would you want it? Would it require that you lose an element of humanity to obtain immortality? Can humanity exist without death?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Fate and Freewill
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, do we have any type of freewill? If we do not, life is really meaningless, isn’t it?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I am going to argue that we have some free will.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is undeniable that much of our lives are dictated outside of our control. In many ways, we are subject to fate. We cannot control the families we are born into, what we look like, how poor or rich we are (mostly), or even how intelligent we are born. There is much beyond our control.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I still believe we have some free will, even if very little, and that is our struggle daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s suppose that 75% of our lives are out of control, and 25% of our lives are in control. ‘They’ want to control that 25 percent.
And we allow them to – through comfort and distraction as noted earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if we are getting tired of those distractions. What if they are not fulfilling us?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is our free will, and they want that, too. Have you heard about the future computer chips in our heads?

       This is not science fiction anymore. I believe the last step of control is to control our minds – the one thing we have left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, we may not be able to control much about our lives, but we still (for the most part) have control over our thoughts, and the actions they lead us to. What if they want control over that, too? It seems that they are in the process of it:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If we were to hypothetically merge our minds with machines, would we really be human anymore? Sure, we may not die, but what would be the point of living?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So what’s the point of it all?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot answer this question, but I can ask you to evaluate a few things that we are led to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Does consumerism and materialism make us happy? That answer seems to be a resounding “No.”:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/15/psychology-materialism_n_4425982.html">
        https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/15/psychology-materialism_n_4425982.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       *Are distractions making us happy? If we eat more, sleep more, drink more, and do whatever we want, will that make us happy? Well, over-consumption does not seem to be the cure to our problems:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/21/overconsumption-environment-relationships-annie-leonard">
        https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/21/overconsumption-environment-relationships-annie-leonard
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       *What about nihilism? What if nothing does matter? As stated earlier, that is quite the possibility, and our society seems to be promoting nihilism at every level. But maybe you have never heard of Pascal’s wager:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely a chance that nothing matters, but I think that it is likely that something does matter, and we are falling into a trap of nothing does.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So, what does make people happy?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are countless studies on why living for others makes us happy:

      <p>
       I can keep going.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am NOT saying that we need to give up everything. I am NOT saying that we need to stop doing things we enjoy. I am saying that living for ourselves does not seem to be the answer. After all, if no other person existed on our Earth besides YOU, would life matter at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that no matter what we try to fill our lives with, we are all going to die. Even if scientists are trying to say we can be immortal, would we really want that? As for immortality, I would not want to be confined to a body of a robot, or the control of a government system…but that’s just me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that I feel we are all avoiding the ultimately conspiracy. We never know when are where or how are going to die, but death does not discriminate. Life does, but not death.
      </p>
      <p>
       In death, we are all the same, and we will all become the same. Perhaps there is nothing, but what if there is something more?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you trust in science, then it seems that helping others is key.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we live not only for ourselves but for others as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look into my post history, it is clear what I believe – Again, I am not trying to preach to anybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       But are the drugs, the selfies, the food, the video games, the WHATEVER (insert here) fulfilling you? Chances are, likely not.
Am I saying that we should not have pleasure? ABSOLUTELY NOT!
I am saying we should not let pleasure distract us from the question, what is the meaning of life, if there is meaning at all…
I’ll end with a few quotes, as I like to do:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.” Dalai Lama
      </p>
      <p>
       Galatians 6:2 – “Carry each other’s burdens: and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.”
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘“We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.” ― Charles Bukowski”
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all going to die one day.

       Nothing and everything. If "being" doesn't matter then compared to nothingness, it matters infinitely. Every life is your chance to embody a virtue, to reach your potential, to make your mark on this world. The real conspiracy is nihilism. This life is whatever you make it to be, so why not choose the path of strength and grand experiences?

       The nature of reality has bent itself to allow us to exist. Shouldn't that be seen as a gift? This isn't random. This was provided. And if this is your only shot, all the more reason to take action, make something, experience a big life, and do good. You will go to death's door with a smile. Would you rather leave this with a grin or experience the universe tear you apart for your failings? The art of living is about preparing for saying goodbye to your loved ones and eventually yourself and your memories. This life is like a novel, don't skip chapters, don't skim over it, it's the only novel you have and you're otherwise stuck alone on a desert island and once you finish it you can't read it again because a storm is coming.

       How is that hard Proof? Plus, I've heard stories about people with near death experiences that saw nothing. As in saw some people experienced no afterlife. It's more rational to say "I have no idea what happens after we die."

       It's called the Holy Inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single being of this place we call heaven surround you while one of them asks, "Will you stay or do you want to return to Earth?" Often times, if the person has children or people he needs to take care of, they will keep insisting that the dead person returns. The moment the decision is made, the dead person moves backwards at lighting speed like a backwards rollercoaster all the way back into the body where the soul basically crashes like a truck. It's said to be a tough experience. That person either wakes up in the process of being revived by some Dr or whatever or time itself alters so that the person doesn't die in the first place.

       Well at least I've figured out how somebody manages to post so much, thought it was a shared account, turns out it's just similar arguments recycled over and over again with different titles.

       So, what's the meaning of life?

       My posts do have similar themes, yes. Not ashamed. I did write this all today from my thoughts though. No copying and pasting here.

       Have you ever written even one post on this sub? Seems all you do is attack people.

      <p>
       Just because you have the need for there to be meaning or not doesn't mean it exists.  The need to create meaning out of something so impossible to categorize leads to the nonsense and manipulation of religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life simply 'is'.  Asking people on the internet whether or not it has meaning isn't going to solve the issue for anybody.

       Because we have vastly different philosophies.  You believe that some magical being in the universe grants people the right to enslave and murder people based on what some book says, I vehemently disagree with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You feel the need to categorize something as incredibly complex as "life", something that took billions of years to come to exist, into two categories, either "has meaning" or "doesn't have meaning".  I think it's far more complicated and disagree.

       When you say “Life simply ‘is’.” , you are answering his question in that there is no meaning. You see, there either is or there is not. Do you actually believe you are so high and mighty, that you were presented the luxury of being placed on this planet with no purpose? This is all a lesson. You are learning everyday. Life is a culmination of your experiences and teachings. When you die you will have realized at that exact moment what your purpose was and why you were sent to Earth. You aren’t so special to have received this opportunity for nothing. After a hard day of being overtaxed and overworked simply treat others how you would like to be treated - the golden rule. You should find meaning in that my friend.

       No there isn't, again, there is no need to categorize something as infinitely complex as life into columns A and B.  Maybe it has meaning, maybe it doesn't, maybe it can't be categorized.  By trying to categorize something so complicated, people allow for things like religion to sprout, which through its categorization of what life means, allowed people to literally determine that other people's lives were less valuable than theirs.

       Individual lives may very well have a purpose, that doesn't mean the concept of "life" has a meaning.

       I do treat others how I want to be treated.  I want my beliefs to be challenged, my philosophies to be critiqued and evaluated.  I want others to point out where I'm wrong, and I especially want to be shown where my beliefs have a negative impact on others (such as when it comes  to religious beliefs).

       The neurological system is one of the most complex things we have ever encountered.  Couple this with everything else it takes to create "life" and you are left with something unbelievably complicated, that took billions of years to come together.

       The idea of being alive vs. dead isn't so complicated, the idea of how that life came to be in the first place is incredibly complicated.

       Maybe through their potential impact on the world and environment around them.  Or their ability to be remembered by others after death.  There are many ways an individual can have a purpose, that doesn't necessarily mean that the concept of life has any inherent meaning.

       The body is a complex design. Life itself is not.

       I don't know I get the feeling we live in a time where people are just waiting for death to come. Hoping for it in many cases. They aren't suicidal people just people that would be okay with not being here. Their will to live has been suffocated by all the "stuff". By the mask that they wear constantly out in society. People aren't living the lives they want to live, rather living the lives they think they should live, or how society tells them to live. Or they are "forced" to live certain ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       To afraid to be real in this chaotic time. Our will to live is what is being sapped. Our will to live fulfilled lives I should say rather. Our basic instinct to stay alive is very much intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps my view on this is biased this is how I viewed the world for a long time. My view has changed but it was one I held for a long stretch of time.

       Ultimately it is hell on earth. Hell is a prison in which we create ourselves. We have the key to the cell and can escape our prison. But our thinking mind (ego) keeps us held in the cell. The tool that births our own understanding of the world is what keeps us from living in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to escape hell would be to enact your will on to the world rather than stifling it. 
How do we overcome the thinking mind? This is where I'm stuck. How do I become untethered to the self. To become whole. If I continue to view myself as my mind then I can never full become the true embodiment of self. I am body mind and soul, but mind thinks himself above all others.

       Yes, a tool can't be evil. It is the "deceiver" in my eyes though. I'm not a biblical person but if I had to refer to something a kin to Satan it be our ego, father of all lies. Who judges us more than ourselves? I can't think anyone more harsh a judge of my own character than myself.

       Great thought.

       The ego is a tool. Like technology. Like the pen. Like the sword.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can use it for good or evil.
      </p>

       But the ego does not need to be vilified. Without it, we would not be human.

       This contradicts current mainstream religions like Buddhism, I know.

       Oh don't worry I think the ego is important and it has it's place. I'm just stuck on it becoming a tool again for myself. A lot of my own thoughts have placed a very negative perception of myself and overcoming that perception has been a struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ego still has more of a hold on me than I on it. If that makes any sense.

       "Try to understand the ego. Analyze it, dissect it, watch it, observe it, from as many angles as possible. And don't be in a hurry to sacrifice it, otherwise the greatest egoist is born: the person who thinks he is humble, the person who thinks that he has no ego.

       "That is again the same story played on a more subtle level. That's what the religious people have been doing down the ages – pious egoists they have been. They have made their ego even more decorated; it has taken the color of religion and holiness. Your ego is better than the ego of a saint; your ego is better, far better – because your ego is very gross, and the gross ego can be understood and dropped more easily than the subtle. The subtle ego goes on playing such games that it is very difficult. One will need absolute awareness to watch it."

       I'm not sure if we are in hell or not.  Every day I try to "enact my will on the world" and improve it, but it rejects me.  So the world is telling me that you'll be rewarded if you cave in and sell your soul.  Makes me think this is actually hell, or some intro level to it... and only those who choose evil get rewarded here.

       If I'm being quite honest I frequently fantasize about catastrophic events quite frequently, not because I wish for people to die or the world to be fucked but just to break the monotony of life. I often feel bad about it too because I have a 4 year old and a loving family and I really should be happy about life, when it comes to my son I am but everything else about it sucks. I work 70 hours a week most weeks, every day feels the same almost like I'm imprisoned so I imagine apocalyptic times so that I may actually have some purpose no matter the pain, it sounds fucked up when I'm even typing it but it's true. I don't know how else to explain it really, I don't necessarily want to die but I don't want to live like this for the rest of my life and I don't see a way out with the responsibilities that I have and suicide isn't an option so part of me hopes for something to shake things up.

       You aren't alone friend. These thoughts are because we aren't living a fulfilled life I suspect. You work hard, to make sure your needs are met, but we neglect the need to be ourselves. You work work work to be the good provider. But that isn't your whole being. You know that there must be something more defining to yourself. But who has the time to define themselves? When you must worry about all the "things" and fill all the roles "society" has given you. Or the roles you have given yourself. When is it enough to just be yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it we are scared to make the necessary changes that will allow ourselves to be happy. We constantly see the wrong in this world and it is hard to see the good. Have we become too jaded?
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds messed up but I do know where you are coming from. I think we just forgot our reason to be alive. No body gives us a reason besides ourselves and if we can't muster up the strength to redefine why we are alive I am willing to bet we will have a regretful life.

       Yeah, my work is so unfulfilling, I work 12 hours a day 6 days a week most weeks sitting in front of a computer at home by myself processing paperwork not really making any difference in anything and the money I make is basically non existent because it's immediately spent once it hits the bank account and I have no real social interactions besides that of my son and some family members. Some days I feel like I'm just going to break mentally, not like break and go on a crime spree or anything like that, just break and say what the fuck is the point of this shit? Literally the only thing that keeps me going is my son, love him to pieces and he's the reason I work so much to make sure he's taken care of, but for what? So he can end up in the same cycle? I really hope not, I'm hoping he takes a path in life that allows him to feel fulfilled and happy, perhaps things may change by then but I'm not hopeful. I feel like the only thing that can truly change it is some type of catastrophic event that forces people to come together, or a shakeup in the power structure of world leaders, just something huge that effects everyone whether it be positive or negative but it almost feels as if something has to really break in order to make people want to fix it.

       I think we've got to change our thinking. WE are hoping for some type pf catastrophic event because we are tired of this and don't want other generations to suffer. Yet we don't have enough will power to try and make a change. So the next best thing to us is having the world as it is fall apart. We'd get some satisfaction knowing it won't be the same either way. But really we just need to start shifiting our thoughts on how we can make change in our own life. Change that will directly align with our inner goals. And by so pursuing our own inner passions they will help reflect outward. If we don't then the world will never know our own ideals. Our chance to ensure any semblance of the world we envision in our mind might never come to exist because we never took the risk.

       I am speaking to you and me in these comments because it seems we both need a pick me up. Sometimes I have positive thoughts but can't really get the message across unless I'm speaking to others. I'm such a hypocritical person. I love to give out advice but it is rather hard to make use of my own advice.  So I speak to both parties typically through my comments. More projecting than anything.

       Gotta start loving ourselves man. I think it is hard to love ourselves when the work we do we don't value.

       Yeah, I feel ya, I've contemplated just shaking things up for myself and finding a different line of work to see if that helps, the problem I run into is that I make decent money that's going to be difficult to find starting at a new company in the line of work I do. I have no particular trade skills or college education and I have to make sure I'm able to provide for my son so that complicates things, I've also contemplated doing something on the side to make a little extra money and perhaps find something worth eventually creating my own business with but I've been getting dumped on with overtime for the past 6 months with no end in sight so time is a huge complication. My life is not nearly as bad as it could be and I am happy when I'm with my son, it's just not nearly as fulfilling as I'd like it to be. I'm the same as you by the way, I'm great at giving others advice but I'm terrible at creating solutions to my own problems even though I usually know what has to be done, right now I just feel stuck in the mud really. I'm still hopeful that things can change someday and until that day I just gotta keep grinding.

       Yes sir. Hope to see you around here. You got this man. Every day just do something that actually makes you happy. Something small. I've been doing free writes, it is becoming more clear that writing has been a passion I should consider pursuing. Even if it is just a self published something. I won't know unless I give it a shot. Maybe you can get into 3d printing, you can buy a relatively cheap machine and download premade files of printable things, might find a niche market of things to sell on amazon and can be fun trying to learn how to design different things on your own.

       I think it is something cool a friend of mine has been doing. I'm not really computer savvy or that invested in the tech to take more of an interest other than to say it is pretty neat.

       Thanks for the ideas, you should definitely stick to writing if it makes you happy. I'm still kind of searching for that thing and I'm 33 years old, still young in the grand scheme of things thankfully so hopefully I get there someday soon. Either way I'm gonna keep my head up and do the damn thing, thanks for the conversation my friend.

       Yeah I'm not really talking a localized event, I'm talking a global event where earth just kind of presses the reset button and people gotta figure out where to go from there, I'm not saying it'd be fun or exciting but it would give the world another chance to do it right, like I said though it's just fantasies due to an absolutely mundane life I don't actually want people to die or the world to end. Though some kind of event that targets specifically corrupt/evil politicians and hollywood folks wouldn't be unwelcome.

        I don't know I get the feeling we live in a time where people are just waiting for death to come. Hoping for it in many cases. They aren't suicidal people just people that would be okay with not being here. Their will to live has been suffocated by all the "stuff".

       My cousin and I recently had a discussion about this. I didn't think it was too common, but he was telling me, he's kind of just living life and going through the motions, and doesn't care if he dies. I see him posting about being out drinking and getting high all the time. People are starting to get into their vices too much. The sad thing is, many people only consider "Vices" as things like Cigarettes, Alcohol, drugs, etc. But a vice could be engaging in too much TV or video games.
      </p>

       It's depressing to see this isn't just something I've felt. I'm glad it's getting some attention though.

       The time is now to speak about our problems and start addressing them. It's always been that time, I'm just now embracing that idea.  Chin up, we can help ourselves out of this mess, and by reshaping our lives it will help others find the will to reshape their own.

       How does someone with a life sentence feel? Why do they feel this way? What would be different if they were out of prison instead of within? Seek to expand the mind and travel across the multi-vese. See the worlds both infinitely small and infinitely big and realize how complex it all is. Try not to get lost in the currents.

        What is odd to me is many live as though they are not going to die. It is interesting that the same themes seem to persist in literature and history throughout time, but they are largely ignored
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A central theme for Achilles in the Iliad is the concept of Kleos- eternal fame after death. Achilles was given a choice- live to a ripe old age, but die a nobody. Or die young but be forever known. Achilles chose the latter, in order to obtain Kleos, though when Odysseus sees him in Hades in the Odyssey he regrets this decision, preferring to have lived instead. As you said, this is a central theme of much of human literature, but I find it amazing that in the beginning of the Western Canon, the Iliad, among such variate themes this one is prominent as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Piggybacking off of this, the ancient Greeks were quite preoccupied with death and legacy. They're thoughts were that there are two things that guarantee one "lives on"- Children, and the work one produces. In this sense, the Iliad and Odyssey serve as Homer's children, themes which far outlived him and ensured his place in History and our collective conscious.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In our current society, I do not think we have any issue focusing on the present. We have countless means of pleasure to keep us entertained and distracted. “Amusing Ourselves to Death” has some interesting perspective on this:

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "Panem et Circensis"- bread and circuses. I believe that this is an intentional distraction put upon us. Consumerism and post-industrial Capitalism play their part, but to me they are only factors of the trend towards living
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       for the present, as well as nihilism. What is important to note, however, is that those in power do not live this way. They think of their legacy, of their actions, of what they will leave behind. The think of their own
       <em>
        Kleos
       </em>
       . It is only for the masses to be distracted and to live in the present. Those who have power know that their actions will stand as a testament to their lives, and act accordingly.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Without God, what is the meaning of life? It is no surprise that many have turned to nihilism, and pop culture is a reflection of that. In Rick and Morty, for example, the ultimate belief is that there is no meaning in life:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have said this before but I will say it again. If there is nothing after death, if we truly are not but star guts assembled together, the universe experiencing itself, then Life becomes all the more precious. What matters are our conscious human brothers and sisters who are lucky enough to share this moment in time, to experience this grand universe with us. To live for each other is to be fulfilled, if all there is is
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is undeniable that much of our lives are dictated outside of our control. In many ways, we are subject to fate. We cannot control the families we are born into, what we look like, how poor or rich we are (mostly), or even how intelligent we are born. There is much beyond our control.
But I still believe we have some free will, even if very little, and that is our struggle daily.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree. What we
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       control, however, is what we do with what we are given. Do those born into bad homes continue the cycle of abuse with their children, or break it? Do those born in good homes share their good upbringing with others in the way the interact with their fellow humans daily? To quote the old Sunday School song This Little Light of Mine- "Hide it under a bush oh no, I'm gonna let it shine". Do we take the gifts, talents, experiences, and adversity that we all face in one way or another, and turn it into something that helps our fellow human beings on this cosmic conscious journey we find ourselves on together? Or do you selfishly live only for the now, at the expense of all others?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Further, could it be possible that immortality is our current physical bodies is NOT possible? What if we are being lied to? Should we trust the science that told us we would have flying cars and hover boards by now? But again, even if it is possible, would you want it? Would it require that you lose an element of humanity to obtain immortality? Can humanity exist without death?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I felt this was the best part from your section on immortality to quote. An apt question, honestly. Death
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a part of the human experience. In Tolkien's works, that was the gift given to men- mortality. That they might see the importance of their brief lives and do their best to live for on another and improve their world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not buy into the futurists of today. Especially those like Ray Kurzweil, who are convinced our Consciousness will be uploaded to computers within our lifetime. That will
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be you. At best, it will be a copy, an exact copy, but a copy nonetheless. The emergent system of the parts that make us unique, conscious individuals will die when your body does.
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       will be dead, but a perfect copy lives on. If that's the case, what's the damn point? If I, personally, am not experiencing life, why do I care if some digital copy of me is?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we ought to live our lives for each other, as best we can, so that if you are lucky enough to live past 100, you can look back on your life in your dying days and say: "I do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       regret it".
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, as I stated earlier, if there is nothing after death then what matters are each other. Our fellow human brothers and sisters, lucky enough to be conscious at this point in time of our vast, expanding, 13.8 billion year old universe. To live for each other is to live for more than the present. It is to live for the future, to sacrifice so that your children will have better lives, so that the
       <em>
        worlds
       </em>
       children might have better lives than we did. We must remember that each of us, simply by existing, has fundamentally altered the base nature of reality. What we choose to do, how we choose to spend our lives, what we commit our time and effort to, will determine whether that impact is large or small, whether it is remembered or not. To live for one another is to live for the future, and to ensure that even if you are forgotten, through your actions your life is remembered, even if not consciously.

       What's interesting to me about all this is how the 9/11 "event" programming reinforced ALL of the points you make in your essay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comfort/Living in the Present---9/11 programmed a sense of necessary immediacy; anything can happen! You could be dead in an instant! Live for Now, Now, Now!!! Which feeds into....
      </p>
      <p>
       Materialism/Consumerism---If we could all be dead tomorrow, we better acquire and consume "things" to help us enjoy the moment. Remember how that cocksucker George W. told us in the days after 9/11 we all needed to go shopping to show our faith in the economy and keep the Market afloat. I actually even bought into that shit at the time. At least I didn't buy a new car when all the dealerships and carmakers were touting their special sales "honoring" the dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nihilism--So if we're not going to embrace unity in the wake of 9/11 but instead pursue a "Just do it now" materialism, the natural cynical response is nihilism. Not to mention the nihilism that comes from the creeping suspicion your own government was behind the 9/11 attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       [You get a bonus point for the Rick &amp; Morty reference, but you are being selective in your criticism of its nihilism; in episode 0201, Rick, on the verge of certain death after sacrificing himself for Morty, and when he thinks nobody is listening, prays for Morty to grow a "better man" than he is, and even asks for a way of rescue. Of course, right after he says that, he figures out a way to escape, and, once back to safely, is all "F#ck you, God! You don't exist!" But the underlying joke there is that God DOES exist, he helped Rick out, and Rick is just a nihilist asshole. It's this type of ambiguity that makes R&amp;M more than just your typical Illuminati/Luciferian/satanic/lizard people/McDonald's Szechuan sauce programming].
      </p>
      <p>
       Immortality---You're on the right track here, but I think we should look to how people view TV and media as the way they seek immortality. It's not coincidence that "Reality TV" really blew up (no pun intended) after 9/11. More and more people became, in Andy Warhol's term, "famous for 15 minutes." I'm not sure people literally want to live forever (yes, the blood drinking satanic aristocracy, but not everybody), but they see "being on TV" as a way to immortalize themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fate &amp; Freewill---not even much sure people even thing about this anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding Happiness---Friends and experience bring happiness. Not material object collection and passive entertainments.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was an occult ritual, long in the planning, to shift human consciousness towards fear, materialism, self-obsession and a sick death fascination/repellant.
      </p>

       Great read thankyou.. we often talk about the past the present and the future and in my mind nothing exists except the present there is nothing to grab hold of in the past or the future they are just memories or ideas . So living in the present doing as much as you can leads to some sort of fulfillment wether it's helping someone out or surfing all day . The last thing people want to think about is death ..it's a tricky part of the future that most of are afraid of.

       Great point! What if we changed how we teach about death to children? Of course not so...intensely...

       I just wanted to say, great post! I, too, often think about death, the actual moment of death and the afterlife. It's just such an intriguing subject and your post has definitely been thought provoking and we'll done. Also, I enjoy seeing other women on Conspiracy!

        We
       </strong>
       are
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       going to die one day. This is very important to realize, but not in a shock or negatively observed viewpoint. 
I think a lot of the themes from buddhism, taoism, and the use of psychedelics should be discussed here. 
We being humans are going to die. As well as the animals around us. As well as our environment. And eventually, if you want to try and grasp the idea, the universe will "die" (or get so slow and cold where as nothing will be in motion). 
But, the good news is, we live in a constant state of change, death, and growth. We are incredibility interconnected with the reality around us. From the microcosm to the macro, even if our minds say we are separate, there is a great deal of evidence for the contrary. 
What I am trying to get at is, however impossible it is to understand our existence, the fact is, we exist! And so does a hell of a lot of other "stuff". No matter how you look at it, from nihilism through the spectrum to ultimate purpose, we are all on this ride, we are all part of an ever-changing interacting interconnected reality, where our perceptions of life and death will continuously be in question.

       Perhaps it comes down to the simple thought, you must find/make your own meaning.

       Perhaps even further, it may come down to choice.

       Thanks for the post! I'm not sure how it pertains to any conspiracy, but it naturally resonated with me (also, I found this to be a fine spot to have interesting discussions regardless of secrets and plots).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a fine balance between cynicism and honest humility when dealing (both personally and as a society) with our absurd existence. Many of the monumental texts written throughout history (from "The Epic of Gilgamesh" to "East of Eden", if I'm allowed to paint with broad strokes) toy with this balance, which makes this struggle seem even more futile. With that context in mind, I actually see many of the modern cultural references to nihilism you pointed out as fairly optimistic. The Rick &amp; Morty quote is a good example of that - it acknowledges the personal crisis, extends it to human reality, and tries to find solace in fellowship (though TV does also serve as a distraction there). It looks for simplicity and companionship as an answer to these immensely complex question. Not a philosophical answer, but a practical one. I think this does much to counter the cynical,  hedonistic, and desperate way nihilism usually presents itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way of thinking (which I personally espouse) also presents a challenge for us humans - surviving. Not just in the literal, genetic sense, but also spiritually and intellectually. The universe is a vast, meaningless, 13.7 billion-year-old entity that doesn't care about our flimsy existence; also, as far as we can tell, we are the only organisms that attempt, slowly and contextually, to add meaning to it. If that is the case, then clearly the preservation of our own communities and histories is our only guard against the ultimate void.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's my take - I'm fine with my personal death if I manage to live a simple life that generally benefits others, and dread a post-history future where any amount of meaning any human has tried to attribute to our existence will have been in vein.

       I think the conspiracy here is that none of want to think of death...or we are too distracted to think of death.

       The topic of death just isn't discussed on a human level in my opinion.

       We are inside a controlled energy farm and are basically cattle that have cars, iphones and go on vacations.  When this world finally breaks you down to physical death, you are Forced to Reincarnate after a brief afterlife period. There is no meaning and no advancement from this. It is "Enslavement"...

       I think this is a better solution than both mainstream organized religion as well as the new age lunacy. Be a happy victim... WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think polkadotgirl's version of Christianity as well as my own beliefs as a universalist theist line up well with this best, but I'm still learning. I think what Cameron Day says makes a lot of sense, finding the light within oneself and others rather than malevolent and manipulative beings pretending to be two different sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is what puts me at ease spiritually and emotionally as well as motivates me best to be better and quit being such an asshole. I need to live my life to the fullest now. I'm 21. I'll never be normal but I can at least get my shit together internally now.

       I don't know what PDG would think of Cameron Day's views though.

       There's only one way to escape, and it's not through our own power. The idea that you can "ascend" through inner enlightenment is yet another lie--a trap disguised as an exit. "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it." (Matthew 19:24)

       Would it make sense that altruism and compassion is the narrow gate? The road leading to life can be interpreted as the hard work and perseverance of character needed to be continually able to help people despite setbacks.

       Interesting write up. Quick question, do you think this living in the moment outlook (YOLO) you mention is the corrupting of the living now tenet of Buddhism?

       Fantastic post. Here is just my humble opinion based on my life experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watch my mom die in hospital due to leukemia. Besides the horror of watching a loved-one slowly fade before your eyes... when she finally passed. It’s hard to explain in writing, her energy... what made her an individual was gone. I felt it and saw it with my own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not smart enough to say for sure that there is something after death (I do personally, believe in one), but there is an energy to us... to life.
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife’s dad passed away 6 months later after my mom and the same experiences were felt when he passed... his energy was gone... what made him, him was gone.  If I’ve done a shit job explaining, I’m sorry. But there is a definite energy to us... all of us.

       It's true, what they say, there is a soul.  As a hardcore atheist/skeptic, I eventually came to this conclusion after a lot of psychedelic experiences.

       this is definitely a conspiracy, what does everything posted in conspiracy matter if it all ends in death? i came here looking for something like this tonight and you have made my life better for reading it. My brother died when he was 16 but before that he always wondered what happened when we die and that is something that has stuck with me since.

       I'm a Nihilist. It's actually helped me cope with life. There's a lot of things I can still live for, I can still appreciate people I love but I'm not going to pretend like these feelings are anything more than what they are.

       There's no afterlife, so the matter of taking care of each other isn't just a moral thing, it's an urgent one as well. That's why I have no patience for ideologies that actively value things like  anti semitism, something rampant on this sub. They all start their arguments with their conclusion, that people need to be separated racially, and attempt to use logic to prove this emotional, ie illogical assertion. It appeals to the absolute worst in a person, and we're better than that.

       Your question implies that only an afterlife can imbue meaning in this life- I don't accept that. Who did you let become the arbiter of what you find meaningful? That's important.
      </p>
      <p>
       We ultimately create and cultivate our own meaning, it's an individual decision each one of us makes.

       First off.. very well laid-out.  I am a fan of your thinking.  I agree with most of what you put down there, but let me push you a little further anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that death serves a vital role for life.  First of all it offers contrast, like light to dark, life could not exist without it's lack.  This is extremely important because it is what gives life ITS VALUE!  When you stop and are aware of your inevitable conclusion, the life you have and the actions you make will be much more wisely chosen and prioritized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every one of you, if three different random people came up to you and told you "you have one week to live"... I imagine you would think differently about how you were going to spend that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all live incorporated lives, unknowing (or begrudgingly) participants of the very same system we criticize here on r/conspiracy.  We allow the economy to eat up more of the natural Earth.  And many of us do it punching time cards for bosses and activities that we loath.
      </p>
      <p>
       The old story of selling your soul to the devil I believe is a metaphor for the worst crime we all commit.  We sell our lives, our livelihoods, and many times our morals and beliefs, every day, going to work and paying our taxes.  Imagine this.  You have a life!  A chunk of time to spend on a beautiful blue green jewel, where amazing produce grows on trees thanks to our Sun, and where all sorts of bizzare, and beautiful things can occur.  You are givin a heart, a mind, a pair of hands, and a voice... and you get to do choose a life to build.  Its absolutely miraculous, and blows my mind everytime I think of the strawberries we have in Oregon.  I CHOOSE TO MAKE SOME ASSHOLE RICH WITH MY TIME AND LIFE ESSENCE!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to keep us complicit in building the world "They" want, is to keep us in the unconscious state.  Unconscious of the corruption sure, but also unconscious of the value we have, and to keep us squandering our life-force.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen glimpses of purpose and true happiness in this world, usually when I help another, or accomplish something.  But the amount of people depressed in their lives, and self-medicating with "pleasure" or "distraction" .  "Please let this bottle put to rest the thought that I hate my life!"(thats a whole other topic to go off on)
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep the high quality stuff coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       And please all you warriors out there looking for truth!!  Know you are powerful, and have the power to re-invent yourlife. Through this process of personal growth you CAN change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gandhi was a wise mother fucker
"Be the change you wish to see in the world."

       Isn't that more along the lines of social engineering possibly? I have noticed some friends that have to be positive positive positive. Also when trying to confide in some people about personal problems, they will move on quickly, ignore it all together, and even distance themselves from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this could be a conspiracy to have people isolate themselves from society. I have noticed too many times of people not intervening when someone else is in some kind of distress. My own family even tells me to not give rides to people, don't interact with the homeless,  and mind your own business. If we continue to separate ourselves into religions, races, classes, and not help each other, then we are more vulnerable to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like that Burger King or McDonald's experiment of having some kid get bullied in front of some of their customers and only a handful actually stood up to defend the boy. While they also purposefully screwed up customer's sandwiches and found 90-something% of them came to complain about their sandwich. We have moved to a more narcissistic and egotistical culture. Although individualism is good as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus preaches to love thy enemy, but most people don't care or are too afraid to love thy neighbor. Makes me think that the opposite must be conditioned to turn the world into what they want.

       no one to comfort me ..
      </p>
      <p>
       im going to be alone ... forever ...just me .. my thoughts .. and memories .. oh god why didnt i do something with my life so i could dye happy ?
      </p>
      <p>
       im going to miss every body .. are they going to miss me ?
      </p>
      <p>
       oh god why...
      </p>
      <p>
       this is how i imagine it will be for me when i die .. what i learned from this is make memories . good ones . touch peoples heart , inspire others . be honest and respectful , show patients and tolerance for what i dont understand and never push someone to do something they dont feel confident or capable of doing   , selfless acts , not for ego and never turn down a conversation from a stranger unless you dont feel comfortable .
      </p>
      <p>
       make memories you can take to the grave with and know that your life passing my your eyes takes longer than you think .. you have forever in death , read books that make you think .. you will have plenty of time to think about them when youre dead and dont have company to talk to .

       I think the reason psychedelics are illegal is because they have a tendency to wash away the consumerist ideal we are brought up in and makes you think about what your life means.  That's a scary idea to those who seek to control consciousness.

       At the end of the day, it is the beliefs in peoples minds that determine power.  Even if someone is holding a gun to your head - it's what they believe that ultimately matters, whether they believe they have to shoot you or not, not the gun. The entire control structure is dependent on keeping consciousness at a low state, making it easier to manipulate belief.

       There is nothing to fear in death. It is as natural as birth. A life after death or not, I take comfort in knowing it’s just another movement of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the idea of reincarnation. But not the idea that I, myself, am reborn as another person but rather that the birth of another person, who understands themselves as “I” just as you and I consider ourselves “I”, is just another iteration of the same type of consciousness we have.

       I am only afraid of death insofar that I will miss out on the future and that my loved ones will of course be greatly saddened. I am a person of faith, not religion, but faith. When it comes to questions of this nature I do not believe any one approach or “answer” is true for everyone,  as perceptions can differ so greatly between individuals. If God exists why can’t our understanding of that being be oriented to our individual perceptions? If God exists then that being can most certainly represent itself in infinite forms. I think it is very important for individuals to come to their own understanding of God and, as such, death outside of the great religious institutions that rule the planet. Use them as guides and pull from them the wisdom that is to be found there but living dogmatically by one or the other is constraining and suppressive to human mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I say pick a philosophy that aligns well with your direct experience even if it ends up atheistic or nihilistic, just be sure your philosophy is benevolent and life affirming rather than life denying.

       might want to travel some or read some history for perspective.   life is pretty big,  considering what hubble has seen.  now,  sure, here in the us their is a lot of dispair and hopelessness right now.   end of empire?   call it depression.  not the first depression either!   its like a vortex,  falling into void,  the will to live can wane.   don't give in,  wait it out.  with you or without you,  life goes on, its big.   cheer up,  even if its a cynical humor,   survival is not really an overall issue.  its not as serious as you might think.

       Take it a step further for me. I buy all of your arguments. But what is the conspiracy? Why don't "they" want us to think about our death. Why do "they" want to distract us from our death with entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it more likely that a bunch of people who don't want to die and want to distract themselves from the thoughts of death made distraction gadgets (phones, cars, material items) for others to use for the same purpose?

       Well yes the purpose would be to see if you are fit for heaven or for a greater war beyond this planet, as examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then I see sellouts living in luxury and wonder if that's not the purpose here, and they're the ones who have it figured out.  Trying to help people and be a good person has brought nothing but misery to my life.  No good deed goes unpunished, apparently, is the cardinal rule of whatever asshole runs this universe.

       This attitude is the attitude the people in power want. Hopeless powerless waiting for death.
Life is a gift and god and spirit is key to our future.

       Being of aware of death is like being aware the sky is blue, every great mind knew there was more to life than just physical reality. I would suggest reading a book called the infinite way by Joel goldsmith. Try meditation seriously as well. Life is a gift, have you ever considers your spirit chose to have a physical experience?

       Enjoy life work hard. earn something for yourself be productive don't let the media that controls our thoughts make you feel powerless.  Be fucking grateful because I have experienced death first hand and life is filled with more meaning than anyone could believe. Or understand . Think about everything you take for granted, think about how material existence is both beautiful and horrifying yet our mortal consciousness can not understand it. Read more philosophy than just a couple of hip nihilist who shall remain nameless. Everyday I wish my sister was still alive and could see the new stranger things or hug my mother or me again and then I read posts like this which remind me she left a
Group of ungrateful children who squander the gift of life. Your diatribe is  a sophomoric understanding of life but a popular one. You can join the apathetic masses who are ready to give up. When the real fight hasn't begun. Disappointed in this sub lately it used to celebrate life.  I hope you can find meaning in the life, I'd say it's life's greatest adventure !

       You have never met Robert Gadling? Or Li Ching-Yuen? There are others. You would never know them as they stay out the light most of the time. But, once photography came along and now video and facial recognition it will be harder to hide.

       In Mount Athos in Greece, the epicenter of Orthodox monastic tradition and practice, there is a man who is (was?) dedicated to doing the sole job of walking around the church sanctuary, whispering into other monks' ears: "Brother, remember that you are going to die."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is in part of the belief that you should be focusing more on your eternal salvation rather than your earthly life since our time here is limited. Eternal salvation is achieved through humility, good works, faith in Christ's salvific promise, and participation in the Holy Sacraments. If you want to make the statement more secular, you can say that this is a Memento Mori of sorts - constant reminders of death and mortality should push us to live wholesome, meaningful lives - whether or not there's an 'other side' when we pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own personal philosophy on these "big questions" has always been this: My choice to believe in Christ and be a practicing Christian is my own, and does not interfere with the lives of others. That being said, I believe that choosing to follow the tenets of my faith will undoubtedly leave a positive mark on this Earth when my time comes - and if it just so happens that when it all fades to black that it stays that way, then let me enjoy my peaceful, eternal rest. It is enough knowing that there will be people who will remember you for the good you did for others while you were here. Goodness never goes unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To all who read this comment: Remember that you are going to die. Therefore, make haste to commit yourself to goodness in every shape and form.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to OP: Thank you for putting my thoughts into writing.

       We are all going to transition.  Heck, we are all transitioning right now - at this very moment - every moment of every day in fact.  What is called “death” is simply a slightly larger wave in the ocean of existence than the average small to medium size waves that go unnoticed by most of us on an everyday basis.

       Well, depending upon what one calls, defines, and or categorizes as “hell”, there is
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       a hell.  “Hell” as “a place of ETERNAL DAMNATION!” doesn’t exist, but hell as a place of
       <em>
        relative
       </em>
       damnation where one might get tortured and subjected to much negativity and difficulty I have no doubt
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       indeed exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matter of fact, there are place right here on this very planet that fit that exact description, so “hell” in that sense is most definitely real.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, and again, hell as a place of overwhelming and unbearable negativity that simply continues on and on “for all of eternity!” is a logical contradiction in terms and does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, I understand your saying that you don’t want to transition to any place of negativity.  I wouldn’t imagine that anyone does really.  We have to understand that transitions, by their very nature, undulate - they ebb and flow.  Some are better than others.  Certain states are more positive and relatively blissful, and others are more negative and relatively difficult.  Where one ends up depends on many things, I imagine - not the least of which includes one’s actions and what one learns while in their current incarnation, as well as how one proceeds in succeeding manifestations thereon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lead a good, strong, positive, focused, determined life, and it seems that this will at least influence your energy in such a manner that you will not transition to any place of ultimate ruin.  Educate yourself as much as possible along the way as well so as to continue to learn, evolve, and develop.  I’m not sure

       It's quite possible 'they' do not want us thinking of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further I don't think they can make us physically immortal. I think that is a lie they are telling people to not seek God.

       I think my post is more on the philosophical side, but I think there are different conspiracies throughout.

       I can see your point, but at the same time I think people are obsessed with death externally.  Look at the "wars" going on, violence on TV, movies and video games.  I think most people are unconsciously obsessed with death.  People make everyday lifestyle decisions that move them closer to death.  Am I going to have that soda or water?  Am I going to stress out about this little insignificant thing or move on to something more important?

       The global elite who own the media are luciferians. It’s designed to distract us from God and what happens to our souls when we die. As long as e are ignorant about God we won’t know to obey Him to avoid hell.

       Life is your place to decide whether to chase immediate pleasure, living to please yourself, or to chase life everlasting, living to please God. The battle for your mind and behavior is the biggest conspiracy nobody knows about. It is brushed off as spiritual nonsense. The biggest trick the devil ever pulled is convincing most everyone he doesn't exist. He knows that our actions and choices in this life define what comes after it. And he wants humanity gone. So how would someone go about getting us to behave in a way contradictory to our true good nature, being we are created in the image of a perfect being?
      </p>
      <p>
       What you output in your life is dependent on how you process the available input. Knowledge is power, control the available knowledge and you control the types of behavior exhibited. Glamorize instant gratification, shiny things, materialism. Create a general mindset of money over everything. Sing clever rap songs about it. Attack and ridicule religion. Popularize and promote humanism.
      </p>

       Sounds like the 20th century in a nutshell.

       Thanks for the ideas, you should definitely stick to writing if it makes you happy. I'm still kind of searching for that thing and I'm 33 years old, still young in the grand scheme of things thankfully so hopefully I get there someday soon. Either way I'm gonna keep my head up and do the damn thing, thanks for the conversation my friend.
