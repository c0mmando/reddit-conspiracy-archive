       In the book of Genisis, our life-bringer aka God introduced advanced sentience to earth with adam and eve. God's civilization is so incredibly advanced they have mastered the key to perpetual life, it is Satan, the fallen one, who has started the war against good and evil, and brought disease, ending this perpetual life. The technologies of our leaders are far more powerful than is publicly disclosed. Humans are all animals combined, cattle at work, bees in apartments, fish on the road, etc... Humans have a primal desire to enslave sentient life. Don't believe me? First it was the Egyptians, then it was the Romans, Then europe, slave trade, etc. technology is almost to the point where we can create our own slaves; A.I. Lots of jobs will become automated. CRISPR will allow us to make perfect humans. Eventually all "flawed" humans will be exiled for not conforming. They will live in tunnels like in the movie demolition man. They are already working on building those tunnels in dc. The mark of the beast is chips implanted in everyone. They are already being produced and shown at press conferences. Authenticator chips will be designed so that when you get gas you authenticate the purchase with the chip. If you want to leave your house, you gotta have a chip. Don't like that? You can live in the tunnels. You think it's gonna be free? No. the surface world will be for the upper/upper-middle class. The LHC is playing with fire. scratch that, they're playing with quantum entanglement. They're smashing particles together at near light speeds. For what? Their goal is to become gods. Simple as that. They believe there is no god, and because of that, they are going to become that. The higgs boson is the god particle because it was the first particle present after the big bang, the particle before all particles. They could be messing with the 4th dimension by starting chain reactions on a quantum level.  You may have wondered. If god was so advanced why did we start from scratch? Because this is all a test. Your soul is real. It's what you are. When you leave this earth you will travel the ethereal plane. You'll be experiencing life on a dimension not comprehensible by our puny 3rd dimension brains. What happens after that is beyond me.

       Mainly the whole 'god, devil, fallen evil ones, good vs evil, etc'. Good and evil, right and wrong are completely subjective in the ethereal realm which is where your soul being resides. It chose to be here for a reason. I think you are getting too hung up on religion and the text of men. Prior to the deluge, humans had it made but did toil. They did not like this and revolted, in which the creator(s) gave them their wish. finite physical life and torment, but free will to do as they pleased.

       In scripture, angels are said to have free will. Satan used this free will to challenge god (which has given him life). Like good and wrong are definitely subjective, but they are definitely still real. I think that science is uncovering what religion had already known forever. These physicists are coming out saying that the smallest particles of life are able to be broken down into mathematical algorithms. Just like html is for computers, mathematics is to our universe. Just how there is a creator behind Html, there is a creator of math. Just like the characters in a video game will never meet the creator of the code which made the game, we will never meet the creator of the math that builds he fabric of our universe.

       Angels-Demons or Djinn? Also, your use of 'HTML' is quite comical. HTML is top layer to lower layers which would be C then more lower would be Assembly. Yes. The bibles and  'holy texts' would be HTML. The esoteric mystery schools would probably be C. No one quite knows what the Assembly language of the universe is.

       That's the thing. They're getting damn close to finding out over at CERN. I suppose you're right though. My theory is that once we figure out all the mathematical rules, when we go to build out own human simulations, we'll be able to make an exact copy of reality by using mathematics as the code instead of a language humans made up. Right? Lol

       Good post.  A bit spotty throughout, but you're on the right track.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you looked into the whole Pledian/Trinity narrative?  Fits nicely with Gen6, Hollow Earth, and subsequently all other mythologies and ancient histories.

       I've look at it briefly, but over the past couple years multiple people have told me to look at pledian literature. I guess i've been hesitant because i can't help but question the validity of it all. As for the spotty post, it started out as a notepad of me just streaming conscience, then after awhile i was like: "this would make a good reddit post"

       Yeah, it's a lot to digest... Maybe listen to some good pod casts on the subject, such as Leak Project or Higherside Chats?  Oh, and by "spotty" I didn't infer anything negative.  You summed up fairly well what could be endless subject matter for a post.  Just made a big jump from human beginnings to future plight without the filler.  It's all good, alot of this stuff is in the eye of the beholder anyhow.

       In the eye of the beholder, very interesting. As for podcasts, there are two that i've watched recently: the joe rogan experience, and the ben shapiro show. I'll make a note of the ones you suggested.

       Astute observation... lol, you're not wrong.  But, they are two of the better interviewers for the esoteric imo.  If you wanna strictly stick to old skool religion &amp; mythology maybe check out Creepylittlebook, Steve Quayle, Lloyd Pye, or even LA Marzulli.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creepylittlebook is highly recommended, many of his summaries are less than 15 minutes and he is very well spoken and articulate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steve Quayle is a bit of rambling nut, but he is in the right ball field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lloyd Pye can debunk Darwinism for the stubbornest of crowds.
      </p>
      <p>
       And LA, well he is just vanilla regarding the nephilim.  Plain &amp; simple, but he is genuine and his older documentaries very well made.

       Interesting. You should start a youtube channel plugging all this info!  Sure there's 50 dozen channels all basically saying the same thing. But if the production is good enough, you'll stand out and people will stick around to see what else you have.

       Mainly the whole 'god, devil, fallen evil ones, good vs evil, etc'. Good and evil, right and wrong are completely subjective in the ethereal realm which is where your soul being resides. It chose to be here for a reason. I think you are getting too hung up on religion and the text of men. Prior to the deluge, humans had it made but did toil. They did not like this and revolted, in which the creator(s) gave them their wish. finite physical life and torment, but free will to do as they pleased.
