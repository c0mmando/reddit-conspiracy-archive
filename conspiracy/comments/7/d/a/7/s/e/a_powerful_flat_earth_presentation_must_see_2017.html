<p>Things like this make no sense when you stop and think about them for a minute. </p>

<p>You heard that info from NASA, right? They purposely crashed landers into the moon to see what the moonquakes would do. </p>

<p>If the moon were hollow why the hell do you think they would tell you about it? Why wouldnt the just say &quot;Yep its a big old rock&quot;? </p>

<p>They literally said it rings like a bell because there is no water locked in the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earthers are like the people who believed the official 9-11 story. But buildings don’t  magically fall into their own footprint at freefall speed, passports don’t magically survive explosions and drift down from the sky and land in the rubble, and plane debris doesn’t magically disappear when a Boeing 747 hits the Pentagon. The govt fooled millions with that propaganda crap and they believed it and still do. You think the same people couldn’t fool another group with a mind control experiment like flat earth? </p>

<p>What does the official 9-11 story and flat earth have in common? They both defy the fundamental laws of physics.</p>

<p>Not to mention that there is absolutely NO MOTIVE for a flat earth theory. None. Round or flat, you can still enslave a population.</p>

<p>So why create a flat earth theory if you’re a social engineer working for the CIA?</p>

<p>Simple. To equate ALL researchers, whistleblowers, conspiracy theorists and anti corruption political activists with flat earthers to derail the entire movement and make them all look idiotic.</p>

<p>Like the NIST reports of 2001, facts of physics are being twisted and morphed, and the people who WANT to believe this stuff will cherry pick any facts to fit their belief system. This is known as zealotry. And like any zealot, there are no facts or evidence or logic I or anyone else can present to you to change your mind. The same reason that 16 years later, the idiots who believe the govt about 9-11 STILL believe it. Nothing will change their mind. The only difference with the flat rather is he THINKS he’s a conspiracy theorist, but little does he know he’s just a sheep at the opposite end of the psychological spectrum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a flat earther but I can see a government coverup agenda being plausible if it were so. Well, for this theory, earth would have to be flat and infinite. They would probably create NASA to lie about outer space so we don&#39;t know about the rest of the world. Because we don&#39;t have the technology to get through the Van Allen belt, they&#39;ll ask for money. They&#39;ll use that money to make sure we don&#39;t find out about the land past Antarctica. They want a slave race and it&#39;s easier for them if we all remain where we are. They will keep it a secret forever. After they create their slave race, they will spread to the unknown lands, colonizing every place they can. Isolating it from the rest of the world, and repeating this forever. </p>

<p>Dont misrepresent facts to fit your narrative. </p>

<p>What you jsut posted is the equivalent of saying &quot;There is more radiation in the upper atmosphere so we have to be careful about plane travel&quot; </p>

<p>NASA SAID PLANE TRAVEL IS IMPOSSIBLE GUYS!</p>

<p>Dont hang out in the belts but moving quickly through it, like we do... Means you get about a years worth of radiation in a few hours. </p>

<p>Doesnt that disprove the current FE paradigm though? The Earth is supposed to be motionless, esppecially if adhere to the infinite plane theory. </p>

<p>How is a focault able to show latitude? Shouldnt that not work on your FE? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Words have meaning, which is why you seem to get confused when you attempt to use them. No worries. I&#39;ll explain.</p>

<p>Beliefs require faith. Your pervious statement made a judgment on someone else&#39;s belief, which you deemed to be mistaken. It is not your place to judge or correct another persons belief. Nor is it acceptable for you to push your beliefs onto someone else. Most people understand this basic social interaction. There are people who sometimes can&#39;t comprehend this, but they are usually ascribed clinical terms/labels, and are usually locked up and/or medicated for their own protection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like I said, words are complicated, and their use requires and understanding of their meaning.</p>

<p>Beliefs require faith. Beliefs do not require God. </p>

<p>2+2=5 might be wrong, but 2+2=3 when we use the language of math to describe music. Context matters. Math is not proof of anything.</p>

<p>Again, READ carefully [try sounding the words out loud]: I don&#39;t have any beliefs about that on which I resided. So, you are not challenging me, nor am I offended.</p>

<p>Relevant text, please see table 2</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Radiation doses measured during Apollo were significantly lower than the yearly average of 5 rem set by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission for workers who use [112] radioactive materials in factories and institutions across the United States. Thus, radiation was not an operational problem during the Apollo Program.</strong> Doses received by the crewmen of Apollo missions 7 through 17 were small because no major solar-particle events occurred during those missions. One small event was detected by a radiation sensor outside the Apollo 12 spacecraft, but no increase in radiation dose to the crewmen inside the spacecraft was detected.</p>

<p>Also just use your head.</p>

<p>Do you really think NASA would just admit that no one has made it though the belts in a promotional video and let it through?</p>

<p>It just doesnt make sense, well it does when you take it out of context. </p>

<p>Please tell me you see the irony in accusing me of taking things out of context, right? Considering thats what both of your sources do lol...</p>

<p>Try harder. </p>

<p>Guy wrote Allen a letter asking if he in fact said that, Allen wrote on his letter that it is correct. </p>

<p><a href="http://photobucket.com/gallery/user/clavius_examples/media/bWVkaWFJZDo1Mzg1MjQz/?ref=">http://photobucket.com/gallery/user/clavius_examples/media/bWVkaWFJZDo1Mzg1MjQz/?ref=</a></p>

<p>I also cant find a free source but Times interviewed Van Allen where he says as much. Its the May 4, 1959 issue and there is a quote in there that says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The radiation zone is by no means a &quot;death belt&quot; that will keep humans from reaching space, but it might do some damage to men who live for a long time in a satellite. Van Allen figured that the radiation level inside the satellite might reach about 0.06 roentgens per hour. At this rate a man would receive in five hours his maximum weekly permissible dose of 0.3 roentgens. A small amount of lead shielding would reduce the dose to a supportable level. The crew of an outbound spaceship need not worry about the radiation belt. If moving fast enough to leave the earth, they would pass through it in about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Danyang-Kunshan Bridge - the photo included in the video only shows a small fraction of the bridge. Why? Because the bridge itself is so long you can&#39;t see the whole thing in a single frame due to the curvature of the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a 9-kilometre long (5.6 mi) section over open water across Yangcheng Lake in Suzhou.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danyang%E2%80%93Kunshan_Grand_Bridge">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danyang%E2%80%93Kunshan_Grand_Bridge</a></p>

<p>The section showed in the video is less than 6 miles long. Most of the bridge is on dry land. This is easily determined, so why does the author of the video imply that the photo shows the entire length of the bridge? Are they stupid or lying?</p>

<p>Aircraft &quot;dipping the nose down&quot; - this is false. The angle of an aircraft&#39;s nose is only one factor that determines its altitude. Watch an airliner coming in for a landing. It&#39;s nose will be pointed up into the sky, even though it is losing altitude. This is because altitude is controlled by the lift generated by the wings. The lift generated by the wings is controlled by the combination of the angle of the nose, the speed through the air, and the density of the air around it. At a specific angle and speed, the aircraft will maintain a specific altitude. if the air becomes less dense, the wings will produce less lift, and the aircraft will descend. air becomes less dense the higher you go. The upshot is, an aircraft can be said to be &quot;floating&quot; on the surface of a bubble of air at a specific density, and it will stay on that surface (all else being equal) whether the surface is curved or flat.</p>

<p>Flight route from Australia to South America - two things... first a single flight would be likely to carry more passengers if there are multiple destinations reached by that flight. Second there <em>are</em> direct flights from Australia to South America. Why does the author of the video imply there are not? Are they stupid or lying?</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m not wasting any more time on this crap. The only thing &quot;powerful&quot; about this video is the level of ignorance.</p>

<p>Please prove to me without using NASA or space agencies the rotation of the earth and please prove that we are moving.</p>

<p>I thought I did? </p>

<p>Coriolis, Gyroscopes, focaults, observation all point to rotation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like I said, words are complicated, and their use requires and understanding of their meaning.</p>

<p>Beliefs require faith. Beliefs do not require God. </p>

<p>2+2=5 might be wrong, but 2+2=3 when we use the language of math to describe music. Context matters. Math is not proof of anything.</p>

<p>Again, READ carefully [try sounding the words out loud]: I don&#39;t have any beliefs about that on which I resided. So, you are not challenging me, nor am I offended.</p>
