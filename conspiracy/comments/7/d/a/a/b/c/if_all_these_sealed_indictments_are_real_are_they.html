        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, all of us, on both sides, should take a step back and lay off the Kool-Aid.</p>

<p>Second, let&#39;s all realize that there is some serious political theater going on with all this.</p>

<p>Next, we should ask ourselves a simple question: Are we really expecting a takedown of the very top corrupt movers and shakers? Seriously?</p>

<p>Is Trump going to take out a global pedo network involved in international money laundering, influence peddling, arms, drug, and human trafficking? </p>

<p>Is Mueller going to take down the entire Trump administration and bring Hillary in on white horse to return the Republic to its natural state of grace?</p>

<p>The answer to both of these questions is no. We all know that. This is the Age of Unreasonable Expectations after all, but let&#39;s be reasonable here for a second.</p>

<p>There are probably many indictments related to campaign finance, foreign influence and corruption in general as a result of the recent investigations and various targets undoubtedly turning state&#39;s evidence. At most, we&#39;ll probably see some small- to mid-level guys take the rap for all that.</p>

<p>But if these 1,000+ sealed indictments are real, then what are they really all about? </p>

<p>Assuming said indictments are real, my guess as to the purpose for a large number of them is simple and somehow evaded all mention that I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a takedown of MS-13.</p>

<p>Look at the map of MS-13 territories and hot spots compared to the locations on the list of the indictments...you will see a that many of those areas align with the areas with the most supposed sealed indictments.</p>

<p>Let us not forget the current extreme need for every part of the government in either party to get a real win to restore general faith in the system.</p>

<p>Consider, then, the recent indications by Sessions that MS-13 is a prime target and that all bets are off in bringing them to justice. </p>

<p>In addition, note the large number of illegal immigrants involved in MS-13. The arrest/deportation of those could be facilitated by and portrayed as a successful implementation of the current administration&#39;s new immigration policies.</p>

<p>Of course, there are alleged connections between MS-13 and elements of the worldwide intelligence community. This is not so far out, as intelligence organizations are known to work with organized crime, and the line gets blurrier the closer you look. There are even rumors that political organizations in this country use MS-13 gang members as hit men, etc. Is this connected in any way to this current round of sealed indictments? Probably not.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my two cents on this bizarre twilight zone in which we&#39;re living these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe that&#39;s why they&#39;re not telling us yet. It would create mass hysteria. So they&#39;re doing the job and gathering enough evidence so that it can&#39;t be denied by sleeping fools and the fake news. </p>

<p>This is what i am hoping is happening. but... OP is probably right :P Mighty people don&#39;t go down</p>
