       Found Brit here? I understand (and respect) your strong opinion about Brexit, and may be Murdoch. But why anti-Trump? I mean, I'm for example interested in events in Catalonia, but tbh not care much which side would prevail.

       I'm anti Hillary as well. I think most of the world was hoping maybe Bernie might have a shot. With Trump it seems another war is inevitable and more money will go to the rich and US politics will move even further right.

       As a Brit living in Australia I enjoy the freedom to move and live anywhere in the EU or Nz. but that will go. I lost about $30k so far from Brexit because the pound has crashed. I would prefer the UK to be closer to the EU than the US. Fixing the EU from within is better than trying to fix it from the outside.

       I guess there is no arguing with that, I mean the people you know intimately enough to know how they feel about these kinds of things are in fact so numerous and so diverse in their opinions and beliefs as to cover all possible variations. It therefore must be a conspiracy because you personally don't know anyone fitting those beliefs.

       I think the largest portion of this sites user base is 20 somethings, and the largest population centers in the country (LA, NYC) all lean pretty left when it comes to the younger generation. it doesnt surprise me when I see stuff like latestagecapitalism on the front page anymore because it seems like everyone who uses this site went to UC Berkeley lol

       I like late stage capitalism. It's funny and it's always good to have a reality check not swinging too far into one direction . Occasionally the sub is hijacked by anti-trump agenda but the other stuff is good.

       weird user name. everyone knows its ok to be white. look at congress, every president but one, country clubs, ceo's, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       why do you feel its important to point out that it is acceptable to be white? do you feel like white people are oppressed?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.
       </p>

       Different people have different experiences. I don't know you or your story, but obviously travel didn't have that effect on you. But you can't say it's not true for other people just because it's not true for you.

       I grew up as a white, upper middle class male in the southern US, the supposed hotbed of racism, but I was taught (and I truly believed) that all races are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       That belief withered quickly when I actually encountered and lived among people from different ethnic and national backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some races, nations, and cultures are WAY better than others. I don't believe "whites" (whatever that is) are the best race by the way.

       That's exactly the opposite of the case - I've actually lived among other cultures and had extensive experiences with thousands of people. It's more than enough to make generalizations.

       How so? Do you have any experience with "the system?" I do, both working within it and having to be a part of it. Welfare and assistance programs are designed to keep you in them. For example, my family receives $240 dollars a month in SNAP benefits. (Food stamps) It helps, but its not nearly enough for a family of six. Now if I manage to pick up overtime, or work an extra job and make $100 extra dollars for the month they then take that out of my assistance for the next month. Now if I had a higher paying job and was pulling in extra income every month I can understand that, but the way it currently is I have almost no way to catch up or pay off debts. You're given just enough help to not starve to death... most of the time.

       Maybe you shouldn't have a family of six if you're on welfare. Nobody forced you to have six kids without an income to support it. But yes just blame the "system" instead of your personal choices.

       Don't need your sympathy. Don't want it either. Never blamed the system, I have made my own choices. But being in the system makes life harder than it already is. I'm grateful for the assistance, but getting out from underneath it is prohibitive. Part of "the system" is that too many jobs don't pay a fair wage. I have a ba and and associates degree. And yet, i'm making 12 bucks and hour in a hospital, with 50k is student debt. This is part of the problem, you have to go to school to get a decent job. School is expensive So you get loans. You get done and still can't find a decent paying job, so hello debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, we don't always "choose" how many children we have, or the size of our family. Parents become ill and have to move in with kids. Homes are lost. Birth control fails sometimes. There's many possibilities. And if you think you are going to shame me for having 4 wonderful, smart, and compassionate children then you can go take a leap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, i'm on the internet at work non my break. Most people on assistance already work and pay into the system. And even if I were at home, internet in my area ranges from 50-60 bucks a month. That's not a lot of money when ones trying to be upwardly mobile, not to mention that having the internet is a necessity for most peoples work and school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly,  I feel sorry for you, as you obviously have no empathy for anyone who's not in the same situation as you. So you can, literally, go screw yourself.

       if you arent poor you can easily afford to go to school, which allows you to stay out of poverty. The system seems to be setup in a rich get richer system, which makes sense since guess who writes the laws and designs the systems???

       I don't have empathy not because you're in different position than me but because you've obviously made choices that you have to live with and now you're costing everybody else by being on welfare.

       its pretty much universally agreed by (intelligent) people that the welfare system is failing and needs to be revamped for exactly the reason you are stating: it disincentivizes hard work and earning. I dont know if it was designed this way on purpose (dont attribute to malice that which can be sufficiently explained by incompetence) as I think well intentioned people wrote it, but it is def not working. Im in favor of a basic income replacing all of these welfare programs with no penalty for earning

       And the best thing about it - it works. In scotland if any of my family members get sick, I know they will be looked after well. And they have been. The idea of “long waiting lists” and “bad care” is a total fallacy. If anything - it’s government cuts in the uk that are stifling the NHS’ productivity. The right are trying to destroy the truly great thing we have in this country. And if u ask anyone about how they feel “paying for free shit for someone else” in the case of the NHS they will be more than happy too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private healthcare even still exists if u really want it.

       I get to go to university for nothing. Receive financial support during it and can leave with my degree - hopefully catapulting myself into the job market with a good career lined up for me. Then I can pay my taxes to help others maintain the same level of health and opportunities in their life. It truly is wonderful!

       It’s literally just because outside of the US, The EU and UK are all left leaning. Even our right wing politicians are further left than the likes of Hillary Clinton. Always makes me laugh that people believe there’s an “agenda” being pushed. When it’s probably just that right wing politics has done nothing but ruin country’s over here.

       uhhh, that's actually exactly why I'm a socialist, because I don't like capitalist corporate overlords stealing the profit of my labor.

       it's so sad that the capitalist propaganda has worked this well.

       i don't want "free shit that someone else pays for", I want a society where workers are compensated fairly, and where instead of spending literally trillions of dollars to go wage endless pointless wars for decades on end, we instead spend a FRACTION of that money to

       and BTW, the "definition" socialism is highly debated, even by those on the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       but most would agree on a basic definition of, "a system where workers control the means of production and are entitled to the profits of their labor."

       If they were paid fairly for what they do ,net profit for the company would be zero and wages would be adjusted upwards accordingly.  But in a capitalist system the people who provide no added value get the most out of it just because they are good at a numbers game.

       You conveniently ignore the fact that in a capitalist economy there are exactly zero places that pay workers fair value for their labor due to the profit motive.  Profit=exploitation.

       I think 5he front page of Reddit accurately reflects what most people I know think. Its kind of chicken and egg though since they think what Reddit tells them to.

       Reddit is the online MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       If liberals want their views to dominate, they have to control the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find truly free media, you'll find extreme right-wing stuff. Check out 4chan or full chan.

       Never noticed on Reddit, but I purposely avoid those kind of pages that are controlled by company staff. The trending page on YouTube, the moments on Twitter, and the news on Google I avoid as much as possible. I only pay attention to what I follow and read the news from whatever sources I trust. I know they want to shove their views down my throat and I'm not with it.

       I wouldn't say there's a lot of anti-capitalist other than what comes from r/latestagecapitalism. Sadly most of it is true, capitalism, more specifically corporate/crony capitalism, is causing many of the problems around the world. It's not really capitalism's fault as people will take advantage which ever system put in front of them. 🤷
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-Trump is pretty obvious seeing as he's a useless piece of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Leftist" because many of the other major countries using reddit are a bit more liberal that good ol' US. I totally under being conservative, I personally hold many conservative beliefs, but I prefer the separation of church and state, not hating gay people, women's rights... Etc. Some of GOP's stances are straight up archaic.

       If they are both a lunatic and a dipshit, maybe you should applaud them for making it into and completing a semester of college? Or you could admit you are just spitting nonsense.
