    <div class="md"><p>How so? Do you have any experience with &quot;the system?&quot; I do, both working within it and having to be a part of it. Welfare and assistance programs are designed to keep you in them. For example, my family receives $240 dollars a month in SNAP benefits. (Food stamps) It helps, but its not nearly enough for a family of six. Now if I manage to pick up overtime, or work an extra job and make $100 extra dollars for the month they then take that out of my assistance for the next month. Now if I had a higher paying job and was pulling in extra income every month I can understand that, but the way it currently is I have almost no way to catch up or pay off debts. You&#39;re given just enough help to not starve to death... most of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t need your sympathy. Don&#39;t want it either. Never blamed the system, I have made my own choices. But being in the system makes life harder than it already is. I&#39;m grateful for the assistance, but getting out from underneath it is prohibitive. Part of &quot;the system&quot; is that too many jobs don&#39;t pay a fair wage. I have a ba and and associates degree. And yet, i&#39;m making 12 bucks and hour in a hospital, with 50k is student debt. This is part of the problem, you have to go to school to get a decent job. School is expensive So you get loans. You get done and still can&#39;t find a decent paying job, so hello debt. </p>

<p>Second, we don&#39;t always &quot;choose&quot; how many children we have, or the size of our family. Parents become ill and have to move in with kids. Homes are lost. Birth control fails sometimes. There&#39;s many possibilities. And if you think you are going to shame me for having 4 wonderful, smart, and compassionate children then you can go take a leap. </p>

<p>Third, i&#39;m on the internet at work non my break. Most people on assistance already work and pay into the system. And even if I were at home, internet in my area ranges from 50-60 bucks a month. That&#39;s not a lot of money when ones trying to be upwardly mobile, not to mention that having the internet is a necessity for most peoples work and school. </p>

<p>Lastly,  I feel sorry for you, as you obviously have no empathy for anyone who&#39;s not in the same situation as you. So you can, literally, go screw yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the best thing about it - it works. In scotland if any of my family members get sick, I know they will be looked after well. And they have been. The idea of “long waiting lists” and “bad care” is a total fallacy. If anything - it’s government cuts in the uk that are stifling the NHS’ productivity. The right are trying to destroy the truly great thing we have in this country. And if u ask anyone about how they feel “paying for free shit for someone else” in the case of the NHS they will be more than happy too. </p>

<p>Private healthcare even still exists if u really want it.</p>

<p>I get to go to university for nothing. Receive financial support during it and can leave with my degree - hopefully catapulting myself into the job market with a good career lined up for me. Then I can pay my taxes to help others maintain the same level of health and opportunities in their life. It truly is wonderful! </p>
