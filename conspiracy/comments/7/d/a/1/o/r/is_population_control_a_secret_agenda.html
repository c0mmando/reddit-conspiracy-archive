       I have a long belief that the higher ups (as in those in say) know that our population growing is devastating to the world in whole so they have been putting people in positions that would cause illnesses and sickness to our youths as a form of population control....anyone want to jump on this band wagon

       The biggest issue with population control is that it isn't a "necessity" as the elites would have you believe. We have the resources to house, feed, and clothe all 7.5 billion human beings. We have plenty of arable land and clean water. We are on the cusp of technology that could move us into a post-scarcity age and allow for the basic necessities to be synthesized at little to no cost. No one needs to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now whether we utilize the coming technological breakthroughs, whether we ensure power is distributed to the masses, and whether we ensure resources are properly dispersed, is up to us, collectively, as a species.

       I don't think we
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       need all the people either. We are fine with our current population level if we take advantage of our current resources, technology on the horizon, and ensure we practice sustainable farming and fishing, as well as transition to a green economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, the UN still estimates global population to level off about 2050. Even if the Sub-Saharan African economies keep growing at their incredibly slow rates, within the next 30-40 years their economies should reach the current level of the developed world. Population is expected to peak in 2050 at around 9.5 billion, after which it is expected to level off and then slowly decline.

       The fewer people we have, the smaller our chances of ousting the ruling class.  That's why the final goal is to cull the population. 
They understand the power we could have over them if we were to ever wake up en masse.

       It would be silly for them to cull the population. The ideal situation is to have a large population of impoverished people. The majority of the people would work and shop at walmart. Never being able to rise above their station in life but also never being poor enough to think about uprising. Ideally they have a few kids to keep them tied down and too worried about supporting a family to think very much.

       Or they could just advocate birth control. Provide contraception to third world countries and give women easier access to abortion. In general, populations also decline after a country reaches a certain point of stability.

       I doubt that would help because plenty of women have access to both and yet we still have more babies being born than people are dying. It's also very expensive. Sex education would probanly be more beneficial so women can take steps to prevent pregnancy like contraception. Too many women think abortion is a form of contraception. I've gone through a miscarriage, it was excruciating, and emotionally damaging. I wouldn't want anyone having to go through an unnecessary abortion.

       I don't intend to have have kids because I can't presume that another person wants to exist. I think breeding is the most immoral act possible, because you're saying that your desire to make a person trumps that person's right to be made or not.

       What is and will never be explicitly defined is that "Climate Change" is a public excuse for the UN's policy Agenda 21, now referred to as the 2030 Agenda. It outlines a global initiative for governments to control land, resources, and population. What many people feel is that this initiative isn't driven by the interest of the habitability of the planet, it's an excuse to gain control over the land and people. The continuous wars over oil and resources, and ongoing country legislation to challenge the public's freedom further this speculation.

       Refusing to do anything about climate change until it causes global catastrophe is a great way to ensure global government.  Adopting some of the entirely non-binding, mostly reasonable suggestions in Agenda 21 would be an absolute necessity to preserving national sovereignty and individual liberty in the long term.

       Maybe. Over here in the US it seems like everything revolves around money. So many are obsessed with materialsm and the idea of becoming famous. Is this an agenda that's pushed by our government, who knows, I don't, but I think it's possible. Our food is trash, our health care is trash, our government overall doesn't really seem to care about us. If you have money than you have nothing to worry about besides maybe your wife leaving you and taking half of everything. If you are poor like me then you are fucked unless you give up certain things 😆

       There's strong incentive not to improve infant mortality rates and combat malnourishment in Africa. One estimate I've heard is that the continent could conceivably push 4 billion people if they had higher standards of living.

       If you put every man, woman, and child currently alive on the planet into a box that measured 2' x 2' x 6' for each of them and assembled all those into a cube it would measure exactly 1 mile x 1mile x 1 mile with some room to spare for a few more.

       I want you think about that in comparison to the size of the world we live on. We're not short of space and we're not short of resources we simply have far to many wasteful and destructive habits and there's nothing more offensive than the idea that we need to get rid of people so we can keep right on being wasteful and destructive instead of becoming proper stewards and careful managers of a natural world that is more than capable of comfortably sustaining even twice as many people as currently exist.

       When you see someone like Bill Gates talking about too many people in the world just remember that he lives in a 50,000 square foot mansion that he needs a golf cart to get from one end to other. Or any of the British royals pushing the same line, living in castles with estates that encompass thousands of square miles.

       In fact it's almost always inordinately wealthy elitists who are the very last people who should ever be complaining about being pressed for space or unable to find enough food for themselves to be talking about there being too many of the rest of us for their liking.

       Their real problem is that there are too few of them and too many of us to ensure their complete control and dominance and the fear that we'll come to realize that it's them and their vision of what they want this world to be for their own relentlessly greedy and extravagant ways that is greatest problem that is actually facing us.

       Millennial's parents will still be alive in 20-30 years, most are only in their 40's and early 50's atm. Give it 40-50 before that generation is gone for all intents and purposes, and the youngest Millennials are reaching middle ages while the oldest are in their 70's.

       It would be silly for them to cull the population. The ideal situation is to have a large population of impoverished people. The majority of the people would work and shop at walmart. Never being able to rise above their station in life but also never being poor enough to think about uprising. Ideally they have a few kids to keep them tied down and too worried about supporting a family to think very much.
