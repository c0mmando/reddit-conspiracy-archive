       The amount of people trying to force the Russia narrative is insane. It's an attempt to discredit the sexual allegations that will surely emerge against the democrats and republicans who oppose trump. The other purpose is to push a narrative has been developed by the military to position the United States as the enemy of Russia . The ultimate goal being war to "save our economy." Im sure this will be inundated with comments suggesting this is a big deal and legitimate as well as my commitment to trump. I did not vote for Donald trump and have many legitimate grievances with presidency. But Russia is being position by neo libs and neo cons to secure their world war.

       Which is a fucking hilarious goal. The only reason WW2 "saved" the US economy was because it gave us an artificial market for our industries to sell their goods- which were converted to producing
       <em>
        war
       </em>
       goods. Then, after the war, Europe and Japan were ruined husks, so we paid billions to rebuild them into markets for our peacetime goods...which worked until the 70's, when the rest of the world started catching up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, instead of doing the hard work to find a way forward through stagflation, we decided to gut labor and market regulations that had guided that growth explosion for a short-term boost, and 40 years later we sit in America and Western Civilization circa 2017...with slowing economies, fraying alliances, and disparate political goals with no clear way forward. A new economic consensus must be established, and I believe that means returning to the post war consensus of strong labor, and fair markets regulated against monopolies, among voluminous other things.

       And now we have a "Middle Class" built on nothing but debt...mortgage debt, credit card debt, auto debt, student debt. It's a stale facade held up by a rotten edifice. And the economic reckoning is coming. 40 years of this monetary and trade policy is coming home to roost, and compounded by the failure of the Fed policy from the last 8 years also. I fear the next Recession will be far worse than 2008, and will likely become a full blown depression.

       What will Americans do when unemployment jumps up to 25%? What happens when the Bond Market collapses and the US Government can't borrow any more money? What happens when in an ill-fated attempt to prop up said Bond Market, the Fed sacrifices the Dollar to hyper-inflation? There are dark clouds gathering on the horizon...

       WW2 did not save the US economy.  This is the broken window fallacy, one popularly propagated in public schools.

       It's really nothing, nothing influenced those voters besides the candidates themselves. If Russia swayed the election with a couple thousand Facebook ads, that has to be Childs play to what America does in foreign elections as well it's a weak argument.

       But it is certainly useful to continue to have Russia as the boogeymen because it provides a reason for armament and deployment of troops overseas. It allows the MIC to push for more military spending around the world and Trump is the main messenger for that with his insistence that every NATO country spends 2% of GDP on military. He even pushes Germany and Japan to arm again despite their constitutional constraints implemented after their defeat in WWII.
