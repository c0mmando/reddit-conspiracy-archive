       Forgive the abstract nature of this‚Äîit‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been pondering lately, and I just wanted to put it out there to see if anyone feels this way sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I‚Äôll jump
       <em>
        right
       </em>
       in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionism. A lot of people arrive at what white supremacist groups call the
       <em>
        Jewish Question
       </em>
       by studying history and race and IQ differences among races, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having studied this topic exhaustingly, traveled there myself, I tend to refer to it as the
       <em>
        Rothschild Zionist Question
       </em>
       . Many Jews aren‚Äôt Zionist, and it‚Äôs frankly unfair to categorize them as such. I first arrived at this ‚ÄúQuestion‚Äù (and answered it) by conducting thousands of hours of 9/11 research. Race was never a factor for me. I got there by other means.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I‚Äôm using Zionism as an example of the point I‚Äôm trying to make is because it‚Äôs happening now, here, in front of our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a group of people who have been on the receiving end of ethnic cleansing brutal genocidal behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what did they do?
      </p>
      <p>
       They created an ethnostate in Palestine and over the years have committed the
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       acts of ethnic cleansing and genocidal behavior of which they claim to be a victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a ‚Äúback-to-Africa‚Äù movement in the late 19th century during which freed slaves were sent to Liberia.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what did they do?
      </p>
      <p>
       They enslaved natives using the plantation techniques they learned in America. This lasted for years and led to many armed conflicts and eventually a civil war that ravaged an already downtrodden country.
      </p>
      <p>
       World history is ridden with massive devastation of men, by men. Genocide. Mass murder. Torture. All of it. All over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on listing examples, but that wouldn‚Äôt strengthen my point, which is mainly this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Maybe humanity truly is evil by its very nature and good will never prevail because good is not in the nature of humanity.
       </em>
       (if you‚Äôre religious, you‚Äôre waaaay ahead of me, I get it üòõ)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a small portion of the population who sees the world for what it is, and so they naturally seek out the guilty party. Just because humanity is evil by nature doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt good people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil forces have existed throughout history.
       <em>
        Just because a group defeats them does not automatically make that group good
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that‚Äôs it, I have never had such a hard time writing what I‚Äôm thinking. And no, I‚Äôm not suggesting that the search for goodness and truth is an exercise in futility, I‚Äôm just stepping back and looking at the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the problem
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the nature of humanity rather than this group or that group, because we all have humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if I‚Äôm spouting bullshit, call me on it. If you‚Äôve ever felt this way, tell me about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks

       I"m no expert so my opinion isn't followimg text book.  Basically we know humans are not perfect and will naturally do bad or evil things. If we were evil we would not see them as bad or evil.  So naturally we are not evil but environment and culture play it's part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like saying all Pitbulls are naturally evil. They are strong and aggressive so by influence they can easily be evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with humanity.  Evil groups in power, manipulate and influence evil behavior.  Right now I believe humanity wants what they believe is best.  Views of what is best is completely divided.  That is the creation of an evil group.  The evil group wants to divide us to distract while they execute a strategy that they feel is best.  This evil group is out for themselves while we scream and argue partisan view points.

       Good answer, I don't profess to say it is the whole of the issue but a damn good way of seeing it. Because you are right, we are not one thing or the other, but can be anything in between depending on the circumstances driving the situation.

       Were all humans, we each have the capacity to do great deeds of "good" or great deeds of "evil" perspective is what will define those relative terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say I agree to some of what you say. Suppose I don't have much reason as to not agree fully aside that it is my belief  that humanity can't be categorized by a relative term. But in that belief it means humanity can't be defined at all. So it is hypocritical in nature.

       I like the idea that you can‚Äôt categorize all of humanity with such a word as evil. Maybe I would be more genuine to say ‚Äúeasily manipulated‚Äù.

       Yes, we are malleable. Our social up bringing, social constructs, education , peers help shape the individual. Exploring their own path in life is what helps define somebody. Right now we got to many people not able to take the steps of self discovery.They aren't defining their own ideology so we got false outrage. Or talking points in which don't identify nor address the concerns of their communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though others might help shape who we are. We always have the ability to shape who we become. With awareness walking forward we can make different choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is in our ignorance, that we will continue to make the same mistakes. I think that is the cause for "evil" factions to form. We can't learn from past mistakes if the truth is always obfuscated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So humanity stuck in a fight with itself. No side can truly win. We've got to accept that there is a side to humanity, ourselves that will always strive to put the self first. The other side of humanity wants to help others and will sometimes do so in neglect of self. Maintaining the balance of selfhelp  and help of others should be something each and every individual strives for.

       I disagree. I think that the vast majority of individuals are good by nature. They are corrupted to commit evil by a tiny proportion of evil individuals, who are able to gain power by being ruthless, violent, having no qualms about lying or betraying others to get ahead. This evil minority creates the conditions in which human beings are more likely to end up committing evil acts, for example by terrorizing them and making them feel they have to fight against an enemy in order to hold onto their lives, livelihoods etc, or literally that they have to engage in war for a salary in order to afford to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the vast vast majority of human beings want nothing more than to live in peace, to be happy, to have friends and loved ones, to have a meaningful purpose, to have joyful experiences etc. The vast majority do not want to commit evil and will onyl do bad things if they have been interfered with, either by being traumatised by the minority of evil humans or deceived or threatened by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far more humans commit good loving acts for no reward, just out of empathy and love for their fellow humans, than there are humans who commit evil acts just because they have a desire to hurt others or to commit evil for evil's sake. This shows us that, at heart, when left to their own devices, when they are not interfered with by evil-doers, human beings on the whole are inherently good and loving. The sociopaths that unfortunately run things at the moment are aberrations, they are mutants, they are not what a real human being is. They are a disease, and they infect the rest of the species with fear, and out of that fear comes hatred and violence. But the number of humans who will commit evil for the fun of it, for the sake of it, is tiny. The number of humans who will do acts of goodness and love for the sake of it, for the feeling of it, is enormous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for this idea that humans are evil. We aren't. We're good, and the evil things that happen throughout history are not a result of the natural inclination of individuals, but are ultimately the result of fear and desperation for survival - conditions that are created by a tiny minority of aberrant diseased minds. If we cleared out that minority, humans would live in peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is one of the biggest deceptions, I think, this idea that so many accept, that humans are inherently a violent species, or that every human has a 'dark side' or whatever, when our violence as a species is only a product of a few inherently evil individuals, without whom we would see no reason to be violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is in our nature to be empathetic and kind, to be co-operative, to forge bonds and connections, to help one another, to feel joy in the presence of others. That is what the majority strive for, and all that causes people to stray from those natural desires is deliberately fabricated in such a specific way as to make us fear and thus hate 'the other'- it is based upon lies. They would not need to lie to us if it was in our nature to be violent and evil.

       Hmm kind of a hard post to respond to because you haven't really made a point other then that evil begets more evil. While i agree on that point,i think its worth adding that good begets more good. Service to others greases the wheel of goodness and helps it turn better. Slavery is circular as you say, because it wasn't that long before blacks were taken to north America as slaves , that they had their own race of slaves (at least according to scripture, the Jewish people were slaves to pharaohs) so they enslaved, got removed and enslaved on another continent,  won their freedom and came back to do what they were doing before we took them away
      </p>
      <p>
       On to your opening topic though which is the Jewish question and your assertion that who people are really talking about is the Rothschild zionists. I frequently see people trying to say "well zionists are different from an actual jew, actual jews reject zionism", question is, are they? And do they really not have support of the rest of their faith? Because from what I've seen they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's many other religious and philosophical examples of this question . For Islam we have "well jihadists are different from a ACTUAL muslim, an actual muslim is peaceful and condemns terrorist attacks" , well are they really peaceful? Do they daily condemn calls to terror? Do the true jews regularly use their extensive will and power to return Palestine to its people? I found in my search that resistance to zionism was really only existent up until the creation of israel, after which Jewish people have rarely backtracked,  or condemned the states activities. Which to a Palestinian getting their home bulldozed,  is terrorism.

       But if we are looking for evil in ANY faith you need look no further than the top 1% of any religion... catholics got the Vatican pedos,  church of England has the monarchy pedos,  Islam has the house of saud,  Judaism has the rothschilds/their owners, and on and on....what's intriguing is that this secret group of the top 1% of all religions , really participate in their OWN religion you see? See what they all get busted for in the end? Child rape/abuse/brainwashing/SACRIFICE ..... this is pizzagate guys, this is eyes wide shut, this is finders cult, this is pedogate, this is the Franklin scandal, etc...start looking into the symbology  and you will find that this religion pre dates most major religions. It may just be the first PARASITIC religion, in that it attaches on to a host religion and uses their people for money, power, reach, influence, and your never an outsider, whatever community your in will shield your activities because they don't want to bring shame to their religion...anyways hope this starts a interesting discussion

       This is a good topic! Do I think evil lies within the hearts of all men....yes. To me it‚Äôs whether one lets that struggle over take them....of course then you have group think. An example from my life was the invasion of Iraq. I was an Infantryman on the frontline...we killed a lot but largely were compassionate to EPW‚Äôs and civilians. As we got closer to Baghdad the gloves really came off. The Iraqi Army, Republican Guard, and Special Republican Guard stopped respecting ‚Äúthe Law of War‚Äù. They would use civilians as human shields, ambulances (which we allowed to take away their wounded) became their way of moving troops in close with RPGs under the guise of medical care.....the same was true for fire trucks and red crescent vehicles. By the last days of the war I had no feeling for them and cheered as we would drop white phosphorus into the city. We had become animals as all men do when the metal hits the meat. Age has taught me a lot about my own complicity....and I have a hard time dealing with my/our behavior.

       I think a lot of
       <em>
        evil
       </em>
       comes from poverty and the massive gap between wealthy and poor. Thugs can go from rags to riches just by greasing the right palms. It's a lot easier than starting a proper business and filing out the proper paperwork! It comes back to pure greed/selfishness and the nasty tactics people use to get their way. I do believe THAT part is in our nature. For sure. It's a survival mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when we built our own houses from nearby materials?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when we grew our food from the ground?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when the only jobs were protecting/providing for each other and building up the community?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Yeah, all those things REQUIRE money now.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       People are desperate --
       <em>
        truly desperate
       </em>
       -- for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was starving, living in a hut I built from trash, with a family to feed and look after, and somebody offered me significant cash for doing something against my morals....... I'd probably consider doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you throw in an armed conflict on top of all that...
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, fuck morals! My kid's gonna eat!!
