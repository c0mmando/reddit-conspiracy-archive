       They are merging our sub and our culture with conservative right wing extremist beliefs and support for anything republican, and hate for anything democratic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever there's bad news about trump or a member of his cabinet, a republican sex crime, you name it: There's
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       a brigade of posts on the front page about anti
       <em>
        democrat
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They want this sub to look like a conservative fuck fest to anyone lurking. That's what media matters, Top Minds, and all the other groups that shill are trying to do, to subvert our efforts to expose the elite to the masses. They're politicizing us and keeping us in a little bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for the bullshit and call out both sides equally.

       Because he just reposts the same bullshit that's constantly on this sub. How many posts say the same thing as this guys. Lol. I bet he defends Podesta also. An accusation isn't a conviction. If their was more dirt on him like others have had in the past, people would call him out. This is r/conspiracy . If the MSM is pushing a narrative, it is always good to question it. You guys are all but hurt because we are skeptical of the news.

       Well either you belong in a penitentiary for sex crimes, or you're innocent. People shouldn't have their careers ruined because of accusations of stuff that may or may not have happened. This applies to politicians, actors and civilians. Innocent until proven guilty.

       That's not true at all. I think we're all pretty sure OJ Simpson killed his ex-wife, but he was never imprisoned for it -- though Nicole Brown's family did win a verdict in civil court.  That's because someone can be guilty, and the evidence can show they're probably guilty, even if there's a
       <em>
        reasonable doubt
       </em>
       that they're guilty.

       I disagree, if you look at 80% of the upvoted content here over the past year+ it is anything but non-partisan and from frequent users.  People need to admit that the community was highjacked by mostly the far right/Trump supporters and work to take it back rather than just cry shill/brigade every time.

       Will have to disagree here. You are likely not aware of the lengths the controlled opposition will go to, to smear a truth movement, and politicizing things from behind the scenes Is a great way to cause division and turn people away.

       I don't deny that there is a lot of effort to do that.  But I've been part of this community for 5+ years of varying degrees and there was a very obvious and still present shift that happened a few years back.  It turned from more general conspiracy to "redpill" style of shit, which is basically alt-right lite.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm curious of who you think is spending the money for the controlled opposition?  Is it just the vague powers that be?  Soros?  Russia?

       Some "entity" of the elite is funding these things. Remember, this is an exclusive club of billionaires. Doesn't have to be one guy funding it, and these people collectively have all the money in the world and can always print more. There's always a bigger budget, especially for shilling or anything to quell the awakening. It's money well spent to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no I cannot pinpoint who or what exactly funds them.

       I think you're lying to yourself. There may be some shills, there may be some bots...but this sub
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       have a bias that's easy to observe if you're honest with yourself. On days like today we get a lot of crossovers from T_D...on other days we get them from r/politics. On the whole this sub leans pretty far right, though, you can see it on the days there isn't a big story drawing users from elsewhere. I think just chalking it up to "shills and bots" is taking the easy way out, it's entirely explainable through userbases of adjacent subs.

       That is not an accurate representation of this sub, and they are not only disingenuous, but they may be actively trying to dissuade people from taking the conspiracy culture seriously.

       You know why that is don't you. Because The MSM ignores everything that doesn't fit in there progressive narrative framing. I'm sick of democrats constantly hiring and protecting known criminals. So get off your high horse and hold democrats accountable. How about holding similar sets of standards for proof. What proof has been submitted for the case against republican candidates. What proof is usually ignored or obfuscated or outright lied about to deceive when its about democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually Republicans will vote out or drive from office politicians that have done substantially wrong things. Democrats it seems like a prerequisite to do bad things before you can even hold office.

       If Franken goes down for this then wouldn't the next logical step be to investigate Donald? Could be an interesting series of events if that goes down. Watching the news now and they're raising Pitch Forks which is a huge contrast to the shit with Roy Moore or Trump or Weinstein. Something to ponder over since Al Franken apologized and asked for an investigation on himself and the reaction is much different than the others that have been accused.

       Now there's a 2nd woman (another known semi-celeb) accusing Franken of harassment and stalking. She says he finally stopped after threatening to call the cops. Franken's a creep. He needs to resign in disgrace.

       I don’t see how “they” could subvert exposure, shit is literally everywhere. Also I’m pretty sure anyone who frequents a conspiracy message board is already of the opinion that anyone who holds office is inherently a scumbag, or at least already a skeptic. It’s not an emergency, this board isn’t going to change whether or not he’s a fun and nice guy, calm down.

       I have kind of stayed out of the loop on this one. I just don't know which way the propaganda is blowing. But seeing as you have an attitude toward this I agree with, have you seen anything that is conclusive regarding his guilt? When I first heard it was the 30yr old allegation. Which should be thoroughly investigated, don't get me wrong, but you sound all the way convinced, and that allegation didn't do it for me. I would like to know what made you feel that way?

       First things first, he's a power politician, and I NEVER give them the benefit of the doubt on ANYTHING. Why? Because they have done nothing for me to

       There were multiple accusers, and his denial seemed flimsy at best and he seemed very nervous.

       Could it be a political thing? Sure, but at the very least, throughout these accusations we need to maintain an equilibrium with these accusations/pedophiles. We can't pick favorites and we can't give a certain side more of a benefit of the doubt. Do you see why that's important?
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is to reaffirm that. Nobody is giving Biden the benefit of the doubt, but some people are defending this guy and it makes us look like we have a bias. Whether or not that's organic or "shills", is up to the sub members to decide for themselves, but none of this seems organic to me and I'm skeptical of everything.

       Agree on all points, except the benefit of the doubt. I think everyone deserves that, but I haven't seen the other accusers' stories either. And not discounting the veracity of the first accuser, it is just the timing makes it a little suspect is all. We have all the national politics focused on a nothing Alabama senate seat. Why? What makes this so important?

       He forgot to mention the obviously forged yearbook note presented as evidence by his accuser. She was asked four times in an interview if it was a forgery and she refused to answer each time. This is why the accusations against Moore have no credibility, because there's no evidence it actually took place.

       so we should ignore the evidence that these are false allegations just because he is a trump supporter?  thought this sub was about the truth and not caring about the politics.  im with you about both sides but to start off with the moore bullshit suggests you are one of the shills you want us to rally against.

       when my grandmother was 14, she married a 28-yr old man. this was in the 1940's. this was also considered a common practice in the days of amassing healthy bodies / families to work the farm land.
      </p>
      <p>
       these types of relationships were part of the culture "back in the day." a part of the culture that we have no problem leaving behind, in today's culture.

       sadly, when I was in high school, just some 20 years ago, freshmen girls always dated older guys; it was not uncommon to have 14 yr old freshmen girl dating an out-of-school, 20 yr old men. it was sick and disgusting! and it probably STILL happens, to this day. gross.

       I am admittedly a Trump supporter and subscriber of T_D. I am also a conspiracy theorist. It is possible to be both. I personally find many things about the Moore allegations to be fishy as hell. That does not mean I am naive enough to think it doesn't happen on both sides of the aisle. Just saying.

       Finally...some reasonable sense here. I’m not naive enough to think he’s completely innocent, but I’m also not close-minded enough to believe he’s 100% guilty based on 40 year old accusations made 30 days or less before a senatorial election, with almost zero credible evidence beyond words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see the guy being guilty. I could also see his innocence. The issue with bringing up Hollywood accusations as an argument concerning Roy Moore (as I have seen done both here and other places) is that Hollywood has a long and storied history of such activity, and has been mentioned here and there for decades. This is the first we’re hearing anything about Moore (to my knowledge).
      </p>
      <p>
       If credible evidence, verified by independent professional forensics experts, is provided, then yes I’ll believe those ladies without a doubt. But until then, we have words to go on, and as we saw with the Mattress Girl saga, words aren’t always reliable. No matter how many tears accompany them.

       Anyone supporting Roy Moore was a political lost cause long before the current scandal with teenage girls. They will never be open to an actual fair analysis of both sides because their identity depends on the silly "our team" aspect of US politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget that Roy Moore is not only a likely pederast but he has shown utter contempt for the rule of law in many other areas. Moore is the philosophical poster boy for the Christian Fascism currently being installed by the Republican Party.

       Seems to be the case. Do you think the elite are "selecting" who is going to go down and be exposed for sexual crimes? Seems like they're doing it to deflect.

       The oligarchy is scrambling to maintain control, but I see no evidence that this is being manipulated. Every piece of shit being outed has been a known piece of shit for many years. It would be almost impossible to frame someone in this manner.

       The hilarious part is that people are defending these losers for political purposes. That is why women are so often reluctant to report rich men for their crimes.

       Is there really a lot of defense for Roy Moore here? I'm not seeing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, the women who made the accusations are just more fuel to the fire. You look at that guy's history on the Alabama Supreme Court and there was never a child abuser or kid rapist he didn't find some level of empathy for. It's fucked up.

       No one on either side has advocated defending ACTUAL perps.

       The point is that starting - or broadcasting and promoting - witch hunts without hard data and corroborating evidence is flat out disgustingly wrong and literally should be legally actionable. Notice how none of Moore's "accusers" try to have any evidence of what they say, because then they would be liable legally if it was shown to be fabricated (and Im sure it is).  Allred's client with the phony yearbook sig is in a world of shit for trying to pass off that obvious fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP, you should be ashamed of yourself, calling out "both sides equally" is completely beside the point. You "call out" anyone on
       <strong>
        ANY
       </strong>
       side that has corroborated and verified hard evidence of wrongdoing, there's no reason to try and artificially BALANCE the two sides, you idiot. Duh.

       I don't like how easy it is for someone to accuse somebody of something (from decades ago) and then the accuser has to somehow prove they're innocent. It's not fair. Especially in politics when an election's less than a month away.

       My point being, they can spam a bunch of anti democrat and pro trump / republican posts here to give the illusion of a bias here.

       The shills have big budgets and can make tons of Alts and bots to upvote their posts. So yes, a brigade. A politician brigade in a non political sub.

       Some "entity" of the elite is funding these things. Remember, this is an exclusive club of billionaires. Doesn't have to be one guy funding it, and these people collectively have all the money in the world and can always print more. There's always a bigger budget, especially for shilling or anything to quell the awakening. It's money well spent to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no I cannot pinpoint who or what exactly funds them.

       Definitely changed, and it even had a massive change since Trump won the election. There has been a blindly partisan support group whether organic or not.
