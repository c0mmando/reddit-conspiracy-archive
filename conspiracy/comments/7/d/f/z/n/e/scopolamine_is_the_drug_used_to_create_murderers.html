       Scopolamine is easily obtainable in South America... street criminals use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has the amazing property of making people under it's influence do anything they are told, leaving them with no memory of what they did.  The YouTube link is a vice documentary about it, 35 minutes and should be seen by anyone who wonders how patsies are are made.

       Edit: every time I see photos or footage of James Holmes, the "Batman killer", I think of this drug.  Most of the time he was in court, you could see confusion on his face.  He'd concentrate deeply, as if trying desperately to remember something he couldn't, or figure out an impossible puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit #2: I find it interesting that the top comment is a new addition within the last 40 minutes which claims this is all bullshit.  Even more interesting is that I can't, for some reason, reply to that comment.  I get the little notification that "Something went wrong" every time I try.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit #3: top comment, which was several paragraphs long with links and much "debunking" was deleted just a few minutes after I made note of it in edit#2.  If anyone has any ideas about why that comment is the only one I couldn't reply to, I'd like to hear them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit#4 that top comment was removed by mods, but why?  I certainly didn't agree with it, but
       <strong>
        it broke no rules of the sub. Why did moderators remove it?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 5 the oddly behaving comment has been restored. I was able to reply this time. I asked the poster why mods removed the comment. No reply as of yet.

       You can just go out to your garden and get similar plant alkaloids in Datura plants like Jimson Weed. It's everywhere. Read Jimson Weed/Datura stories on Erowid, it's like you live a horror movie for a few days. Complete dissociation. Maybe won't make you do whatever you're told, but definitely weaponizable.

       If you just want a deliriant, diphenhydramine is sold OTC in many places (as Benadryl/Nytol etc.). Scopolamine is somewhat unique in its alleged[1] effects in making you controllable.
      </p>
      <p>
       [1] My suspicion is that it induces sedation and confusion, making you less able to resist and/or formulate a lie, rather than making you actively controllable per se.

       Personally I've found that promethazine gives a better sleep than diphenhydramine, albeit at higher than normal doses[0]. Combined with 20mg tamazepam when necessary (I have severe headaches which keep me awake, which are worsened by insomnia, so sometimes fairly drastic measures are needed to break that cycle). It has a stronger anticholinergic effect though, so the risk of side-effects / long-term effects at those dosages is a definite consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oddly I didn't find diphenhydramine to be nearly as reliable[1] - before switching to my current antihistamines, I was taking 100mg, which made me
       <em>
        drowsy
       </em>
       but didn't do much to actually get me to sleep.

       I second this. Its been blown out of proportion for sure. On top of that, even if it was actually possible to do, everyone reacts slightly different to drugs. Forget about proper dosage per bodyweight, or full stomach, or anything else. Its just not possible. I would find it more believable that there is some form of hypnotism than this. Its just another media trying to scare parents ploy, and boost ratings by calling it a zombie drug or something.

       While I agree scopolamine is an interesting drug, I doubt it would be used for patsy or false flag. No I don't have any sources, just doubtful it would be used in such a manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone reacts differently, alot of variables to control, hard to control dose. Also the victim would be in a state of confusion and would need constant coaching.

       No but if I were to buy corn flakes cereal and everytime I poured a bowl half of the flakes were covered in shit it would make me stop buying the cereal. Half the vice articles today are literal shit, same with every main stream media. It's best to just avoid it at all, no one wants to eat shit covered corn flakes.

       I have no knowledge that my post was ever removed. However, I saw you make comments earlier suggesting that my post had been removed, and around the time of your commenting, I checked my post from another account and confirmed that it was still there, which it was. I also continued receiving replies and upvotes to my post the whole time, suggesting the post was still visible. That's just about all the information I have, so I have no explanation for what you experienced.

       I think a big mistake people make is wanting to assume everything is  coincidental.
      </p>

       If the mods did remove that comment because it was botted to the top, who is responsible for the comment?  Who would hop on here with a huge comment attempting to debunk, then bot it to the top?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this drug IS used to perpetrate false flags, the odd comment situation makes sense as an attempt at discreditation by a gatekeeper of this information.

       Yes, had one comment I couldn't respond to here.  It was a lengthy comment "debunking" the connection which leapt to the top of  the comment section.  I tested the other comments and that strangely behaving one was the only one I couldn't respond to.  After I made note of it in my post, mods removed the top comment despite it not being in violation of any rules.

       I hadn't even considered that, thank you.  I'm not computer savvy and don't really understand how bots function or how they would be detected. Your idea seems the most likely, though.

       Can confirm. You don't remember squat with that. I was given scopolamine when I was in labor with my first son. I don't remember most of that time, just little snippets here and there. Eight hours gone like it never happened and what I remember seems more like it was told to me, not like I actually experienced it.

       Yes, in the hospital in the United States. Was 1976 and I was pretty young, 18, so you kinda do what they tell you to do. I don't even remember them asking me if I wanted it, they just gave it to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went in because I was in labor. Turns out my son was breech, so I'm assuming they gave it to me because of that hoping it would erase any bad memories. He's fine, the birth went ok . .. I think. They knocked me out just before he was born in case it didn't go well, I'm guessing. But, that stuff is pretty awful. It's like you're looking at what is going on from the outside rather than experiencing it yourself. I only have vague memories of the whole thing and it took a while to wear off. I don't remember much of the next 24 hrs after he was born either. I was in labor for 8-9 hours and I remember only 3 things. They wouldn't let me go to the bathroom to pee afraid I'd lose him in the toilet, I guess. They told me to lay on my left side so he'd get better blood flow. And, I remember waiting for the Dr to come in to deliver him, while his butt was crowning, and the nurses were talking about what they would have for lunch. That's it. The entire total of my memories of those 8-9 hours.

       Maybe it's not even your son. Do you remember actually giving birth? They could have switched your child with another while you were drugged. Just saying.

       That's not necessarily due to the drug. I barely remember any of my labor and birth and I only had a few inhales on the laughing gas. You're body throws out a heap of hormones that make you forget. Why else would a woman have more babies?

       I had laughing gas when my wisdom teeth were removed.  Had more than a few puffs, was "gassed" during the whole 2 hour procedure.  I suffered no memory loss whatsoever. It is interesting how drastic the different effects on different people.

       Well it doesn't get any more coincidental than that. I've seen a few of the cards around in various conspiracy threads and have always wondered what was the deal with them; its almost like someone created the artwork in response to what happened.  Were the cards printed before these events?

       Yes, I think it would be more of a situation where someone is acting out what is on the cards. Symbolism is everything to these people. They communicate with secret codes and symbols and it's rampant in pop culture. Think of it like Reddit is a hivemind through memes and they are a hivemind through symbols/coded language.

       They were the Illuminati Card Game cars that had a guy with a watch that read 12:05. 12:05 was the Dark Knight Rises movie time of the mass shooting and also on the card was a building that looked just like the movie theater it occurred. There are several of those cards with similarities to real events. Creepy.

       Scopolamine is commonly used here in Canada as a motion-sickness medication (in patch form). I️ have personally used it multiple times for cruise ship vacations, etc. What kind of dose are we talking about because I️ definitely didn’t get any weird dissociative experiences

       Just kidding:)  all kinds of opiates and narcotics are used to help people, that doesn't mean you can't use opiates or narcotics for nefarious purposes.  I drink coconut water and eat bananas all the time, yet people use potassium-rich coconuts to off old relatives in India, they call it thalaikoothal.

       I think it works on older folks who are already bedridden, I think they get way too much potassium and their kidneys fail.  Not a great way to go, I think there's nausea and it's generally pretty uncomfortable.  They don't off healthy people but just avoid long term care of elderly parents. I'm going to be super nice to my kids:) I think I would prefer an overdose of some narcotic, just fall asleep.

        Edit: every time I see photos or footage of James Holmes, the "Batman killer", I think of this drug. Most of the time he was in court, you could see confusion on his face. He'd concentrate deeply, as if trying desperately to remember something he couldn't, or figure out an impossible puzzle.

       I think he was on medication and visiting forums/chats all day where they were poisoning his mind/planting seeds.  It’s really bad to be on meds and isolated spending all tour time online with people you dont know, they are lurking, waiting for prey.

       What a bunch of bullshit... Vice is just sensationalist garbage made for teens and 20-somethings. This isn't a documentary. They went to Colombia and paid some whores and weirdos to spin a good story, but there is very little truth to it.

       They talked about this drug the same way they'd talk about any other rape drug. Only the whores and dealers, who were paid by Vice, were making up the kind of stories the OP is talking about.

       I think there are probably way more advanced drugs the government uses (like the truth serums they were experimenting with from the 60's on) then Scopolamine. The U.S. used Scopolamine in the 20's (

       I'm not, I'm actively involved in discussions, but this place is like
       <a href="/r/drugs">
        /r/drugs

       . Half constructive discussion about the hobby of poly substance abuse and harm prevention, it's also half crazy people talking about Aurora's and third eyes. Point being, there's subreddits that are half serious and half

       You don't understand what he's saying?  He's saying it is the modus operandi of US Intelligence Community to use a pasty during their false flag operations.  They did it with Tippett, JFK, 9/11, and Aurora, CO, is what he's saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't fully agree with him.  In the case of Navy Yard Shooter and Aurora, CO shooters, I do believe they were mind controlled, and not patsies, but with the use of some relatively modern tech.  If scopalamine is involved, I don't believe it's the key ingredient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oswald and the Saudi hijackers, though, I agree are obvious patsies.

       I'm writing to defend him because I feel that a problem in this sub might be comments like yours.

       I completely agree with your theory and after watching a Vice episode on the plant and its effects, its actually the perfect drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       People whom have had it given to them in a bar or anywhere have been said to drain their bank accounts or be led to their homes to have it totally robbed all in complete compliance with whomever is leading them around.....the next day the victims have no recollection of the incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said about James Holmes...he was totally out of it during the whole trial..weather it was scopolamine or something else he was in boogie wonderland the whole time.
      </p>

       I really don't get how people can't fathom this being a possibility....I really don't....great post OP.

       Holmes was "not displaying any outward emotion or any outward sign of engagement of what's going on" when the police questioned him as he stood in plain sight outside the movie theater. 
Now why the fuck haven't they taken him to the station and drug tested him? Or perhaps they did, and the results vanished? Who knows. 
Whats clear is that he wasn't mentally ill, he wasn't a "loner" or a psychopath. seems like he developed schizophrenia out of nowhere, without any triggers.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion is that he went too far with  his research. He either fucked up himself or someone assisted him.

       I watch the vice documentary a while back and it was pretty cool. Do you think the effects would last long enough from just standard scopolamine, or would it have to be some modified research chem developed from scop with a longer half life?

       Scopolamine is a huge problem in South America, criminals use it on unsuspecting victims, they bring them to the ATMs and make them withdraw all the money they can from their bank accounts and the victims have no recolections of the events. They also go to businesses, use Scopolamine on the business clerk and tell them to give them all the money. A high dose of it can kill the vicim, like it has in the past.

       Yeah...hur dur...just because Vice sucks and has been bought out by libtards means everything about the drug is false and is all sensational garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a prime example of gaslighting.....
"You got your information from Vice! ...they suck balls and everything they say is bullshit...and if you believe OP you're a moron."
      </p>
      <p>
       ...what was false or bullshit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the effects of the drug stated here false?
I'm really confused why you're so sceptical that it isn't possible it could be a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a simple Google search will give you the same side effects as listed in the story.
