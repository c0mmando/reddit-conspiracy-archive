       This was the really incriminating and devious stuff they did not want coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Has anyone heard of any victims yet of the recent scandals being below 13?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the global trafficking ring of pre-pubescent children? The spirit cooking revelations? The photos that emerged from Epsteins island of men in hoods? Tons of accounts of former elite sex slaves who claim they were tortured and electrocuted with cattle prods to be "conditioned"?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's real legitimate child abuse and rape infused with satanic practices, that they are hiding from us, and instead dazzling us with "breadcrumbs" of Hollywood disposables.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It's real and it's on both sides of the political spectrum
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's shift the focus back to what we really want uncovered.

       I think people are a bit outraged-out on Trump sometimes. Especially since we spent weeks talking about the allegations prior to the election. Regardless of guilt, that probably would have ended his run had the allegations against Weinstein and Spacey come out at the same time. I think those dominos needed to fall first.

       Right? The media spends so much time on Trump scandals that it has become the new baseline and any report that isn't critical of Trump now counts as being pro-Trump propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all designed to appeal to emotions and divide the narrative into left vs right. There is only one consistent message here:
      </p>
      <p>
       **"Any news that comes out in the next few days about political scandals should be interpreted as partisan bickering, and can be dismissed without further research"

       I wasn't asked to present anything... but ok. It's suspicious because the handwriting in the two sections is different, especially the 7s, the fact that he signed it "DA," despite not having been the DA at the time it was written, and the fact that it's a yearbook being signed in December, which is strange. It kind of looks like someone took his signature from something else and superimposed it into this yearbook.

       His law clerk actually would stamp or copy his signature then write ‚ÄúDA‚Äù after to show that he signed it in Moore‚Äôs place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the accuser said she never saw him since the 70‚Äôs yet Moore presided over her 1999 divorce? So she‚Äôs absolutely a liar just at the start before getting to the signature.

       They also won‚Äôt let anyone examine the yearbook as well as wanting to go straight to a congressional inquiry NOT at all the court of law.

       I think that is something that Republicans are going to have to be forced to reckon with very soon, in the meantime it seems they aren't done self-righteously going after any and every liberal possible.  Which honestly is fine by me, most Americans are just one emergency room bill away from bankruptcy and we have the largest prison population in the world, I don't care if Democrat elites go to jail as long as it means the Republican elites will be targetted too

       Still. We'd have heard at minimum rumors. We don't even have those. Ditto for Podesta. You think that Sean Hannity doesn't have connections that would know about this? You think that anyone who blew the whistle on these two wouldn't be sanctified by the right? Ted Nugent would personally stand guard for them.

       Biden's been protected for a long time for some reason. But look at the bullshit he's gotten away with, on top of the Clarence Thomas bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plagiarism of that UK politician's speech, when he ran for President. That weird "articulate and clean" comment about Obama, and it's just one of a bunch of racist comments he's made.

       If you can look at all those videos of Biden and not think somethings really wrong, then we're just gonna have to respectfully disagree. Cuz I think's something's really wrong.

       The videos make me think something COULD be wrong, but nothing else does. Very few people have bad shit to say about Biden.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just can't get on board with this "we can learn everything by watching YouTube clips" shit. It's not real life and it is much much easier to create a lie in a video than in real life.

       God the more I watch these the more I realize Biden simply can't control his urges. Perhaps his wife keeps him in check or he may be one of the upper elite protected and that's why we haven't heard anything, but he can't control his actions around those little girls. It has just completely consumed him.

       I mean, is it really coincidental that Biden and Franken got in the news in somewhat specious circumstances immediately after Moore's stories left the realm of plausible deniability and stories about damage to the GOP brand started popping up? How could it possibly be?

       No, the way he touches little girls is not normal and is extremely creepy. He either has no understanding of body language or he gets off on invading people's personal space. He may not be a kiddy diddler, but don't try to normalize the disgusting way he manhandles people who are visibly uncomfortable.

       I don't understand this statement, it makes it appear that someone is in control of all these outings of pedos and creeps. These people are coming out are not controlled by anyone they are merely emboldened in stating their experiences because it's a safe time to do it. There is no person who wakes up in the morning and decides which person to out. That view is very simplistic and misleading. This giant melee of scandals has it's own life, and is being molded by hundreds if not thousands of people right now. No one person controls it, it's a social movement.

       Because, as many have said, it is to dilute the charges.  Moore isn‚Äôt just a political hit, it is just more and more flinging of accusation so that when the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       stuff comes out everyone will say ‚Äúthis is just a political smear‚Äù and there will already be sex abuse accusations everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Edit:  I want to note that I am not trying to get into the Moore thing, he is a shitstain demagogue pos regardless but the allegations do come at a fishy time.  Point is that there may be a greater reason for there to be evidence of falsehood even if the allegations are true.)

       a political hit.  The media ignores everything until it is beneficial to them.

       The media ignores everything until it can get ratings. Would anyone have given a single fuck about a nobody judge in Alabama being a pedophile? Get some PG accusers and it would catch fire. Right now though? No smoke, no fire. I guarantee if you could get someone to speak out it would explode.

       The news media also ignores everything they don't want the public to know. Covering pizzagate honestly would have been HUGE ratings. Even the people in denial would have watched that coverage the same way they'd watch a train wreck, kind of like how Trump got billions in free advertising from "liberal" media outlets. But they didn't cover it. They covered it up.

       I actually wrote and entire post this morning about how everyone who's getting busted are small fries, then deleted it.  Their big enough so it makes people feel like there is progress, and so anyone talking about the elite seems like they are talking about this small time bullshit.  Don't get me wrong, it's bad stuff, but not like raping children and the shit the elites do.

       The MSM here in Norway covered the "DarkRoom" scandal extensively last year. It involved people -- including a police officer or two -- raping and torturing children (toddlers, infants, etc.). One of the cases even involved a woman getting pregnant just to be able to give birth to a child she (and/or her partner) planned to abuse sexually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the MSM went silent. I guess the investigators went too deep. Perhaps they discovered that
       <em>
        powerful
       </em>
       people were involved in the abuse.

       I've heard him off-handedly mention it several times in the last two or so years I've been listening... giving a specific episode number, ehh... (I'd check around when this whole pizzagate thing first started appearing in the subs... so like oct-nov 2016)

       I can say that he gives the impression that he's almost sort of reluctant to detail it, as if he acknowledges that it can be
       <em>
        dangerous
       </em>
       to talk about.

       Here's the thing...cough cough...even if you use a word a certain way, alternate definitions and original root meanings can still apply a LOT of the time to the situation you are talking about.  Even somewhat true for word association and word sounds as well.  THAT is a deep topic.  But it's a big part of puns and comedy.

       People's names are one of the more interesting ways to look into it.
Nominative determinism is kinda the same idea.

       Now that's deep...have not heard it quite like that.  It's actually a sort of creepy thing, isn't it?  Like a sucker punch, when you learn to look further into almost anything word wise, but with a different lens.  Things really start to jump out at you.  It's cool though...and that is a vast understatement.

       The mystery schools (Essenes, Mayan order, Masonic order, rosicrutians, etc) all teach the same thing; ‚Äúthoughts are things‚Äù and they all teach that ‚Äúall that exists in manifest form, first started as thought‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you take that tack and you look at our languages and our words, you can see this happening. Let‚Äôs take one of my favorite simple examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       Information
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously nothing can be built without the correct information describing its nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read that sentence three times.
      </p>
      <p>
       In-formation to be formed
      </p>
      <p>
       Describing de-scribe, to scribe, to create, write.
      </p>
      <p>
       It‚Äôs nature - nature being that which eminates  into the being of the object, idea, thing, person
      </p>
      <p>
       Etc
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you look at language, it is what we use to define the universe, and language can be used on so many levels. Language is the most creative tool in the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the language of man and the language of math, the language of man is needed to navigate thought, which life possesses - but the language of math is just innate to the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you master the language of man, you can manipulate the thoughts of man to result in creations from the mind of man using the language of the universe, math.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don‚Äôt think that the elites know what they are doing, but they do, you can only manipulate energies with the right understanding and tools.

       Hate to make myself a target, but the zionists are masters of language and semantics....thats how theyve confused so many terms and words and changed thoughts and meanings. For example the term semetic....palestinians are semetic. Semites r people that speak a semetic language. Arabs are semites. So zionists are actually the ones who are antisemetic....

       Did you see my comment about the blog?  Canned personality...like Disney Kids, MKUltra, and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       People use the word "cringe" all the time, and you see NO issue with what she said?  I have no problem with people saying whatever they want, but for somebody that tries to be classy it's exceedingly in poor taste.  Like most hobos are classier.  And given other people she's been connected to, yes, she is very suspicious.  She also harps on how she's a girl from a "working-class" family, but that is not true as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, given that she has relatives in the archaic British Empire system (why do they have Knights still???), we know with Jimmy Savile, Theresa May and the like that they will sweep ANYTHING under the rug to maintain the appearance of propriety.

       Issue with her saying 'mega lolz'? I mean not really.. AFAIK the phrase was nothing to do with pedophilia it's just something he created long before that. It was commonly used and popular, it could easily just be a part of her regular vocab now if she was in a relationship with him for some time. It makes no sense to me she intentionally put it in there as a homage to his pedophile behavior, is that the theory? Is everyone that uses 'mega lolz' now a pedophile supporter? Obviously not. It's just more dumb internet slang who gives AF.

       Yeah, and taking that argument is ridiculous, and you know it.  It wasn't a homage or that she supports pedophilia.  It DOES show, for that someone who is all about CHARITY and fundraising, that she doesn't give a shit about morality or ethics or thinking about the impact of what she says.  It's not funny or catchy, and saying all dumb internet slang is the same is patently untrue as well.

       Well I would give AF if she was linked to something more suspicious but IMO a radio DJ using cringy outdated internet slang is not very significant. Do you not think she could have just forgot it had anything to do with him? Seems quite likely.

       I don't get your point.. I'm saying if a friend said it I would not remember it being anything to do with Ian Watkins and it would go totally unnoticed (aside from me thinking they were weird for saying LOLZ) so it seems quite probable that she doesn't automatically tie it to Ian Watkins either.

       Whatever, that "catchphrase" was plastered ALL over his t-shirts, stage set-ups, everything.  If she wasn't acutely aware of the significance of MEGA LOLZ!!! compared to just LOLZ then I'll eat my hat.

       That is true but it was a phrase that existed before that. I dunno man maybe you're right it just seems weird. Like if a known pedophile uses a particular phrase no one is allowed to say that phrase again? The phrase becomes out of bounds just because someone bad used it? It just seems like people getting easily outraged.

       Did I say "no one" is allowed to say it?  Yet again, you try and weasel it so that anything is fine and permissible.  Anybody can say it, including her.  But she is like the ONE person that should realize the importance.

       That's what I'm saying, what is the importance? I guess we just have different opinions on what is PC/acceptable or not which is fair enough. I guess we'll leave it there.

       Say Charles Manson had an ex-girlfriend.  If she was seemingly normal but used phrase "helter skelter" tongue-in-cheek, most people would look askew at that.

      <p>
       The importance is that our media is controlled by people of low ethical value, and they make light of things that are extremely dark and insidious.  Ian Watkins is NOT an isolated incident...there are people far worse than him.   And they are mostly connected to the elites, which she is a part of.  She's also friends with people in the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO)...it's all about shining a light on the people that hide in the shadows.  And some of those people also hide the light, too...

       BBC is like  British Hollywood. Sick things happened with Jimmy around and still happen now. Not to mention the Childen in Need and Comic Relief "charity programmes" that are so full of shit, it literally hurts to watch. Yet Brits still pay millions into it, they somehow still respect the Royals even after finding out they had close ties to Savile?? Britain wake up pls.

       my mom was drunk/high the whole time she was part of the Process Church of the Final Judgement and remembered little of it.

       Look man; all I know is that, as adults, we can be who we want to be and live up to our own standards. Bad shit happens to everyone in their own way but you don't see it stopping most people or turning them into helpless victims.

       This opened my eyes. It takes 9 months to produce a  child. It wouldn't be too hard to pay a sleezebag some life changing good money to have a child in secret, and it wouldn't be too hard to ensure no one finds out about it. Natural birth has been a thing since the beginning. This conspiracy wouldn't even involve many people.

       I'm all tapped out after the neocons. That's the only ones that have some sort of evidence linking them to the cabal. There are good people in government, not all of them are shitbags. There's even good honest Democrats. The ones at the heads of the major committees, executive branch, and intelligence agencies are more than likely deep state puppets used to further destruction and domination.

       I said he was a blind fool for only believing this goes as far as the Democrats. It's spans the political spectrum. Both sides are here to give the illusion of choice, but when it comes to war both sides work together for the cause. Funny how that works amiright?

       Apparently you have never heard of the Franklin cover up. That targeted the highest of the Republican party. So I really don't know what you're talking about. Sounds like you have an axe to grind and is salty about the pizzagate allegations.

       Hastert?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Former U.S. House speaker Dennis Hastert has been released from a federal prison 13 months after he began serving a sentence for a bank fraud conviction linked to his effort to buy the silence of a former student he sexually abused during his days as a high school wrestling coach.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hastert, 75, pleaded guilty to illegal structuring of bank withdrawals as part of an effort to circumvent federal banking laws as he went about paying off someone identified in court as "Individual A" for abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago during his years as a teacher and coach in Yorkville, Ill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The former speaker served about 13 months of a 15-month sentence, according to federal prison records, and now faces two years of supervised release and lawsuits from former students who say they were victims of Hastert.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How about that? This guy has abusing kids for
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       and still managed to become speaker of the house. No time for the abuse, just for the
       <em>
        paying off of the victim
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't something that develops overnight either. There's never "just one time" with people who are sexual abusers.

       okay, here's the point. We have an example of Hastert Sexually abusing kids, paying people off, conspiring. Things people who care about politicians abusing kids and keeping it quiet should be all about, right? But if you search Hastert on r/conservative you only get 15 posts since the start of the Pizzagate, and this INCLUDES one post about how /pol/ refuses to talk about it. Most of these posts have less then 10 comments and only one breaks 100.
      </p>
      <p>
       this guy should be the poster child for pizzagate or however you wanna brand it, but pizzagaters don't really seem all that interested in talking about him. (which is why I forgot about him until you brought him up)

       I think the phenomenon you are describing (ie forgetting about him) is precisely part of the mechanism that keeps these things under wraps. The Franklin Scandal? The child porn investigation that turned up
       <em>
        hundreds
       </em>
       of people at the pentagon?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a "pizzagater"... But I do remember a long series of allegations and investigations that
       <em>
        go nowhere
       </em>
       . These people are still out there, still abusing children, and still getting away with it. This is beyond partisan reindeer games.

       wow, Catholics and jews totally not demonized by old racist preachers. Okay, I might have been to vague about this...the racist preacher I'm implying ya'll agree with is basically just Jack Chick. So If you bring up a group that Jack Chick would hate, that isn't a defense. Don't bring up hippies or communists as examples that Pizzagate isn't blatent propaganda against the enemies of my hypothetical racist preacher.

       Definitely agree there. Regardless of the legitimacy of the whole pizzagate story, there's definitely some horrific level child abuse/sex slavery shit going on in elite circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember reading a post on Reddit a while ago about a member if another forum (suspected to be Robert Downey Junior) basically confirming that he was aware of such stuff and I think Hayden Panettierre (Save the cheerleader, save the world) the as among the victims.

       There's been some recent revelations of sexual harassment being rife here in UK parliament and historical stories of gay orgies with under age rent boys and such like among UK MPs.

      <p>
       And just to throw a further aspect into the works, the us if sexual abuse is, according to what I've read/listened to, a classic part of MKUltra mind control techniques (ie. Horrific trauma used to break the psyche of targets who can then be proframmed

       I wonder if these stories are intended to desensitize the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting with low-level abusers like Weinstein or Franken, who are basic creeps, slowly introduce the more and more perverted abusers into the mainstream news. MSM could string it out for years for their viewers. It may be never that the mass-public learns about the satanic elements of pizzagate. What the elites are doing is so disgusting that if the public ever found out there would be another Marseillaise.

       The current spate of sexual assault allegations started real, but then not only are they throwing a ton under the bus but also making sure to implicate politicians with overtones of being hit jobs.  This is all to muddy the waters and make people bored or suspicious of future allegations.

       Wow. You dont need to belittle that problem in order to call attention to a more insidious branch of the same issue. "Groping" -dismissive air quotes and all - is adult men lording their social power over other human beings in order to control, embarass, objectify &amp; abuse them. You don't need to downplay the seriousness of one thing to argue another thing is worse. We can be outraged about both things at the same time. The same people who grope &amp; otherwise sexually harass women have the same mindset and are probably the same people who are doing the darker things you're imaging.

       So actors had enough leverage over others to get away with this for decades, but powerful members of government don't? People just don't want to believe its true because it rattles the power structure, they want to pretend they can still blindly trust the govt.

       I don't think very many real people are actually saying that. There's a lot of that over-the-top denial all over social media, but I don't think very many of those actively denying are real people. It's astroturf, paid shills, political operatives.

       I don't think anyone's saying this. Most are very willing to accept and understand that powerful politicians participate use their power for purposes of sexual assault or sexual harassment. We even have documented instances of child molestation.

       I agree. I think they know that pedophiles are close to being exposed and they're pushing these "fall guys" out in front. Groping someone is nothing compared to what they've done. Asking if you can masturbate in front of someone is nothing compared to what they've done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charlie Sheen was accused of doing drugs with an underage Corey Haim and raping him. Why didn't that accusation get the kind of attention that it deserves? Why is everyone obsessing over some asshole Republican? Did anyone hear of this Moore guy before these allegations? Like yeah, I'm sure he's a sick fuck too, but why is the media obsessing over that while ignoring other instances that the public should be concerned with? It's because this thing we're seeing isn't organic. Some of the gross people being exposed are DEFINITELY being exposed on purpose in a controlled way.

       I had heard of Roy Moore before these allegations. All I know is he ran against Luther Strange. Luther Strange was the McConnell and Trump endorsed candidate, and lost.

       Interesting. The thought actually never occurred to me until I watched Season 2 of Stranger Things. There is a reporter that says something along the lines of (in referencing going public about a hard to believe story) "You and I are the kind of people that live our whole lives trying to see what's behind the curtain, but you have to realize most people enjoy the curtain, it's comfortable to them...you've got to water down the story so it's more believable to them"

       I noticed that as well. Also see the paragraph in Hitchhiker's Guide about a normal guy trying to get his head around something huge (the destruction of the Earth to be specific):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Earth.
Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole Earth having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the people he had been close to. No reaction. Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden stab ‚Äì the supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone. Nelson‚Äôs Column
had gone! Nelson‚Äôs Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was no one left to make an outcry. From now on Nelson‚Äôs Column only existed in his mind. England only existed in his mind ‚Äì his mind, stuck here in this dank smelly steel-lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia closed in on him.
       </p>
       <p>
        England no longer existed. He‚Äôd got that ‚Äì somehow he‚Äôd got it. He tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn‚Äôt grasp it. He decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He‚Äôd never seriously believed it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer
any such thing as a McDonald‚Äôs hamburger.
       </p>
       <p>
        He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he was sobbing for his mother.
       </p>

       That's a great passage. It's also interesting to me after being "enlightened" to the real world, so to speak, everything I've experienced before has new meaning and interpretation, including this book I read and totally didn't quite understand at the time.

       Brice Taylor! Now I remember! I remember hearing about her 17 years ago. Talked about project monarch and mind controlled sex slaves. She was a kid when this happened. Got passed around famous and powerful figures. As well as Sylvester Stallone and saw his dolphin thing. Whats the legitimacy of her claims?

       I suspect you're right. Unsurprising given the taboo placed on child rape by even our incarcerated population. Groping is unacceptable, but there are rapes that have occurred and continue to occur, and that is where we should focus the majority of our efforts.

       I hope everyone has taken a moment to consider how horrific this is.  Everyone expects nothing less from Hollywood.  But when you are talking about Senators, Congressman, Presidents like Clinton and Bush 41, these are leaders of our country.  They are elected to PROTECT the Constitution and the citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they are doing neither.  Their actions are literally dragging down the country.  We must get a handle on this issue.  Nothing less than the very existence of our country depends on it.

       Sex slave conditioning is from/due to Project Monarch, the successor to MK Ultra. Trauma is used to fragment and then control the mind of someone, usually susceptible children. I assume this is usually one of the reasons for such pedophilia and rituals besides the occult reasons

       But you are spot on, they are trying to create white noise over Feldman's accusations and ensuring the focus never goes over to the pedo rings which is the REAL story.

       This opened my eyes. It takes 9 months to produce a  child. It wouldn't be too hard to pay a sleezebag some life changing good money to have a child in secret, and it wouldn't be too hard to ensure no one finds out about it. Natural birth has been a thing since the beginning. This conspiracy wouldn't even involve many people.

       I don't understand this statement, it makes it appear that someone is in control of all these outings of pedos and creeps. These people are coming out are not controlled by anyone they are merely emboldened in stating their experiences because it's a safe time to do it. There is no person who wakes up in the morning and decides which person to out. That view is very simplistic and misleading. This giant melee of scandals has it's own life, and is being molded by hundreds if not thousands of people right now. No one person controls it, it's a social movement.

        Some of those detained had live-streamed abuse of their own children. Those arrested include two elected officials, one teacher and a lawyer.
