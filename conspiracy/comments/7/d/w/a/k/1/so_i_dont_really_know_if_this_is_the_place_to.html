       Hey guys, so i dont usually visit this sub so apologies if this is the wrong place to post but for some reason it just felt right, Periscope is a live streaming service owned/ran by twitter.. every single day there's HUNDREDS of underage kids that are watched by sometimes THOUSANDS of online predators and its fucking disgusting, i came across this a month or two ago when i saw a random article on google about this.. can't be that bad right? i thought to myself.. guys its literally shocking, hundreds of young kids every single fucking day are streaming themselves doing various sexual things while sometimes hundreds and thousands! of creepy fuckers tell them what to do and force them into it... the fact that no one is talking about this blows my mind, i figured after i saw that 1 article it would be a big thing and get shut down but no.. i havent seen it mentioned once and it honestlyblows my mind.. this is an absolutely huge problem that needs to be dealt with and i honestly dont know what else i can do, maybe one of you guys can figure something out but i just feel like everyone should be aware of this so we can help other kids from getting caught up in this.

       I have no idea dude, its possible to report the person who is live but not people in chat, i reported every single one i saw like that but even then it took several minutes for it to eventually be down, enough time for one to go from like 100 veiwers to a thousand easy.. its fucked up

       I've been using periscope for a while now. I've yet to see anything like this at all. At best just some wild teenager will pop up for a minute but is quickly taken down and I've never seen any sort of porn like stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The commenters on any video with any woman are pretty awful, and most are indian I assume because they are literally saying stuff like "show bob, open shirt" just like the memes.

       I do recall the Twittergate as mentioned by u/SiriusDogon and it was really bad, evidently. It seems insane that YTube is not being hit hard by all manner of Legal Remedy with the ElsaGate stuff and yet they're knocking decent channels off left and right!
      </p>
      <p>
       The damned world seems upside down!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not experiencing what OP is describing, I wonder if
       <em>
        demographics or location
       </em>
       are better indicators? Then too, I recall the highest areas for Porn searches are ultra religious Western States and some areas in the Deep South...or so certain cable companies report.
