    <div class="md"><p>14 years for me and over 25 for my dad. Both of us did everything we could to quit smoking and nothing worked. When we tried vaping, we put down cigarettes for good. Even while I was in the military they gave me the patch, the pill, the gum you name it. I think I tried every single alternative there was and I could not stop.</p>

<p>Vaping was the easiest transition there was. I literally sat down my pack of Marlboros and started vaping. There was like maybe a week of discomfort, but besides that it was flawless. I did some research and I found that it was not the nicotine that kept me coming back. It was a habit, the ritual. I still Vape to this day but with no nicotine, yet I will still get edgy without my mod on hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaping helped me quit nicotine altogether after a 10 year pack/day habit. Took about a year of vaping only until I was down to 0mg juice before I quit altogether. It was still very hard for me but I could not have done it without using vaping as a tool.</p>

So those boxes of patches that last you a week might last you all week are nothing but a huge Cash Cow. Medical and laboratory grade nicotine is dirt cheap.

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty big. Not too long ago they were pushing pretty hard to pass and regulations that would put vaping shops out of business. They wanted the FDA to approve everything. Doesn&#39;t sound too bad in the beginning but let&#39;s take a look at the details. FDA testing takes about $100,000... Per product....</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say I have a line of juices and I have 10 flavors. I offered each flavor in six nicotine strengths. Each flavor in each nicotine strength would have to go undergo FDA testing... $100(k)x 10 x 6 = 6mil. Thankfully the regulations they had proposed essentially got neutered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pack a day for ten years here. Someone I loved who never asked anything of me before made me promise that I would &quot;at least try vaping&quot;. So I did. Turns out I liked it way better. Sense of smell came back, lung capacity came back, the complexion of my came back, and I no longer deal with ashes and smoke everywhere in my house.</p>

<p>I still cough in the morning, and I think it&#39;s 100% due to vaping constantly. I&#39;m not gonna pretend vaping is completely healthy and safe. But I know my body pretty well, what with having lived inside it for my entire existence, and it&#39;s simply working better than it was before when I used to reef back a pack of Players Original every damned day. </p>

<p>Cigarettes make me feel sick now. Although I&#39;ve found that the smell of second hand smoke has become more enticing after four years on the vape. I don&#39;t know what they put in that shit, but it&#39;s diabolical. </p>

<p>You&#39;re probably still dealing with residual tar from all those years of smoking. Or there is an environmental factor (dust, mold, etc). Or, you&#39;re one of those crazies who pursue setups that produce huge vape clouds.</p>

<p>Going to assume the comments being deleted are anecdotal.</p>

<p>Vapers need to commission (fund) some studies if they want to engage in the discussion on r/science.</p>

<p>As it is, Big Tobacco and the Anti Smoking lobbies are both invested in ending vaping. That&#39;s alot of money, and alot of studies, to overcome.</p>
