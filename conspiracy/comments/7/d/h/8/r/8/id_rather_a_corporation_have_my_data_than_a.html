<p>The guy with the gun does what he does because of what the leaders of the corporations tell him to do.</p>

<p>You mean there would be Nestle owning all the water, and setting prices.  The fact that you are even considering that a highly inelastic resource should be under private ownership is just silly.  There is a direct incentive to jack up the price at the loss of effective demand.  Do you know what that means?  Do you know what effective demand translates to in human terms?  Just sociopathic!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well no, that company would pay of the researches, and falsify the studies,  engage in a very powerful PR campaign, and pay of the politicians.  The notions that strong corporations just go out of business because of some kind of malfeasance is not strongly supported empirically. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Because capital tends towards monopoly, and Nestle currently almost has a monopoly on water products.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why do you think competition on the free market isn&#39;t the best way to get the cleanest water to the most people for the best cost? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several reasons, the first would be that there are no such things as free markets, the second is that capital has a tendency towards monopolization, and the third, and I think most important is that water is an inelastic good.  A company can increase its profit, by increasing the price, while its effective demand shrinks.  Effective demand shrinking = some people not getting water. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>sure maybe some company may falsify information</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well once a company gets a certain size, than even getting cought  falsifying results would cost less than not being caught.  There is a direct financial incentive towards moral hazard. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but we have free speech</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, as liberals never get tired of repeating, is not applicable to private organizations.   The government can&#39;t interfere with the press, but private corporations are not  bound by this, they can attack the press. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>overnight, that bad company would lose all of its business, and a competitor would offer a deal to attract the new customers with the demand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we are just going to repeat each others claims.  The company would not go out of business overnight, especially if it had a certain market share.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and as a result you have a monopolistic entity that has NO FEAR of competition and NO REASON to give good service because your money is SEIZED and given to them REGARDLESS of your satisfaction because its LAW.</p>

<p>Fear of competition is not the only incentive, nor is it particularly a real incentive. </p>

<p>why do you think the company would not go out of business overnight? i wouldn&#39;t keep paying. already in society we have many ways to get water, and each town could decide how it&#39;s water works. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>can you explain why you think capitalism tends towards monopolization? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that is what empirical data shows, and theoretically I think the following paragraph is accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The desirability of monopoly, from the perspective of a capitalist, is self-evident: it lowers risk and increases profits. No sane owner or business wishes more competition; the rational move is always to seek as much monopoly power as possible and carefully avoid the nightmare world of the powerless competitive firm of economics textbooks. Once a firm achieves economic concentration and monopoly power, it is maintained through barriers to entry that make it prohibitively costly and risky for would-be competitors successfully to invade an oligopolistic or monopolistic industry—though such barriers to entry remain relative rather than absolute.

<blockquote>
<p>and like, if you&#39;re so afraid of monopolies, can you explain why you think it&#39;s a good idea to START with one by centralizing it in a government run program</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because a government programs are not commodities nor firms, that makes them qualitatively different.  They are not motivated by profit, as such the tendency to increase profit by cutting costs is not present, the incentive to save by cutting costs is.  Therefore a government program can run at a loss, provide a valuable public service to everyone, like water, and still be solvent. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>i wouldn&#39;t keep paying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until you got thirsty. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>already in society we have many ways to get water, and each town could decide how it&#39;s water works. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is somewhat simplistic, as water aquafers, lakes and rivers don&#39;t just serve a particular community, rather they serve multiple communities, as such communal mechanisms to manage those resources necessary.  And if the last 100 years have shown is that treating natural resources as commodities is not a sustainable practice. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so there&#39;s a reason why the greedy capitalist will have to provide the best service </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Capitalists don&#39;t have this incentive, the goal is minimize costs, while maximizing profits, this does not entail a best product or service.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>your quote about capitalism condensing is true in the sense that it&#39;s what the capitalist wants. but there are many capitalists. and they&#39;re all competing for your dollar. so when one gets too big, another will innovate and create something better that they can offer at a competitive price.</p>

<p>financially you&#39;re right about the government not seeking profit, but as a result there is no market competition to threaten them if they perform poorly. we need competition.</p>

<p>you say until i got thirsty - there are many ways to get water, i would boycott the one that is poison. under your system, where private ownership is illegal - there is LITERALLY no other option than the state which we&#39;ve seen is prone to lead in the pipes.</p>

<p>the capitalist can not achieve his selfish goals you describe without getting you to voluntarily purchase what they&#39;re selling. so they want to make it what you want. </p>

<p>government takes your money and gives you the service and you have no other option.</p>

<p>Completely ignoring barriers of entry that are erected.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t need competition.  There are different modes of enforcing accountability, that do not involve threats of financial loss. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>where private ownership is illegal - there is LITERALLY no other option than the state</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that is literally false, as in the real world that we occupy we can get water through other means.   To reiterate the important point, there are other mechanisms to enforce standards than fear of losing market share. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the capitalist can not achieve his selfish goals you describe without getting you to voluntarily purchase what they&#39;re selling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As there are asymmetries, and ones where they are very pronounced the appeal to volunteerism is somewhat empty.  If you are thirsty and the only option is the company story, even if the act of purchasing can be explained as voluntary, it is still unjust. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>government takes your money and gives you the service and you have no other option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only  reason there is money is because of state systems, but this is really not important, what is important is that those systems are somewhat accountable to the public, and we have some mechanism to enforce fairness.   Corporate forms are not responsive to those mechanisms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what barriers of entry? you mean the regulations installed by gov&#39;t that limit competition?</p>

<p>like i said, i agree that government doesn&#39;t operate with a financial incentive. but there still should be competition. if there were a few water sources funded by different &#39;government&#39; groups, as well as private business, i see no problem with that</p>

<p>where you say that&#39;s literally false, im sorry but you&#39;re wrong. im not describing currently, im describing if you make private means of production of water illegal, that means that you have no other option but the state monopoly and its ILLEGAL to sell water otherwise. </p>

<p>corporate forms are more accountable to the public than government. i can&#39;t believe this is even a question. look at our government and congress, there&#39;s like a graph i saw that shows it doesn&#39;t matter what the public wants congress acts in whatever way it wants.</p>

<p>a business that doesnt satisfy you will be out of business fast. our government just gets bigger and bigger</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm...a slave to the elite or a slave to the pursuit of money and materialism. What&#39;s the difference? That&#39;s how they want us to be, after all. Corporations don&#39;t give two shits about us, they could care less if what they sell to us is killing us as long as we don&#39;t notice. The government doesn&#39;t give a shit either. The same people who control the corporations are connected with the people who control the government, so don&#39;t get all chummy with them just because they give you products. You&#39;re not getting any actual benevolence from either one with these people in control. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>can you explain why you think capitalism tends towards monopolization? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that is what empirical data shows, and theoretically I think the following paragraph is accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The desirability of monopoly, from the perspective of a capitalist, is self-evident: it lowers risk and increases profits. No sane owner or business wishes more competition; the rational move is always to seek as much monopoly power as possible and carefully avoid the nightmare world of the powerless competitive firm of economics textbooks. Once a firm achieves economic concentration and monopoly power, it is maintained through barriers to entry that make it prohibitively costly and risky for would-be competitors successfully to invade an oligopolistic or monopolistic industry—though such barriers to entry remain relative rather than absolute. Creating and maintaining barriers to entry is essential work for any corporation.</p>
</blockquote>
