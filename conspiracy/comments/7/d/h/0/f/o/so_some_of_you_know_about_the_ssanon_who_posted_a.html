       Now, most of us dismissed him because Tony Podesta wasn't arrested along with Manafort.  But I think no one knows that he posted again a week later.

       I think Q's posts drowned him out because if you remember, that whole Q saga began right after this anons initial post.  But it seems to me that he pretty much states that Q is bs.  And with the sealed indictments, maybe he's onto something?  I don't know.  I'm just sick of waiting for a happening.

       Think of how long it takes for people to divorce. Our judicial system is so so so slow.. attorneys can keep things out of public eye forever and draw out any case. Imagine all the murder trials that last years.. it takes time, be patient.

       There is no way on this earth Sessions is as stupid as he being made out to be. I could buy the argument that he is corrupted, but I do think Trump would have fired him if this was the case. I've gone over this for months in my head and the only way this makes sense is that Sessions is holding back.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do know the Podesta's are coming up. They were mentioned in the Manafort case. It's just a matter of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think some of the people calling for someone to replace Mueller are corrupted. Jim Jordan seems like a good dude.

       That's what I was thinking. Why Sessions?  Why is he doing this?  Why did Trump tweet all those negative things about Sessions when in fact, Sessions was the first one he appointed to a cabinet position?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only conclusion I can come to is that, they've got something planned.  They're up to something.  They're playing a game!

       Do any of you actually take these 4chan posts seriously?  Look at the kind of language used -
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I knew /pol/ was autistic
       </p>
       <p>
        I didn't know /pol/ was retarded as well

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These 4chan posts (if they're even written by the same troll) are the work of someone who is absolutely
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       a member of the government, or likely any institution more prominent than a Burger King.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure you'll call me a shill for pointing out how ridiculously asinine these 4chan posts are, and you'll definitely call me a dirty jew goy for implying that these posts are complete horseshit, and that's OK.  But at least take a moment to actually think about the implications the poster is attempting to drill into your mind as
       <em>
        "The Truth!!!"

       You seem to believe a 4chan post that has zero credibility, zero sources cited, and no proof that the poster is who they claim to be.

       I’m sorry that your assumptions about me don’t match reality.

       I did not imply it. I also believe government agents lie. Where did I say that being a government agent means one always tells the truth?

       I think this is a LARP too. Most times when real gems of knowledge have been dropped on /pol/ it's from an Anon and it's in a thread. No insider would use a namefag and make their own thread if they were dropping real knowledge because they'd want to get lost in the noise. The people who make these threads are just attention whoring or shills. Shills trying to distract you from the bigger picture. Bigger than just the DNC, or the Podestas, or even Hillary.

       )&gt;"5. Some of you guys are saying that the Uranium One deal may have supplied North Korea or Iran with uranium. While this MAY be true, there is no way to verify this. Once the Russians had the uranium, we had no way to trace where they ultimately went. Stop compromising the investigation with unconfirmable theories. They do not help. "
