<p>Now, most of us dismissed him because Tony Podesta wasn&#39;t arrested along with Manafort.  But I think no one knows that he posted again a week later.  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZBq8h0F.png">https://i.imgur.com/ZBq8h0F.png</a></p>

<p>I think Q&#39;s posts drowned him out because if you remember, that whole Q saga began right after this anons initial post.  But it seems to me that he pretty much states that Q is bs.  And with the sealed indictments, maybe he&#39;s onto something?  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m just sick of waiting for a happening.</p>

<p>Edited: the first link.  Sorry, posted the same link twice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way on this earth Sessions is as stupid as he being made out to be. I could buy the argument that he is corrupted, but I do think Trump would have fired him if this was the case. I&#39;ve gone over this for months in my head and the only way this makes sense is that Sessions is holding back.</p>

<p>We do know the Podesta&#39;s are coming up. They were mentioned in the Manafort case. It&#39;s just a matter of time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think some of the people calling for someone to replace Mueller are corrupted. Jim Jordan seems like a good dude.</p>

<p>The only conclusion I can come to is that, they&#39;ve got something planned.  They&#39;re up to something.  They&#39;re playing a game!</p>

<p>These 4chan posts (if they&#39;re even written by the same troll) are the work of someone who is absolutely <strong>not</strong> a member of the government, or likely any institution more prominent than a Burger King.</p>

<p>Sure you&#39;ll call me a shill for pointing out how ridiculously asinine these 4chan posts are, and you&#39;ll definitely call me a dirty jew goy for implying that these posts are complete horseshit, and that&#39;s OK.

Once the Russians had the uranium, we had no way to trace where they ultimately went. Stop compromising the investigation with unconfirmable theories. They do not help. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We would love to expose Obama as well but Pres Trump is adamant about protecting former Presidents. Even if they are corrupt pieces of shit, he believes in the dignity of the office. He feels that ruining the legacy of a President will do nothing but hurt our country. This is why both Bushâ€™s., Bill Clinton, Obama, and even LBJ will be spared. &quot;</p>
