    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that was what he meant. I took it as &quot;Bitches want me because they want my money&quot;. However, I&#39;m not going to deny the possibility, his position and power before running would certainly allow him to do that. But so far I&#39;ve seen no proof to even suggest he may have, other than the shady shit he said about his daughter that one time and his buddy-buddyness with Epstein, the second being extremely concerning to me. </p>

<p>But don&#39;t you think if he did sexually abuse someone, they would have taken them and got them to make allegations suited to what they would allow them to reveal and set it up so that they can be proven before a judge? With all of the predictive programming I&#39;ve seen, they&#39;re dead set on either killing or fatally discrediting this man. I&#39;d think if there are people who were sexually abused by Trump, they&#39;d leap at the chance to use them as their puppet to help get rid of him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll explain even though I know I&#39;m wasting my time doing so. </p>

<p>Trump is as anti-establishment as it gets. Our government has gained control of our lives in more significant ways than you are aware of. Every power granted to them has accumulated to the point where they act without recourse. It happens on both sides of the party line, and both parties rely on this status quo. Trump is actively pushing for accountability in government, and not just for the Democrats to make political gains. He has allied himself with people he believes with apply the rule of law equally to the elites that abuse their power. Obviously it doesn&#39;t effect lower courts which is a huge problem right now, but setting the example in high courts will do more for our country at this time.</p>

<p>I understand why you&#39;d think he hasn&#39;t actually done any of this, most of the developments have been relatively small and blacklisted from MSM. The bigger picture is what is important. Every time the Clinton&#39;s corruption is brought the response is &quot;well she&#39;s not our president, why does it matter.&quot; It matters because she&#39;s an obvious of example of the level of corruption our politicians are engaged in. If you&#39;re familiar with <em>Art of the Deal</em> you&#39;d understand that Trump doesn&#39;t make a decision if he doesn&#39;t already know the outcome of it. The only way to thwart those who have been operating behind the scenes and off the books is to meticulously track every single detail. Given the nature of the government&#39;s attitude toward anti-establishment politicians, Trump doesn&#39;t have many people he can trust which only adds to the amount of time needed to develop an airtight case. I don&#39;t necessarily mean a case against Clinton either, there are people in our government and intelligence agencies that are much more dangerous.</p>

<p>On top of this he&#39;s focused on taking down MS-13, child sex rings, and the opiate trade, all things we know our intelligence agencies are involved with in some way. The problem is we&#39;ll never know to what extent they are involved and many believe they don&#39;t deserve our trust.</p>

<p>I get it if you don&#39;t buy any of what I&#39;m saying, all I can say is I hope one day this becomes clear for the sake of our country. I was bordering on the edge of full blown liberal political views before I saw in Trump what I&#39;ve always wanted to see in a President. Even then, though, I never bought into either sides Media because of the obvious disinformation. He&#39;s the one candidate I&#39;ve seen who was the subject of disinformation from all sides, yet spoke the truth. I&#39;ll admit this isn&#39;t always the case with him and he exaggerates more than he should, but when it came to the issues I find important he was spot on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you gave an actual response. I&#39;ll do the same:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump is as anti-establishment as it gets. Our government has gained control of our lives in more significant ways than you are aware of. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you implying that you somehow ARE aware? How so? How did you gain this knowledge?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every power granted to them has accumulated to the point where they act without recourse. It happens on both sides of the party line, and both parties rely on this status quo. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that was the case, then why did they ever let Trump get elected?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump is actively pushing for accountability in government, and not just for the Democrats to make political gains. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.....no he isn&#39;t. Please cite any examples of him doing this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has allied himself with people he believes with apply the rule of law equally to the elites that abuse their power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again....examples?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand why you&#39;d think he hasn&#39;t actually done any of this, most of the developments have been relatively small and blacklisted from MSM. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where did you get them from? If you found them then surely you can post some links</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bigger picture is what is important. Every time the Clinton&#39;s corruption is brought the response is &quot;well she&#39;s not our president, why does it matter.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, I don&#39;t care about the Clintons. I care about what is actually happening right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It matters because she&#39;s an obvious of example of the level of corruption our politicians are engaged in. If you&#39;re familiar with Art of the Deal </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why on god&#39;s green earth would I read that garbage? It wasn&#39;t even written by Trump. It was written by a ghostwriter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;d understand that Trump doesn&#39;t make a decision if he doesn&#39;t already know the outcome of it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he&#39;s psychic now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way to thwart those who have been operating behind the scenes and off the books is to meticulously track every single detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet he won&#39;t release his tax returns, has lied about the revenue of his organization, and has made hundreds of false statements since taking office.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given the nature of the government&#39;s attitude toward anti-establishment politicians, Trump doesn&#39;t have many people he can trust which only adds to the amount of time needed to develop an airtight case. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t think his antagonistic attitude has hurt his cause there?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t necessarily mean a case against Clinton either, there are people in our government and intelligence agencies that are much more dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why on Earth are you so fixated on Clinton?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of this he&#39;s focused on taking down MS-13, child sex rings, and the opiate trade, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are you even talking about? Do you have any evidence at all for any of this or are you LARPing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all things we know our intelligence agencies are involved with in some way. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No....we don&#39;t know any of that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem is we&#39;ll never know to what extent they are involved and many believe they don&#39;t deserve our trust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those people are idiots. The intelligence community consists of THOUSANDS of analysts, agents, lawyers, accountants, etc. Are you saying they are all somehow involved in this vast conspiracy?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get it if you don&#39;t buy any of what I&#39;m saying, all I can say is I hope one day this becomes clear for the sake of our country. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you would post links to your sources or any sort of proof, then I would buy it.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>By that logic, touching any girl is wrong.</p>

<p>The women with Louie were uncomfortable. It comes down the how the other person feels. It&#39;s either consensual or not. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s flip genders and consider - how many guys would turn down letting one of the hottest (most attractive) girls grab their dick?</p>

<p>Trump was bragging and making a statement of power and of being incredibly desired by women - he was building himself up. If you read between the lines that&#39;s all he&#39;s saying. He&#39;s a fucking egomaniac. </p>

<p>That does not imply in any way that he acted against a women&#39;s wishes, which is what Louie is going through.</p>

<p>Again, at the end of the day, it comes down to how both people feel about the situation. We&#39;re going off of an unspecific, vague statement about how &quot;women will just let you grab &#39;em by the pussy&quot;. I mean... that&#39;s probably true. </p>

<p>Imagine any hot girl saying the same thing... &quot;guys will let me just go up to them and grab them by the dick&quot;. It&#39;s fucking true.</p>

<p>It was a power statement. It does imply forcing yourself upon someone against someone&#39;s wishes. That&#39;s a huge leap. He&#39;s just implying that he&#39;s fucking desired and he can do whatever he wants BECAUSE THEY LET HIM.</p>

<p>The problem is, very few guys have the experience of what so many hot girls do that they can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like to be universally desired.</p>

Grabbing someone &quot;by the pussy&quot; IS assault. After he (or anyone else) assaults someone (theoretically) in this manner, the victims of this assault would fall into two categories - women who were ok with what happened and women who weren&#39;t. It isn&#39;t his (or anyone&#39;s right) to just grab crotches willy-nilly assuming the owners of said crotches are ok with that.
Just because a small number of people may be ok with assault doesn&#39;t mean its defensible and it&#39;s impossible to determine who would &#39;let him&#39; before he actually tries it.</p>
