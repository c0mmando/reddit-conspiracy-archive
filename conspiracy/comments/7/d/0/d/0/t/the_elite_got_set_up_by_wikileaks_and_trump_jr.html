       You saw the screenshots that Trump Jr. posted of his conversation with Wikileaks. But did you click on the link in the messages? Here it is:

       The elite/media got set up. If Trump is playing 4D chess, there is no way they would do something as dumb as have Trump Jr. corresponding with Wikileaks on Twitter, as if they don't have a more private place to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire conversation was pre-planned to get the public to indirectly look at Seth Rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Folks, when these mass arrests happen, forget about Uranium One, Hillary Clinton and John Podesta are going to be on a murder trial. Wikileaks will/has provided all the evidence.

       None of us has a more private place to speak. The only questions are which combination of NSA/CSE/GCHQ/ASD/GCSB/BND/DGSE/GRU/MSS/ETC are creping on your data at any moment in time and what combination of technical/legal vulnerabilities they are exploiting.

       I believe regular citizens would have more privacy than a targeted individual such as Assange.

       They would be subject to real physical espionage, things like bugs, specialized microphones, and intercepted electronic shipments.

       It does make sense to hide in plain sight. Look at how the Government has operated for decades. They encourage the "Conspiracy" mindset. It'd easy to discredit someone when you call them a conspiracy theorist. Messaging back and forth under our noses and in full view of anyone willing to look, is like, straight out of the 'Cover-Up Play Book.'

       Do you honesty think it’s that in-depth? You honestly think that Donald trump and his “people” are that smart to set up tptb who have controlled the world for so long? I’m not being sarcastic It’s just hard for me to believe that Donald is playing 4d chess with all of the mistakes his entire group has made. Please prove me wrong because I really want to believe and I want to be hopeful but I can’t.

       Well, he has somehow made his way into the oval office, and the mainstream media/establishment wants nothing more than to get him out of there. That's the most compelling evidence that he is at least on a
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       side than the TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, his side might not necessarily be a good side either. But, unless this is a big soap opera (which is very possible), it seems that there is a real power shift happening in front of us right now.

       He appealed to a large amount of people. Doesn’t mean he was/is smart. I’m not trying bash him I just want him to prove it to me that he is trying to Maga and not just do whatever he can to get more publicity.

       When you are a billionaire, you have access to intelligence that an ordinary person does not. Trump likely has known about the deep state for a very long time. This is a link to a mainstream Washington Post article discussing one such Trump connection.

       Do you honestly believe that? You think that the "good" people in the in our government asked Donald Trump, a TV personality, who has had quite a bid of bad publicity and bad business deals, to step up and become POTUS so that he could help in the take down of TPTB?? There isn't ANYONE else in the entire U.S.A that could have done this? Or is Donald the only one not corrupted? None of the other Billionaires in the U.S.A were qualified enough? Or is it that Donald was just the easiest to manipulate?

       Easy answer to all questions:  Who fucking knows???  This could have been in the works for a long time.  Possibly why Trump was trolling Barry so hard on Twitter. It's possible but seemingly unlikely.  We are all so in the dark it's hard to determine anything for certain.  Time will tell and we will be trying to sort this out in hindsight.

       I'm not American and I'm just wondering why every negative story about Trump gets turned into a win by his fan club. He plays golf with Rupert Murdoch and Netanyahu sleeps at his son in laws. He is the Elite he is one of TPTB yet he gets a free pass. Fuck Hillary and fuck trump they should all pay for their crimes.

       Well, he has somehow made his way into the oval office, and the mainstream media/establishment wants nothing more than to get him out of there. That's the most compelling evidence that he is at least on a
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       side than the TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, his side might not necessarily be a good side either. But, unless this is a big soap opera (which is very possible), it seems that there is a real power shift happening in front of us right now.

       It does make sense to hide in plain sight. Look at how the Government has operated for decades. They encourage the "Conspiracy" mindset. It'd easy to discredit someone when you call them a conspiracy theorist. Messaging back and forth under our noses and in full view of anyone willing to look, is like, straight out of the 'Cover-Up Play Book.'
