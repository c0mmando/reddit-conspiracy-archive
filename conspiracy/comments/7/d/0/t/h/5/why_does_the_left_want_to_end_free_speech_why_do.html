       There are examples on both sides.  Geez stop looking at this as a sporting event and look at what is happening.  We spend more time worrying about who's feeling are going to get hurt than talking about the issues.  We don't agree with someone and we can't talk about it.  Instead we throw bullet points and call names.

       I think your feelings are hurt. I'm putting facts to show the point it is both sides, it's how our political operatives manipulate us. You made the same mistake others do by placing blame on one-side. You get called out and now, after 4-5 reiterations if it being the left have come to the point that there's no sides and it's a global and equal manipulative effort. You're starting to learn and that's the point

       For one thing if the media is rabidly against Trump to the point of talking about pulling off a coup and routinely taking every word he says and twisting it out of context misrepresenting everything he says, then why does even having press briefings make sense? They don't. So those links are garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't really fault Trump for the CIA director wanting to stop wikileaks from disseminating classified info. That link is garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       And talking about allowing libel suits on the fake media? The same media that misrepresents everything he says and lies by omittion? Maybe the media should be held accountable for lying. It certainly would change things.

       Wouldn't recording press briefings prevent words being twisted and manipulated, if you weren't worried about being in record lying?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure I get your point on the libel suits. The media certainly can be sued for libel and defamation, even by politicians, you just need to prove it to be maliciously and knowingly false. I think threatening to sue, with no intention, instead of showing how its false leads to an intimidation of the press. I think declaring you will repeal case law regarding the First Amendment us fairly scary. I put it up there with legalizing state propaganda under Obama as some of the scariest things you can do in attempting to manipulate what we get as news.
      </p>

       I agree on the Wikileaks one, I just grabbed the first few from a search.

       Not really. During prime time and repetition news the corporate media will only play the sound bites they want to use to make Trump look bad. I have notice that most news station follow a strict George Orwell style daily 2 minutes of Trump hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is why Trump uses twitter so their isn't a middle man in between his words and the public.

       I'd disagree. Let's put it this way? Would you be OK with a country where the only information we received regarding the President's activities were provided in unquestioned speaking points from the office or in interviews to "friendly" outlets that softball questions? Would you be okay reducing first amendment case law on suing the press' coverage on politicians, so that they are constantly sued for reporting events that are negative on an administration? How about ejecting and ridiculing protestors at presidential rallies, so the people's voice can't be heard, as we've seen repeatedly. Hell, Clinton did the same thing duringbhis Presidency by using surveillance to identify protestors and ensure cameras don't show them when scanning the crowd. Both instances with him and Trump are manipulation of the first amendment. We just get conditioned to say, it's a privilege to report or to protest when it's our person.

       Just because you put a question mark at the end of a group of words, doesn't mean you are actually asking a question... Go back and read what your two "questions" were. Yeah, they broadly sweeping statements with a ? At the end. It's like if I asked, "Why is it you choose to be blind to reality?" or "Why do you hate us so much to intentionally waste our time with drivel?"

       So Keurig execs decide to exercise their rights of free speech and not advertise their products on a program that conflicts with their brand identity, and the Right smashes their Keurig machines in protest of Keurig exercising their right to publicly denounce a TV host's actions. I struggle to see how this is limited to the Left.

       Freedom of speech means the government can't sensor you. Other citizens are still allowed to criticize you or boycott you if they so wish. You don't just get to say whatever you want with absolutely no backlash from your peers.

       I never said anything was wrong about criticizing them.  As a matter of fact I said the opposite.  Yes criticize them, let them show their true colors.  In a way I think quieting people who we don't agree with are almost protected when we quiet them.  People then can't see them for what they are.

       Well the left isn’t some monolithic entity, there are idpol zealots sure, but they think they are fighting the chilling effect of privilege with safe spaces. We can see that in the victim blaming culture of the sexual assault stories coming out. Women who have been abused are afraid to speak up against the powerful who hurt them, especially since they know they’ll be interrogated in court and forced to relive through their abuse to strangers (the court).
      </p>
      <p>
       In race relations many people get shouted down. People with privilege think that racism is solved, because it’s not enshrined in law anymore, but these wound of centuries aren’t going to be over in a few generations. So you may see POC-only spaces because these are one way to get away from racism still lingering under the surface. Somewhere that they can speak up to people without having to hear “I’m not a racist but...” because that is usually going to be dismissive of their lived experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as there are authoritarians on the right, there are overzealous idpol leftists. But by no means is the left a monolithic bloc, and you can find leftists who idolize the Equality of Opportunity rather than the Equality of Outcome. But that is what idpol leftists should strive for, equality of outcome when it comes to free speech. The chilling effect isn’t just for journalists who are intimidated into silence by brutal regimes who murder their colleagues, but for everyone who lacks a privileged position in society.

       both sides try to silence freedom of speech in different ways. Dems vs Republicans has become a joke to divide and control the population and control choice.

       What don't people understand about this? You can say whatever you want but there is consequences. I can say allahu Akbar in a crowded mall or say fuck off to my boss. But one is going to get me arrested and other fired. The only people who keep complaining about free speech are racists. That's what I've noticed

       That's my point.  Limiting their speech limits the consequences and gives them more power ultimately. Its like a paradox.

       It's pretty brave to go out on a limb and defend free speech. We're in a time where our freedom of speech and press is at risk. Push Time Warner to sell off CNN, talk up fake news on any negative press and threaten oppressing it, etc... Let's protect these rights and shut down the left ftom always talking about feelings! Let's imprison those commie bastards so they can't stop "our" freedoms of hating "them"

       I never said that.  I never called anyone names, you did.  I asked when feelings became more important then freedom.  It is a fair question.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Fake News' only exists because we as a nation are to lazy to look into issues.  We collect bullet points and throw them at people we disagree with.  We have forgot how to have conversations and debates.  All we do now is name call and throw data.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can fix this by beginning to respect one another's freedom of speech.

       Reread your "questions". Why the "left" and why do "they" (left) are your questions. Maybe go back and edit it to "when did feelings become more important than freedom" if that's really your question

       No need to apologize. I often get a good idea and it gets hung up on something I think is trivial. Takes a while of people explaining before I get it. Pride gets in the way as I see a bigger point in my head and don't understand why everyone else is caught on some "small" detail. I think it's how we're wired

       The modern day groups in America who are claiming to be on the left are a strange brew that have enriched themselves through a particular brand of corruption and selling out,  and certain ideologies that are tailored towards identity politics.    They have sold out the workers and unions time and again.
      </p>

       Neocons and neoliberals at this point share fascist values but spout off whatever lies it takes to hold onto power and keep donor money flowing to them.   Its a hollowed out sham.

       What we need to focus on is elected representatives who are not bought off.    Who is buying them off is the fascist corporations.   Your voice doesn't count because you don't own them.
