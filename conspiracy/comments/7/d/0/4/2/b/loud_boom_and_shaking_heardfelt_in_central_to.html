<p>Lots of military guys I know that heard it said it couldn&#39;t have been a sonic boom because if it was, the aircraft had to have been the size of a football field or bigger. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jamesspann/posts/10155907233705842">full Bill Cooke quote is here</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sound was not caused by a Leonid meteor, which is the light produced by a fragile bit of comet hitting the atmosphere at over 150,000 miles per hour. At such speeds, the particle does not last long, burning up completely at altitudes of 60 miles or so. Leonids never penetrate low enough into Earthâ€™s atmosphere to produce sounds audible on the ground.</p>

<p>Each time it happens, it comes out of the blue. It&#39;s loud, everything rattles, and we all jump in shock but there&#39;s no patterns to times (other than always during daylight hours), time between booms, etc.  I&#39;ve been baffled for a while but nobody really seems to care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>20 years or so ago i was camping on a boy scout trip at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville and a loud boom knocked me off my feet one morning when i was out of my tent. Ends up there was an explosion at Wyle labs across the highway. </p>

<p>Heres an article on it: <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/04/29/Feds-probe-rocket-motor-explosion/8103830750400/">https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/04/29/Feds-probe-rocket-motor-explosion/8103830750400/</a></p>

<p>One of the scout leaders who was there and worked on base was completely freaked out and made us break down and leave. When asked about it later he just said &quot;It could have been sooo much worse&quot;. We never went on base again.</p>

<p>Moral is between redstone, marshall, and anniston there are all kinds of odd things that go on in that part of the country. </p>

<p>This is what a fracking operation looks like on Google Earth. Look in Northwest Alabama around Limestone County and you will see these out from the cities. Each pad has a hole drilled into the Earth and a pipe in the ground and they inject spent cutting waters at high pressures into the Earth and the pressure pushes the Natural Gas out of the ground. </p>

<p>Two fault zones are found in Alabama, the Southern Appalachian Seismic Zone (also known as the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone) in northeast and central Alabama, and the Bahamas Fracture Seismic Zone in southwest Alabama. Alabama also lies within the influence of the New Madrid Seismic Zone and the South Carolina Seismic Zone, earthquakes in those zones have resulted in damage in Alabama. The northeast corner of the state is subject to the greatest peak accelerations due to the presence of the East Tennessee Seismic Zone. </p>

<p>So when the water creates pressure on the fault, it gives and we have an earthquake. It is usually covered up by saying it was a plane or something else because Fracking is highly controversial. </p>
