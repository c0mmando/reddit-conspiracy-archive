       Seriously though do. I for one think the original Q may in fact be legit, and I suspect that this user is posting on 4chan, copying screenshots, and then posting them for his own bewildering agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this post breaks any rules, so be it. But I mean really, go through his posts, and then look at the recent "Q" updates he posted. People should be aware of this.

       What are you getting at? Shall we go through your post history? I know Light bringer by name. I don't know you. Lots of accusations flying in this sub. I'll stick up for him or her before you. May not seem like much but, I've been here for years under many names and I know much.

       But why? You're implying that there's something you have seen that you think others will also see or might see. People are just asking you what you're seeing. Why won't you answer that? The fact you're not answering that question makes it seem like you have no solid basis for this question about LBF and are just trying to sow doubt about him or her without any foundation - it's like you've come here and just gone - this person is fishy! not to be trusted! See for yourself! Without explaining why you think that. You know that plenty of people will see that and will not have the time to go through their posts and compare them or whatever, and you know that it will sow doubt in many people the next time they see a post from LBF, even if it is totally unjustified.
      </p>
      <p>
       So justify yourself. That's all that is being asked.

       Lol half this threads comments are him copy/pasting that response. Strange how he won't elaborate. He's 100x more suspicious than LBF's posts, which are generally well researched/thought out.

       I have compared both posts. OP is right. They are comparable. Very interesting how they are indeed both posts. Cause if they weren't posted you couldn't begin to see the comparisons. Now I'm convinced.

       Like I said, I think the first "Q" posts are legit, but that people have since hijacked the moniker, and that LightBringerFlex fakes Q posts for his own agenda.

       LightBringerFlex has been here a while, to be fair.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't only push the Q stuff. He just follows the "LARPs" closely. I only know his username so well because I tend to keep an eye on the same type of conspiracy content that he would, and he's just usually a nice way for me to be lazy. I'll just check his page as he'll generally just post everything that I would check anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Q is a fake, which I'm leaning towards, then I would look towards 'KibBitzLaw' on Twitter, or 'VOTL' as he's known. He's one of the best I have ever seen at "LARPing" and the Q post remind me of him a lot.

       I'm sure that he might believe what he says is true, but plenty of links he's posted in the past go into bizarre and unprovable territory. Don't get me wrong, I believe some pretty far out things myself: aliens, alternate dimensions, alternate history, ect ect, but I can back up most of those with fairly well fleshed out discussion. I don't go around saying "A mothership is in orbit around earth that will save us all".

       In his Farage/Soros thread (where he alleges the Paradise Papers were Soros' response to Trump 'smashing the cabal,' even though Soros is named in them), when asked for any evidence he comes back with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was some insider who said the Paradise Papers were revenge against the white hats like trump eta al. Honestly, I can’t remember the part of Soros clearly. This message was made about a week or so ago and my memory is foggy. I know for sure they said the Panama Papers was revenge against the white hats and I think he said Soros funded it but not sure.

       Like, he can't remember clearly even though he made an entire post positing this bananas theory. I dunno what his deal is.
