Why won&#39;t you answer that?

See for yourself! Without explaining why you think that. You know that plenty of people will see that and will not have the time to go through their posts and compare them or whatever, and you know that it will sow doubt in many people the next time they see a post from LBF, even if it is totally unjustified.</p>

<p>So justify yourself. That&#39;s all that is being asked.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t only push the Q stuff. He just follows the &quot;LARPs&quot; closely. I only know his username so well because I tend to keep an eye on the same type of conspiracy content that he would, and he&#39;s just usually a nice way for me to be lazy. I&#39;ll just check his page as he&#39;ll generally just post everything that I would check anyway.</p>

<p>If Q is a fake, which I&#39;m leaning towards, then I would look towards &#39;KibBitzLaw&#39; on Twitter, or &#39;VOTL&#39; as he&#39;s known. He&#39;s one of the best I have ever seen at &quot;LARPing&quot; and the Q post remind me of him a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure that he might believe what he says is true, but plenty of links he&#39;s posted in the past go into bizarre and unprovable territory. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I believe some pretty far out things myself: aliens, alternate dimensions, alternate history, ect ect, but I can back up most of those with fairly well fleshed out discussion. I don&#39;t go around saying &quot;A mothership is in orbit around earth that will save us all&quot;.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In his Farage/Soros thread (where he alleges the Paradise Papers were Soros&#39; response to Trump &#39;smashing the cabal,&#39; even though Soros is named in them), when asked for any evidence he comes back with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was some insider who said the Paradise Papers were revenge against the white hats like trump eta al. Honestly, I can’t remember the part of Soros clearly. This message was made about a week or so ago and my memory is foggy. I know for sure they said the Panama Papers was revenge against the white hats and I think he said Soros funded it but not sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like, he can&#39;t remember clearly even though he made an entire post positing this bananas theory. I dunno what his deal is. </p>
