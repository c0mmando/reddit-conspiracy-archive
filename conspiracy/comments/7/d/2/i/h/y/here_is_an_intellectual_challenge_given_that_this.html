       Hmmm...no points for you.  You didn’t suggest a solution, just a dry attempt at wit.  I’m serious, if the shills are running amok, the best way to differentiate is to check the slant of the poster.  If there is no suggestion, consider it to be someone who is only interested in attention, and not someone who actively engages subjects from the point of betterment.

       Dayum...second response is shill.  No doubt a bot.  So there are bots setup to comment their political slants.  Anyone know what toolkit’s could be used to do this?  My suggestion stands, if no solution is offered, the motives become transparent.

       Brilliant!  If it’s a systemic problem, and apparently the staff isn’t going to fix it.  So, should we switch to another platform?  During the great rebellion, many left and setup shop at Voat.  Is the shilling happening as much as here on Reddit?

       I think the absolute best and most effective thing you can do, and it's actually easy, is to try to stop perceiving and labelling every comment that conflicts with your personal beliefs or biases as a shill. I think you'll find that this will immediately cut the shill-population down byba large percentage.

       Since the claim is, that the community is overrun by hostiles, the voting system fails.

       And the community will never agree on a strict rulership by a dictator - no matter how benevolant.

       I have no solution, so in your proposal I wouldn't be allowed to post this comment...?

       Thanks for the comment.  The point is to address the problems and come up with solutions.  There is no intent towards censorship, just intellectual banter.  To be frank, there are solutions...and this is one thread of many to humanize a situation that seems impossible to solve.  It is true, that your comment isn’t suggesting anything, just restating the obvious.  Perhaps, it’s better to “reason” through it all.  I think perhaps knowing how to reason, is a lost art in striking up conversations.  Through reasoning, we can and will find solutions.

       How about this for a solution, if the existence of shills truly bothers you, abandon Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Etc. Seek out other smaller message boards/social media that aren't worth shilling or manipulating. No, not Voat, Voat fucked up by being too similar to Reddit, it's already loaded with shills. There are plenty of other communities out there that exist and thrive outside of popular social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wherever you can find millions of peoples eyes, you're also going to find manipulation, not just by TPTB, but by anyone with a bit of cash,

       I treat the shills like I treat the trolls, I ignore them.

       Thanks for the suggestion, but this is an attempt at “socially engineering” a solution by weeding out those who seek to dominate the conversation in a negative way.  It’s not an exercise to run away from a problem, or ignore it.

       Distrust and scepticism is one thing, but being paranoid about everything is going a step too far. It's like the MSM seeing Russia behind literally everything that happens in the world now.

       Thanks, excellent suggestion.  As we all know, the Gold is in the comments.  As a Redditor, I spend a minute or so on the front page, but I don’t see it as a true pulse since it’s been taken over.  I do many sorts, and drill into topics...and get distracted by pics.  Thanks for the reminder.

       A better system would be that you can't vote unless you comment.

       Brilliant!  If it’s a systemic problem, and apparently the staff isn’t going to fix it.  So, should we switch to another platform?  During the great rebellion, many left and setup shop at Voat.  Is the shilling happening as much as here on Reddit?

       Is he for real, or perhaps “scripted?”  I wonder...if it’s conceivable that shill-bots are a thing, couldn’t the same be done to push a scripted message?
