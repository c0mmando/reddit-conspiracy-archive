I realize it is a buzzfeed article which is shit reporting however the events did happen and I haven’t read about it on here. I’m slightly worried about the very real possibility of nuclear war and this just makes that worry worse. Am I just being paranoid or is mass media trying to instill fear of nuclear war to distract from other things or are we all going to die in a nuclear waste land? Thoughts, opinions, comments, words of wisdom are all appreciated. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/verabergengruen/theres-no-legal-way-to-stop-trump-from-launching-nuclear?utm_term=.yp1L3lq2Om#.yp1L3lq2Om">article from buzzfeed I referred above </a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you near a military base? a nuke silo? and air strip?</p>

<p>if not you are not a target for a nuke. nukes are for strategic target, a population center full of eaters is not going to be a target.</p>

<p>think of heavily populated cities as the guy you have to carry when a mine blows his foot off. once the grid/logistics are down populated cities are actually huge liabilities for a government, sources of civil unrest and revolts.</p>

<p>the only people to use nukes against civillian targets are your own government (hiroshima, nagasaki)</p>

<p>there was a map of russian nuclear targets from back during the cold war that was posted here a year or so ago if your really that paranoid about it. <a href="https://crisisboom.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/nuke-targets-48.jpg">found it</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think most of europe is fucked, NA is at least spread out, with the UK  pretty much everyone is near enough a base....</p>

<p>although i dont know if a russia/US trade were to even happen they would bother using nukes vs europe. im pretty sure russia would stomp most of it with conventional weapons, though they might hit leadership /bunkers with a few depending on if europe joined in with the US or stood down.</p>

<p>if we ever get to that point the first indication of it happening to the average person will probably be seeing the flash of one going off.</p>

<p>First, I live in a place that is very unlikely to be targeted directly. </p>

<p>Second, I own more than enough iodine tablets to survive the fallout. (Or at least longer than anyone who doesn&#39;t have them.)</p>

<p>Third, The US is very unlikely to use one of out own. We have newer weapon systems that make nukes look like playthings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what, seriously? Let me understand this. If I have a reasonable likelihood of getting through a planetary annihilation, the end of everything that everyone and every creature hopes for and depends on, as long as I&#39;m OK - then nothing to worry about? I&#39;m kind of shocked. And the last one, you somehow derive comfort from the current and next generations of weapons being worse than what could already spoil the life support system for everything? </p>

<p>I&#39;m writing so you can re-think this, Keith, and open up your perspective...</p>

<p>To think that everything&#39;s not so bad as long as I get through it, that the world doesn&#39;t matter as long as I&#39;m OK, that when I&#39;m gone, nothing else is going to matter anyway, to me that&#39;s the original sin of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The next generation or weapons don&#39;t spread nuclear radiation. I&#39;m not worried about dying in some huge explosion. That will be over quickly and it won&#39;t matter once I&#39;m gone, but what I don&#39;t want is a week of radiation sickness first.</p>

<p>And yeah, I have no problem outliving everyone else. I&#39;m not speaking for everyone, simply myself. An end of the world situation leaving me alone here sounds like a blast. I&#39;m a country boy, I&#39;d do just fine.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>nothing.</p>

<p>okay so why fixate on worrying about it? i mean you could get hit by lightning 30 seconds from now, nothing you can do to prevent it, so i guess the only answer is to cower in your basement for the rest of your life right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. But that&#39;s mostly because I&#39;m living in a very secure location as far as nuclear war is concerned. There are no nearby targets and very low chance of fallout.</p>

<p>As for war itself. what kind of war are you talking about?</p>

<p>A few nukes lobbed at each other by India and Pakistan? For people outside of that region, life would go on without much change.</p>

<p>A 3 way launch fest between Russia, China and the US? Mexico might not be too bad off depending on which way the wind blows. Otherwise, North America goes back to the 1800&#39;s. Same thing for Russia and China and whoever else gets caught up in the madness.</p>

<p>The thing that makes me think it&#39;s possible are all those huge underground survival installations that &quot;our leaders&quot; have built for themselves. Fighting any war is a lot easier to think about if you know you&#39;re going to ride things out in comfort no matter what happens to everyone else.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if things are really run by wealthy elites...</p>

<p>They like their women, fancy cars and tropical playgrounds. They like their expensive restaurants and all kinds of drugs. </p>

<p>Destroy the world with a full scale nuclear war and all that good shit goes away.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m 50/50 about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once came up with a theory that&#39;s close to what you said. </p>

<p>Basically, the idea goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Develop the technology needed for a &quot;futuristic paradise&quot;. </p></li>
<li><p>Keep it stored away instead of trying to integrate it step by step.</p></li>
<li><p>Build facilities where your group can live separately from the rest of society for 10 or 20 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Now wipe the board clean via full scale nuclear war with whichever enemy. Make sure all your history books claim that &quot;they started it&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now you&#39;ve got the whole country to yourself. Maybe 20 or 30 million survivors in a land that could easily fit 10 times as many people. You get your robot workers to build brand new cities with brand new infrastructure and brand new everything else. It&#39;s powered by that reliable fusion energy that you&#39;ve been hiding away for the last 40 years.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve still got maybe half your nukes left. You&#39;ve got a half century of rebuilding, so the economy is going to grow quickly for decades. No more poor people. No more senior citizens. No more complainers or disabled people. </p>

<p>Most of the survivors are wealthy or from the leadership class. So the New United States of America equals a nuclear armed Switzerland with the same land area as Europe. Military power is unchanged because next gen weapons technology/robotics makes up for reduced number of people in uniform. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, i think most of us arrive at this conclusion once you are able to mentally put yourself in that position of total power and think well what would i do if i thought of the average person as a mouth breathing idiot (its a real stretch...) </p>

<p>things like the georgia guide stones being built by rich anons, doesnt help...</p>

<p>if we went down that sort of road, there would probably be less than a million of us left at the end of it, and most of the world would be left empty and we would end up with something like the capital from hunger games after a few generations.</p>

I read news on the internet or in a newspaper and I take it all with a grain of salt. However nuclear war is a particularly frightening scenario that I know many powers have the ability to unleash. Right now several of the leaders aren’t particularly stable people, so I don’t think my fear is unjustified. As I stated previously I sometimes get a little more worried than your average joe because I have severe anxiety and refuse to be doped up on Xanax 24/7 like most people I know with anxiety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prepare for the worst but hope for the best. I have a &quot;set and forget&quot; philosophy as far as prepping goes. Most people in this thread seem to think that if the bombs drop they&#39;re instantly goners. The truth is that if the bombs drop, they will likely survive unless in a large city or military or infrastructure target (of which there are plenty). </p>

<p>So what then? If the bombs are air bursts, there is no fallout, but if ground detonated, there could be radioactive fallout for a hundred miles. In that case, bug in, not out, and cover yourself with mass in the basement or middle floor if in a tall building, and hunker down for at least 3 days. You can prepare for this by building a makeshift fallout shelter in your basement under a thick table which you can pile things on, and build walls around. It won&#39;t stop all the gamma rays, but it will stop some, and will only be better protection as the hours pass. Your neighbors who all go outside to see what shattered their windows will be the walking dead when the fallout drops. </p>

<p>Anyway I think nukes may be a hoax, psychological warfare and to keep the populous terrified, and also believing the powers that be can wipe life off earth with a button press. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well IF its coming, frankly there is fuck all you can do about it unless you can afford to buy/build a bunker under a mountain and stock it with food/water for 25 years.</p>

<p>so, why bother worrying about it.</p>

<p>now i dont me throw your hands up and accept that, that is inevitable reality, were all just dust blah blah blah. but if this is keeping you up at night its like being worried about death being just around the corner.</p>

<p>IF that scenario plays out your survival is 95% luck and 5% adaptability. </p>

<p>now on to the trump is scary booooooo, this is just more stupidity and diversion. if trump is as self centered as they claim is he going to end the world? think of how much effort he has put into building all those gaudy towers with his name on them, is he really going to destroy those? he owns property in china and russia, is he going to shoot nukes at his own stuff if this self-centered narrative is true?</p>

<p>the guy has what 5 kids? is he going to turn the world in to ash after spending so much time worried about his legacy?</p>

<p>this sort of shit is what drives me fucking nuts, the narrative has to keep two completely opposed views of trump at all times, hes this cold calculating psychopath who wants to kill the gays and destroy murica&#39; and a bumbling impulsive moron whos just going to lose it after a twitter exchange and nuke china.</p>

<p>take a breath, engage your brain and realize this is all just bullshit to sell papers/views and the fear mongering they keep pushing is all in service of that.</p>
