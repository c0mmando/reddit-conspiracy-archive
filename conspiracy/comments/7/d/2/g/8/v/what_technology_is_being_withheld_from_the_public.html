       As many have said solar panels have made the free energy argument moot. Solar panels ARE free energy. You dont need h h o or zero point or anything else anymore. You dont need tesla transmitting tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       You simple receive direct free energy straight from the sun which exists everywhere on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if there was some other type like zero point its unlikely the device would be cheaper than 5 solar panels on your roof.

       Solar technology isn't free. There's a high cost of entry that keeps most people from bothering to invest in it. And there will always be a high cost due to the material requirements to manufacture.

       You mean "Real Dolls"? Those aren't quite what I'd call "sex bots", they just lay idle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm mid 30's, and honestly the only peice of tech I actually pray for are bona-fide sex bots. Think westworld style, where they're indistinguishable from actual humans. I subscribe to primal sense of being. That I am a man animal, driven by primal urges and hormone, and that any heady sentient thoughts are really just a bored brain making shit up. I'm an animal and my purpose on this planet is to fuck, nothing more. In civilized society, fucking like an animal just doesn't have a place. For this, sex robots can fill this void. I pray to see it before my body is no longer able to fuck, and will spend every last dollar I can muster to purchase one. Please science, please.

       My friend, you misunderstand. I'm not a basement dwelling idiot who wishes all women were sex puppets. I understand I need to socialize, and I do with success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, lots of women are into primal, rough animalistic sex, but very few are into it all the time. The comment I replied to was talking about sex bots, and no woman is going to compare to a lifelike sex bot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if a woman enjoys animalistic sex, no woman wants that all the time, and no woman is beheld to a man's desires 24/7. Women are people who aren't objects to be taken all the time. Sex bots however, are available 24/7. If you know of a woman who you can ignore all the time and only visit with for primal sex, having her be enthusiastic while she does anal, eats your ass, and swallows your cum multiple times per day then you've found a golden goose.

       I am beginning to beleive more and more they are witholding time travel or viewing. I think they do it by forming zones of radiant energy which instead of creating magnetic distortions like electricity in a wire it creates a distortion we see as a distortion in time space which can both be used to travel in time to a place or to a new place in this or another time like a teleport.

       I think its likely thereare large high speed tunnels under the usa.  They had a nuclear poweredtunneling machine in the 60's. Tunnels were neededfor rapid transit and defense. It would be surprising if they DIDNT  create a network.

      <p>
       Phil Schneider (google this guy and watch his testimonials) said that they have a machine that  liquefies the rock and leaves the tunnel rocks smooth as gel while disintegrating the rock that needs to be ''shoveled away''. He said that with one machine you can make a 1000 miles tunnel in months !

       Cancer cure. Which is somewhat understandable if you’re as inept as the cabal are as it heralds the start of indefinite life extension. Then we’d have a population skewed even more into geriatrics without the vitality to contribute. So it’s gotta start under wraps .. for now at least.

       We learned about stealth helicopters when one crashed during the UBL raid. If that hadn't happened, we still wouldn't know they exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are rumors that the raid also involved eye drops that allowed them to see in the dark without nods. Rob O'Neall has hinted that this is true in the past

       Other than that, more weapons than you would imagine.

       DPRK hasn't tested a nuke since their earthquake. When they started clearing out the mess to resume working, they lost their scientists in a second earthquake. Both of those were timed extremely well to have been natural. It's been suggested that the Rods from the Gods program was a success. That means space weapons.

       That's literally the broken off tail. The walls around the compound, which it's up against in that picture, we're between 12 and 18 feet high. That should give you an idea of the size. But once again that's just the tail. The rest of the helicopter isn't pictured because they blew it up. The tail failed to be destroyed in the explosion and that's why pictures of it exist.

       We all want to know that. There are resources online showing evidence of this but to what extent and in what branches of technology, nobody can surely know. Even for those building it...it's called compartmentalized knowledge...a real fuckery

       So if we are to believe many whistleblowers who have come out over the decades, a select-secret group got access to space during mid-20th century. They've been colonizing, developing and trading that tech with many other civilisations ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the tech 'out in the desert' might be 50 years ahead, but the tech we have on Mars, on Luna and other bases around in the solar system is probably at least 500 years ahead.

       Well. The travel to get to space is intense takes a lot of energy.  The world isn't perfect by any means there are always factors that you cant account for and doing a mission like this would have a small success rate.  If you started running today you wouldn't run a marathon tomorrow. Humans don't do well away from earth. Gravity is weird. We haven't even figured out turbulence.... We are advanced but we aren't as advanced as what you guys want to believe.

       Well your argument springs forth from our current understanding of physics and reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if a different approach was figured out with crashed vehicles and then improved upon, leading to formal relations and technology discovery and trade with ET civilizations? What if?
