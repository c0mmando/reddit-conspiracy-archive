       It's funny they spend so much time talking about it, trying to convince people to not talk about it. It's like a large group of police standing around blocking your view saying nothing to see here. You know damn well there's something to see there, otherwise why are they standing around

       The concept itself is news, since so many people believe it. Someone even went to the pizza place with a gun and fired shots. It's worth reporting on, even if they don't believe the evidence.

       right.  it's news that people are talking about.  yet NPR goes further to "discredit".

      <p>
       the only reason they don't believe the evidence is because they have no investigated -- at best.

       Right thanks for clearing that up, OK folks move along genius over here has it sussed nothing to see go back to your TVs and buzzfeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality however all of this circumstantial evidence indicates the likelihood of something untoward going on to be. Pretty. Highly. Fucking. Likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       But thanks for your derail and dismiss attempts. Good work.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" is a good rule of thumb around these parts but in this case there appears to be positively overwhelming evidence which when overlaid with older patterns in the mil./indust/corp./political/monarchical world the matches are beyond doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you'd know all about the ins and outs of all the other elite pedo scandals am I right?

       Typical pizzagate tactic: if my account isn't thhe age you think it should be, or if I don't post about the range of topics you think I should post about, I'm suspect. That's all pizzagate is: throwing accusations and innuendo around without anything resembling evidence, to turn people against each other.

       (aka #pedogate) is the new 9/11 rabbit hole -- i.e., yes, it's all (mostly) true -- and yes, difficult to swallow.  But yes...  it's very real -- i.e., there are real children who are being trafficked, raped and murdered right now through these channels. (really... right now.)

       no, it's not a smoking gun.  alone, i would brush it off as ... just... weird.

       He's not wrong about that though, but there's still circumstantial stuff worth investigating. Just calling it "debunked" means nothing unless there's proof it was ever investigated, which it almost surely was not.

       I'm not even saying it's debunked. But there's no victims so far and only emails and some weird gays.

       Just thinking about an investigation IMO they got nothing. Masking tape a kid's hands to a table and associating it to bondage is really sick.

       There's never been a real investigation of the emails, not a public one at least. Don't expect real details besides the paid shooter actor plot point and homophobia accusations.

       The initial hubbub with pizzagate was at least 50% about the Podesta emails as well. Funny how he doesn't come up in these discussions and how there was this sort of unexplained overfocusing on Comet. Before long, people who hadn't heard any details were being led to believe that everyone researching pizzagate literally thought that Alefantis was raping kids under his pizza place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of us who caught that story at the beginning can see how it was spun to make us all look like idiots with 100% confidence in a very specific and impossible to prove narrative. Plenty of the circumstantial evidence (especially with the Podestas) was at the very least super creepy, if not suggestive of something sinister. It pointed to something 'off', but not all of us were ready to call it an open and shut case.
      </p>
      <p>
       But guess what? You can't even look into this shit with a healthy measure of objectivity and an open mind without being called a Trump-blowing, naive, idiotic head case with no critical thinking skills. I got so sick of being chastised for not automatically following the media narrative on the matter that I let myself drift off of the topic altogether for several months.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the hell is happening to society these days? When did we start chastising anyone who didn't instantly agree with every single story as presented by the popular media?

       NPR has really shifted and is just blatant propaganda at this point.  I still like to listen at work but their slant on new issue is quite extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a few weeks ago they featured a story on H1-B visas and how they brought about economic growth and cultural diviersity to a small town.  Nothing wrong with this angle except at no point did they cover how H1-B visas are being used to control IT wages and outsource low level IT jobs.  No mentions of how entire businesses are setup to exploit a loopholes in the program to essentially create a captive, easily controlled work force that revolves every 3 years.

       Nice summary on the true purpose of h1-bs use in IT. They use them in nursing to break unions and suppress wages as well, as well as having a captive, overworked group of laborers whose mistakes due to overwork can ultimately lead to death.

       Best I can suggest is to keep an open mind and check multiple sources.
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       is pretty far left,  voat.co is pretty far right.. rt.com is pretty pro Russian .. etc,  just keep in mind each source likely has a slant.

       I'm not saying it was satanic, or what have you, but she was definitely manipulated by her friend, whose father was a cult leader and who was herself part of a cabal whose name translates to "The 8 Heavenly Fairies". There are articles about this from a variety of reputable sources. The president was this woman's puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't personally think this scandal in particular has anything to do with trafficking or occult rituals, but I do think it points to the feasibility of non-elected, non-appointed groups running the U.S. from behind the scenes (AKA the Shadow Government).

       Well, you're entitled to your own opinion on the matter. I do think the fact that a country as modern as South Korea can have a scandal like this makes it more likely for other affluent nations to have similar shadiness going on, but it's not like I'm totally sure that it's going on.

       Pizzagate is totalitarian propaganda meant to normalize the idea that people can be accused of serious crimes based on their word choice, the art they like, their friends, or the fact that they defend others who are wrongfully accused -- anything other than evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagaters don't care about actual victims of abuse. They go to great lengths to avoid identifying victims. Their only goal is to accuse; they know that attempts to identify actual victims would fail, so they discourage attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't trust the pizzagate-pushers. They have an agenda, and it has nothing to do wih helping kids.

       I listened to it, I wish it was a little longer and they deep dove into it a little more, but I thought it was decent for what it was. I get a lot of people on here are very defensive about this being true, and yes, there is definitely child sex trafficking that happens around the world, in this country, that is under reported. They did a good job on the podcast of dispelling the most salacious and untrustworthy actors in spreading the ping pong comet theory, the Alex Jones, Hagmann, that fucking clown opportunist Jack Posobiec, etc.. I think people like the mentioned definitely take advantage of people’s good intentions, and weaponize clear fabrications of truth to politicize it and push critical thinkers over the edge.

       They ran something like that a month or two ago.  A lot of the time they dig deeper than other networks. But everything I've heard them report on pizzagate has been very half-assed.

       The problem is that even if it is false, we cannot confirm or deny that. There are pedophile sex rings and it isn't a stretch of the imagination that this is happening, but to state it as completely false is disengenuous. It maybe absurd, bizarre and a stretch of the imagination but it is clearly bias to say it's completely false.

       Pizzagate
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       completely false. It's based entirely on a list of codewords made up by a LARPer on Reddit. The typical Pizzagate argument is pure innuendo: "can you explain what this (innocuous, out of context) email means? Can you defend this (completely unrelated to pedophilia) artwork?" None of it comes within a mile of even indirect evidence of a pedophile ring. You may as well say we can't confirm or deny that Donald Trump was born a woman.
