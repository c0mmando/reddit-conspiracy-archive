        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">59</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-18 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TheMadBonger.html">TheMadBonger</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As far as public releases have gone, the Clinton Foundation should still be under investigation by the FBI. Weiner might have flipped on people and that&#39;s why the shilling has intensified, things are moving. So far it&#39;s looking like Uranium One is linked to the Clinton Foundation too. </p>

<p>FBIAnon, the only legit one always said &quot;Focus on the Clinton Foundation and the e-mails.&quot; Uranium One might be the way they crack the case though, <a href="https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/17/secret-witness-in-senate-clinton-probe-is-ex-lobbyist-for-russian-firm/23281339/">this secret witness looks promising.</a> He worked for Rosatom. If this William Campbell guy ends up dead. Sound the happening alarms because that&#39;s all the proof you need they are taking down The Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>FBIAnon also said &quot;1) Yes, an open investigation by the IRS/Treasury Dept/FBI is open on the CF.&quot; This could explain recent &quot;controversial&quot; IRS and Treasury appointments. They needed an expert on avoiding taxes to catch them maybe?</p>

<p>&quot;The Senate committee searching for Clinton&#39;s alleged wrongdoing is keeping their witness&#39;s name cloaked. However, William D. Campbell, a lobbyist, confirmed to Reuters he is the informant who will testify and provide documents to Congress about the Obama Administrationâ€™s 2010 approval of the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian company with uranium mines in the United States, to Russia&#39;s Rosatom.&quot;</p>

<p>Prime example of where to focus in regards to the e-mails is George Webb showing the Rat Line drug, organ, and weapon smuggling. The spying, the stealing data, how her private e-mail server gets &quot;hacked&quot; by multiple state actors when there just so happens to be SCI and SAP level information on it? </p>

<p>Can you imagine what would happen if the USA citizens were educated enough to understand the seriousness of the Obama administration toppling 7 countries, and the war crimes these people committed? That&#39;s why they&#39;re letting the pedophile stuff go. They&#39;ve decided to sacrifice the perverts to keep the operation running. I think there are backups of Webb&#39;s videos but they are not on his channel.</p>

<p>I believe all the major amounts of sealed indictments could be better explained and examined under the lens of the Clinton Foundation investigation and an all encompassing pay for play, influence trading, money laundering, and blackmail operation. </p>

<p>They have been completely silent on this investigation. I bet they like it not being in the spot light. I mean, all the human trafficking side of Pizzagate came into the picture <em>because</em> The Clinton Foundation had shady dealings in Haiti, Laura Silsby was a big part of it too, and Monica Peterson since she was investigating human trafficking in Haiti and was found dead. Let&#39;s not forget Dyncorp either folks. Afghanistan, boy dancing, foreign human trafficking is big business. Organ harvesting too. Where Hillary goes it&#39;s like the shit just happens in that country. Kosovo is a good example of early Hillary evil.</p>

<p>George Webb Elaborates on this in good detail. Eric Braverman was where he started his investigation, so starting at his first video on youtube puts you right where you can learn all about this, Libya, Clinton Foundation and shit she did while Secretary of State. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCTzFNrsKns&amp;amp;list=PLcgk8FfGnzkxDSYW-3gqzNBVxJVE2a9Hh">Video starting with George Webb Day 53.</a> But honestly, for the Libya and ratlines stuff it&#39;s a good starting point as his format is weird but it explains it in detail. So later on when he says &quot;So and so, took out so and so because money&quot; You know the whole thought process and conclusions made behind it and it&#39;s not some baseless claim hanging without sourcing and backing.</p>

<p><a href="http://people.com/crime/why-anthony-weiner-walked-free-hours-after-being-sentenced-to-federal-prison/">Weiner was crying as he was sentenced to two years.</a> Didn&#39;t have to start his time until Nov 6. It&#39;s been almost two weeks of being locked up. I&#39;m sure some upstanding model inmates have introduced him to the prison system, and how well they treat pedophiles. He&#39;s talking I bet, and he wants out of jail. He may have already talked and that&#39;s why he could defer his jailtime until November 6th, 2017. </p>

<p>The impeachment tv ad from a billionaire screams of desperation to get the public to somehow rally and hate Trump. Online astroturfing has been off the charts. I feel like the cabal are in defense mode right now, waiting to damage control something big. Perhaps they are being fucked with. Could be people sending Wikileaks primo damning intelligence, bluffing to leak huge politically damaging things. Investigations might be coming to a head as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are the original 7 AMA threads he did. Pretty much anything after that is BS. Usually it is the OP, original poster. You can see the colored code that identifies all his answers. If you go to the 4pleb original archives instead of archive,is you can click on it and it will highlight all the posts by user id. Some of them he jumps into a investigation threads and answers questions, like in #3 (TurkBro)</p>
