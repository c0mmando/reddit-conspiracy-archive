       So Rolling Stone just did a piece on Pizzagate where they labeled it as the example of fake news. I read through the story, and it didn't address any of the issues that I feel are the real issues regarding the story. So here are the issues that I would love answered if any news organization out there feels the need to debunk the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigate and tell me what those strange Podesta emails were about. Your article doesn't mention "handkerchief." Let me know what they were talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigate and tell me what is up with the satanic bands performing at Comet. Your article doesn't mention them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigate and tell me what goes on at Pegasus Museum. Again, not mentioned in the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I would like to know how a pizza shop owner can be one of the fifty most powerful men in Washington. Was it a joke? What is the story behind that? Why does a pizza shop owner get invited to the White House?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, nothing is mentioned about the money spent for pizza and hot dogs by Obama. Just investigate that and let me know what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made this list off of the top of my head on what things seem off to me in regard to pizzagate. Sadly, Rolling Stone didn't investigate a single one of the strange things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll gladly believe it is a fake news story if there are good answers to the questions.

       Rolling Stone is of course going to call it fake news, and of course they aren’t going to focus on the more plausible and probable elements of the situation. The same reason all MSM does with  this stuff. They’re most likely complicit in the behavior.

       Catering is expensive, and rich/powerful people do opulent things, like cater a party with chicago style hotdogs flown in from chicago- which would probably cost 50-75k. People who are familiar with the catering of rich-person events/galas and such, do not find this suspicious.

       Might seem strange, I'll admit that. But "strange" isn't evidence of a crime. In fact, literally none of these things are evidence of a crime. At all.

       What do you think of Alefantis Instagram and Podesta art? Yes, all of these things can be explained away individually, but when you put them altogether, ESPECIALLY with the behavior / attitudes / art collecting habits of Tony and James “I love children” Alefantis, it absolutely deserves a PROPER investigation.

       doesn't seem all that nefarious to me. but then again, i actually spend a lot of time in the artist community, so when i see "weird" art, it doesn't freak me out, i just think, "ah yeah, some weird hipster art"
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean, when people had never heard rock and roll music, a bunch of people thought it was literally demonic. and that was in the 50s/60s, with bop rock and the monkeys etc., nothing too scandalous at all. It's all relative, you know. Just something to think about.

       No, sorry, it’s not all relative. If you can look at paintings of children in handcuffs and think that’s the same as The Beatles singing about holding hands, you’ve been really desensitized.

       if you can't look at strange art of children without assuming it's about raping and killing and sacrificing them, you should probably talk to a therapist.
      </p>
      <p>
       most normal people don't sexualize everything to do with children. it's kind of bizarre that most pizzagaters see literally anything to do with kids and think it's something sexual.
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean, you see a painting of kids with handcuffs on and your mind immediately goes to sex? that's actually super fucked up dude. my first reaction was, "so this artist is trying to make a statement about arrested innocence or something, in modern society?"

       literally
       <em>

       it was downvoted.

       if you don't think that's hihgly suspicious, you probably shouldn't be on this board.

       what you erroneously described as "a room full of stuffed animals" is, actually, a photo that shows exactly THREE stuffed animals on a shelf in his bedroom. here

       to be honest, i believe every single adult female that i know has more than one stuffed animal. that includes the childless ones.

       I get out plenty. In fact, I’m friends with some of the women that Harvey Weinstein raped. I also know billionaires who’ve seen underground sex dungeons with underage sex slaves. SO PARDON ME for thinking the elite are engaged in some disgusting behavior, especially if they have horrifying artwork like Podesta.

       well after a contentious exchange, i'd like to finish off with this;
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm a rational skeptic, which means i require good evidence to believe extraordinary claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       i remain open to new evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       if there is every
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       evidence of an
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       crime, i will revisit all the circumstantial evidence with fresh eyes. or if any victims are ever discovered or come forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       until then, to my rational mind, this is all just "spooky and weird" art combined with partisan propaganda.

       Right, and i respect that. Skepticism is very healthy. I’ve just been personally exposed to this stuff in Hollywood for over a decade and witnessed some insane shit, so I think that makes me perhaps less in need of solid evidence, for better or worse. But you are correct that our system is innocent until proven guilty. I’m still inclined to believe the Podestas are engaged in some dark practices, but respect your stance. Sorry if I came across overly defensive, this topic can make me see red.

       understandable. most sane people get pretty emotional about child abuse, and i don't really blame them. it's horrific and disgusting to think about the things some people do to children.
      </p>

       i have no sympathy's at all for people who abuse children. i just try to stay away from witch hunts, you know?

       Podesta’s emails tell their own story. He is a creepy ass dude.  These elites are just so disgusting. HRC thinks she is invincible. Sounds like she is getting worried though. No one wants to go there publicly bc 80% of our government would be involved. It needs to stop so the children will stop having to live these horrible lives.

       The NYT and WaPo articles on it did the same thing. The headlines all had 'Fake News' and all claimed it to be debunked but they never say how it's debunked and ignored all the damning evidence. Podesta and Alefantis have given interviews but they've never been asked to explain the pedo codes in the emails, pedo pics on instagram or any of it.

       How about all the pictures on Alefantis and CPP's Instagram feed? How about the interview he gave where he admitted they stored stuff in the basement (that allegedly doesn't exist).
