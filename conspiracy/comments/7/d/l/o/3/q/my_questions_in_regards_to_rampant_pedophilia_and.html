        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So Rolling Stone just did a piece on Pizzagate where they labeled it as the example of fake news. I read through the story, and it didn&#39;t address any of the issues that I feel are the real issues regarding the story. So here are the issues that I would love answered if any news organization out there feels the need to debunk the story.</p>

<p>Investigate and tell me what those strange Podesta emails were about. Your article doesn&#39;t mention &quot;handkerchief.&quot; Let me know what they were talking about.</p>

<p>Investigate and tell me what is up with the satanic bands performing at Comet. Your article doesn&#39;t mention them.</p>

<p>Investigate and tell me what goes on at Pegasus Museum. Again, not mentioned in the article.</p>

<p>Also, I would like to know how a pizza shop owner can be one of the fifty most powerful men in Washington. Was it a joke? What is the story behind that? Why does a pizza shop owner get invited to the White House?</p>

<p>Also, nothing is mentioned about the money spent for pizza and hot dogs by Obama. Just investigate that and let me know what is going on.</p>

<p>I made this list off of the top of my head on what things seem off to me in regard to pizzagate. Sadly, Rolling Stone didn&#39;t investigate a single one of the strange things.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll gladly believe it is a fake news story if there are good answers to the questions.</p>

<p>anything? some crazy explanation is no more preposterous than thinking that he had a satanic pedo cult map on a square of cloth that he left at a restaurant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>satanic bands performing at Comet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you really need to learn the difference between edgy hipsters and satanists</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like to know how a pizza shop owner can be one of the fifty most powerful men in Washington. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was he, though? Or did a journalist just write a fluff piece about washington socialites and call it &quot;the influential people of washington&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nothing is mentioned about the money spent for pizza and hot dogs by Obama</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Catering is expensive, and rich/powerful people do opulent things, like cater a party with chicago style hotdogs flown in from chicago- which would probably cost 50-75k. People who are familiar with the catering of rich-person events/galas and such, do not find this suspicious. </p>

<p>If anything, it&#39;s just an example of stupid and wasteful government spending.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pegasus Museum</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Might seem strange, I&#39;ll admit that. But &quot;strange&quot; isn&#39;t evidence of a crime. In fact, literally none of these things are evidence of a crime. At all.</p>

<p>doesn&#39;t seem all that nefarious to me. but then again, i actually spend a lot of time in the artist community, so when i see &quot;weird&quot; art, it doesn&#39;t freak me out, i just think, &quot;ah yeah, some weird hipster art&quot;</p>

<p>i mean, when people had never heard rock and roll music, a bunch of people thought it was literally demonic. and that was in the 50s/60s, with bop rock and the monkeys etc., nothing too scandalous at all. It&#39;s all relative, you know. Just something to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you can&#39;t look at strange art of children without assuming it&#39;s about raping and killing and sacrificing them, you should probably talk to a therapist.</p>

<p>most normal people don&#39;t sexualize everything to do with children. it&#39;s kind of bizarre that most pizzagaters see literally anything to do with kids and think it&#39;s something sexual. </p>

<p>i mean, you see a painting of kids with handcuffs on and your mind immediately goes to sex? that&#39;s actually super fucked up dude. my first reaction was, &quot;so this artist is trying to make a statement about arrested innocence or something, in modern society?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>unrealted to the topic at hand, but... i believe i&#39;m being targeted by downvote bots. </p>

<p>i hit &quot;submit&quot; on this comment, which simultaneously submits and refreshes the page. when it reloaded, my comment had ALREADY BEEN DOWNVOTED.</p>

<p>literally <em>less than a second after being posted</em> it was downvoted.</p>

<p>what you erroneously described as &quot;a room full of stuffed animals&quot; is, actually, a photo that shows exactly THREE stuffed animals on a shelf in his bedroom. here <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/stuffed-animals.png">http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/stuffed-animals.png</a></p>

<p>i&#39;m a rational skeptic, which means i require good evidence to believe extraordinary claims.</p>

<p>i remain open to new evidence.</p>

<p>if there is every <em>actual</em> evidence of an <em>actual</em> crime, i will revisit all the circumstantial evidence with fresh eyes. or if any victims are ever discovered or come forward.</p>

I’ve just been personally exposed to this stuff in Hollywood for over a decade and witnessed some insane shit, so I think that makes me perhaps less in need of solid evidence, for better or worse.

<p>understandable. most sane people get pretty emotional about child abuse, and i don&#39;t really blame them. it&#39;s horrific and disgusting to think about the things some people do to children.</p>

<p>i have no sympathy&#39;s at all for people who abuse children. i just try to stay away from witch hunts, you know?</p>
