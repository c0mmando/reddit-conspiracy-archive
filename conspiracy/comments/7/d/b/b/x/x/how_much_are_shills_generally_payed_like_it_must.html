    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a thought. Instead of being paid shills.. what if a significant percentage of the population were just ignorant/biased and want to push a narrative that supports their cause. People think that just because someone has an opposing view they are a shill but in reality there is a wide spectrum of opinions out there and many of them will always conflict with your own.</p>

<p>CTR, shareblue, the Soros groups - no one on reddit or 4chan etc has ever shared any info about what they’ve learnt on the inside.</p>

<p>For groups that are apparently so influential, it’s odd that they are so inscrutable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been a few leaks I guess you would call them. Where someone will make a post about being a paid internet scumbag, you should be able to find them. They go into some detail on how they landed the job what it paid etc. There was at least one that was convincing. I think he even had a pic of a pay stub but I might be wrong about that part. </p>

<p>Other than jidf I get the feeling these people don&#39;t really know what they are getting involved with at first. Same goes for Eglin/jtrig, I sometimes wonder if being a shill for the government is harder on these guys than being a drone operator. Imagine having to convince yourself that deceiving the people you took an oath to protect is the right thing to do.</p>
