        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We all grew up in believing we have democracy, that kings and queens and people like the pope were things of the past, one man, one vote, but the sad reality is, today, they COULD BE STILL the true rulers. How did we get so majorly hoodwinked???</p>

<p>Our modern history of our western civilization is pathetic, to the point, we are questioning as adults if the facts we learnt in school are really facts, and not just BS TPOB propganda. The real tragedy is not whether you or I believe conspiracies are true, we are not the stakeholders that can turn the tide, but the BILLIONS that are still asleep and still hold onto these &quot;pushed&quot; values that they were taught from these so called schools.</p>

<p>Pink Floyd sang it well, school is an outdated institution: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U</a></p>

<p>Together with all media controlled by only 6 major companies, well &quot;ideologically subverted&quot; is the right word.</p>

<p>Here is what we are up against. News today from Limbraugh: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/77-of-College-Educated-Democr">http://tinyurl.com/77-of-College-Educated-Democr</a></p>

<p>The say conspiracy theorists are dumb BUT I just pointed out in the last few videos our IQ&#39;s are way higher by a factor of 1000. Yeah, I know, some of you are going to defend this by saying I have a left/right bias. Nope. This is about common sense and in all cases, as much as I can, using logic.</p>

<p><strong>Point being: Keep fighting, have hope but we still have a long way to go before we are truly free, IF EVER. We&#39;re awake but the braindead, who have the power of the vote, are strong still. That means they will drag you down back to bed. Don&#39;t go back to sleep!!!</strong></p>
