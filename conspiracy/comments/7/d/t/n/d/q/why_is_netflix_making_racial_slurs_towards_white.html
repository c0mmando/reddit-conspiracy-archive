       Did anybody notice something weird in the first episode of The Punisher?
      </p>
      <p>
       When the white conservative was making his rant about the “do-good liberal” at the Veteans help group meeting, the black guy immediately says “Fuck you
       <strong>
        cracker
       </strong>
       ”
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn’t and still don’t understand this part for this racial slur to be put in the dialogue at all. The white guy didnt call him a ‘porch monkey’ he didn’t call him a ‘nigger’ or a ‘coon’ he wasn’t even talking directly to him, he was talking to the entire group. He was only talking about how liberals were taking his second amendment rights and his freedom of speech but the black veteran just calls him a cracker for no reason and nobody gave a shit. Because let’s be honest, if the white guy said anything insensitive to the black guy, we would have had to sit there and listen to a lecture about racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw this again when Franks son referred Muslims to ‘jihadees’ and Frank grabs him by his mouth and says to never say that word again. I agree with this part because children should never use racial slurs and should be nipped in the butt, but at the Vetran meeting, when the black veteran calls him a cracker (for no fucking reason), nobody said anything, the organizer didn’t even say anything along the lines of “Hey man, we don’t use racial slurs here, be respectful” but he didn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wtf?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
       For everyone who is down voting, how about giving me a good fucking reason why this dialogue was put in.

       They want people to rely on the government for every aspect of their life so that the people are easily controlled.  I believe they took over 1/8th of the economy when they implemented Obamacare.  You have to do this softly and in a slow progression when 42% of the households you are trying to control own at least one firearm.

       Correct again. Boiling frogs. First they destroyed the unions, who would have provided organized resistance to oligarchy. Next, they decimated the standard of living of the middle class with disastrous trade agreements illegal immigration, and real estate/equity market ponzi scams. They have permanently introduced 10% real unemployment and use it to stifle dissent. Any interaction with the police can be escalated the point that you can be destroyed financially. Employers are claiming the right to regulate out of work speech. The 2nd Amendment has been infringed upon to the point that it barely exists in some states. It is all about the permanent introduction of oligarchy.

       Probably have to go ahead and look at
       <strong>
        who
       </strong>
       produced (funded) and directed the show? And then go from there. Most of the concerted anti-white hatred shown in an overt manner comes from blacks and jews. Oh, and I have black and jewish friends, so fuck your fist if you try and call me a racist.

       I agree.  As a white man, I really don't care about any word you use against me.  But does that mean it's okay to use racial slurs against white people when everybody cries about the rest, even when they use those same words to address each other within their own race?  I believe LoveableCancer and I will be the most downvoted within this thread, but it's the truth.

       Because that is what happens in real life. You don't need to make a racist comment towards someone to have them make one back.

       Growing up I had friends that lived in a predominantly spanish &amp; black neighborhood. When I went to pick up my friends I was constantly called things like "cracker" and "white piece of shit" ... and all I was doing was waiting in the car for my friends.

       Really? Your argument is that “it happens in real life” So white people are calling black people niggers out in the open right?

      <p>
       That’s my point. Do you really think that if the white guy had said anything racially charged towards the black guy, nothing would have happened? No #boycott The Punisher for being racist and having “white supremacy ideals” Or like I said in my original statement, if the white guy said anything racially charged we would have had to be lectured about racism. But, flip the race and nobody cares. I’m sick and tired of this double standard bullshit.

       When I was in 7th grade, I was arguing with this black guy in class and he called me an "F*****G White Boy."  I said "If you can call me that, I can call you a Nigger right?" I realized I shouldn't have said this, and from his reaction, I started to get really nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the bell rung, it took me longer to leave the classroom than everybody else becasue my backpack was broken (and I was nervous to leave).  When I finally left class, him and his other black friends were waiting for me in the hallway and jumped me.  Luckily the teacher came out before I got seriously injured.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like everything in the media is one-sided as far as racism goes.  It's always whites being racist towards another race.  I attended a 30%/50% black/hispanic populated middle school, then moved to a 90% hispanic high school, and I can say there are just as many "racists" in other races, not just whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can't be a one-way street.  All races should be treated with respect.  I could personally care less if you call me any word, it doesn't bother me.  But, speaking on what OP said, you can't cry about the N word or words towards other races, and then have no reaction to words against white people, because let's face it, that's really the only race that people have no reaction to when called a racial word.

       You are the problem.  You don't see the point.  It isn't the severity of the word that he called me, it's that he called me it in the first place, and people think it's okay.  He would have had a problem if I called him a black boy.  And if he would have called me cracker, people would have said I shouldn't have called him the N word, not even mentioning what he called me.  There is a double standard.

       Yes, yes there is you poor oppressed white man. Look, dude, we've got 400 years of collective racial oppression to deal with, so maybe if a black man calls a white man cracker (or white boy) it doesn't carry nearly the same weight as the reverse. And, seriously, do you think cracker is even close to the n word?

       "The Hateful Eight" comes to mind (great flick). I know it was set in another time, but holy hell I never heard the word "nigger" so many times in a movie. The book Huckleberry Finn also had quite a bit. In the end, it's just a novel, just a movie.

       If it's about white people it can't be racist. Also only white people are actually racist. This is what the media, government and Hollywood have told us.

       I've noticed a normalizing of very nasty rants from black writers. On Facebook, a woman who I respected, posted an awful article written by black woman saying they had no sympathy for raped white women. At a time when women were feeling safe to be our spoken, this article appeared. I was furious and told her how I felt. What white woman could respond to that? She would be called a racist. So I called the black writer, a racist, opportunistic selfish bitch.

       You watch almost any insurance company TV commercials the past 5 yrs ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probly 80% have white male as the uncool / idiot / slob figure amidst a group of other demographics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The white man dressed as a referee at the restaurant, ruining the dinner for his wife and A-A friends ? The white brother in law live-in wears the wife’s robe as the A-A family looks on in the next scene ? “Randy” the inept construction worker with Latino colleagues ? The dishonest slob BF who speaks “French” to the nice white girl while A-A male neighbor watches ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probly just insurance companies (and banks) have been identified charging higher premiums (or withholding loans) to lower income zip codes. In order to win back minority customers or just camouflage their actions, Insurance runs a steady stream of ads which mock white males. The targeted viewers have a “favorable reaction” to the ads though they don’t necessarily know why.

       Quite possibly. It would be the same bias at work. Companies though are creatures of profit and regulation so their advertising themes are crafted with very deliberate intent, down to the clothing, wall-paper of the room, age of the children, etc.

       They want people to rely on the government for every aspect of their life so that the people are easily controlled.  I believe they took over 1/8th of the economy when they implemented Obamacare.  You have to do this softly and in a slow progression when 42% of the households you are trying to control own at least one firearm.

       I agree.  As a white man, I really don't care about any word you use against me.  But does that mean it's okay to use racial slurs against white people when everybody cries about the rest, even when they use those same words to address each other within their own race?  I believe LoveableCancer and I will be the most downvoted within this thread, but it's the truth.
