<p>I am viewing this as vindication. </p>

<p>((edit: Roseann&#39;e account is back up</p>

<p>edit #2: For those asking who Q is, he/she has been explaining everything that has been happening since Oct 6. (technically ever since Trump was asked to run)</p>

<p>If you are not used to 4chan, this can be overwhelming, but look here:

<p>NOTE: Only posts from tripcode &quot;!ITPb.qbhqo&quot; are Q, if it does not have that, not Q, just some jerk misleading people. ))</p>

<p>Now little u/FireHazard11, you need to show your work! Remember, you have to tell us <em>why</em> you think q anon is a &quot;4 chan troll who is clearly full of shit,&quot; or we can&#39;t give you any internet points.</p>

<p><em>end teacher voice</em></p>

<p>Even if the messages did contain disinformation, the whole thing clearly isn&#39;t disinformation. It gives you lots of leads for you to pursue in your own research, instead of asking you to agree with conclusions that can&#39;t be proven.</p>

<p>Part of critical thinking is going into <em>layers</em> of analysis, instead of just looking at the surface.</p>

<p>Such as?</p>

<p>Have you noticed the hundreds of sealed federal indictments, the purge of the 9/11 and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7243">ISIS-funding</a> elements in Saudi Arabia, and the Podestas being <a href="https://www.apnews.com/7167dc620047495ebe424d1e85da4598/What-We-Know:-Indictments,-hearings-in-Russia-probe">implicated</a>?</p>

<p>&quot;The indictment has also cast shadows on several powerful Washington lobbying and legal firms, with Democratic as well as Republican ties. The Podesta Group, founded by Washington powerbroker Tony Podesta, was among the three firms cited by pseudonym or other references in the indictment, though none is charged with crimes. Prosecutors are implicating all three in covert work for pro-Russian Ukrainian interests, the heart of the criminal case.</p>

<p>Podesta stepped down from his namesake group following the indictment. His brother, John Podesta, ran the Clinton campaign.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so what about fluid situations? do you understand how the real world works where &#39;murphy&#39;s law&#39; is something everyone deals with? For all we know, Podesta was arrested/indicted, worked out a plea/immunity deal, and was released shortly after and they sealed all the paperwork to shield it from the media. We don&#39;t know cause we can&#39;t know until all of those sealed indictments are no longer sealed.</p>

<p>To ask a fluid situation to be 100% certain is not fair nor is it honest. He&#39;s giving information as he reports it, but to expect him to be some omniscient presence is a bit much, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a string of predictions as you are claiming (lying). It is primarily a series of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/DTeK7">questions</a> that you can look up the answers to. That is, in fact, the point that the anon emphasized, not the predictions.</p>

<p>Bullshit. Doubling down on your already debunked misrepresentation that Q anon is just a series of predictions.

<p>Since she still has her account, she is not banned. When accounts are randomly deleted, it is usually by hackers trying to fuck with someone, which would explain why her site went down as well.</p>

<p>I never moved the goalposts either, the goal is explaining why her account is gone, you theorized it was a cabal of twitter elites censoring her for exposing Q to the masses, I think it was a hacker or herself. I provided reasons that a hack is more likely, you provided nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;entering the South Carolina primary, the pledged delegate count was 52-51. CNN’s poll two weeks out projected an 18 point Clinton win. Ann Selzer, the best pollster in the United States, projected a 22 point Clinton win. RealClearPolitics’ polling average projected a 27.5% win. FiveThirtyEight was much bolder in projecting a 38.3% Clinton win. The early full exit poll said Clinton had won by 36%, pretty close to FiveThirtyEight’s call. Tellingly, white people in that exit poll went for Sanders 58-42. But the final results said Clinton won by 47.5%, an 11.5% exit polling miss. And the exit polls had to adjust their initial figures to a 53-47 Clinton win with white Democrats in South Carolina.</p>

<p>Clinton seriously outperformed her exit polling projections again in a bunch of states on Super Tuesday, including Massachusetts where she went from a projected 6.6% loss to a 1.4% win. Super Tuesday set the narrative that Sanders had no chance of beating Clinton in pledged delegates.&quot;</p>

<p>Way to assume your conclusion. No, the polling was not off, the election was off. This is explained in great detail in the link.</p>

<p>Hanging their hats on the fact that Podesta wasn&#39;t arrested, even though Q said they were only slated for arrest, and they have definitely been implicated already:</p>

<p>&quot;The indictment has also cast shadows on several powerful Washington lobbying and legal firms, with Democratic as well as Republican ties. The Podesta Group, founded by Washington powerbroker Tony Podesta, was among the three firms cited by pseudonym or other references in the indictment, though none is charged with crimes. Prosecutors are implicating all three in covert work for pro-Russian Ukrainian interests, the heart of the criminal case.</p>

<p>Podesta stepped down from his namesake group following the indictment. His brother, John Podesta, ran the Clinton campaign.&quot;</p>

<p>Next up, lots of repeating &quot;LARP&quot; over and over again, along with outlandish reasons to dismiss it. I just saw one where they said he is fake because &quot;he asked questions&quot;. Shill logic of the worst kind.</p>

<p>Such as?</p>

<p>Have you noticed the hundreds of sealed federal indictments, the purge of the 9/11 and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7243">ISIS-funding</a> elements in Saudi Arabia, and the Podestas being <a href="https://www.apnews.com/7167dc620047495ebe424d1e85da4598/What-We-Know:-Indictments,-hearings-in-Russia-probe">implicated</a>?</p>

<p>&quot;The indictment has also cast shadows on several powerful Washington lobbying and legal firms, with Democratic as well as Republican ties. The Podesta Group, founded by Washington powerbroker Tony Podesta, was among the three firms cited by pseudonym or other references in the indictment, though none is charged with crimes. Prosecutors are implicating all three in covert work for pro-Russian Ukrainian interests, the heart of the criminal case.</p>

<p>Podesta stepped down from his namesake group following the indictment. His brother, John Podesta, ran the Clinton campaign.&quot;</p>

<p>Bullshit. Doubling down on your already debunked misrepresentation that Q anon is just a series of predictions. It&#39;s actually a bunch of questions for people to research on their own, with a small handful of noncomittal predictions that were explicitly described only as having been scheduled on a certain date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so what about fluid situations? do you understand how the real world works where &#39;murphy&#39;s law&#39; is something everyone deals with? For all we know, Podesta was arrested/indicted, worked out a plea/immunity deal, and was released shortly after and they sealed all the paperwork to shield it from the media. We don&#39;t know cause we can&#39;t know until all of those sealed indictments are no longer sealed.</p>

<p>To ask a fluid situation to be 100% certain is not fair nor is it honest. He&#39;s giving information as he reports it, but to expect him to be some omniscient presence is a bit much, don&#39;t you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that if you make the claim that a man is going to be arrested/indicted on a given day and then there is no news of that happening and you are an insider with information about this subject why don&#39;t you then come out and explain &quot;the guy I said was going to be arrested/indicted was arrested/indicted secretly and here&#39;s how it happened...&quot;  If you want to prove you are for real that is the sort of thing you have to do.  If you are actually wrong but you don&#39;t want people to know you are wrong you&#39;ll most likely just move on and make a bunch of new vague claims because if you are being vague then it&#39;s impossible to be proven wrong.  What did Q do?  He moved on and made a bunch of vague claims and asked a bunch of vague questions so that he can&#39;t actually be proven wrong with anything new he is saying/asking.  </p>
