       Roseanne had been talking about Q mostly all day and asking him to contact her, now ...

       I am viewing this as vindication.
      </p>
      <p>
       ((edit: Roseann'e account is back up
      </p>
      <p>
       edit #2: For those asking who Q is, he/she has been explaining everything that has been happening since Oct 6. (technically ever since Trump was asked to run)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are not used to 4chan, this can be overwhelming, but look here:

      <p>
       NOTE: Only posts from tripcode "!ITPb.qbhqo" are Q, if it does not have that, not Q, just some jerk misleading people. ))

       It's not that she's a celebrity, it's that her twitter account got deleted and her website is now down. She has mainstream followers, so I guess the reason it lends Q credibility is that as a celebrity, she has the opportunity to spread the Q stuff further than others in the 'truth community.' If Q was not legit, no one would care that she tweeted out this stuff and wouldn't feel the need to shut her up.

       Making an incorrect prediction is something anybody can do.  If you are an "insider" with actual information about what is actually going to happen then you aren't making predictions.  You are saying what you know.  If what you are saying turns out not to be true then it calls into question the idea that you are actually somebody on the inside with real information.

       so what about fluid situations? do you understand how the real world works where 'murphy's law' is something everyone deals with? For all we know, Podesta was arrested/indicted, worked out a plea/immunity deal, and was released shortly after and they sealed all the paperwork to shield it from the media. We don't know cause we can't know until all of those sealed indictments are no longer sealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ask a fluid situation to be 100% certain is not fair nor is it honest. He's giving information as he reports it, but to expect him to be some omniscient presence is a bit much, don't you think?

       Well something like "Podesta is going to be indicted on "x" date" isn't exactly a fluid situation.  If he was an insider he would know that there was an indictment order or not.  If it didn't happen on the date he said for one reason or another he could easily come out the next day and say "Here is why this didn't happen like I said it would..." and explain why he was wrong.  Why didn't he do that?  He just moved on like it didn't happen almost as if he was hoping people would forget he was wrong and just focus on the 50 other things he's been vaguely saying instead of actually holding him to account for the specific claims he made that were not correct.

       there are over 100 sealed indictments right now - how do you know one of them wasn't for Podesta and he worked out a quick deal? They could have kept it sealed to draw less media attention, and then release him right after and keep it quiet. There is more that can happen than 'Podesta gets arrested in front of his neighbors' and to say that is a concrete situation shows you aren't being thorough.
      </p>

       Or are you claiming to know that the 100+ sealed indictments aren't anything to do with them?

       I'm saying that if you make the claim that a man is going to be arrested/indicted on a given day and then there is no news of that happening and you are an insider with information about this subject why don't you then come out and explain "the guy I said was going to be arrested/indicted was arrested/indicted secretly and here's how it happened..."  If you want to prove you are for real that is the sort of thing you have to do.  If you are actually wrong but you don't want people to know you are wrong you'll most likely just move on and make a bunch of new vague claims because if you are being vague then it's impossible to be proven wrong.  What did Q do?  He moved on and made a bunch of vague claims and asked a bunch of vague questions so that he can't actually be proven wrong with anything new he is saying/asking.

       Sorry, is English your second language? "Slated for" means it's scheduled for that date. If it was postponed then why hasn't he updated with the new date, or mentioned that it was rescheduled and he doesn't know when?

       You seriously think that his post stopped the riots? 4chan is not that popular of a website. It doesn't have that kind of reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if someone anonymously claims that they're a super secret agent with Q Clearance and have access to a shit ton of secret information, but the very first prediction they make falls flat on it's face, then of course I'm going to completely disregard everything they say. Why the fuck would you give them the benefit of the doubt after that? Literally any jackass with internet access could write those posts, and 4chan is notorious for people who make up huge bullshit lies just to troll people. Q has provided absolutely zero evidence that they are who they claim they are, yet you're just mindlessly believing everything they say because you want it to be true.

       No, they couldn't, because 99.9% of the people on the internet aren't even that up to date on open source intelligence. So it would have to be, at a minimum, someone whose full-time job is following these events to the point that they could impersonate a high level insider based solely on open source.

       You are literally writing excuses for a LARP that has a 0% accuracy so far. He said slated for the 4th, then he never updated it, why would he know the original date but not the updated date? Because there is no date, there is no Q, and a random person hacked a dumb celebrities twitter and website for 5 minutes.

       Bullshit. Doubling down on your already debunked misrepresentation that Q anon is just a series of predictions.

       Since she still has her account, she is not banned. When accounts are randomly deleted, it is usually by hackers trying to fuck with someone, which would explain why her site went down as well.

      <p>
       I never moved the goalposts either, the goal is explaining why her account is gone, you theorized it was a cabal of twitter elites censoring her for exposing Q to the masses, I think it was a hacker or herself. I provided reasons that a hack is more likely, you provided nothing.

      </p>

       "entering the South Carolina primary, the pledged delegate count was 52-51. CNN’s poll two weeks out projected an 18 point Clinton win. Ann Selzer, the best pollster in the United States, projected a 22 point Clinton win. RealClearPolitics’ polling average projected a 27.5% win. FiveThirtyEight was much bolder in projecting a 38.3% Clinton win. The early full exit poll said Clinton had won by 36%, pretty close to FiveThirtyEight’s call. Tellingly, white people in that exit poll went for Sanders 58-42. But the final results said Clinton won by 47.5%, an 11.5% exit polling miss. And the exit polls had to adjust their initial figures to a 53-47 Clinton win with white Democrats in South Carolina.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton seriously outperformed her exit polling projections again in a bunch of states on Super Tuesday, including Massachusetts where she went from a projected 6.6% loss to a 1.4% win. Super Tuesday set the narrative that Sanders had no chance of beating Clinton in pledged delegates."

       So the polling being off means she cheated? Did Trump cheat since polls showed him losing by 1 point? Perhaps the pollsters overhyped the idea of a social democrat amongst southerners.

       Hanging their hats on the fact that Podesta wasn't arrested, even though Q said they were only slated for arrest, and they have definitely been implicated already:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The indictment has also cast shadows on several powerful Washington lobbying and legal firms, with Democratic as well as Republican ties. The Podesta Group, founded by Washington powerbroker Tony Podesta, was among the three firms cited by pseudonym or other references in the indictment, though none is charged with crimes. Prosecutors are implicating all three in covert work for pro-Russian Ukrainian interests, the heart of the criminal case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta stepped down from his namesake group following the indictment. His brother, John Podesta, ran the Clinton campaign."

       No celebrity profile was nuked, though, and you're just wrong. Maybe this should teach you a lesson - pick the sources you trust more carefully in the future.

       There needs to be a de-centralized version of twitter.  Just a hub where celebrities have a page that they manage and aren't at the mercy of a gov't controlled company like twitter.

       Yeah idk! But they sure live to censor lately. 
Maybe...and just maybe here...someone who wants to protect Q did this? I have no idea but was there contact info on her website? Perhaps by taking down twitter and her website, it ensures she CANNOT be contacted by Q? My first thought was "Q please don't dm her anything...twitter is obviously capable of releasing personal DMs" (not that Q would fall for that,  but it's just a thought)

       How would she even know if it was Q? I thought he/she posted anonymously on 4chan. So anyone could have contacted her on twitter and said they were Q.

       Kind of strange that her website was taken down too.

       Im not sure of what to make of Roseanne. But in light of her recent actions she is singlehandedly trying to pot-stir on a legendary level. Either she is enlightened, crazy, or a edgelord of diety-like proportions. Either way, its more entertaining to me than her TV show.

       So what is this some Pizzagate bullshit all over again?You guys do realize Russian intelligence agency's use 4chan to destabilize the West ? Am I the only person who's seeing through all this bullshit for what it is ? Its a modern form of political propaganda.  For Christ sake we even know where the troll factory's are . Pizzagate, Slamming Hilary, Fake News all reek of old school Soviet style propaganda.  Look up Hybrid/Non Linear Warfare and people like Vladislav Surkov. This is an old video that sums up whats going on in Russia and now the West.

       "The indictment has also cast shadows on several powerful Washington lobbying and legal firms, with Democratic as well as Republican ties. The Podesta Group, founded by Washington powerbroker Tony Podesta, was among the three firms cited by pseudonym or other references in the indictment, though none is charged with crimes. Prosecutors are implicating all three in covert work for pro-Russian Ukrainian interests, the heart of the criminal case.

       Podesta stepped down from his namesake group following the indictment. His brother, John Podesta, ran the Clinton campaign."

       Bullshit. Doubling down on your already debunked misrepresentation that Q anon is just a series of predictions. It's actually a bunch of questions for people to research on their own, with a small handful of noncomittal predictions that were explicitly described only as having been scheduled on a certain date.

       so what about fluid situations? do you understand how the real world works where 'murphy's law' is something everyone deals with? For all we know, Podesta was arrested/indicted, worked out a plea/immunity deal, and was released shortly after and they sealed all the paperwork to shield it from the media. We don't know cause we can't know until all of those sealed indictments are no longer sealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ask a fluid situation to be 100% certain is not fair nor is it honest. He's giving information as he reports it, but to expect him to be some omniscient presence is a bit much, don't you think?

       I'm saying that if you make the claim that a man is going to be arrested/indicted on a given day and then there is no news of that happening and you are an insider with information about this subject why don't you then come out and explain "the guy I said was going to be arrested/indicted was arrested/indicted secretly and here's how it happened..."  If you want to prove you are for real that is the sort of thing you have to do.  If you are actually wrong but you don't want people to know you are wrong you'll most likely just move on and make a bunch of new vague claims because if you are being vague then it's impossible to be proven wrong.  What did Q do?  He moved on and made a bunch of vague claims and asked a bunch of vague questions so that he can't actually be proven wrong with anything new he is saying/asking.
