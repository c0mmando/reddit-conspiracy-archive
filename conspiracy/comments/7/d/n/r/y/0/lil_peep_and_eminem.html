        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So aspiring rapper lil Peep died yesterday due to an apparent overdose. I believe that Lil Peep is not really dead and will be “revived” on Saturday on SNL when Eminem performs. </p>

<p>Reason 1: Eminem’s upcoming album is called Revival. It may also be his last solo album so reviving someone from the dead may be a major and huge way to go out with a bang.</p>

<p>Reason 2: there are a lot of similarities between marshal mathers and lil Peep. Both got their start with shock rap and I could see me attempting to make lil Peep blow up like how Dre did with him.</p>

<p>Reason 3: in Eminem’s new single “Walk on Water” the hook is “I walk on water, but I ant no Jesus”. Jesus raised people from the dead. Kinda a stretch but small connection.</p>

<p>This is extremely far fetched, but so far, Eminem has not been promoting his album like he has been in the past. He released the single last week, but in an interview today he refused to make any mention of revival. While this is the case he is set to perform on SNL this weekend and I he only has done that to promote a new album. I also do not think he’d perform walk on water because Beyoncé is a major part of the song and she isn’t going to show let’s be real... idk just a crazy theory of mine. </p>

<p>EDIT:
Obviously this is super far fetched. These are just small connections, but the idea just hit me so I thought I’d share it. I’m not on drugs...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think everyone comes here just to read outrageous frivolous theories with zero regard for whether they are true. I&#39;m sure some might, but I definitely don&#39;t. And honestly, that&#39;s one of the main things I always hear when people try to discredit all conspiracy theories, they say, &quot;You just like reading about conspiracies because they&#39;re fun, which clouds your logic.&quot; I don&#39;t come here for fun, I come here because it&#39;s a far better source of info than the MSM on this sort of stuff. I wish to hell there were no conspiracies at all and the world was how I used to think it was before getting &quot;woke&quot; to all this dark shit that goes on behind the scenes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was commentating on political issues because those political issues were directly effecting him and his music. The censorship was a real worry back then. The heat from school shootings and the media were a real issue back then. When he came back after Encore, too much had changed in music, much as a result of himself. There was no reason to go after the government when they weren&#39;t going after him. He tried to go back and be Slim Shady on Relapse and pushed things even further, but nobody really cared. It was done. He&#39;s talked in songs and interviews about having nothing to talk about anymore, which is why he focuses on the flows and &quot;lyricism&quot; over the type of songs that made him great in the first place. </p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to be as weird/goofy as he is, so the whole clone thing is ridiculous to me. I see people mention his voice and style now, but you hear him live and he can still rap exactly the way he used to. It&#39;s him lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just pointless antagonism. When you post shit like this just because &quot;it&#39;s fun to think about,&quot; what you&#39;re really doing is discrediting the entire idea of conspiracy theories. One of the main talking points for people who try to discredit conspiracy theorists is that, &quot;they&#39;re all just un-critical thinkers who just come up with theories because it&#39;s fun to them.&quot; That is not true of many of us. Many of us actually take this shit seriously. There&#39;s nothing fun to me about the fact that there are extremely powerful and, apparently, malevolent forces behind the scenes. I wish that everything was more straightforward and honest, and that there were no conspiracies. But this is why you have been getting some hostile responses. Your post really does not paint the most flattering picture of &quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot; Just gives the doubters more ammo when they read something that is so made up out of thin air as this.</p>
