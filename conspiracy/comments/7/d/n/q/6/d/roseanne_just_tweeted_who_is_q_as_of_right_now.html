       Asking questions to show people what to research means this person is fake? That makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, asking questions about publicly available topics makes this
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       credible. They are avoiding disclosure of classified information and outing themselves, as well as encouraging people to look into facts that are verifiable, instead of just asking to be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       These threads need a booster shot of well-thought-out, critical thinking, not cursory dismissals that don't actually deal with the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is almost as bad as the people saying he's fake because he won't show his badge number.

       It says that was "slated to occur" on the 3rd. This is pretty credible considering that sealed indictments were filed in the DC district, and the Podestas have already been implicated in this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The indictment has also cast shadows on several powerful Washington lobbying and legal firms, with Democratic as well as Republican ties. The Podesta Group, founded by Washington powerbroker Tony Podesta, was among the three firms cited by pseudonym or other references in the indictment, though none is charged with crimes. Prosecutors are implicating all three in covert work for pro-Russian Ukrainian interests, the heart of the criminal case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta stepped down from his namesake group following the indictment. His brother, John Podesta, ran the Clinton campaign."

       But you wouldn't necessarily "see" indictments as they can be sealed, and/or the subject of an indictment could barter for media silence on an unsealed indictment in return for timely compliance or information leading to other arrests, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be the case for anyone subject to an indictment that you'd never know that they had been indicted, save for actual charges resulting from an indictment being made public.

       By editing your host file, it intercepts attempts for routing to a particular website, where your machine will first look at the local rules and if there are some it shall invoke them first.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you set statements in your hosts file that says “anytime you hear a request for Facebook, then I want you to go (here) instead” and here can be anywhere you want, including a black hole such that your computer can never load Facebook.

       This is the way it's going to go now. If you speak out against the narrative, you are (a) demonetized by youtube, (b) customization by facebook and twitter means that people won't see you in their feed (they have to go to your page to see your stuff), (c) you will be shut off or silenced without notice and without recourse, (d) reddit, FB, and other social media sites will blacklist alt news sources and groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember 9/11/2016 when Hillary collapsed? It happened to me. I merely mentioned it on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and was instantly perma-banned with no warning and no appeal.  If I message the admins, they say to message the mods. If I message the mods, I am muted.  So I am silenced in
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       . But I tell everybody about it all over the rest of reddit.

       Its really a downward spiral, trying to control the narrative like this is going to backfire on them and explode. Wisdom doesn't seem to be valued by these fools at all,  and the hubris is over the top. The more tech goddess forward,  the more backward the policy seems to go.  They are right to be afraid I guess,  the guilty are usually paranoid while the innocent are bold.

       About Hillary?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a memorial service in NYC on 9/11/2016 just before the election. Hillary showed up with her entourage. She apparently wanted to leave because she wasn't feeling well or was overheated or some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       A video surfaced of her collapsing and being dragged into her van by her handlers.  This didn't fit the narrative of the queen awaiting her coronation, so it was silenced by the mainstream media and also blacklisted by reddit due to bots, shilling, and mod abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned it on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and I was instantly thrown into the black hole. I was perma-banned with no warning. No way to appeal.  Normally you would get a warning strike and something like a 7 day ban or maybe a 30 day ban for something really egregious. It was obvious that I struck a nerve somewhere. I wonder how many other reasonable people want to have honest discussion and discourse and are simply silenced by the authoritarian censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the video.  Play it back a couple of times and look carefully. Then you decide if it's newsworthy that a candidate for POTUS apparently passed out and collapsed
       <em>
        and it was silenced by the news
       </em>
       .
      </p>

       The really interesting thing is that they didn't take her to a hospital, which causes some conspiracy-minded people's eyebrows to raise. Instead, they took her to Chelsea's palatial apartment in NYC which takes up a whole floor of a large building and cost over $10M.  Some believe there is a small medical facility there because Hillary spends a lot of time there and she has a number of serious medical problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Hillary is rushed into Chelsea's apartment (which the media was apparently forbidden to tape).  She emerges some time later to a staged photo op.  She waves and smiles for the camera, and appears OK. A young girl who is dressed up in a little cute dress with a bow in her hair (vomit) runs up to her and gets a hug just in time for the camera crews to film it all.  It's obviously staged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some believe that second appearance was a body double. A lookalike actress was known to be in NYC that day. The second appearance has her wearing the same clothing, but she has dropped about 40 pounds. She does not have any of her bodyguards around her (which is unusual in the extreme) so that you can't tell she isn't the same height.  Slightly different appearance (hair style, nose, ear lobes, etc).  Since she wore those special glasses that are used by people who have seizures, that's pretty much the focal point of her face... and it's pretty easy to miss that this person is not, in fact, Hillary.  Judge for yourself.  Is this the same person that passed out and collapsed earlier?

       If her best friend just started updatimg about her. Hen her friend gets removed and wiped. Then it moves onnto another friend and repeat until it has gotten overwhelmingly ridiculous and they have to respond publicly. And epicly fail at bullshitting a reason.

       Oh yes, I remember. That was the day it became crystal clear that our nation is under attack. Sedition had long been on our doorstep, knocking quietly so that few could hear, but on that day the quiet knocking was replaced with the thunderous banging of giants. I fully believe that entire swaths of social media have been actively faked ever since to pacify the masses who started to wonder about all the commotion.

       It's shocking that they were able to partially cover up these serious health problems. She was not even physically or mentally capable of being President and yet millions of people voted for her. It's really scary that the propagandists nearly pulled that one off.

       How? Cuz Roseanne said so? She literally is just you and with more money. She sits around super hopeful and willing to believe anything she reads on the internet. Not trying to shit on discourse or anything but this q thing has gone on for weeks and it was never credible. Roseanne is just like us. She might even follow r/conspiracy. But literally q has just been trolling and she took the bait as well. She isn't some bastion of truth cuz she's a celebrity with some money and free time.

       It's not about Roseanne. You're missing the point... it's about the censorship of Roseanne because of her question. Patterns are the key to unveiling the truth. Censoring accounts asking questions is a pattern.

       She could have even deleted it herself to make it look there's a conspiracy against her. I honestly think this whole q thing is retarded. 2 weeks ago everybody started following cuz podesta was gonna get arrested and that never happened.

       Roseanne has many well-documented and self-acknowledged mental issues that have plagued her for her entire life, which has been long and weird. It sucks because she is funny as hell, and could’ve easily continued with constant mainstream success as a comedian and actress, if she had wanted to (raw talent-wise). I️ would recommend her appearance on Maron’s podcast if you want to get s good feel for where she’s at lately though. Some might call her off-kilter.

       You don't have to give anything legitimacy. No one is forcing you to believe anything. However, some people do and they want to discuss those things with other like-minded people. That's why they come here. If you don't believe in any of the "insiders", then ignore the threads and go on with your day.

       This sub is filled with sexual harassment rumors, claims, and accusations right now. Many people wouldn't describe those stories as a conspiracy. However, some would. This sub tends to be a bit chaotic at times because of the open ended nature of what can be considered a conspiracy. If you don't agree with something, then pay no attention to it.

       Arrests? That Trump had some secret location he was going to? That Sessions was going to announce something? You have to remember, Q wasn't predicting shit to go down last week, this was nearly a month ago, and nothing Q talked about has happened.

       Q didn't say arrests, he said indictments on "Podesta" (probably Tony) on Nov 3 and Huma on Nov 6. Arrests and indictments are different and just after he said that over a dozen sealed indictments appeared. There is no way for us to know if they were or were not indicted just yet. Also, I don't think Tony and Huma have been seen in public since then. Even if they have been seen doesn't mean anything because they were only indictments, meaning they wouldn't have been incarcerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions did in fact announce something last week. He's directed senior prosecutors to investigate Uranium One and also said he's open to appointing a special counsel on U1.

      <p>
       I haven't heard about Trump going to some secret location and in any case, how do you know he didn't? China did give him a State Dinner within the Forbidden City and presented him with some honor which have never been done to an US President before. This was a massive deal for diplomacy between US and China. Q did question about this state dinner and medal of honor so maybe that's what you're referring to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there anything else you could refer to?

       At minimum, he said that the arrests would leak or be announced. And what i asked was how long we should wait for that? Tony, John, Huma. All free and walking around. Well, Tony probably not for long, but who knows.

       I remember saying leaks and I'm still waiting. I'm betting Tony was indicted but not John and I never really understood why Huma would be indicted a few days later. For me it didn't seem to fit into that story line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictments are just formal notices of intended charges so if you've been indicted you can still be walking around. After indictments have been served then arrests can be made which means the person is taken into custody. Obviously this hasn't happened yet.

       I think the people who are talking about VOTL are not new to the concepts he covers. To them, it doesn't matter if he's wrong about dates or anything else. His target audience does not need to be convinced of those theories; they already believe them.

       His tweets simply give people an opportunity to discuss these ideas, which can be fun.

       Podesta firm folded. That is a hard fact. The saudi shifts happened, also a hard fact. The hollywood scandal continues to unfold, new deals with china, and east asia. These are huge changes in the geopolitical fabric, all of which happened after Q posted, predicting huge changes in the same. Q may not have been perfect, but there is definitely something going on and it is more than tangentially related to what we are seeing unfold. Perhaps this social media breadcrumb thing is a way to slowly build up grassroots support for those actions? If so, I think that is a brilliant strategy and wish them god speed.

       I am not aware enough of the McCain stuff to comment, and obviously the sealed indictments are a mystery to everyone. I'll agree that its too early to say QAnon is a total fraud. So will wait 'til the end of the year to make further judgment.

       To my understanding, QAnon is an alleged White House insider who has been making predictions and leaving clues to major revelations. Q is possible Donald Trump himself, based on the fact that both Q and Donald Trump used "+++" in messages. If anyone else has more or better information, please share.

       Q stated a specific date that Huma and Podesta would be indicted, among other clearly defined predictions. They appear to have come and gone with zero incident. In fact, Q seems to be writing an alt-right fantasy world in which Trump is the hero on horse back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, it really could be Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the failures in prediction does not aid credibility. No matter who it is, they don't have the information they claim. This suggests they are a fraud.

       Well, we don't know that yet. We know something happened -- for all I know, she deactivated her own account as part of a false flag, or out of harassment, or that the account was compromised and she wasn't the one who sent that Tweet.

       Fair enough. Admittedly, I don't know too much about QAnon, and I don't use Twitter, so I'm not much of an authority. I was just trying to answer a question that seemed to be overlooked. Thanks for your insight and clarification.

       Thanks for the sanity about Q, didn't know anything about it until Roseanne twitter thing and just read the archive images, obvious LARP. Surprised people are sucked in by it. It's just some dude getting shit mostly wrong and then the rest is them trying to appear cryptic by asking questions.

       Yes, and if I were Q, it would make sense for me to post on one of my more public identities, thus when investigated, it'll point to me not being Q.

      <p>
       Therefore, maybe you should entertain the notion that I am Q. Or that I am a CIA robot, sent back in time from 2024, to kill Q before he runs for President in 2020. Or that the world in fact ended in 2012 and this is just the universal hell we've been condemned to.

       Qanon is the guy that's been blowing up 4chan with question/riddle hints about what the Trump admin is doing. Still could be a larp tho, twitter is stupid for doing that now it makes Q look legit.

       Qanon, on 4chan has posted a series of questions. Basically it seems to be a little but biased towards Trump, so it's being viewed with a lot of scrutiny. There are some predicted events that are sketchy. What peaks my interest is the questions themselves, it goes really deep into conspiracy theories all the way back to the Titanic. Just researching the questions you learn a lot.

       It's Dan Scavino and the whole thing is pro Trump WH propaganda. The AF1 post showed that he was an insider but it doesn't mean that he was telling the truth. He might know a few things though and maybe he might lead us to something real but I doubt he will.

       I freaked out because I thought I might get doxxed and I had enough information on that account to do that easily. Better for security in the long run anyway, all I lost was a shitty username and a relatively small amount of karma.

       That's not quite what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone posted a 4chan tag from her account, then it went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would also be consistent with someone hacking her account, posting that message, then either closing the account themselves or being shut down by Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matched with the takedown on her website, it sounds an awful lot like someone compromised a password, then shotgunned it around to see where it worked.

       At least, that is completely consistent.

       I saw her post right before I got off work. I saw her posting a ton of stuff that I see on here. She must be a regular here on Reddit. Strange that they took it down. She was also wanting to speak to Corey Feldman the other day through private message. I hope she comes back online soon. She wasn't posting anything more offensive than the stuff on here or anywhere else.

       Roseanne was on the TV show Roseanne back in the 90's. She had a talk show too. She started writing on Twitter about who this Q guy was, and got her profile deleted. It seems as though the person who started this post had his profile deleted as well, according to the top text bar. Not sure if the Reddit user did it himself, or if he violated the terms of use of Reddit.

       Hehe maybe I shouldn’t have used “older” folks, but hopefully you know what I mean. I’m a bit older than you and was in college those days. I had most of my classes in the late afternoon or night, so I was at home nerding out on my computer with the TV on during the mornings. All the tabloid shows aired around that time, I guess catering to bored housewives, maybe? This were also the very early days of the internet and social networking didn’t exist back then. TV was still king and what mass media “reported” was “fact”.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those that don’t know, the world hated Roseanne back then. And I mean hate.

       I would agree with that. I remember some family drama with the daughters acting out the way teenagers do, and not in a funny way. I’m blurry on it since I really wasn’t paying much attention (other than a rabid attraction to both daughters in the latter days of the show), but if my old age isn’t pulling a fast one on me, I recall some drugs/alcohol, pregnancy and that sort of drama, especially with the older blonde daughter. I may have been stretching it, but I got a lesbian vibe being hinted at with the aunt, too.

       Yep, good old Bill. Even black folks loved him. “The first black American president”, not realizing he’s the chief architect of one of the most detrimental pieces of legislation to affect African American and other minorities with the prison system deals.
      </p>

       All of my family were frothing at the mouth Clinton supporters. I was like
       <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/gngO1gmBhS9na/giphy.gif">
        that John Travolta gif
       </a>
       wondering “am I the only one in this family paying attention!?!”, and it’s a big, close family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I gotta admit I had my doubts about the accusations. Not because I thought they weren’t true, but because, as I do with the recent stream of DC and Hollywood accusations, words are cheap and if you’re powerful people would like to make a buck or get 5 mins of fame at your expense. It was not long before that a stream of crazy fans came out claiming they were the “Billie Jean” from MJ’s songs and they had his baby. That whole “innocent until proven guilty”, especially after he came on TV flatly and directly denying it... And then he admitted it. It was the single funniest piece of TV history, as far as I’m concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I saw a few documentaries, obviously produced around that time, but never aired or at least not well publicized. The deal with Vince Foster and how Mike Wallace and 60 mins manipulated interviews to discredit the questions and inconsistencies being raised and the one going through their history from before college through his presidency. It made sense of why my lizard brain (not alien related, this being
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and all) always made me dislike the guy to the point of disgust, even at the height of his popularity. And I’m not even a conservative!!!!

       So... looks to me like someone guessed her Twitter password, posted about Q and then deleted her account to stir shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally I just searched reddit for "roseanne" and found a fuckton of posts about this is the_Donald and r/conspiracy and NOTHING anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half the posts on r/conspiracy front page are about Roseanne's fucking Twitter account as if this is super meaningful. But it just looks like a deliberate campaign to me.

       Fair enough. Admittedly, I don't know too much about QAnon, and I don't use Twitter, so I'm not much of an authority. I was just trying to answer a question that seemed to be overlooked. Thanks for your insight and clarification.

       Thanks for the sanity about Q, didn't know anything about it until Roseanne twitter thing and just read the archive images, obvious LARP. Surprised people are sucked in by it.

       Roseanne was on the TV show Roseanne back in the 90's. She had a talk show too. She started writing on Twitter about who this Q guy was, and got her profile deleted. It seems as though the person who started this post had his profile deleted as well, according to the top text bar. Not sure if the Reddit user did it himself, or if he violated the terms of use of Reddit.

       This is the way it's going to go now. If you speak out against the narrative, you are (a) demonetized by youtube, (b) customization by facebook and twitter means that people won't see you in their feed (they have to go to your page to see your stuff), (c) you will be shut off or silenced without notice and without recourse, (d) reddit, FB, and other social media sites will blacklist alt news sources and groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember 9/11/2016 when Hillary collapsed? It happened to me. I merely mentioned it on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and was instantly perma-banned with no warning and no appeal.  If I message the admins, they say to message the mods. If I message the mods, I am muted.  So I am silenced in
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       . But I tell everybody about it all over the rest of reddit.

       About Hillary?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a memorial service in NYC on 9/11/2016 just before the election. Hillary showed up with her entourage. She apparently wanted to leave because she wasn't feeling well or was overheated or some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       A video surfaced of her collapsing and being dragged into her van by her handlers.  This didn't fit the narrative of the queen awaiting her coronation, so it was silenced by the mainstream media and also blacklisted by reddit due to bots, shilling, and mod abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned it on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and I was instantly thrown into the black hole. I was perma-banned with no warning. No way to appeal.  Normally you would get a warning strike and something like a 7 day ban or maybe a 30 day ban for something really egregious. It was obvious that I struck a nerve somewhere. I wonder how many other reasonable people want to have honest discussion and discourse and are simply silenced by the authoritarian censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the video.  Play it back a couple of times and look carefully. Then you decide if it's newsworthy that a candidate for POTUS apparently passed out and collapsed

       The really interesting thing is that they didn't take her to a hospital, which causes some conspiracy-minded people's eyebrows to raise. Instead, they took her to Chelsea's palatial apartment in NYC which takes up a whole floor of a large building and cost over $10M.  Some believe there is a small medical facility there because Hillary spends a lot of time there and she has a number of serious medical problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Hillary is rushed into Chelsea's apartment (which the media was apparently forbidden to tape).  She emerges some time later to a staged photo op.  She waves and smiles for the camera, and appears OK. A young girl who is dressed up in a little cute dress with a bow in her hair (vomit) runs up to her and gets a hug just in time for the camera crews to film it all.  It's obviously staged.

       Some believe that second appearance was a body double. A lookalike actress was known to be in NYC that day. The second appearance has her wearing the same clothing, but she has dropped about 40 pounds. She does not have any of her bodyguards around her (which is unusual in the extreme) so that you can't tell she isn't the same height.  Slightly different appearance (hair style, nose, ear lobes, etc).  Since she wore those special glasses that are used by people who have seizures, that's pretty much the focal point of her face... and it's pretty easy to miss that this person is not, in fact, Hillary.  Judge for yourself.  Is this the same person that passed out and collapsed earlier?

       Here is the announcement that she was back online, 18hours ago. She has posted a lot of RT, some Q oriented and some hollywood stuff. No explanation as to what happened that I have seen. Could be something in the comments to this tweet, but I've not sifted through it yet.
