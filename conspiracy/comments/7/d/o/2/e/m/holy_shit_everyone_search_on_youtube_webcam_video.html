        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This will work with &quot;Webcam video from (Month)&quot;.
All of these videos are random videos of children.
I know what you&#39;re thinking- &quot;These are just videos that random kids posted on youtube without a title, so the date was put instead&quot;</p>

<p>Sure, that does make sense. But what doesn&#39;t make sense is the amount of views each of these videos have</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DJJarTIyXs">This one</a> of a little girl playing with her dollhouse, for example, has over ONE MILLION VIEWS. 
This is not normal for some random video that no one should care about, right?</p>

<p>What is even more disturbing are some of the videos in the &quot;suggested&quot; sidebar. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lxCMhZKSrU">This one here</a> is one of them.
Over SIX MILLION VIEWS for this little girl twirling in a dress. One comment even states a time stamp to see up her dress.</p>

<p>Let me know what you all think.</p>

<p>Edit: Descriptions to videos</p>

<p>Edit 2: Holy crap my first Gold?! Thank you kind stranger!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t? So I didn&#39;t just have 2 FBI guys here and 4 cops because I said I was going to (vague threat) on Twitter, got retweeted by a verified user with 60k followers and multiple people said they sent it to the tip line. About 3 days passed and they were here, my choices were either be arrested, or get a mental evaluation at the hospital. Did the hospital thing, almost got admitted, was there for 5 hours. They follow up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disabling saving cookies and stuff might help with kids being recommended this stuff but I believe Youpuke keeps their own info server side. If you want to be &quot;okayish&quot; anonymous you download Tails operating system. You can erase everything on a computer and operating system and use the flash drive to do basic computer stuff.</p>

<p>Tor helps, having multiple VPN&#39;S to connect to is what is really needed for good protection. Tails, Tor, VPNs is the way to have half assed anonymous browsing. But they have passed laws to circumvent Tor protection legally. So you can choose every web browser that tracks everything from keys typed, mouse position, what you click on, how long you were there, how long you watched or looked at any picture. Basically anything. Xkeyscore is a pain too, there&#39;s no real hiding anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly......Leads me to the conclusion that they aren&#39;t just allowing this, but endorsing it and encouraging it, I haven&#39;t checked but I&#39;d hazard a guess some of the videos even have adverts on. There&#39;s these videos, the elsagate ones, and the videos of young Thai girls getting interviewed by American men about how they are willing to be &#39;good friends&#39; with &#39;any age man&#39;. It&#39;s truly disgusting. </p>

<p>At this point, our question should be <em>why</em> is YouTube complacent with this? ..instead of <em>are</em> YouTube complacent with this...because it is glaringly obvious they&#39;re ignoring the reports of certain videos whilst immediately rendering videos that don&#39;t fit their sociopolitical paradigm as &#39;restricted&#39; or demonetising them. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>They are an FBI honeypot operation.  Click on two many of these vids and you get put on an FBI pedo watchlist.    </p></li>
<li><p>Disney is making some of these videos with the intention of making parents regard youtube as not child safe, so that parents will stop letting their kids watch youtube.  Why?  Because youtube is direct competition to Disney for childrens content.  Kids aren&#39;t that discerning.  They&#39;re just as content to watch Youtube as Disney&#39;s streaming service, so if you&#39;re a parent why shell out the money for the Disney channel?  Because youtube is dangerous for kids.</p></li>

It was seen on the Sunday night Walt Disney Show/The Wonderful World of Disney(name?) back in the 1960s.  It showed the naked backside of a toddler with the song lyrics: Turn around, turn around....  I was a kid at the time and thought it was just some new kind of progressive open mindedness.  So Disney has never been the wholesome, clean, family friendly company it seems to be.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, projection much? J/k</p>

<p>You make a good point. A clearnet honeypot would be a good way. But this is too big, too many normies seeing this shit and reporting en masse. We aren&#39;t going to get V&amp; over reporting kid fuckers to the FBI. But it&#39;s not looking good for you continually telling us to stop looking because it&#39;s bad.</p>

<p>That would be the suspcious behavior I would look at if I were running a honeypot. Following your logic you are making yourself look bad.</p>

But spreading the knowledge that these platforms are abused for this still is at least an effort to fight it. A lot of these video&#39;s are still monetized.

Videos that do depict children in a sexual manner often hide behind the excuse that they are <em>family oriented videos</em>. This is how much content is allowed to slide undetected.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree these videos are no bueno obviously. It is just speculation, but I am starting to think a lot of these creepy videos are honeypot traps set by the FBI or related agencies. I recently was checking out articles how the FBI secretly took control of a tor site trading CP and kept it up to gain info on it&#39;s &#39;subscribers&#39;. I guess you could argue if it helps catch some of these assholes then that&#39;s a good thing. Then again, with the different languages of these comments makes me lean that it&#39;s real creeps signaling to other creeps to get their perverted jollies on. Either way, I&#39;d obviously prefer this shit not be out there. Even if it is an FBI honeypot, the potential of kids seeing this stuff and getting into thinking this is okay behavior is of greater concern to me.</p>

<p>LOL, yeah the FBI is going to come knocking. No one is going to get flagged for looking at content already on youtube. They will go after the channel. No need to create a false panic and scare potential researchers away. If anything we need more eyes on this content so the word can be spread. Plus the vast majority don&#39;t know how bad it really is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious what your opinion is, one of the suggested videos was actually a video I saw posted yesterday, and it occurred to me that all posts like this really do it make it easier for perverts to find shit like this. </p>

<p>The suggested videos are because so many places on the internet trying to oust perverts, while basically they help create the algorithm by linking plain videos of kids doing random shit that perverts around the world probably like.</p>

<p>I mean look at the comments in that post I linked, someone points out the videos themselves are kids being kids, and they get attacked. It&#39;s the comments on the videos that need to be reported, the videos themselves really just seem like random shit.</p>

<p>I guess my ultimate question is why are posts like this allowed, when it&#39;s likely just creating a roadmap for actual predators? You made a good point to report shit to the FBI, but it&#39;s not the videos that are the issue, it&#39;s the people watching them.. and I feel like all these posts actually do is point the perverts in the right direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair most perverts aren&#39;t coming to r/conspiracy looking for leads, there&#39;s better places on the internet for that but you make a fair point all the same.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that maybe censoring it isn&#39;t the right choice, but I am willing to bet pizzagate kind of posts is on their radar(face it, perverts are everywhere). Also, these kinds of posts are linking these kids videos (changing the algorithm) to whatever else people here have viewed, which is likely elsagate and other twisted stuff. These videos are now more likely to be in the related section.</p>

<p>The only thing that really bothers me about this is most of those videos seem to be uploaded by the kids themselves, and if anyone here comments on the videos they may not be realizing they&#39;re literally talking to the kids. Maybe you can put that in your stickied comment so people at least realize that, because anything they might say might traumatize them even more.</p>

<p>In the end, I feel bad for these kids that they live in a world full of weirdos, and they can&#39;t just be kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube is full of innocent videos of girls, uploaded by people who aren&#39;t related to them and shouldn&#39;t have any interest in them, with people openly exchanging child porn in the comment sections. It&#39;s been this way for ages. There must be millions of people involved.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some comments from a video <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> hasn&#39;t already flooded</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/9XknDmh.png">https://i.imgur.com/9XknDmh.png</a></p>

<p>The top comment translates as</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;I have material C.P .... add me to a group ..... 442 456 0235 .... gracias&quot; - C. P. means child porn for <strong>CERTAIN</strong> That&#39;s followed by things like</p>

<p>&quot;I change by gmail I have several of long duration <a href="mailto:angelito15777@gmail.com">angelito15777@gmail.com</a>&quot;</p>

<p>and &quot;I only exchange by mail ... most of my material are type ls models, photos and videos of long duration (<a href="mailto:johnatan_a_l@hotmail.com">johnatan_a_l@hotmail.com</a>)&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>This isn&#39;t unusual. It also isn&#39;t unusual for people to comment inappropriate timestamps, or to creep on the girls. I&#39;ve Googled the emails and numbers people leave, and they are DEFINITELY trading child porn.</p>

<p>I searched <a href="mailto:johnatan_a_l@hotmail.com">johnatan_a_l@hotmail.com</a> and came up with DON&#39;T CLICK IF YOU DON&#39;T WANT TO BE ON A GOVERNMENT WATCH LIST <a href="https://sak3lc.org/ls-magazine/">https://sak3lc.org/ls-magazine/</a>. Check the comments. It&#39;s an article detailing a busted child porn creator, and people are openly trading the videos in the comments.</p>

<p>There is absolutely zero legal explanation for any of this. It isn&#39;t like ElsaGate. People use YouTube as a child porn exchange platform. People upload what isn&#39;t legally child porn but which is effectively used that way to YouTube too. Can we do something about this? I don&#39;t think the media&#39;s ever covered it. It&#39;s not even a conspiracy theory: it&#39;s undeniable fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, social acceptance has a lot to do with it. In Greece it was considered ok to be gay. So lots more gay stuff. In biblical times it was ok to marry a fourteen year old. So whatever,  different times.</p>

<p>As far as taking the shame out of sexuality,  that should be ok in my opinion.
However,  the line we see today in modern society is all things consensual,  which I think is a healthy attitude. You&#39;ll never see rape nor pedophilia become acceptable in the mainstream. We&#39;re seeing a purge of harasses now, which shows how even the actual harassment that was commonplace as recently as the 80&#39;s is not being tolerated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;sexual freedom.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a <em>lack</em> of &quot;sexual discipline.&quot;</p>

<p>Discipline, when truly from within, leads to prosperity and happiness. </p>

<p>Think of it this way: what if we decided we should be free to defecate wherever we wanted? And not to be able to do so was inhibiting our freedom? Imagine streets filled with people doing exactly that.</p>

<p>We need to eliminate the end product of our digestion, so we can&#39;t say defecation is bad. Just like sex isn&#39;t bad. </p>

<p>But undisciplined sexuality can be like undisciplined hygiene. </p>

<p>Anyway, discipline and virtue lead to happiness.</p>

<p>But it has to be self-discipline, not something imposed like a whip from outside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there&#39;s something weird going on, especially with the second video. These videos shouldn&#39;t be part of the YouTube algorithm. The only thing I&#39;m wondering is maybe it&#39;s kids who have uploaded videos without a title and it&#39;s automatically just labelled Webcam etc, however the people viewing some of these videos are not young kids. Either way YouTube has fucked up if they let their algorithms appeal to pesos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been a long time and I don&#39;t really want to go there right now. Especially after conversing with my daughter. But it also has strengthened my resolve to expose them. Ehh, I did stumble across how they look at shit on archive sites. A way to avoid IP tracking I imagine. I reported that to the FBI but they probably already knew.</p>

<p>They archive google image searches, thumbnails, anything they deem worthy, It was literal CP. Not any sex acts, but fuck that I wasn&#39;t going deeper than that. This is a huge problem. </p>

<p><a href="https://getwatcher.net/">https://getwatcher.net/</a> This website is for helping score digits on image boards.</p>

<p>I noticed clicking on obscure forums no one would ever know of but high traffic yielding some kind of pedo picture trading scheme. They would say shit like &quot;Got any Maine&quot; or other states. These pedo&#39;s are so knowledgeable about their potential victims they can request certain names even. I also reported that to the FBI, again, they probably already knew. Sometimes the thread started with a picture of a State. From there they asked for towns and or direct names. They probably know which victims they can browse by state and local municipality. It&#39;s fucking revolting!!! OMG I want to dig my eyes out sometimes. I haven&#39;t seen anything truly horrible since my early 4chan days almost 10 years ago. Browsing /b/ some fucking sick fuck posted a picture of a baby girl with a screwdriver inserted by the handle.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that shit is still out there. Let&#39;s mass report all. I already see idiots commenting on the videos screaming about Sicko, you&#39;re going down blah blah. TOtally blowing the cover of any real citizen investigation. Perhaps it is on purpose. Sigh.</p>

<p>The second video. Well it is innocent enough too, but the suggested videos look appalling and 6,000,000 views is pretty big for a random kid singing, unless it went viral in her country or something.

    <div class="md"><p>After searching a bit I&#39;ve found them sexualizing children. Even the mom coaches the kid on certain positions to make. Young Russian rhythmic gymnastics is one of the pedo hangouts. There is like this channel or Mix that has tons of young asian girls doing girating dances  like a grown woman. I don&#39;t really want to go farther. Guys this is legit advertising kids. There are innocents in every group but they are the minority.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending it, but there was a <strong>logical</strong> explanation, in that there are a lot of webcam software that will automatically upload to YouTube given your credentials.</p>

<p>Obviously there may be some less friendly content, and I&#39;m not going to go searching for it, but if it&#39;s the same phenomena as last time, you&#39;re not going to find much in the way of kids exposing themselves or anything. You&#39;d have to search pretty hard for that.</p>

<p>People jumping on the bandwagon without thinking things through are the reason innocent kids are becoming sexualized for being stupid, and simply acting like kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason those videos have to many views is simple.
A few years ago this was a big deal all over the internet, so a bunch of people started spreading awareness about it and a bunch of us from the sub went and reported and flagged a ton of those videos, some even made troll videos pretending to be those videos of kids but instead just called them perverts.
So now, a few years later.. these videos that werent taken down all of the sudden have millions of views.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention thus far that there are popular videos, and recently downloaded videos shown at the bottom of the webpage from that specific website (so when I downloaded pornhub vids, it showed me other pornhub vids that are popular, and have been recently downloaded).</p>

<p>One day I thought about using it to download a youtube video. I happened to take a quick look at the popular and recently downloaded videos and I shut off my browser and deleted my history and decided to take the 2 minutes to create bogus accounts on pornsites to download videos. </p>

I think Pyrocynical made one where he talked about this, I can‘t remember the other channel‘s names. Anyways, he said that this is probably some „low-radar“ kind of ring or group on Youtube who upload these videos that they found or obtained by tricking children into doing these seemingly harmless things on webcam. The trick is that apparently you only find those videos by searching those exact words („webcam video from“). As I said, that was already some time ago and I thought that these youtubers raised awareness and Youtube banned those videos. Guess I was wrong, that‘s some really messed up stuff though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The newest youtube scam.  People upload random video, then link it in a pop-under ad.  So When you open a site with pop-ups or pop-unders, it&#39;ll open youtube and autoplay the video.  That&#39;s how these weird videos score so high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been a long time and I don&#39;t really want to go there right now. Especially after conversing with my daughter. But it also has strengthened my resolve to expose them. Ehh, I did stumble across how they look at shit on archive sites. A way to avoid IP tracking I imagine. I reported that to the FBI but they probably already knew.</p>

<p>They archive google image searches, thumbnails, anything they deem worthy, It was literal CP. Not any sex acts, but fuck that I wasn&#39;t going deeper than that. This is a huge problem. </p>

<p><a href="https://getwatcher.net/">https://getwatcher.net/</a> This website is for helping score digits on image boards.</p>

<p>I noticed clicking on obscure forums no one would ever know of but high traffic yielding some kind of pedo picture trading scheme. They would say shit like &quot;Got any Maine&quot; or other states. These pedo&#39;s are so knowledgeable about their potential victims they can request certain names even. I also reported that to the FBI, again, they probably already knew. Sometimes the thread started with a picture of a State. From there they asked for towns and or direct names. They probably know which victims they can browse by state and local municipality. It&#39;s fucking revolting!!! OMG I want to dig my eyes out sometimes. I haven&#39;t seen anything truly horrible since my early 4chan days almost 10 years ago. Browsing /b/ some fucking sick fuck posted a picture of a baby girl with a screwdriver inserted by the handle.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that shit is still out there. Let&#39;s mass report all. I already see idiots commenting on the videos screaming about Sicko, you&#39;re going down blah blah. TOtally blowing the cover of any real citizen investigation. Perhaps it is on purpose. Sigh.</p>
