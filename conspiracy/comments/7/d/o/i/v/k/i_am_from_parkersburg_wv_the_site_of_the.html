        Gif of Warehouse as it burned in Parkersburg, WV
       </a>
      </p>
      <pre><code> The warehouse that caught fire was an abandoned building on Old Camden Avenue. It was an Ames tool warehouse before it was shut down and bought some time after by a man named Jeffrie D'Costa. D'Costa was a former supervisor for the Little Hocking DuPont facility. 

 In 2015 D'Costa pled guilty to charges of "fraud and swindling". Acts which he had committed between 2009-2012, as an employee for DuPont, resulted ultimately in the theft of $550,000 from his employer.

 D'Costa had some sort of legal agreement with DuPont (lease/contract) that allowed the company to store chemicals, which they could not otherwise legally dispose of, in the warehouse. 

 D'Costa did not maintain proper standards of storage for this facility with these chemicals       

 They regularly leaked out of their containers and were exposed to the elements, and each other. 

  On October 21, 2017 the old Ames warehouse caught fire, and the chemicals which were all stored there were burned and released into the air for approximately 5 or 6 days in total. An air quality warning was issued over the city. Over 6 surrounding local fire departments were called in to battle the flames. When local news sources attempted to get a statement from D'Costa about the his storage methods and the cause of the fire, they were informed that D'Costa had left the country for an undisclosed amount of time, to an undisclosed location. 

 Fast forward several weeks, and D'Costa files an insurance claim seeking monetary compensation for the loss of the warehouse. 

 I cannot say for certain what actually happened. However, my theory is that D'Costa burned down his own warehouse to get the insurance payout. I'm not entirely sure of the nature of his relationship with DuPont, this could have been a way for D'Costa to repent to his former employer for stealing from them. I.e. He gets rid of their chemicals for them since they can't OR he could be angry at them for catching him stealing, and hope to implicate them in this tragedy. Either way people need to know what DuPont does to the communities in which they operate. 

 When I was in elementary school there was a city wide blood test that people partook in. If an individuals blood had high enough concentrations of C8, DuPont would pay $400 to that individual as compensation for years of drinking tainted water. This fire is not the first major transgression that DuPont has engaged in, in my community. It is time for the public to educate themselves on the dealings of massive corporations, their employees, and the politicians they donate to. WAKE UP.

       The revealing part is that D'Costa is affiliated with IEI. online everything just says IEI owned the warehouses but you can't find anything out about IEI besides their CEO who isn't D'Costa. Also, the fact that D'Costa was out of the country after the fire, and draws attention to the fact that the fire might not have been a result of JUST negligence, but rather an arson aimed at claiming insurance payouts.

       And It says wake up because most people in my town do not understand the full situation and believe that the fire was entirely accidental. DuPont also has been doing this type of thing for years in places across the globe. So we need to wake up and stop letting this corporation (and others like it) to corrupt our political sphere and harm our communities.

       I have posted sources for all of my claims except the claim that D'Costa was out of the country immediately after the fire. Still looking for the news article I read. It seems to have almost disappeared or something...

       This is a random comment, OP. But have you ever heard of Summit Betchel Reserve? its a giant outdoor camping area owned by the BSA (boy scouts of america.) however it is actually a secret and GIANT underground base. The only other people that i know of who are aware of this are the locals, which is why im asking you.

       Whoa.

      <p>
       Maybe 15 years ago was driving back from a trip and got off at an exit around there at maybe 3am to look for food/gas. Took a wrong turn and suddenly some headlights turned on and started following us. I always wondered about that, it was so weird, and we were so sketched out that we just went back to the interstate and tried the next exit.

       Frankly, I still kind of think it was a weird run-in with some illegal drug-farm, or just paranoia. But that is exactly where the weirdness happened. Take it or leave it.

       To answer your question, yes I do know the place. I have driven past it probably 4 times in the last month while I was Traveling to Beckley, WV. It is a massive piece of land that can only be seen in a few places from the road Bc the trees cover most of the actual reserve up from the interstate. That is actually where Trump went to address the BSA this year. Could be very well be of no coincidence that the president was at this place that may contain a secret bunker/base of some sort. The part of the state that it is located in (largely the center part of WV) has a very low population and a lot of mountains covered in woods. It would be very easy to hide something there off of any of the unmapped dirt roads.

       The underground places are always secret. When people have been living/ working in or visiting these type of places they never fail to be shocked when they find out. 
I was no different, I had no idea. This was a massive corporate place in the city of London.

       I went to the BSA camp as a camper, live in the area (but 50 mins away) and I can at least confirm numerous amounts of humvee/military jeep type vehicles traversing the roadways around this campground at late nights with the lights off, as anecdotal evidence one summer at camp, friend and I went out wandering around in the middle of the night and found ourselved on a dirt-backroad. figured we would walk along it until the next intersection and turn left (back toward camp) and then go back to our tents, as we walked we heard a large vehicle coming up behind us, looked... not lights anywhere (fairly curvy road so no terribly surpising at first), we moved off the road, the vehicle got close enough we saw the darker outline and nope... no head-lights, It got up on us (we were just standing on the side of the "road" and it stopped and some-dude with headgear (i'm guessing night-vision) tilted up on his head, said you boy's best turn around b4 your troupe leader finds you and you get sent home... As a local I can also confirm an usual ammout of militaresque helicopter traffic that is unexplained

       UPDATE: My close friend who is an Eagle Scout thinks that it would make sense for an underground bunker to be there, and to be kept secret since the bunker under the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulfur Springs, WV has been debunked. No pun intended.
