       When you want to discredit something, you need to bring in the big guns: Jim Carrey, Roseanne Barr, and Charlie Sheen are happy to bring your movement down to their level.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are not activist.  They are not your friends.  They don't care about your cause.  But, they will pull out all the stops to make you believe they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Mueller is also not a friend of this country.  He and Roseanne Barr both played their own rolls in covering up 9/11 attacks.  If you think Mueller is a good guy, look back at what he did to Steven Hatfill.  Go ask Steven what he thinks of Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, Trump is a good guy, and I want to believe, but we've seen this schtick before.

       Yeah, it's the same BS existential ideology from the matrix.

       Right or wrong, existentialism is a recipe for failure.  It's like how to brainwash and make a degenerate by mumbling BS.

       I think it could be cover for details about how he is kind of a piece of shit for dumping an ex he gave STDs for. She killed her self as a result and the ex boyfriend is suing Jim Carey.

       Roseanne has been an activist for years. It's been much more who she is as a person in the last decade than an actress. You notice much going on with her career any time recently? Hollywood has never favoured those who speak out too loudly.

       You would have an anxiety attack if you knew the full truth.  That is if you believed it.  Not trying to say I'm better than you or anything, it's just that I've been living this for most of my life.  Im not talking about

       Lots of people know many parts of the truth.  Most of it will never be disclosed for "national security" purposes.  Pedophilia in Hollywood is just the tip of the iceberg.  9/11 was more than a terrorist attack, false flag, or attempt to cover up the "misappropriation" of funds.

       Not a simulation.  Everything is very real.  Don't worry, it won't help or change anything.  Focus on your family, friends, coworkers, neighbors, etc.   That is where life happens.  Hang out with us "crazy people" when you have free time ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       No Lizard people.  God is real.  The Devil is real.  Jesus is real and defeated grave.  The Great War was won on that day, but the battle rages on.  Satan has "run" the world for millennia.  Remember Satan offered Jesus all of the kingdoms of the world if he would worship him?  The enemy here is so much more experienced, knowledgeable, and capable than any Rothschild or any of their supposed "family."  They are owned and controlled.  They are given the illusion of control in return for their obedience.  They are the real puppets.  They've been deceived, but in a different way than normal people have been deceived.
      </p>
      <p>
       They lie about reality and then construct higher levels of reality on top of the base lie.  To recruit they will "wake you up" by revealing this higher level of reality that they made up.  They will keep this going until they get what they want.  All of the levels are absolute horse shit.  The money and the fear they will attempt to give you is real though.  As you do their bidding they sit back and laugh.  They're pissed off, bored, and angry as can be.  Did I mention they lost the war?
      </p>
      <p>
       So they will occupy complete cities and slowly pick apart the unassuming because they don't know everyone is a part of a secret society, intelligence organization, or whatever.  There are multiple levels of secret societies, and the top level is known to the others yet the lower levels only know about the top or a couple others.  This compartmentalizes them and also allows the subservient groups to pretend that they are superior to others.  It also keeps them from coming together to overthrow the top rings.  I did say they were experienced.  The pitch they like to use is being a part of something.  It is usually after you have been entrapped and have no other option than to take their offer.  If you don't submit and buy into it then they have a thousand different ways to make you or get rid of you. (Or so they thought)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, should I continue or do you think I am full of shit?

       I'm not apologizing for her, I tend to believe that she's all hype especially since she is referencing a questionable 4chan larp. But that's irrelevant to your argument that just because she's an actor, her motives are not pure. The facts are this isn't the first time she's come out against the Hollywood cabal.

      <p>
       And clearly you have a preexisting hatred against her, which I think is a bit strange.
