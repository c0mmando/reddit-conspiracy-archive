<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Iran is a much more natural ally than Saudi Arabia. Saudis are a client state of the British and should be stolen to acquire leverage against the Chinese/British model.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We suggest that Trump allow Russia to finish off ISIS, cuts off western funding for them, and stages a soft coup in Saudi Arabia to turn them into a US rather than British client state and use the new possession as leverage against China. No military campaign necessary, trade negotiations with China become incredibly easy, and US / Russian economies are both revitalized as the other two of the top 3 big petro powers.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t care who is the face of the policy.</p>

<p>High Level Insider ID:ajZlAZ9P Thu 01 Sep 2016 </p>

<p>Trump would like to topple Saudi Arabia. That would cause a more significant production drop than is desired though, so places like Venezuela will need to be simultaneously stabilized enough to ramp up production. Bringing Venezuela and Iran into full production while cutting the taps in Saudi Arabia is about right for the effect they want.
 High Level Insider ID:VemQdR6V Thu 01 Sep 201</p>

<p>Donald wants to hit Saudi Arabia. Hillary wants to push into the central stans.</p>

<p>High Level Insider ID:DZUwTGfD Thu 25 Aug 2016 </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many significant families involved with the Federal Reserve. Several banking houses that go back to Venice, the Dutch and British royalty.</p>

<p>No aliens.</p>

<p>Hillary is the regime&#39;s preferred candidate. They are willing to go with Trump and start a major depression after he gets into office to discredit nationalism though.</p>

<p>Global conflict coming down the line has a lot to do with who gets selected in America this year. Trump wants war with Saudi Arabia and alliance with Russia; Clinton wants more proxy wars against Russia and friendly relationships with China.</p>

<p>His plan is to have a war with Saudi Arabia and a detente with Russia, throwing China under the bus. Higher petro prices would be good for US economy (energy is the only growth industry over the last decade of any significance) but his opposition will tank the economy with financial shenanigans if he is elected and attempt to punish the public severely for refusing to accept Clinton.</p>

<p>Hillary would like to end the US reserve status via SCO strengthening. Trump wants to cut a deal with Russia to knock out Saudi Arabia, send petro prices back up, and use that to rent extract on China / weaken their economy.</p>

<p>The Saudi establishment will be allowed to evacuate the country, assume new identities, and live a quiet but decadent life. Those who refuse the deal would be taken out.</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Disappearance? There was just a crash, 8 dead -no survivors.</p>

<p>No explanation given from the interior ministry either. Mansour was the son of a former crown Prince.. and no official statement on the manner he sided.. How odd?</p>

<p>Only vague reports of the helicopter being near the Yemen border and <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/saudi-prince-killed-helicopter-carrying-11473811">past occasions </a>  when the Yemenis have used rockets..</p>

<p>They don’t explicitly state it, but the conclusion they want you to arrive at is glaring</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Prince Mansour bin Muqrin was killed by Yemeni rockets</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>If the Saudis had definitive evidence, it was Yemenis, (as indeed they would given they recovered bodies, wreckage etc) they’d have proclaimed so with great pomp and fanfare no doubt, in an attempt to provide some much needed justification for their current military campaign against the impoverished nation.</p>

<p>So yeah, I’d say the mysterious, unexplained death of the son of former Crown Prince, taking place the day after a public purge of senior royals, was most likely an assassination. </p>

<p>Given the rest of the royals &amp; notables were apprehended unharmed, we can reliably infer Prince Mansour:</p>

<p>A) Didn’t like the terms offered 
B ) As the son of a former crown prince, was considered too dangerous to be left alive, in case rival factions used him as a figurehead to strengthen their schemes for power.</p>

<p>I’m nowhere near well versed on the mechanics &amp; intrigue of the house of Saud as a should be.. but I do know about the “Get Down or Lay Down” proposition... (Escobar had his version “Plomo o Plata”... )</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>The subject is pretty vast but if someone wants something tangible and interesting on ET phenomena, check out the day after Roswell.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just about done listening to it and it&#39;s blown me away.</p>

<p>The book is written by Col. Philip Corso and he worked at the pentagon and various military positions as information and technology officer. He directly reported to general Trudeau.</p>

<p>Not only did the Roswell crash happen, a lot of technology was retrieved. From these artefacts that were taken, came the technologies of lasers, night vision, Kevlar bullet proof vests, and certain fiber optics as well as integrated circuits that replaced vacuum tubes. These are all admitted and more in this book of his that reads like an autobiography of his life and work.</p>

<p>He even saw a Gray from the crash first hand after it was shipped to (Fort Wiley I think it was? Can&#39;t remember) </p>

<p>Anyway, very, very, very interesting listen/read</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ETs have never came into contact with Earth nor ever will. Life alone on planets is extremely rare and practically impossible and Earth may only be the 1 in 1 trillionth chances of life ever happening in the universe alone.</p>

<p>Also even if life was more abundant it would rarely ever live long enough to evolve past single-cell organisms, then even if <em>that</em> were to happen the possibility for intelligent life is even slimmer. Than the possibility that they would be able to create technology of space flight is slimmer. Now factor in the large possibility that light-speed will never be surpassed means even if the 1 in 100 trillion chances of intelligent life exists, we will never meet them do to being in such large distances away from them, not even light-speed tech can ever reach us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every number is a guestimate when it comes to life since we only have one control (Earth). Also just because they are earth-like doesn&#39;t mean that they will support life. For all we know life could be much rarer than 1 in a billionth chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can think what you want, but you should know the astronomers who study this as part of their careers disagree with you. There is plenty of evidence that ETs have been on earth, if you take the time to look for it. As to why they don&#39;t openly communicate with the public, there are a few plausible explanations, namely the chaos would ensue as practically all people would have their fundamental beliefs shattered. It would be wiser (and appropriate) for them to let us accept their presence before actually making themselves known to the world at large. Our world leaders are already aware of their existence, but have kept this knowledge secret for their own benefit. They can&#39;t keep the cat in the bag forever though, the truth will eventually come out. I would advise you to do more research on the subject before coming to such a concrete conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly believe there is a lot of manipulation on the part of the more malevolent ETs, but there is also a lot of collaboration between these beings and world leaders. Then you have archons, the nasty energy-sucking parasites that feed off our negative emotions, but I wouldn&#39;t classify them as ETs per say. More like astral entities. Unlike many others I also think there are benevolent ETs that are working to rid our planet of this corruption, but at this time are unwilling to show themselves in part due to the meltdown of society that would likely occur given our current, very narrow mindset. We need to ease into it, otherwise there would be total chaos. I wish there was more discussion on this subject here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it&#39;s a topic that is super interesting and wide-ranging in scope, and I loveee discussing it with people. Hopefully the mass arrests of our corrupt leaders will happen sooner than later and will quickly transition into disclosure of the real nature of life in the universe.</p>

Things like the US and Britain funding the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar">Nazis</a>, Freemasons starting World War I and the Civil War, the <a href="http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/venices-war-against-western-civilization/">Venetian</a> perfection of the international usury system and its subsequent export to the Netherlands and England after the near disaster of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_League_of_Cambrai">War of the League of Cambrai</a>, and so on.</p>

<p>Work in finance or something? Ok, here&#39;s an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/dec/13/drug-money-banks-saved-un-cfief-claims">article</a> describing hundreds of billions of dollars in drug money being used to bail out the banks during the financial crisis. A pretty reasonable conclusion then is that the financial statements of large banks are completely fake and they launder drug money routinely.</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t Iran a natural to the US, assuming the US wants to move against the bankers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q talks about freemasons, Nazis and their backchannel funding and British Royalty.  Not so much civil war though.</p>

<p>I am sure the government has way more cash than we could ever imagine.  Financial statements of banks are accurate.  They are odd because debt is measured as assets versus credit.  They also move their money around which makes it a challenge.  Banks are regulated on AML.  It&#39;s not easy to catch but firms like non profits are where money gets laundered.  </p>

<p>US wants to move against corruption like the FED and Rothschild.  Iran is a country with problems and has been abused by US.  They could not impact our economy like Saudi and Russia.  They could make an ally but not anytime soon. Too much for me to explain my opinion here but certainly don&#39;t see it being natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banks trade publically.  Sure some off shore banks can launder money but in the US they better launder through their clients before laundering in their institution.  HSBC paid a massive loss for laundering.  Sure it happens indirectly but they are monitored closely and spend a shit load to comply.  Some have over 5000 investigators tracking transactions.</p>

<p>Casinos are 1 source but being a donor to a non profit who is loosely  regulated is a better option.  There are 1000s of ways to launder money.  Banks and Casinos are watched and if you need constant laundering it would put you at risk to go to them each time.  Not saying they don&#39;t, just saying non profits are less risk.</p>

Not sure of this question.  Are you assuming that CIA is using banks to launder their drug money and in the 2008 crisis we used that money to bail out the banks? So CIA paid for the bailout? </p>

<p>Antonio Maria Costa, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, said he has seen evidence that the proceeds of organised crime were &quot;the only liquid investment capital&quot; available to some banks on the brink of collapse last year. He said that a majority of the $352bn (£216bn) of drugs profits was absorbed into the economic system as a result.&quot;</p>

<p>I’ve been on the same line of thinking since the anons disappearance.</p>

<p>One suspicion is that they were there to put pressure on Trump to comply with their policy demands with all the material they were posting about his past. The trump mud slinging in msm is one thing but the detailed source backed narrative CS presented was making waves in a way the “trump is a nazi” failed to emulate.</p>

<p>But given the plethora of decidedly anti - humanist policies he’s passed in the same period, the notion trump is now 100% swinging for Team-Humanity as opposed to oligarchical faction that put him in power, is questionable.</p>

<p>There’s a few others I’ve been entertaining but that’s the most complete...</p>

<p>Keen to hear any thoughts you’re comfortable divulging on a public forum..</p>

<p>Re- Alphabet Boys- if I’m on the radar to the extent my communication is worth monitoring and being subsequently acted on, any ability I have to to adequately counter such surveillance, is negated by my adversaries resources &amp; reach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post-it is helpful to read ALL of High Level Insiders posts and questions asked. This makes the most sense to me versus the hype that Trump is secretly dismantling the NWO- though I cross my fingers. He mentions, &quot;US establishment is rallying around the idea of a war with Saudi Arabia. Trump and Clinton are both behind this idea. Trump might actually have an easier time selling it. The democrats have some interest in letting Trump be the one to do this.&quot; and alludes to the theatrics of the left/right paradigm but mainly being on the same page but with different ways going about the agenda. But, then I don&#39;t understand if it&#39;s just theatrics, why Trump would go that hard against the Clinton clan to wear we all want heads to roll. That makes me think maybe Trump kinda double fucked the Dems/CIA and mainline Reps and is going a little off the script? Or maybe the theater of it all is just that genius. Wtf do I know though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I realize it was from last year. I thought the point was if this is an insider who is predicting happenings in the present, then you use current events and reference back to the predictions/insites to see what lines up. The way Trump&#39;s people seemingly want to go after Hillary for crimes and the way the media think Trump is Hitler  didn&#39;t make sense to me if they are really behind the scenes on the same team pushing for ultimately the same agenda. If it&#39;s ALL really just political theater, then I would wonder why they would push so hard as to really mess with each other&#39;s lives and money.</p>

<p>Please stop using the expression &quot;prediction&quot; when discussing information provided by these insiders. That would imply they are clairvoyant people with immense psychic powers who know WHAT exactly will happen precisely WHEN. This is a totally wrong approach. Instead, consider that they represent a certain faction fighting for power, and that there are various other factions and circumstances that can greatly influence the course of events.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious it&#39;s been happening, many actions and reactions clearly visible when you read HLI&#39;s question sessions, even in retrospect. </p>

<p>Even more fascinating to watch the current events...</p>

<p>Trump is trying to do the same with the soft coup in Saudi Arabia and plans to jack up oil prices which will provide a lot more money to the US, and is certainly preferable to being merchants of death. He&#39;s also setting up cooperative international <a href="http://larouchepub.com/pr/2017/171106_goldman_cic_fund.html">deals</a> to fund infrastructure development.</p>

<p>Building a space elevator would grow the economy a lot faster, but at least Trump is trying to do things that will create growth to eventually allow moving away from an economy based on human misery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks to me that Trump is gearing up to end the Fed. Get the Saudi&#39;s on his team (MbS coup), list permanently solidify the petrodollar (Aramco listed publicly on NYSE), open more Saudi oil sales to China in order to strengthen US/China relations, reinforce the military (sign of force) and establish strong relations with Russia. </p>

<p>If he&#39;s able to put all of this in place he&#39;s got a chance at killing the Fed. The world&#39;s three most prominent energy producers, the world&#39;s largest manufacturing country, the world&#39;s largest market and the world&#39;s top militaries all trading in a gold (or whatever) backed currency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a couple of things to consider here. First of all, the Fed is essentially an institution of the elite Americans and the British. New York and the City of London. These Anglophiles like the Morgans, Rockefellers, the Bushes, etc. are behind most of the corruption of America&#39;s institutions.</p>

<p>While a gold currency can be a good thing in certain situations, it has some real problems for our current situation. We have trade deficits, so going to a gold standard would mean depleting our gold supplies. And you have to worry about the bankers cornering the gold market, which is an utter catastrophe for actual producers that need productive capital.</p>

<p>What worked best in the past was a public bank. Instead of having the Fed owned by private bankers, it is owned by the people. The credit comes from the government, who earns the interest, rather than private bankers who are using fractional reserve lending (lending money they don&#39;t have) to create the money out of thin air.</p>

<p>With a public credit system, the people that are building up the real economy (not the casino in Wall Street) would have access to cheap credit. Construction companies, transportation, farmers, hospitals and other real producers would get priority over private banks.</p>

<p>Both authors share a common timeline for the development of consciousness. I think of it as Jaynes explains the technical process of consciousness development while Neumann describes the metaphorical concepts that are articulated in the mythologies of early conscience humans. </p>

<p>Next up is Thomas Metzinger&#39;s book. He looks at consciousness with modern neuroscience perspective.</p>

<p>I figure between the three I should have a reasonable grasp on consciousness. </p>

<p>The idea is to <em>avoid</em> a violent revolution. I don&#39;t think this is very likely at all, because the military supports Trump. If it ever turned violent the military would join Trump in taking out the globalist institutions, like the CIA.</p>

<p>I agree, but consider that each of the other anons, such as Megaanon and Q have different level of &quot;clearance and are not sanctioned to tell us all they know even if they wanted.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s pretty clear that HLI was consistent across several months while Q&#39;s persona was impersonated and/or hijacked within several days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. Although my point was that the original authentic Q (time will reveal the aim of this operation) was most likely only the early one (my conservative estimate is until CBTS #80, and maybe some occasional appearances later on), but than both his &quot;identity&quot; and purpose was brutally hijacked by the tripcode Q. </p>

<p>No, not really, not going to help in making their next &quot;bread&quot; even more tasteful, and even more credible.</p>

<p>Do not misunderstand me though. The fact is that Megaanon has set a much higher bar for herself than Q anon, for example by repeating her claims about three three letters going down, and it seems to be lining up with Q.

And if Trump DID want war with Saudi Arabia, would he be signing billion dollar arms deals with Saudi Arabia? You might argue that since he&#39;s carried out this &#39;coup&#39;, he won&#39;t need to fight a war with a pro-American Saudi Arabia, but Muhammad Bin Salman is well known for his hawkish foreign policy. Under him, we&#39;ve seen Saudi Arabia carry out its war on Yemen, isolate Qatar, antagonize the Lebanese and increase the aggressive posturing against Iran. Essentially, these predictions are anything but accurate. </p>

<p>It’s no coincidence that the most ardent of skeptics of HLI, tend to be the least versed in the anons work. I just struggle to see how it’s a Larp of some sort, haven’t met anyone whose spent any time looking into this who have major doubts on their veracity.
 There’s a few details that cause contention sure, ie Obama is Osama, no aliens (discovered) etc ..but the overwhelming consensus is we’ve somehow stumbled across the Rosetta Stone of conspiracies.

<p>Disappearance? There was just a crash, 8 dead -no survivors.</p>

<p>No explanation given from the interior ministry either. Mansour was the son of a former crown Prince.. and no official statement on the manner he sided.. How odd?</p>

<p>Only vague reports of the helicopter being near the Yemen border and <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/saudi-prince-killed-helicopter-carrying-11473811">past occasions </a>  when the Yemenis have used rockets..</p>

<p>They don’t explicitly state it, but the conclusion they want you to arrive at is glaring</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Prince Mansour bin Muqrin was killed by Yemeni rockets</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>If the Saudis had definitive evidence, it was Yemenis, (as indeed they would given they recovered bodies, wreckage etc) they’d have proclaimed so with great pomp and fanfare no doubt, in an attempt to provide some much needed justification for their current military campaign against the impoverished nation.</p>

<p>So yeah, I’d say the mysterious, unexplained death of the son of former Crown Prince, taking place the day after a public purge of senior royals, was most likely an assassination. </p>

<p>Given the rest of the royals &amp; notables were apprehended unharmed, we can reliably infer Prince Mansour:</p>

<p>A) Didn’t like the terms offered 
B ) As the son of a former crown prince, was considered too dangerous to be left alive, in case rival factions used him as a figurehead to strengthen their schemes for power.</p>

<p>I’m nowhere near well versed on the mechanics &amp; intrigue of the house of Saud as a should be.. but I do know about the “Get Down or Lay Down” proposition... (Escobar had his version “Plomo o Plata”... )</p>

<p>I’ve been on the same line of thinking since the anons disappearance.</p>

<p>One suspicion is that they were there to put pressure on Trump to comply with their policy demands with all the material they were posting about his past. The trump mud slinging in msm is one thing but the detailed source backed narrative CS presented was making waves in a way the “trump is a nazi” failed to emulate.</p>

<p>But given the plethora of decidedly anti - humanist policies he’s passed in the same period, the notion trump is now 100% swinging for Team-Humanity as opposed to oligarchical faction that put him in power, is questionable.</p>

<p>There’s a few others I’ve been entertaining but that’s the most complete...</p>
