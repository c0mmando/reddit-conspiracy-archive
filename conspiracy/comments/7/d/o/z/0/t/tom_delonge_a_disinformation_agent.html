        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello everyone, i don&#39;t usually post in here but tonight i wanted to get your views on Tom Delonge. </p>

<p>After watching the Joe Rogan Experience with him as a guest, im convinced he is made to put out disinformation in matters regarding ufos and extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>According to the book &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;</p>

<p>Willam Cooper mentions how the cia puts out disinformation to confuse the public, to keep true facts hidden. Will also goes on to say that there have been people similar to Tom to put out disinformation and guess what they work for the CIA.</p>

<p>With that being said i will be making an effort to put things into perspective. We deserve the truth and we will not tolerate misinformation.</p>

<p>I have nothing against Tom, but i do understand the role he is playing.</p>

<p>Why would  you get on a podcast to reveal your findings to the public, it is clearly used as misinformation to confuse the listeners. </p>

<p>The true facts are hidden, and if we found out about whats really going on, we wouldn&#39;t be able to truly digest it.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that someone like Delonge A) <em>does</em> have some relevant, factual, true ET information, <em>and</em> B) is also possibly influenced by certain groups that have a definite interest in making sure the truth about ET existence on and around this planet is kept as under wraps as possible.</p>

<p>He&#39;s like Dr. Steven Greer lite.  Dr. Greer has done more for the popularization of legitimization of ET truth than almost anyone in current times, but he himself I don&#39;t doubt has been undermined and compromised to some extent or another by powerful groups, and there are a SSSHHHHIIIIT ton of haters constantly buzzing around him.</p>

<p>Again, Delonge is Dr. Greer lite.  Delonge is legitimate in certain areas, but I don&#39;t doubt he&#39;s been given information by some groups that want to keep the truth hidden.</p>

<p>Regardless, it doesn&#39;t really matter.  He&#39;s only one person.  One should never put all their focus on just one person anyway as it regards this issue.  Listen to what he has to say, take it in, keep what&#39;s valid, discard what&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Almost nothing is &quot;all or nothing&quot;.  Everything has a little bit of everything else.  It&#39;s yin and yang.  Delonge&#39;s no different.  Don&#39;t raise him up on a pedestal, but also don&#39;t unduly vilify him.</p>

<p>He&#39;s either 100% idealistic and being used by deep state operatives, or he&#39;s 75% idealistic and 25% in it for the money (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO-hAm4g47o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO-hAm4g47o</a>).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s  a shill at all but as somebody else said; if they are planning on seeding pop culture with drops of real future tech, unless they&#39;re putting red arrows on what&#39;s what we&#39;re stuck on the guessing game.</p>

<p>Regarding the expected craft, if they deliver I&#39;ll change my mind in an instant. But they seem as uncertain about their ability to deliver as I am, according to <a href="https://youtu.be/tUOu9RpzwJI?t=38m16s">this long ass disclaimer</a> at the end of the TTSA presentation. </p>

But in the end he is a disinformation agent, the fact that he is trying to make a multmillion dollar enterprise out of it doesn&#39;t help his case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Loll exactly. It’s not that I’m questioning his intelligence or sincerity (he does seem to believe what he’s saying) and I have no problem with him having interests and investments apart from the band but I just... I don’t understand why any high level officials would be like “yup, this is the guy we’re going to tell about top secret anything”. 
I mean sure he put out a book but who hasn’t put out a book about aliens and UFOs when they’re interested? 
It’s all just so strange and if any of it’s legit, good for him but since he avoids answering most of the questions he’s asked (at least on Rogan) I think he’s probably just being used to draw people in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I understand it all of the UFO researchers that are in the public sphere today all started with a bit of credible evidence and once they had exposed that they are told to give out disinformation to muddy their own waters. I think out of many Tom’s waters are the least muddy compared to Greer or Friedman or someone like that. Listen exactly to what Tom says in everything he has done in this field. His Fade to Black interview, all of his coast to coasts and you’ll see he a bit smarter than “we found a life form, but I can’t go into it”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s intelligent enough to act dumb.. It&#39;s too convincingly, genuinely dumb! I think that when he speaks, he genuinely thinks he&#39;s onto something.. It&#39;s like a semi intelligent person who&#39;s surrounded with idiots..the semi intelligent one of the group thinks he&#39;s clever when really, he&#39;s just the least retarded of the group. The guy has no intelligence, the vocabulary of a ten year old, the intellect of a twelve year old and the gullibility of an 8 year old.. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, Tom Delonge is mentally retarded. He&#39;s not intelligent enough to act dumb.. His motivations intrigue me though. I wonder why he&#39;s coming out with this nonsense.. If anything, the disinformation agents are feeding him with info... &quot;Tom, don&#39;t tell anyone but here&#39;s the truth.. I&#39;m only telling because you&#39;re smart and you understand the situation&quot; 😑 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah I agree OP, from the beginning with his &quot;I&#39;m leaving music to follow UFO&#39;s and write a book about them&quot; (and I have &quot;special friends with Top Secret <em>stories</em>) crap, I immediately decided this <em>was</em> some kind  of Psyop that had yet to be fully fleshed out, which is why all the &quot;It&#39;s <em>coming soon</em>, Th TRUTH Disclosure is on it&#39;s way&quot; type BULLSHIT</p>

<p>IMHO he&#39;s no more than a celebrity &#39;high level partial hangout&#39; and disinfo agent ... becoz he already has a <em>devoted</em> fan base who will believe whatever he says, he&#39;s being &quot;positioned&quot; -- to do what? I have no idea. </p>
