       I’ve been telling people for years (previous logistics life) that every color, material and substance is controlled. Every bit of “thing” or Service or entertainment is given to you to consume.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every particle or even the thought of a particle or even the thought itself has been marginalized, maximized and taxed well before you come up with your brilliant idea. Now if you make something there are so many people scrutinizing the very fact that you would be so brave to do something we are made to fear being self sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s really a tormented population overall and I’d venture to say a lot of the mental conditions we see is by this fake reality laid over the top of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       We grow up being taught we revolted against the British and created a new “experiment” when in reality it was all cover for decimating the native population of North America.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s all a sham.

       I had second hand reports from an older friend whose Father was a Mason but who left and became a devout Christian. I didn't really glean much, since his father refused to talk to him or his mother about it. Though he told his Pastor everything when he joined their church. Not sure if that is helpful, but these things are kept secret for good reason, and even those initiated who decide to leave are highly selective in who they tell. My friends father only divulged his rites to their Pastor because he felt morally obligated in order to belong to their church.

       All I know is that, though they claim to be based on Christianity, and supposedly want their members to believe in a "higher power", including the Christian God, his father said that wasn't true. He believed that it was satanic. But the issue with Masons is that they only divulge a part of their right to each "Degree", and you will never make it to a 33 degree Mason unless they are positive you can be trusted, which means very few every reach the bottom of the Mason rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry I can't give more, I honestly don't know much more other than what is publicly available and that I have learned form this and similar forums. I just wanted to share what little I did know about their secrecy, and how my friends father refused to even talk about it to his family,
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       he had left if for many years.

       True but in the US they advance up the degrees fast, possibly only takes 1-5 meetings to get up to 32.

       I know several.. it’s more or less a church group of people helping one another. It is it’s own society.. they have ranks and custom uniforms and such.. but they are never bad from what I have seen personally. But with every group that other people aren’t a part of or have experienced they can and will come up with whatever story about them since they don’t have facts.

       Was in a national fraternity at a big10 school. No women in certain rooms, secret handshakes, etc. There are some guys I know who are freemasons, and am thinking about approaching them for sponsorship.

       I used to clean for a high up mason. 
The amount of guns and ammo this man had was huge. 
All old school ones that fully function still, he got then through mason friends during the Australian gun amnesty. 
He would also get us to go through his huge book cases full of mason books and other really old books. 
He had a massive and i mean massive industrial size work shop shed full of old equipment that i had never seen before. 
He offered us to borrow any book we wished, i really should of.
