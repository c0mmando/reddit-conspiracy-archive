       All has to be known in the end. Transperancy into positions of power is a matter of national security. When the murky web of poison is lifted from society and wealth is injected into it, the world will experience a mental evolutionary jump. That will lead to a high point and open the gates to the new Golden Age. Many, many good times are ahead.

       Hey did you hear Jeffrey Tambor has had a 2nd person accuse him of sexual harassment? Wow, I wonder if they'll write him out of the show. I mean, it's pretty obvious he's the reason for the shows success, it's pretty crazy the impact on Hollywood all these accusations are having. Hopefully it will lead to a healthier work environment for actors and people in the industry, it's such a huge coverup that this has been happening for years and it's only coming out now.

       I've been thinking we'll likely see a resurgence in the popularity of printed news media, though I don't think that's going to help much if companies like Sinclair are allowed to purchase every media company they can get their hands on.

       What we have to do is protect our right to create a secure, anonymous Internet to replace the one that we have now. If we lose that right then the new generation of technology that is currently being deployed will create a totalitarian nightmare. If we maintain that right, then it will be the engine of a new era as different from the last as industrialism was from agrarianism.

       I wish that the supporting analysis was as easy to state as the conclusion. I'm working on it:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Either p implies np or it doesn't. If it does then most of the existing encryption is a fail and we can confidently expect the complete collapse of society via hacking. If it doesn't then the next generation of technology is golden and the establishment will have to embrace it in order to save itself.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Networks are under the control of the people who have physical access to their nodes (~devices) and edges (~fibers, wires, frequencies). The current Internet is almost entirely under the control of the establishment because the central nodes reside in their server farms and they enjoy privileged access to its edges.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A network controls the things that it is able to identify. The point of identifying nodes is to allow them to be controlled, the point of identifying edges is to allow them to be controlled, the point of identifying people is is to allow them to be controlled.

       All that is right but to take it a step further, it’s not only about taking care of family. We need to unite as a human family and take care of each other worldwide regardless of ethnicity. That is what it takes to run a successful, wealthy planet. The selfish approach has been hammered into our heads because the cabal who ran the world was very selfish.

       We can remove the brainwashing that drives people to selfishness and educate the masses on how Planetary selfishness leads to more wealth than personal selfishness. For example, a selfish planet would never tolerate homelessness, starvation, war, tryranny, out of control income inequality, an overly complicated economy, ect..
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, service orientated people get much more in life than selfish orientated people. Giving is getting. People can have everything they want by giving what they want for themselves. What goes around comes around like a boomerang. I can carefully help a little kid understand an adult term knowing with full certainty that someone will give me that same kind of attention measure for measure on something I don’t understand in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fastest way to hell is to create a planet where everyone only worries about themselves. Being entirely selfless is bad too because sacrifice is bad. Self sacrifice is bad because the self is a person too. Therefore, a balance between self and other service has to be made with service orientation being the main stance.

       One day I will break this whole thing down in a way that will convince people without a shadow of a doubt that outwardly love to all people like a Planetary Family is absolutely the fastest way to a wealthy, happy life. We are def headed in this direction. It may not seem like it now but a lot will happen after the cabal takedown that will eventually lead to this realization.

       That is why politicians and governments want to keep us divided and dependant on them for protection. They fear us coming together....but how can we come together with the Traitors and Pedos that call themselves conservatives and Christians. Their wickedness has to be purged first.

       You should really google it yourself and wonder "why wasn't hillary declaring that she would undo one of her predecessors signature accomplishments and unilaterally declare war on iran brought up more during the election?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It just sets you up to look stupid or be hoodwinked by someone if you get into the mindset of "hillary is bad, so everything bad people tell me about her is true" It's not any better than liberals who lose their mind misinterpreting everything trump says.

       The funniest part is that they think I’m idolizing Q into a “religious figure” in my reference to the water-bearer. They think I’m calling Q the water-bearer. 😑

       Our collective consciousness has the power to change things. Discuss things in a positive light, see light shining on the dark corners of society. There is no need to bemoan the actions of these individuals any longer, the force of our conscious intent in alignment with Source transmutes the wrongdoing into positive action. The barriers to human potential have been unlocked, a golden era of humanity is on the horizon for us to create.

       Yes this is so true. I think this is perhaps where the Q posts have helped a little. People are getting excited, people are imagining the cabal takedown and a better world afterwards.

       Nope. A person posting questions on 4chan is yet another instance that shows me that the age of Aquarius is here and I interpret the water-bearer to be the bearer of knowledge and truth.

      <p>
       Water is used to clean. To nourish. To sustain life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mass awakening has been happening for a long time. The NYT stopped polling when something like 80% of American citizens believed they weren’t being told the truth about 9/11 for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing happened with JFK, but now we have this amazing piece of technology called the internet. And it’s under attack because the powers that shouldn’t be know that more people than ever are researching these topics.

       Well last week the mass media was pushing Biden 2020, so pretty relevant. But thanks to people with "confirmation bias" regarding his touching of little girls the Biden 2020 media movement fell flat on its face. So, pretty relevant

       I definitely noticed a media push for Biden 2020. Social media reacted with the creepy Biden thing. Wapo ran an op-Ed just a few days after saying that Biden 2020 was ill-advised in a post-Weinstein era. I'd give sources but I'm lazy

       Im not sure the "Creepy Biden" thing is as much of a niche conspiracy meme as it is a generally known thing. Wish i still had the links but when some democratic figure heads were reposting Biden 2020 articles last week they were lambasted by "Creepy Biden" replies. For every 1 reply of support there were 20 people posting clips of him being weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its completely unrealistic that hed be able to run with that mass-circulated video evidence of him being weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus you had an ex-secret service come out and say he had to protect women from him on some "weinstein-level stuff":

       Doubtful. I was born in the 90s so I wouldn't know. I believe in a conspiracy, regarding that, based on my own logic and independent research. I would suggest anyone reading this with an open mind to do the same.

       No, I just said Alex Jones being a charlatan is more conspiracy 101 than OKC being an inside job is conspiracy 101. A broken clock is right twice a day.

       They're so transparent. All of a sudden were supposed to believe that big government liberals are regular conspiracy buffs like the rest of us. No, we aren't shills. We're just a group of people you've never seen before who simultaneously believe in big government and believe the government is involved in misleading and murdering their own people.

       I understand your sentiment but I'd be cautious at framing it as a liberal vs conservative thing. Trust there are good peoples on both sides that want the same thing in regards of a representative and transparent government that acts according to the people's needs and views.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of these guys, I think they're intention is more focused on a dismissal of dangerous revelations as opposed to a left right battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me my right-wing brother, once we can get rid of the divisive/ binary mode of political thinking we're going to find out that both sides of regular people have more in common than in opposition

       Fair. It could easily be shills posing as leftists to create a divide in the community. Still the idea of a leftist conspiracy theorist is hilarious to me.

       I think you missed the point of this guy's post.  He's saying that it doesn't matter if he's fake or not.   That the world (well mostly America) in general are starting to question things that were previously unasked.  Not Q's questions.
       <br/>
       Even people who have never heard of the poster supposedly are "waking up".  I haven't seen it myself, but I think these reports are what he's talking about.  (in the variety of "my grandma is even saying, maybe it was the intelligence agencies" who were previously US/party line all the way.
       <br/>
       People seem to be ready to understand something more, at the very least, what he's talking about, is that people are now looking for answers instead of waiting for them to come to them (the thirst).
       <br/>
       I'm not convinced the poster is legit.  I think at best, it's someone with a great imagination, slightly better intel/information than the average joe, who is able to connect the dots to make somewhat general educated guesses.  And he's a great writer.

       I mean, that just seems like what every generation goes through. I think we said the same thing when we got TV, internet, smartphones, apps and on and on. Right now I think people are witnessing a HUGE journalistic endeavor into the presidents suspicious activities and realising from it that one of the major parties is entirely incappable. In this one administration generations are being exposed to ridiculous nepotism, blind allegiance, hardcore baseless partisan attacks, pay to play, horrible lies, and dangerous levels of gaslighting. It has been almost a year and they control the entire government and have yet to accomplish anything with it after 2 years of claiming to be a walking god.

       From what I hear, many people who are not Trump voters, did not like at all the idea of a Trump President, are becoming suspicious of the enormous amount of coverage he gets, particularly on places like CNN. People are perplexed by it. The huge journalistic endeavor you speak of is not normal. And people know that politicians are all dirty to some extent and that 'stuff goes on' to a certain degree, so the level of attention Trump has been getting and the fact that he won despite all of them saying he wouldn't - I have heard people confused about this fact and what is going on in the media. People do begin to see it as biased. All but the rabid anti-Trump lot who are just as bad as the rabid pro-Trump lot. The true awakening begins for people when they understand that there is just as much, if not more, Clinton corruption and yet that is covered up and dismissed while similar or lesser crimes from the Trump camp are seized upon and blared out constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I say that as a Democrat. I disagree with Republican policies but I can see that Clinton was an out and out criminal and the whole establishment including the media is trying to protect her. many people see that and it scares them.

       If this were true, our current corrupt admin would prosecute her, and if they aren't corrupt they would still see her crimes and fairly prosecute her but it seems even our current biased "lock her up" DOJ cannot dig the dirt to prosecute her after like 40 years of public service.

       No, you missed the point, this is the dawning of the age of people believing in absolute obvious bullshit unquestioningly. Of trolls leading the sheep because they've kept up the joke for long enough, and of those exact sheep all declaring how intelligent they are when they're genuinely, visibly, obviously being fed utterly outrageous, obvious lies. No-one has suddenly become any more clever and certainly nit anyone in this sub, including myself, that's for fucking sure.

       What the hell are you talking about "non-sources"??  You must have some fucked up perception of what reality is if you think Hilary Clinton isn't the most fucked up corrupt politician of our lives.  During the campaign it was known fact that she was colluding and taking control of the DNC to screw Sanders out of the nomination. Let's not even mention the Whitewater murders. And now as soon as Trump gets to office suddenly now there's nothing wrong with her. She didn't even endorse gay marriage until 2013! This was all known fact and it all happened on the internet, not MSM.

       I wholeheartedly believe our nation is in better hands with Trump than the alternative(s) we were actually given. In a FPTP, two-party system that's about all that matters.

       The Q stuff has posted so much stuff that has been just blatantly wrong at this point. Seems like the Nostradamus approach to me, make vague statements (or as vague questions as it were) and you're bound to get close to something. It's basically cold reading, people find what they want in it.

       Unfortunately I've given up hope of the country being fixable. People live in their confirmation bias bubbles and aren't willing to take a critical lens to their own side. Corruption is too wide in politics. There's no hope of fixing gerrymandering, of moving to publicly funded elections, of return control of Presidential debates to the league of women voters.

       When anyone makes a comment that disagrees with even just a portion of your post AND said offending comment offers even a hint at the delectable prospect that you can attack their Christain faith, do you dredge through their history, drooling and snarling, until you find at last some further evidence, however tangential, to support your initial suspicion?

       Gotta hand it to you: your deductive faculties are at least sound enough to aproximate my religious beliefs, but your social interactive and charismatic persuation skills leave a bit to be desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attacking my personal faith - one with which you cannot possibly begin to dispute or discount with any measure of authority - on the basis of your own misdirected anger fed with hubris only deflects attention from the point you wished to make, and threatens to dismantle your future credibility as one desirous to influence a conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, since you mention it, not even the most secular scholars dispute the historicity of Jesus of Nazareth, nor that of the Gospel's accounts of His life as found in the first four books of the New Testament.  I'd be more than happy to debate this with you, and am even willing to say that, at the very least, you'd have no defense against the objective facts available.  But I wager I could convince you, at least on an intellectual and academic level, that you're completely wrong.  The rest would be up to the very One whom you claim is fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is very real, my friend.  Of all the knowledge of all the things in all times within and without the entire universe, that is the only fact which your choice to believe will determine the outcome of your eternity.

       Now instead of cathedrals, we can build giant dams that can provide electricity to millions of people. We can build airplanes that make travel faster and more efficient.

       I completely agree a million percent. How do we get people to see the need for the change?? That's why I think psychedelics are the big key; they make that shift somehow- or at least a fairly high percentage of the time they do; they're more effective than anything else at opening minds, it seems to me. Big props to brave authors such as Terence McKenna, Graham Hancock, Rick Strassman, and others.

       You really think that someone who is a blatant troll can get people who don't already believe in conspiracy theories like 9/11 to believe in them?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people who give an credence to Q are people who already believe so deeply in their worldview that they're willing to ignore the fact that someone is a complete liar as long as that person confirms their world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone like Q (by which I mean the almost certainly legion number of people who post as Q on 4Chan because that's how 4Chan works you know) has the opposite effect of what you hope for. Reasonable people who might otherwise be led to believe in conspiracies like 9/11 see obviously stupid posts by Q and then see people on a conspiracy sub giving them credence and conclude that the whole thing is stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to convince people to believe in theories, give them actual evidence. Don't post stupid anonymous posts with juvenile questions like "who's really in charge?" Give them real, verifiable facts.

       I’ve been around conspiracy theories for some time now, and I’ve heard this before. I respectfully disagree.  I don’t believe that these things are the beginning of the end of rational thinking for MOST people who read and get absorbed by them. I think they are the beginning of a never ending process by which people who could not imagine such complexity existing, now have their eyes forced open. They are forced to consider uncomfortable possibility. They are forced to begin analyzing problems outside of the paradigm they’re used to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you without the shadow of a doubt that reading conspiracies has made me a more analytical, rational, open minded, and interested person. I care abbot subtly now where once I did not. I want to know details that I never would have asked about before. I want to understand motives better.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, I’ve come to believe that what people call “conspiracy theories” make people better long term.

       i agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       however, i will offer this anecdote. When I first learned to play poker I became a follower of r/poker. After a few weeks of gathering tips and finding better forums for the game I realized that the reddit sub for poker was more akin to children falling over themselves and offering bad advice with next to know real experience. 
After discovering other sources for information regarding 'conspiracies' I have realized that r/conspiracy is much like this. it's the first place people come for questions because it's the easiest to find and it's also the place where you get the worst disorganized and unverified made up narratives with out much meat to them.

       How is it dangerous? I hate it when people call others discussing their ideas and presenting information as 'dangerous.' That's the kind of talk that is used to censor. It is not dangerous for people to discuss things, even crazy off the wall ideas. If you spent time here you'd see that people ask for evidence, some people are quick to believe anything but the majority want evidence for claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not having a place to discuss these ideas and theories and to put forward evidence and information that contradicts official narratives would be far more dangerous in my opinion. I feel that I can trust the majority here to be able to discern fact from fiction or real possibility from crazy talk. It's not for me or you or anyone else to decide what narratives others should or should not believe.

       I agree. Before I understood that many so-called conspiracy theories were actually real, I had a deep sense of fear and mistrust of the people who believed something differently to me. I couldn't understand their point of view so I made assumptions about them that they must be stupid or hateful etc. But when you understand that many cnspiracy theories are real, or even when you understand that the media lies and that the people who know that have no idea where to turn or what to believe, it makes everything and everyone make a whole lot more sense. It makes it easier to see everyone's point of view, especially when you have had your own point of view so thoroughly debunked and changed. It makes you cling to what you can prove, to be open to every possibility but to seek evidence for any theory. It makes you great at the scientific method, and realise how few people actually practice that method in their thinking, even scientists!

       I'm happy about what reading these theories has done for you. Conspiracy theories also did similar thing to me as it draw me further and further into thinking and making conclusions. Parallel to understanding I also discovered a spirituality as a dry information definitely isn't the fabric of the universe itself.

       Very much on point. The narrative you talking about is still better than fox or any other news, tv in general. So that if you have that info from YouTube it means you went looking for it because you had questions and those are always welcome. I wonder, are we gonna get somewhere by perfecting our own narratives? Nope. I think the truth has to be felt as much as understood. If I could explain this I would know the truth but I don't, not yet. When I do learn I'm sure to tell it to everybody else.

       it is interesting that Q included the 4, 10, 20 like a signature DJT? Trump used to study Qabalah.. Could that be a hidden connection? Q, Qabalah, Queen of Cups, Water of Water.. 4, 10, 20? The Tarot is an ancient secret language 4 The Emperor, 10 The Wheel- "Anubis or positive +++?", 20 Judgement- It is a ‘wake up’ chance for transformation- Whats really weird.. You will find the The Wheel &amp; Judgement 2017 Trump Tarot on The Economist Magazine Cover 1 of the owners is Rothschild... Tarot Trumps - also called Atouts and Major Arcana.. There is alot more info if you want to go down that rabbit hole

       I thought the whole Mayan calendar thing in 2012 was actually correlated to the changing age. From whatever it was to the guy with the water vase. I remember watching that on Zeitgeist movie 15 years ago.

       The Mayan calendar had nothing to do with the precession of the equinoxes (which is where the astrological ages come from). The only thing they have in common is that they're both associated with the end of one era and the beginning of another.

       Well, if Q is real, then we have entered a new age of knowledge and the thirst for it and the thirst for it, and the age of the water-bearer has thrust open the floodgates of truth. If he's fake, then the usual floodgates are about as open as they ever were.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a bit of a distaste for the terms "real" and "fake" for the person called Q. Obviously he's real, the only question is whether he really is an all-knowing oracle of truth or instead just some guy with a keyboard who's getting shared around.

       Shit is getting increasingly FUCKED UP for everyone at the bottom, so young angry white dudes online are clinging to their fantastical take that strong big daddy Trump is the grand liberator of the "superior" European white Christians. Like a bad WWE final saga against the Liberal Deep State.

       They still haven't caught on that when ex-NYC-liberal  royally fucks up yet another good thing, it's not some masterful 4D chess he is playing. He's just been a royal fuck up for a good part of his life. Maybe why he has such daddy issues.

       As for me, i'm no 'Trump Supporter' but to call him worse than what we have seen is not genuine. First, congress and the senate haven't really allowed him to do anything - it's Obama 2.0. Everything they have done is pretty common sense stuff that everyone agrees on (in the majority). I think it's all 'chicken little' sky-is-falling hyperbole from his opponents, so it makes me stick up for the reality of things. I think at some point, people need to move on and try to be productive with their time and energy, but i'm just a person on the internet.

       I used to think Trump supporters were all racist idiots too, but then I spent time outside my echo chamber and in theirs to try to understand. And while there is a lot of silliness and belief in dumb stuff like Trump being a 'god emperor' and thinking he's the savior of humanity etc, there really aren't many racists among them at all. That is a lie pushed by his detractors in the media.

       There is no objective truth. Those who claim to know the objective truth are tricking you into believing their construction of reality over your own reality. Everyone has their own subjective reality and that is all there is.

       Exactly.. even if it's "fake" it's not really all fake.. some of the info on it the truther community knew.. and most of it are things we pretty much knew.. so the fact it's making people research and wake up I love it! I really hope we can unite to stop these tyrants, the most important issue to me is saving these children and ever since being red pilled I have been inspired to try to film a doc with my friends about trafficking in the Philippine and the tourists all around the globe that come that keep the demand. Pretty fucked up but it's our job to get the truth out anyway we can!

       I clicked on a Q post on the front page earlier this week. The first line was something like "Trump has such an amazing life and loving family, now why would he make the noble sacrifice of going into politics if not to save us all?" That told me what I needed to know about Q.

       Found the link:

       If Q is legitimate, he's someone close to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's that person going to say, that he grabs women by the vagina?

      <p>
       To not vote for Trump in 2020?
      </p>
      <p>
       No. Use your brain. This person, if legitimate, will only have positive things to say pertaining to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that you're not right about capitalizing on power.

       The two extremes of the paradigm of being in power -- that of using it as service to one's self, and as its intended function of service to the group.

       They aren't mutually exclusive.

       It's one of the largest and most active subs on Reddit. Didn't they change the algorithm because top posts on the Donald were being showed the r/ all too often? So they changed it so only one top post a day can reach r/ all. This is why we have dozens of anti trump subs, so they can all spam the top of Reddit.

       I mean you have analytical evidence showing irregular voting patterns, evidence showing the script being used, and evidence of coordination among external users to brigade certain subreddits/users. If you look into it more you'll also see evidence of keyword-based comment bots, which obviously are a real thing if you've ever been to

       That "analytical evidence" is only comparing one of the most active subs (the Donald) to others that just simply aren't as active. Compare it to r/ NBA or some other sub where users are constantly active and up voting. You didn't show evidence of the script being used. You posted a screenshot of a script.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't doubt that subs get brigaded. But to argue over that is kind of trivial. We're talking about one sub in the Donald, that's brigaded by the rest of Reddit. The Donald has almost 600,000 subscribers, how many people are on reddit as a whole?

        /r/politics
       </a>
       , which has over 3.5 million subscribers, gets 40k upvotes, why do you think it is because of vote manipulation? Because that is what you originally said.

       Probably because the post got enough votes to hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and subsequent upvotes aren't coming from subscribers? Overall, Reddit has always been a left-leaning site so it makes sense that when even a niche subreddit like
       <a href="/r/enoughtrumpspam">
        /r/enoughtrumpspam
       </a>
       hits the front page people will upvote it, especially when, at the time, everyone was used to seeing simiilar posts from T_D hit the front (and then get downvoted to oblivion by
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you don't believe its bots or scripts, it's still almost universally just spam that gets blanket upvoted. There is no meaningful discussion.

       It could be a movement of trolls, burn-outs, and people too afraid to admit they may have made a really dumb mistake. The truth has been labeled "fake". Or maybe the "Clinton Crime Syndicate" really does sell baby parts and are Satanists who fuck kids, and Trump is the Anointed One to lead us to a better economy and Real American Values. Good luck everyone!

       It kinda does matter if what he says is real or fake though... So far it all appears to be fake so I don't know how you can use him as a platform to promote some form of awakening.

       It doesn't matter if Trump is the one who jumpstarts the coming of the new age. Everyone is an active participant. If Trump wants to take credit for it, so be it. Good is good. It wasnt all Trump. It was each and every one of us fighting the good fight.

       It absolutely matters whether it's fake or not, are you kidding? What's the use of 'waking someone up' if the very next thing you tell them is more bullshit? Q anon's stuff reads like a fortune teller, super vague, and gives the notion that you're about to be let in on a super duper secret. You can't look down on the masses for being gullible and trot this guy Q out at the same time, it's laughable.

       I'd say it matters, but it doesn't. An awakening
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       happening, which will evolve into something profound, in due time. That said, it doesn't help that Q might lead us to providing more disinfo, which might lead us to delaying the process of another person's awakening. The awakening, itself, however, has certainly begun, and nothing can un-stop that process from continuing to evolve toward its totality.

       Are you assuming newbies aren't logical enough to figure out where the fake information is?  We are working on that here so why is it any different for people seeing the questions from Q and then googling information?

       Misinformation a convenient tactic to create confusion, distrust, fear in the masses. This is what Putin is instegating to bring America to its knees.

       What awakening? People are aware of the symptoms and that's not an awakening. Until everyone opens their windows and yells "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!" nothing will change.

       Don’t worry though. You can do all the vile shit you want and just get that sweet, sweet forgiveness later. That’s how it works in your mind, yeah?

       Yes, but they're so widely used they're basically utilities at this point, especially Twitter and Facebook.

       How on earth can you consider that proof? It's a post of someone posting a script.

       That "analytical evidence" is only comparing one of the most active subs (the Donald) to others that just simply aren't as active. Compare it to r/ NBA or some other sub where users are constantly active and up voting. You didn't show evidence of the script being used. You posted a screenshot of a script.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't doubt that subs get brigaded. But to argue over that is kind of trivial. We're talking about one sub in the Donald, that's brigaded by the rest of Reddit. The Donald has almost 600,000 subscribers, how many people are on reddit as a whole?

       I'm not talking about big subs like r/politics. I'm talking about subs like r/enougtrumpspam or the dozens like it that have posts with tens of thousands of up votes.

       Probably because the post got enough votes to hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and subsequent upvotes aren't coming from subscribers? Overall, Reddit has always been a left-leaning site so it makes sense that when even a niche subreddit like
       <a href="/r/enoughtrumpspam">
        /r/enoughtrumpspam
       </a>
       hits the front page people will upvote it, especially when, at the time, everyone was used to seeing simiilar posts from T_D hit the front (and then get downvoted to oblivion by
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you don't believe its bots or scripts, it's still almost universally just spam that gets blanket upvoted. There is no meaningful discussion.
