<p>Also, wouldn&#39;t it be pretty easy for &quot;Q&quot; to have multiple other people in on the LARP who &quot;investigated&quot; the photo? That is, Q calculates the president&#39;s flight plan (which is public) and produces the photo at some point after the flight has been scheduled. At the time of the flight, Q makes the post, then has someone else come in later and say &quot;Look at this, fellow anons! I&#39;ve used my autism to prove that Q was on AF!&quot;. </p>

<p>Not when flying near countries that are a nuclear threat and not when the president is on AF1. You can be 3 Nm in your plane away from another but you are not significant as the president. The  more significant the US Govt. Officials - the greater the measures are to be taken. POTUS equals HIGHEST SECURITY-LONGER DISTANCE BETWEEN PLANES ETC.</p>

<p>Air Force One is the designation of the plane carrying the President. There are at least 4 planes that can be designated as Air Force One (as in, converted, mobile command centres), and they aren&#39;t called Air Force One when he isn&#39;t aboard.</p>

<p>That’s what I meant when I said if the president isn’t on board, none of them are called “Air Force One”, and once he boards one that becomes its designation.</p>

<p>I had no idea that they always had two planes, and frankly I don’t think that true (at least not when he visited Canada).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My view also. Its acting and speaking like a &quot;strong Ai &quot;  asking questions, open interactive  socratic style.  Not making any suppositions or expressing emotions, it all fits. I wonder if this Ai is completely autonomous, (self learning deep think model?) If so, is there a human entity involved at this point? Time will tell. If this is a larp its one with global intent and effect!  Either way, we humans shoukd be very interested to find out whatever we can about it. Check out Quinn Michaels youtube channel and find out what we through Quinns research and algos have found out so far. It all backs up what Qanon says so far. Paralell efforts perhaps? I hope we all make it.</p>

<p>I bet if you called a fellow user a pedophile or murderer in it would be treated the same way, likewise if you called a public figure stupid it wouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why certain users have to resort to calling each other childish names instead of having discussions like an adults, but if you can&#39;t achieve that basic standard of decency to fellow users of the subreddit then I don&#39;t have any sympathy for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comprehensive Command of Conspiracy Theory. It&#39;s like someone went and read a ton of books, watched a ton of videos, and researched a ton of different rabbit trails, and then managed to condense them into a series of brief &quot;hints&quot; that will then expand as far as anybody wants to chase them. If and when we have &quot;Conspiracy Studies&quot; in our universities - this list of questions will be a major part of the curriculum.</p>

<p>Stage I - Weaponized Autism: 4chan/pol. It really is what it claims to be: the largest uncoordinated and unconventional meetup of some of the best &quot;under-utilized brain power&quot; in the world. These people are the classic Aspergers-spectrum type: super smart but socially limited, such that keeping a regular job, or working through an advanced degree, or having any type of normal social setting (job, friends, family, clubs, etc.) must be a real challenge for many of them (not all - there&#39;s a good smattering of professionals and retirees). In terms of Myers-Briggs personality types they are overwhelmingly INTJ and INTP - look it up if you don&#39;t fully understand what that implies! There&#39;s a very revealing meme-level statistic out there that comes into play. According to this meme - which you can find on 4chan, btw - people with above normal IQ tend to be liberal in political orientation. But, people with unusually high IQ have an opposite tendency to be conservative - and in unusual ways. You see this strangeness in 4chan/pol when everybody just &quot;impersonates&quot; the most outrageous political positions - an example would be the alt-right. Who knows how serious they are being? It is often claimed that it is meant to be &quot;ironic&quot;. They can do this only because it is an anonymous platform.</p>

<p>Stage II Religious Clean Room: The current Q operation expertly harnesses the latent energy of 4chan/pol, and then injects that frenetic output into a much larger and more traditionally conservative population - the evangelical right. While 4chan itself is the nemesis of standard bible belt religious attitudes, Q has made a huge effort to attach a standard Christian world-view aspect to their &quot;instruction sets&quot;.  It&#39;s an incredible operation because it uses two of the most under-reached but potentially powerful political hinge-points in the USA, to completely bypass the filtration of mainstream media, and attack the establishment players of the &quot;old system&quot; on their unprotected flank - which is pay-for-play money corruption, with a whiff of satanic debauchery.</p>

<p>This brief overview is just the surface - there is much much more when you delve in. For instance, I did not even address the power of memes and search algorithm manipulations - all that is stage 2 analysis.</p>

<p>Do you have some evidence to back up your claim that 4chan users are these &quot;super smart&quot; types as you put it?</p>

<p>People tend to believe they&#39;re incredibly smart or &quot;better than average, but I don&#39;t try&quot;. It&#39;s even called the Dunning-Kruger Effect.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a></p>

<p>If you asked half of reddit they&#39;d say you&#39;re describing them (&quot;super smart but socially limited&quot;).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people with above normal IQ tend to be liberal in political orientation. But, people with unusually high IQ have an opposite tendency to be conservative - and in unusual ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would love to read about this if you can direct me towards some. I researched this a bit and it&#39;s mostly liberals/conservatives taking potshots at each other or some studies saying social conservatism is correlated with lower IQ&#39;s.</p>

<p>If Q is as deep as they have said and if the things they are saying are true, then the punishment for leaking won&#39;t be prison after a nice trial. It would be a bullet to the back of the head in a dark alley after a quiet meeting in some backrooms.</p>

Why make it a game? This supposed oracle is just fucking with people. It&#39;s the same old story: I have all the answers to the greatest red pilled game ever, but I&#39;m going to tease you for weeks with questions and breadcrumbs that lead to nowhere. If there was some individual with all the secrets, they would risk getting caught toying with people over multiple days; they would just come out with it. Q is just another fedora wearing knob getting his kicks off people who want to be believe. The term &quot;cold reader&quot; is spot on.

    <div class="md"><p>The two more recent Q posts are bullshit.  The jargon used in some of the open ended questions dealing with the military and intel agencies is just flat out wrong.  Specifically, the following:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is Bin Laden&#39;s handler?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the intelligence world, the term &quot;handler&quot; is nonexistent.  It&#39;s like calling a mechanic a &quot;wrencher&quot; or a police officer an &quot;arrester.&quot;  Designations set by the government referring to a particular employment role are clearly defined and firmly established within the community.  This has been set out since the late 70&#39;s with the formation of DoD special mission units.  Long story short, inter-agency (and intra-agency) communications mandate separate and distinct designations for particular service roles.  For example, and as explained in Charlie Beckwith&#39;s (the founder of Delta Force) book, this is why the term &quot;operator&quot; was selected to refer to SMU members.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why was the [CIA] tasked to hunt/capture/kill UBL?  and Why not MI?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two are glaring red flags.  I&#39;m not even going to address the MI question because it&#39;s just flat-out stupid and shows the author has absolutely no idea what MI&#39;s role is or what its capabilities are.  Even if Q actually has such a high-level security clearance with the DOE, Q should know that the DOE works hand in hand with the FBI, NSA, NRO, CIA, and JSOC, especially with regard to JSOC&#39;s (and in particular, CAG) role in domestic CBRN events, commonly referred to as the 0300 mission set.  Because Q should know this, Q should also know that the CIA has a particular mission profile that is (or was at the time) unique to the CIA.  Details fleshing out this mission profile are not necessary, except for the fact that the CIA/NCS/SAD/SOG is an animal unto itself with the capability and established regional connections (post Soviet Afghanistan) to handle hunting a high-profile individual like UBL.  For example, look at the information surrounding the death of Johnny Michael Spann, the first American killed in the GWOT.  He was CIA SAD/SOG.  In addition, look at the multiple accounts of the events in Tora Bora in November of 2001.  JSOC, NSA, FBI, CIA, USSF, and the UK&#39;s SBS all worked together in targeting UBL.  Even more, it is widely known that JSOC intelligence elements (TF Orange) were actively pursuing UBL hand-in-hand with the CIA, and other JSOC DA unit members were &quot;sheep dipped&quot; to augment the CIA&#39;s tactical capabilities.  Asking why the CIA was tasked with hunting UBL is like asking why is there beef in a cheeseburger.      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why wouldn&#39;t we want to capture UBL alive and extract other possible T-level events?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we have yet another stupid question that illustrates the author&#39;s complete lack of understanding regarding the command structure of AQ/TB post 2002.  UBL was intentionally isolated and stood merely as a figurehead with little to no direct involvement or oversight of day to day operations.  Communications were active, but the PERSEC/INFOSEC techniques emplyed by UBL absolutely removed him from his former shot-caller status.  Even Akhtar Mohammed Mullah Mansoor inadvertently clarified this in an ad-hoc press release.  This is common knowledge.    </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: The past two Q posts are bullshit.</strong></p>

<p>A lot of his questions are even meaningless but just the fact that he asks them make them seem to have deep meaning. </p>

<p>Like recently Q asked, “Why did POTUS leave Manilla a half hour early? Why did AF one stop in Hawaii to refuel? Does AF One have in air refueling capability?” </p>

<p>I mean, to start, Manilla isn’t that awesome of a place. He probably just wanted to get on the road. Stopping in Hawaii to refuel is ALWAYS done on overseas trips. Every. Single. Time. Does AF One have in-air refueling capabilities? No. </p>

<p>I just don’t get why those questions are worth anyone’s time to ponder. Seems like how a schizo would think things through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, why do you so strongly think it&#39;s a larp? </p>

<p>are you one of those people that operate on the ideal that if one tiny little detail doesn&#39;t pan out as planned then the whole thing is worthless. whats that word .. nitpicking ?</p>

<p>even if it is a larp is it so terrible that more people are paying attention to these things?</p>

<p>why do you feel that the world needs you to rain on this parade?</p>

<p>are you getting paid?</p>

<p>if so, by whom?</p>

<p>what do you know ?</p>

<p>i can do it too.</p>
