       This guy has it figured out:

      <blockquote>

I looked into some of those account leaving random gibberish comments. I wasn't interested in their messages but rather Youtube profiles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of the time use generic Google avatar and some random normal name like "John Smith". A lot of them have few playlists consisting from 1 to few hundred videos but the majority playlists have under 10 videos. Name of playlists are giberrish, videos are usually nursery rhymes, Spiderman meeting blue Spiderman, etc. However some of the videos don't fit into the theme for example I found SA Wardega's Jurrasic Park prank video and video about Boeing's new Apache helicopter. My only guess is those accounts look for some specific keywords and sometimes they randomly stumble upon "normal" videos. Under most of videos added to those playlists you can find more gibberish comments made by generic accounts.
       </p>
       <p>
        My guess is those are simply bots, their purpose is to make ANY comments under videos to make number of comments higher because a lot of those ElsaGate videos have number of views inflated by bots in the first place anyway. 1 milion views video with 20 comments would look very suspicious so adding random comments makes it look more "legit".

       And to elaborate on this comment, something about typing random letters into a thai keyboard gives a result that translates into something that seems to make sense. ยหผา ฟหผฟ ผสสกก ผผกด translates to 'I don't think so.' but I did not get it from a youtube comment, they are just random letters that I mashed on the thai keyboard.

       Of course it is, but we at least try and give the appearance of somewhere a genuine conspiracy could be posted (which this looks to be) and be taken seriously, how is sending threatening messages to people doing so a good thing? We're all nutters here yes, but when someone who isn't a nutter drags along to post real truth lets not fucking scare them off.

       Oh god, ff someone messaged me and said "we'd like you to stop posting about this (certain topic). It is in your best interest (my real name)," I'd delete and wipe everything no hesitation. My random internet speculation is no where near worth the off chance that they are for real

       I'd just applaud them for being able to highlight my username and right click "search pizzaboy192" on Google. Alta are what would get me concerned. I have probably 20 or so, each only posts in one subreddit. Each only posts through a specific city/location via PIA. makes life easy that way.

       DISCLAIMER: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTACT OR BULLY THE CHANNEL USERS. PLEASE HELP TRANSLATE OR FIND EVIDENCE WHICH EITHER PROVES OR DISPROVES THIS THEORY SO WE CAN GET OVER IT.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it isn't a bot army, at least I don't think so. You have to use a thai keyboard emulator(link:
       <a href="https://www.branah.com/thai">
        https://www.branah.com/thai
       </a>
       ), only in pattachote(edit: it varies) I think but possibly both formats. I've only tried out a few comments but it seems very promising.
      </p>
      <p>
       See my earlier theory(See here :
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElsaGate/comments/7d6r4e/elsagate_bot_video/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/ElsaGate/comments/7d6r4e/elsagate_bot_video/
       </a>
       ) that the comment section is being used to sell/swap/buy cp or support human trafficking. Tons of short videos of kids linked to creepy gibberish speaking accounts with no views. Lots of them are creepy as shit(see here:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLaywoHRYWc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLaywoHRYWc
       </a>
       ). And here's the thing, look at the name of the dude who owns the channel: Daniel Thomas. Definitely not thai. Or this:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is the case then this should be busted wide open. I've only been looking at this stuff for two days and don't have enough time to process this stuff fast enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: so far I have tested a few, the first one i tested was "ny" which translated to "reply." That poster had four homeade videos on their channel. Will keep updating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Update: Okay, so look at this channel:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSFyhdhgHdyFzn45ljBFqw">
        https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOSFyhdhgHdyFzn45ljBFqw
       </a>
       The user commented "may" in thai. They have a bunch of videos including march and april but no "may." What if "may" is the child they're selling?
      </p>
      <p>
       Update #2: So this stuff is translating, and it may be promising. I just got a location (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phra_Dhammakaya">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phra_Dhammakaya
       </a>
       ) from one of the comments on an elsa video and then a commenter reply who had more videos of kids. Interesting
      </p>
      <p>
       Update #3: Okay so im done searching comment sections on YT for the night, Ive been looking at this stuff all day and it's still gonna be there tomorrow. Will stay on reddit though, I just need to calm myself down so I can sleep eventually. People should start checking the comment sections(need a place to start? Check my previous posts linked above).
      </p>
      <p>
       Update #4: Okay, I just woke up and want to make some things more clear. First, the "method" of decoding I'm using is very simple: type comment into thai keyboard emulator and then throw the results in a translator. Second, if you do want to help me figure out if this is an international pedo ring or just a bunch of random home videos then please DO NOT contact them, assist in translating or searching for videos. When I was doing my sleuthing I noticed that not every elsagate channel and not every comment section were the same, some seemed to have more videos and comments while others seemed to have more normal comments. Third, I'm super overwhelmed by this stuff and this is just a pet theory. I posted it to this sub(I was just messaging with a few users on r/elsagate before) so it could be vetted. If you see holes in it, post it. If you see potential connections, post it. I would say my "hit" ratio on the suspicious videos/activity was maybe 1 out of every 30 suspicious accounts. These guys are super wary also. I made a post about some cp I found and it was gone an hour later, channel still intact. I think the guy got tipped off by the maybe 20 extra views all at once.

       I was looking for this so I could say this.  Okay if you dared to watch the first video link of some diaper kid on a bare mattress dancing around, did you notice the look he gave the camera? Something about that look doesn't feel quite right. That quick two second gaze that the kid gives is so disturbing. It could be re kid is just trying to figure out the phone camera...but that look. There's just something off about it.

       ARCHIVE any evidence and keep UPVOTING the threads.
 These youtube accounts are discussing profit of some sorts, there were a few comments on EG videos i translated that say something like "we make $5000 in a week" (dont have links on hand but they're not hard to find).  Now they could be discussing profits made from the shitty spiderman/elsa videos or they could be discussing something more sinister like CP. Nobody will ever know until we either prove or debunk the conspiracy with provided evidence.

       Most of the users are foreign, if we're looking at Thailand for example, 5k will seem like a fortune to someone earning less than hundred bucks a month. They sell their kids real cheap.

       Are you guys sure the comments aren't just from toddlers watching these videos on their parents phone?  Like you know how kids fat finger the phone and type out some weird shit?  That would explain why so many letters are next to eachother.  Like this.

       Well, that's what I think too.  But a few things don't add up.  Why are so many arabs replying in an obviously American made video? (Yeah, I know the whole thing is suppose to be Thai.  But I know arabic when I see it, and a lot are Arabic)  In fact, why are 99% of comments either jibberish or foreign?  Weird considering the videos were made for an American audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are people responding to nonsense comments?  Yup.  If you look closely, some people are actually responding to jibberish.  YouTube got rid of the "reply to" button a long time ago.  So these days you actually have to type the name you are responding in order for it to appear on the comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I'm not mistaken, a few phrases actually did translate to real sentences.  What are the chances of that happening if a random child was bashing keyboard?
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I think it's ludicrous.  But still..... you never know...  LOL

       Here's the problem -- if this were the case, why are the comments not filled with parents saying shit like "Don't let your kids watch this" and that sort of stuff?
      </p>
      <p>
       You see comments from parents on all sorts of other, less disturbing, videos. Why aren't they commenting on these, but their kids are? And we can't say the parents don't know because it's been in the news, and I know of plenty of parents (myself included) who found out about them because they caught their kids.

       You're talking about some videos with hundreds of thousands, of not millions, of views. You're telling me that all those parents aren't paying attention?
      </p>
      <p>
       That just doesn't make any sense. Again, I've seen parents comment on videos they caught their watching numerous times on YouTube. I rarely (only a few, actually) seen parents commenting on these videos.

       My YouTube account has commented on dozens of children's videos because my son who is 2 watches YouTube on my phone and button bashed the screen. He sends links to my friends, comments, replies to comments, likes, dislikes, saves to play lists, the lot.

       Probably makes it an easy environment to hide messages in.
