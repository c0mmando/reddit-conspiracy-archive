        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We decided to use a church of one of the conservative guys to home the meeting. Their chapel was big enough to fit everyone, even though we really did not expect so many people!</p>

<p>It was basically just about 30 of us conspiracy theorists that belong to a club here and we meet weekly. We decided to invite our friends and family members who were interested in learning more about the recent events in the country and the world. We basically had a bunch of people have their eyes opened and many came up afterwards talking about how they&#39;ve had suspicions about a lot of the stuff, but after tonight they will think and act differently.</p>

<p>The main things we discussed were:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Panama Papers</li>
<li>Roy Moore and Al Franken, and other politicians who have tried covering up sexual accusations or have been exposed.</li>
<li>Trump and Russia Collusion</li>
<li>Hollywood&#39;s elite pedophilia rings</li>
<li>Pizzagate</li>
<li>Uranium One and The Clintons</li>
<li>Seth Rich</li>
<li>The new tax plan</li>
<li>The left/right paradigm and the divide and conquer technique being used by the current administration</li>
<li>Obama&#39;s presidency, and his extreme failures as a president</li>
<li>Q&amp;A Session</li>
</ol>

<p>Altogether it lasted about 3 hours, after which we all had food and refreshments.</p>

<p>From the look of it, I&#39;d say more than half were conservative. There were still a lot of liberals.</p>

<p>We basically tried to make it very non partisan. We even had some SJWs and alt-right people there!</p>

<p>I honestly believe that one of the few ways to make real change is to organize.</p>

<p>Bring people from all walks, creeds, and colors, and discuss topics that are relevant. You&#39;ll be surprised by how much this could change people&#39;s minds.</p>

<p>The 30 of our original weekly club will probably grow to about 80 to 90, but who knows, perhaps even more will continue to show up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As odd as it sounds, the best way to prevent a FBI informant from infiltrating your meetings and promoting extreme violence, is to record the meetings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy for the FBI / CIA to get 2 or 3 people to start attending meetings, becoming an echo chamber for each other, and promote extremely violent behavior. Even if you &#39;shut it down&#39;, one of their guys &#39;leaks&#39; the clip in which their people were promoting violence, and now all the sudden you are another WACO.</p>

<p>The way you avoid this is to regularly record meetings. I suggest video, which I would put on to youtube. This way, the meetings are presented in context, with history, and to the public. Undercover agents have &#39;real lives&#39;, and if they get recorded at a Conspiracy meeting effectively their careers are over as they can no longer maintain their cover story that they are a &#39;airplane pilot&#39; or whatever they tell their spouses, friends, etc.</p>

<p>Also, through EXTREME transparency, it is impossible for anyone to later claim you were a &#39;secretive cult&#39; for violence. Without such a process, you are effectively begging for 2 or 3 FBI / CIA agents to take over your meetings, and &#39;leak&#39; clips to incriminate and demonize all attendees.</p>

<p>But do what you feel necessary.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of this meeting and am glad that more people are starting to become PUBLIC with their social investigations. That&#39;s the type of behavior that turns a closeted notion into a public event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We tried our best to set a non partisan tone, and actually i think this is what opened people&#39;s eyes the most.. obviously there were some conservatives who didn&#39;t agree with some things, but it seems like almost all the liberals were more willing to accept corruption on the left then conservative accepting corruption on the right. Just my observation though.</p>

<p>But by trying to maintain a non partisan atmosphere, i think a lot of people saw this as evidence that we all have things in common, and it&#39;s really a people vs TPTB problem, and not a left vs right.</p>

<p>Just shows how powerful organizing different types of people is in bringing people together and opening each other&#39;s minds</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was one who watched the crazy war mongers speeches and threats to Russia by Stephanie Powers and Joe Biden and was appalled by it before the election. I was also concerned though about Donald Trump&#39;s double-sided messages. He was against wars but he wanted to end the Iran deal.</p>

<p>After the election, it became clear (minus the crazy threats mentioned above) that Russia did play a role in the election. I was able to change my view not because I flip-flopped, but rather, because the quality of the information about &quot;Russian collusion&quot; became much better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is ONE reason why divide and conquer works so well on the U.S. population:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png">https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png</a></p>

<p>Democratic party is dressed up as &quot;left&quot; or &quot;centrist&quot;
but it&#39;s in fact, EXTREME right, and EXTREME authoritarian.
(At least modern Democrats anyway)</p>

<p>Republican party is dressed up as &quot;moderate right&quot;
but it&#39;s actually even MORE EXTREME than the far right authoritarian Democrats.</p>

<p>Almost all Dem/Repub politicians are corporate extremists.
Even the moderate Bernie was an Independent before running as a Dem to avoid a corporate media blackout.</p>

<p>The corporate media (CNN, Fox News, etc.)
lied about the French president Macron,
falsely claiming and repeating over and over again
that he&#39;s a &quot;centrist&quot;. Even BBC and RT repeated this propaganda.</p>

<p>No way in hell is a literal Rothschild banker shill 
who wants tax breaks for the super rich
and wants to remove worker rights (insane labor reforms hence the mass protests against Macron)
can be anywhere near &quot;centrist&quot;.
He&#39;s EXTREME right wing.
The BBC even got a political scientist lying shill claiming
Hamon was &quot;too far left&quot;,
he was actually only slightly left. They lie right in our faces.
Melenchon was much more leftist than Hamon and even
he was not a full socialist, just a democratic socialist.</p>

<p>This was their real political leanings:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/4GBqQRg.png">https://i.imgur.com/4GBqQRg.png</a></p>

<p>This confirms this theory of mine,
where the elites are trying to use extreme right economics
OR extreme authoritarianism OR BOTH in order
to achieve the shitty NWO globalist corporate-bankster one world government dictatorship.</p>

<p>For many years the media has tried
to show moderate/reasonable politics (like real centrism)
as &quot;unrealistic&quot;, &quot;FULL socialism!&quot;, &quot;FREE SHIT YOU ENTITLED PEASANTS!&quot;
that type of crap while
portraying extremist corporate economics like
Reagan&#39;s trickle down scam economics as &quot;the norm&quot;
or &quot;fiscally responsible&quot;. 100% bullshit.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve tried to shift the scale by claiming
Dems are left or centrist
while Republicans are claimed to be moderate right.
Both astronomically far from the truth.</p>

<p>Obama wasn&#39;t too extreme in his 2008 campaign,
he was only slightly right, which I would consider the limit
on what is &quot;anti-establishment&quot;, you know his whole &quot;Hope&quot; campaign.
But he flip flopped massively, had many corporate donors, etc.
so he proved to actually be far right with his implemented crony capitalist and deregulated economics and even more so in 2012
when he had almost identical policies as Republican Romney.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t trust either Democrat and Republican politicians personally.
Liberal vs conservative is bullshit IMO,
and at this point it&#39;s just pure corporate marketing
to get people to choose an arbitrary side (Pepsi vs Coca Cola // Democrat vs Republican)
when both are almost the same.
This makes people irrationally loyal to a shitty team that
shits on them every time they come into power.</p>

<p>Both parties have shifted more rightward, they used
to be more moderate, decades ago.
When you keep re-using lib vs con,
people get complacent and don&#39;t see the carpet pulled from beneath them
as they shift to extreme right deregulated corporate economics
and NSA spy state extreme authoritarian social policies.</p>

<p>Liberal/Conservative &quot;values&quot; are garbage.
Everyone should ideally look at each and every policy
with a blank slate, rather than religiously look at a packaged ideology
that might have been constructed by the establishment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a center left democratic socialist
but when I see homelessness,
I don&#39;t religiously think &quot;that goes against democratic socialism therefore I hate it&quot;
instead, I&#39;m more critical than that and just think &quot;that&#39;s awful, there&#39;s plenty of money out there
and the corrupt gov lets these people suffer in the cold while billionaires dodge taxes&quot;.</p>

<p>Being ideologically religious, corrupts the mind
and takes away objectivity, and instead adds
emotional attachment with the propaganda phrase &quot;I&#39;m a proud liberal/conservative&quot;
so if someone criticizes a policy, the reaction is emotionally excessive
rather than a rational analysis with reason and evidence guiding people
to the truth.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right that
it&#39;s the people (homeless/working/middle/upper middle class + ethical small/medium businesses)
VS
the Establishment (corporations, wallstreet, elite central bankers like Rothschilds, and maybe Royalty bloodlines).</p>

<p>We don&#39;t all agree on things but surely
centrism is a decent starting point.
We all have similar needs and desires, yet disagree
astronomically because of propaganda and tribalism mentality.
A lot of people think crony capitalism is socialism. Utterly ridiculous.
Crony capitalism (like the big pharma/insurance company shilly Obamacare system)
is socialism INVERTED - i.e. socialism for the super rich and rough capitalism
for everyone else. Socializing the business risks
while privatizing the profits. It&#39;s sick.</p>

<p>Far right authoritarian Republican politicians
pretending to be Christian would influence Christians into
being corporate extremists themselves,
while Jesus was actually a libertarian socialist (non-authoritarian socialist),
not sure if he was specifically democratic socialist, full socialist,
anarchist, or whatever, but the dude was a hippie who wanted
to help the poor and drove the money lenders/bankers out of the temple.
Definitely not corporate Democrat/Republican material.</p>

<p>When people stop falling for Pepsi VS Coca Cola (Dem vs Repub)
we can start to have a common ground,
join forces and take down the elites with a strong will
&quot;NO, WE don&#39;t want your crappy Dem/Repub corporate economics&quot;.</p>

<p>Economically, people have fallen for the
&quot;Bernie is a full socialist&quot; &quot;90% tax rate!!&quot;
&quot;he wants to dismantle capitalism!!&quot;
&quot;FREE SHIT!&quot; corporate propaganda.
I think Fox News invented the 90% bullshit, I have Bernie&#39;s tax plan right in front of me
and it&#39;s nowhere near 90% even for the top tax rate.</p>

<p>Bernie&#39;s tax plan:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/grOU5BO.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/grOU5BO.jpg</a></p>

<p>Social democracy (Bernie/FDR economics)
is almost centrist, let alone center left democratic socialism,
let alone far left full socialism.</p>

<p>If you or your group have any questions about this,
I&#39;d be happy to answer specific questions.
Questions about different types of socialism,
real communism vs fake communism, free market vs fair market,
state capitalism, etc. I&#39;m no expert but I&#39;ve done a fair amount of research
over the years.</p>

<p>If you can get people to simply look at some things that seem implausible, but not see them as an attack on their current position, I think it is helpful. Try to get them to help elucidate the error they think is being made by those that hold an opposing view... for example, after watching Peter Ketchams 30 minute video explaining the problem with the collapse of building 7, have them explain what error they believe he is making that leads to his erroneous conclusion.

    <div class="md"><p>I think your next step is to distance yourself from identity politic labels like &quot;liberal&quot;, &quot;conservative&quot;, and <em>definitely</em> from &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.  You should know (and I think you do if you&#39;re this into it) that the word &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was coined years ago by the CIA as a means of marginalizing and vilifying truth seekers.  I&#39;d personally say if anything, call yourself &quot;critical thinkers&quot;.  I think that would likely be closer to what you actually are and <em>want</em> to be, and it doesn&#39;t pine in to those labels that are already so very marginalized in one way or the other.</p>

<p>&quot;Liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; labels cause others to pretty immediately and automatically predispose and prejudge you.  They feel they already &quot;know&quot; how you&#39;re like if you&#39;re a &quot;liberal&quot; or a &quot;conservative&quot; or a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.  He&#39;s one of <em>those.</em>  I bet you he thinks like [insert marginalizing categorization].&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d personally say call yourself either &quot;Critical Thinking Forum&quot;...or just don&#39;t call yourselves or each other or anyone who comes to join you <em>anything</em>.  Heck, almost make it mandatory that such labels are not even allowed to be mentioned while in meetings or whatnot.</p>

<p>Sure, you can <em>talk</em> about politics.  Of course.  But don&#39;t label yourselves.</p>

<p>Anyway, just some thoughts I had is all.</p>

<p>Glad you&#39;re doing the meetings.  Keep it up!  Hope more of us do it and make things happen for real!  Take the thoughts we have and move them from the internet in to the real world!  Onward and upward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so important. Right off the start OP mentions &quot;conservative&quot; almost in a gleeful tone and proceeds to continue segmenting by using liberal and AltRight etc. 
Labeling yourself impedes critical thinking and is lazy. 
If you call yourself conspiracy theorist forum then you&#39;ll be inviting the scrutiny of the mainstream. They&#39;ll think it&#39;s a bunch of bunk being discussed and is not inviting for new people. Also, people love using &quot;oh it&#39;s just a conspiracy theory&quot; to discredit and belittle claims. Almost like the terms &quot;fake news&quot; </p>

<p>Wake up OP. This is a good start though. 
I like the idea of critical thinking forum. </p>

 threat. </p>

<p>You should commit a couple of your guys to watch out for possible agitators and provocateurs. If you spot them, your special guys will engage them knowing full well that they&#39;re up to know good. The objective is to tie them up in circles and have them busy doing pointless things...sort of like the reverse Nigerian scam.</p>

<p>Another analogy is that your special guys are like macrophages that surround an infection, blocking it from the rest of the &quot;body&quot;.</p>

<p>If you have good presenters, rotate and pick a topic each week and have someone plan a 45 minute talk with questions. Corbett Report videos are about an hour, which is a good length for this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Quick question. How did you go about advertising for this meeting? Was it mostly through word of mouth with people who are already suspicious? Or did you put up fliers etc?</p>
