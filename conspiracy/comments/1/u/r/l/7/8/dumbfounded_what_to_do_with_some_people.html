       Now I know people don't have to believe things, that's their right, but today the subject of September 11 was brought up with my mother, and she refused to believe anything about a third tower falling, or basically anything that has been discovered in the wake of the tragedy, also saying that we shouldn't dig too deep and let the government do what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was dumbfounded, I had to end the conversation (which she quickly tried to make about God and religion...). It's a problem I have with her every day on every subject, she just cannot be reasoned with, how do you deal with these people?

       In your case you can find out why your Mother believes what she does and what her source is both media and family/friends.

       Please don't let this harm your relationship, Mother's are more important than winning political arguments.

       You can only do so much.  Drop hints and occasionally show them proof.   Dont hassle them.. people will wake up when its their time.   Remember, this isn't just about evil secret societies doing evil secret things and we need to stop them quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit has to play out.  People are on their own timelines.  Work on yourself.  Speak out against injustices and make a stand, but don't let sleeping people bother you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like you gotta market your message, and be patient.  Can you imagine soicety all waking up at the same time and being pissed at the Same time?  It can't happen that way and it shouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep researching yourself, go deeper.

       It is truly ironic, people in this subreddit often claim that only one viewpoint is offered to them by official government accounts yet the same people that complain about that are completely fine with only showing them one side of the story from the conspiracy files.

       Well it may be ironic, but it is untrue.

       Anyone who has seen the 'conspiracy files' side has automatically seen both sides, and is therefore in a position to judge for themselves the truth.

       I guess you can catch some at the "I just don't give a F%$ what people think anymore" stage. I've also seen a couple of older people with index numbers tattooed on their forearms that would possibly believe their government might not have their best interests in mind.

       I agree, we need to talk to each other and the people we know in order to grow awareness. while it is a volatile issue, if you present your questions intelligently, your friends/family should be more likely to see the facts than some youtube video they can ignore

       My family is the same way, and I think a lot of it comes from it being so frightening to accept that a government might do that to it's own people.  I stopped trying to get anyone in my family to question what's presented to them by the media since it only seems to cause them a great amount of stress. Ignorance is bliss I guess.

       I've learned not to bring it up anymore, because you can't make everyone see it and you've got to respect their view even if you think it's wrong.  I'm sure they think I'm crazy for being an atheist and are saddened by it, but they respect my views enough not to pressure me with it so I try and return the favor. To each their own.

       Put a documentary on the TV, something she trusts, and don't try to convince her solely yourself or through your own words.
      </p>
      <p>
       If she trusts Fox News, find the best Fox News clips to show her sometime on the TV.  Like the

      </p>
      <p>
       If its religion she wants to talk about.  Find some passages from the Bible about standing up to evil etc.  Or use the money changers story to expose her to some good documentaries on the federal reserve system.

       I had a similar conversation with my mother about pot the other day. She conceded that it was harmless, but wouldn't budge on it's legal status. She insisted government knows best. Blindly supporting authority makes my head spin. Let me know how to deal with it if you can figure it out.

       Many people "blindly support authority" because that's just the way they are wired.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago I realized that a lot of people KNOW things are fucked up, and they even suspect who the culprits are, but just to acknowledge it is so difficult that they retreat into their shells.  Kind of sad for them, actually.

       Interesting, I'll have to look into that. No matter the author, I think the sentiment is good to keep in mind- one's duty to the state (if one believes there is such a thing) has nothing to do with one's duty to God (if one believes there is such a thing).
