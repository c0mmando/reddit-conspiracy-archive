<p>I was dumbfounded, I had to end the conversation (which she quickly tried to make about God and religion...). It&#39;s a problem I have with her every day on every subject, she just cannot be reasoned with, how do you deal with these people?</p>

<p>Shit has to play out.  People are on their own timelines.  Work on yourself.  Speak out against injustices and make a stand, but don&#39;t let sleeping people bother you.   </p>

<p>I feel like you gotta market your message, and be patient.  Can you imagine soicety all waking up at the same time and being pissed at the Same time?  It can&#39;t happen that way and it shouldn&#39;t.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family is the same way, and I think a lot of it comes from it being so frightening to accept that a government might do that to it&#39;s own people.  I stopped trying to get anyone in my family to question what&#39;s presented to them by the media since it only seems to cause them a great amount of stress. Ignorance is bliss I guess. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned not to bring it up anymore, because you can&#39;t make everyone see it and you&#39;ve got to respect their view even if you think it&#39;s wrong.  I&#39;m sure they think I&#39;m crazy for being an atheist and are saddened by it, but they respect my views enough not to pressure me with it so I try and return the favor. To each their own.</p>

<p>If she trusts Fox News, find the best Fox News clips to show her sometime on the TV.  Like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8IuCGwwxMs">Israeli Spy expose</a> they did in December of 2001.</p>

<p>If its religion she wants to talk about.  Find some passages from the Bible about standing up to evil etc.  Or use the money changers story to expose her to some good documentaries on the federal reserve system.  </p>
