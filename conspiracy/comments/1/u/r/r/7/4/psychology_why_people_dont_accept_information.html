       When confronted with information that might indicate horrible truths people have several cognitive resistances to it. The information that is received is translated into something else, and can ultimately turn into a fanatical denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The following psychological processes are active:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       1)
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">
        cognitive dissonance
       </a>
       <br/>
       Humans strive for internal consistency, therefore make up ideas to restore the consistency.
       <br/>
       2)
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism">
        Denialism
       </a>
       <br/>
       Deny reality as a way to avoid dealing with an uncomfortable truth.
       <br/>
       3)
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_standard">
        Double standards
       </a>
       <br/>
       The application of sometimes impossible "principles" to get rid of the uncomfortable information.
       <br/>
       4)
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy">
        Hypocrisy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These processes are often sub-conscious. Most people are not aware that this is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        There are logical factors that strengthen these factors:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       1) Trust  - trust in the system and experts that gives you false information.
       <br/>
       2) Repetition - repeating this false information by the media.
       <br/>
       3) Supposed help from possible harmful organizations
       <br/>
       - a - we can get more food or money of we do
       <br/>
       - b - science advances, if we do
       <br/>
       4) Supposed threat - we need to do this, otherwise something goes wrong.
       <br/>
       - a) Some people may kill us if we don't (terrorism)
       <br/>
       - b) Some people may die
       <br/>
       - c) Some technology may be lost
       <br/>
       5) new technology - newer is always better
       <br/>
       6) hail science!
       <br/>
       - a - Not understood or miscalculated consequences. (antibiotics, influence of electricity/magnetism on biology)
       <br/>
       - b - not understood science. (UFOs?)
       <br/>
       - c - Biased scientific researche(r)s  (money /status involved)
       <br/>
       x )) and many more
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But then there are two big sub-conscious factors:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       1) FEAR!
       <br/>
       - the more fear this truth gives the more likely your mind tries to hide it.
       <br/>
       2) HORROR!
       <br/>
       - the more horror is happening the more likely your mind is numbed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The greater these factors are, the more likely most people are going into cognitive dissonance, or even some kind of hypnosis.
       <br/>
       The Jews in the 2nd world-war could not resist because their minds were numbed. And other people could not accept the full truth of what was happening.
       <br/>
       And we see that over and over again in history. If there is too much violence, people start losing their minds in many ways. Including that their minds are not really accepting what is happening. Do kid-soldiers and their victims understand that they are wasting lives? Do we understand it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do people in the US understand what their soldiers are doing in the war-zones? Do they understand that/why there is a war? What horrors are going on there? The idea that a democracy has turned into a war-machine is pretty scary. Torture is even very horrifying. The mind is easily bend into accepting the given idea of our: "fight against terrorism".
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at how the media and people react on the NSA spying on
everyone. It is actually very fear-full having someone following your moves continuously. Fear stimulates cognitive dissonance, and that produces ideas that it is not so bad after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I apply the same rules on the big conspiracies here:
       <br/>
       1) JFK. - The horror that the government might be behind it, and the fear for having a complete corrupt government is great.
       <br/>
       2) 911/ false-flag? - The idea that some people in the CIA or whatever might be behind it is soo horrific, no mind can fully accept that. And we did see planes and we have seen some bad guys, making the popular conclusion very tempting for the sub-conscious mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        how it may be used
       </strong>
       <br/>
       There might be a group within the secret services that know how to use techniques of fear and horror to control a huge group of people. The Russians have used it for a long time to make everyone follow the communism. Controlling a democracy seems more difficult, but it seems to be possible using psychological tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But how do we free ourselves and others from cognitive dissonance?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       1) Make fear go away. Make jokes/ use absurd humor.
       <br/>
       Examples:
       <br/>
       (not meant to offend anyone, just showing how to make the unacceptable more acceptable)
       <br/>
       <em>
        Why did they blow up the twin towers?
        <br/>
        To prevent more planes from crashing into them.
        <br/>
        Why did they stop waterboarding?
        <br/>
        They ran out of water in the desert.
        <br/>
        I am not afraid of the NSA spying on me.
        <br/>
        I am not a sexy female.
       </em>
       <br/>
       2) Make the horror reality acceptable, and add a possible good end
       <br/>
       Example:
       <br/>
       <em>
        I hope that we can stop the killing of children in the war-lands
and that there may be a peace in their country. And I hope
that these people may forgive us for what we did to them and
their country, but whatever their choice,
I will always look for an answer that will result in a mutual peace
and where we can all live in harmony. 
And I think these children need schools and safe places to live,
        <br/>
        an environment that is peaceful.
        <br/>
        And while some people may think we can get more of them by 
plundering their lands, my idea of richness is not money but
the harmony and peace that we can get by working together
to rebuild their lands.
       </em>

       Through indoctrination and reinforcement by parents themselves, the state becomes like a de facto invisible parent for many people, beginning from infancy. Therefore, presenting ideas that conflict with the ideas presented and supported by the state is equivalent to a personal attack on a family member to some on a subconscious level.

       It's strange that conspiracy theorists use this as a reason why normal people don't believe in their conspiracies while normal people generally see conspiracies as a way for theorists to avoid facing the reality of an event.
