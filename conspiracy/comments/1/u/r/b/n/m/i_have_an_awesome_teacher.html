This semester we have been learning about law enforcement, and this unit we are learning about terrorism and the 4th amendment. Last week, my teacher took 3 class periods to explain the facts about 9/11, show us a video, and just debate about what we think happened. He made our class a really open environment for conversations about conspiracies, which has added a lot of class discussion about whatever we are talking about every day since then. I know teachers are usually pretty against discussions like this, and I know how difficult it must be administratively to make this happen. I just wanted to make sure you guys know that not everyone in the mainstream education system is against the thought processing and stuff that educators usually get a bad reputation for. </p>

People seem to honestly think every Cop is corrupt, that every teacher is told to install a sense of apathy, that nobody is doing the right thing.  I think a lot of them are just afraid.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Concerning indeed.  Cop&#39;s should not murder those they are to protect.  Teacher&#39;s should be instrumental to the advancement of a future society, not an obstacle we encounter at an early age.  However, I don&#39;t believe this sub would be so quick to jump to cast a label if we weren&#39;t so actively seeking instances of corruption.  Good deeds are done every day, but much like OP&#39;s post are rarely recognized.</p>
