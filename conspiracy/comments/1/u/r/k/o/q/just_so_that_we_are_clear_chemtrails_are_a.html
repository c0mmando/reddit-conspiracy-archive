        I recall another Redditor doing something similar for Fluoride. From this link alone, I learned alot, and shared it with others.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it might be beneficial to create a trove of documents and articles that support the various claims that we are making? (similar to this, and similar to the fluoride one)
      </p>
      <p>
       This may be beneficial to lurkers and newbies, as they would have all the info conveniently presented for them to click and read and make their own judgement. In turn this would hopefully eliminate or discourage the frivolous discourse and confusion that the conspirtards and shills often bring to this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be beneficial if we would vote on the best links, and information to put in these troves. By having these on hand, whenever someone posts sensationalist/fear-mongering/bs links or discussion. Boom. Here you go.

       That story freaks me the fuck out. They coated an entire town in aluminum silicate at low altitude? They have practice areas for that, there's no reason to cover a populated town with it. And no one seemed to care. Sometimes I feel like I'm taking crazy pills... Are people really this apathetic?

       Yes they are. The fluoride and vaccines have done their job. People have been so poisoned that most of them barely qualify as conscious anymore. Try presenting people with a novel situation, they freak out. The reactions of most adults now are similar to dogs, no real concious mentation, just reaction to stimuli.

       I'm not entirely sure why you're being downvoted, other than people might think it's rude to say this about other people.

       I don't necessarily believe you are looking down on those around you by having this opinion of the average person.  As truly sad as it is, when you start to realize the extent, nature, and degree to which "something" in our society has caused us to poison ourselves into stupidity, you have to admit, u/Zebraton is mostly correct in their description,

       BUT..that doesn't mean you have to be pessimistic about it at all. I for one believe the situation is starting to get better, and I'm not just saying that to make myself feel better.

       I would have prefered that you used words...but what should I expect from you?

       If that confuses you, I mean: You  could have typed out and fashioned your own argument...but that would require a command of intellectual constructs you're not capable of.

       That wasn't really direct at you so much as it was directed at others who read your comment; a reminder, if you will ,that concluding everyone around you who doesn't agree with you is being poisoned into idiocy is probably a product more of ones own cognitive biases than a critical evaluation of the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might realize as much yourself if you stepped down from your high horse and didn't immediately attribute disagreement with you as either brain damage or lacking comprehension of intellectual constructs.

       Otherwise, you might be falling prey to confirmation bias. I posted a link up-thread regarding it when someone made a similar claim that failed to take it into account so that others could see it and take note. You should check it out.

       I guess the conspiracy is 'what' are they spraying and 'why'? Weather modification is certainly one reason, in fact here's another r/conspiracy post about that, and from Yahoo news;

       Weather modification is certainly a beautiful cover if there are other nefarious reasons for spraying the atmosphere.

       The theory of chemtrails that seems most prevalent here is that contrails that don't dissipate in a way one would intuitively think they should are laced with chemicals to achieve some end. Which is of course is dramatically unsupported by empirical evidence.

       How is it dramatically unsupported by empirical evidence? Because YOU don't go outside? Because YOU dont notice what's going on above your head?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen them laying down these chemtrails with my own two eyes. I've watched the way they intersect and evenly space themselves apart into a giant grid. I've literally sat and watched as they fly by overhead opening and closing the valve on those things to form a neatly laid out pattern. I've witnessed those same lines in the sky persist overnight and dissipate the next day into a slight haze making the mountains in the near distance barely visible while the sun shines with an overwhelming glare. Don't tell me there's no empirical evidence. The longer people like you sit on their thumbs with this the worse the recovery will be for ALL of us. Stop giving these crooks the benefit of the doubt when they did nothing to earn it and everything possible to lose your respect. It's just pathetic at this point.

       When you take what Ive seen and then ask the internet what the fuck that new haze and lingering line in the sky is that you dont remember seeing a few years ago, ...... I dont see your point in denying this. Are you getting something out of it? I'm not getting anything out of arguing with people like you, I just want it to fucking stop. Your denial just keeps it going. Dont you understand that? Maybe you do...

       Youre wasting your time on me if you think youre going to convince me that what I saw and keep seeing are goddamned contrails. Youre a stupid motherfucker for even entertaining that weak ass excuse. The fuck is wrong with you? Seriously.

       The theory is that the government never stopped spraying, and perhaps increased the amount of programs. This is r/conspiracy, not r/skeptic. If you aren't a conspiracy theorist, then I have to ask why you're here.

       Fact-checking. "Conspiracy" theory or not, a theory should be both factually correct and logically follow. Some succeed on both counts, others don't.

       Besides, I've seen this place used to plan political action related to various conspiracy theories, which is perfectly fair by my standards. But I will speak up if A.) That political action will affect me and B). The motivation behind such political action is not evidenced based.

       You should have seen the sky of Cincinnati last Saturday before the storm hit. THEY WERE EVERYWHERE. They crisscrossed the sky several times. This was just before the storm hit the Midwest, so I suspect they were lacing the clouds with something that would get rained onto the populace.

       Dude these are NOT clouds, they are TRAILS that come from PLANES.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen planes flying in the sky for my whole life ( I am 24 ), and when they pass over they leave a contrail which dissipates not too long after it passes, which gives it the appearance of having a long "tail".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen on many occasions the trails of heavy fuel propelled devices such as rocket propelled aircraft, and they leave a trail which lingers for longer in the sky due to the chemicals being burned and their resulting emissions spewing out into the sky which obviously creates the trail.

       Since I have become aware of their presence and appearance, I have started to notice CHEMTRAILING, where in these trails are left in criss-cross patterns that just linger in the sky for what seems like forever as they slowly dissipate outwards and drift slowly downwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a clear difference between all three of these, and chemtrails are most definitely proven through photographic evidence.

       You literally can not deny chemtrails as I've stated earlier, these activities are done daily all over the globe be it spraying chemicals on to crops, spraying particulate matter into the sky for Geo-engineering, and the proven secret government projects that sprayed chemicals on completely unsuspecting populations of people such as in St. Louis.

       I have no idea who is paying you to post what you do if you are indeed a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus far, you still have yet to answer multiple of my questions, such as why you can't post picture proof of your supposed FAA License with sensitive information redacted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you also unable to post any link which clearly demonstrates through reputable scientific evidence as to how all of these things you claim to be "mistaken contrails" are just that, and not chemtrails of some sort?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind you, a chemtrail is any trail left by a plane which is a purposeful emission of chemicals for multiple various purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the lingering lines in the sky are not chemtrails, because you mostly can't see the chemtrails as they're spraying such microscopic particulate matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real evidence of that are planes who are spraying very thin mists that don't leave long trails of anything, as those are more than likely the aerosol spraying planes, especially when the spray is observed coming from the location on the plane where these devices are known to be installed.

       It's not really a conspiracy that planes have been used to spray chemicals for various purposes over the years. The conspiracy, as I've come to understand it, is that the government is secretly using commercial airliners to spray chemicals for either weather modification or mind control, and that this is evidenced by contrails that linger for extended periods of time. I think this is the theory that most people think is complete bullshit.

       Fuck Joe Rogan, he is nothing more than a little punk on his knees serving the elite so he can hold on to his lame "media career". It's a shame too, but he sold out big time.

       I'm curious as to how you think commentating on UFC fights and hosting an internet podcast about alternative history, spirituality and conspiracy is
       <em>
        selling out
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        serving the elite.
       </em>
       Do you have any examples to back up your mud slinging?

       Did you read the links the OP posted? They were doing a lot more than cloud seeding including dropping chemicals that mimic biological weapons to see how they would spread.

       Even if it was just cloud seeding, fuck that. That shit doesnt belong up there and you'd have to be about retarded to leave something with such a high chance of unnecessary disaster in the hands of these dimwits. You should try graduating to the blocks with letters on them.

       Yes they are. The fluoride and vaccines have done their job. People have been so poisoned that most of them barely qualify as conscious anymore. Try presenting people with a novel situation, they freak out. The reactions of most adults now are similar to dogs, no real concious mentation, just reaction to stimuli.
