       Mods not sure if this is the right sub...At our grocery store I noticed the price of Kraft Mac 'n' Cheese boxes went up in price about 14cents during the 1st of the month. I remember not too long ago these would go on sale for 3 boxes for a dollar. Tortillas went up double in price from just a couple years ago. This is what I suspect: when Food Stamps were an actual "stamp" -a food coupon one tore off of a stack like paper checks, these were put out by the US Dept of Agriculture. Since we switched over to the EBT card, the plastic debit card, it is done by JP Morgan (JP Morgan is printed on the back of the card) thus creating money,
       <em>
        food
       </em>
       money (since the card can only be used to purchase food) out of thin air. What happens when you start printing money? Inflation. Food money inflation= food inflation. All of the cheaper foods that people on food stamps are known to buy have skyrocketed in price. Is this not a direct result of the usage of the EBT card? Previous user of food stamps here- no offense meant- just stating something that is
       <em>
        not talked about
       </em>
       anywhere. Why? Why aren't people talking about this? I can't be the only one. This is NOT regular inflation.

       Thank  you for posting this information.
I've noticed the food prices increasing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lets face facts you won't hear that from the main stream media because they are owned by corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally no bad news gets reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just more bailouts i.e inflation
      </p>
      <p>
       Food is going to be really really expensive.

       Anyone notice a pack of heirloom veggie seeds went from $2 to $3.90? Yeah, probably not. I grow my own non gmo food. I save my seeds. Inflation is a bitch.

       Not necessarily! The old fashioned coupons were put out by the USDA- conversely, it was also more "shameful" or more embarrassing to use them by the recipients (you handed out "Monopoly money" to the cashier) the EBT card is quite different. It is all done by JP Morgan now. Oh I wish an economist would jump in on this to clarify it for me and everyone else. What I am trying to say is, this EBT card debacle is making food go up sky high, much more than regular inflation levels, and it will NEVER ever go back down again unless something catastrophic will occur. This is terrible what JP Morgan has done. Terrible!

       what's making food prices go up is poor growing seasons, using corn for fuel instead of food, and the cost of energy to grow, process, and ship. not that the method the government chooses to dole out help.

       Government is collaborating with the corporations for mutual benefit.

       Government wants more control, through more people reliant on them for food stamps and benefits (Which are paid for by other taxpayers anyway)

       Exactly. This was my point but I'm not very eloquent in this vein and it's pretty much what I wanted to say, but you know, I wish more people were talking about this. This is a big thing. 
On the domestic front though, seems to me no one is up in arms about these prices, it's insane! Why isn't this headline news? Why aren't people marching with pitchforks? My cousin said in Europe the people have manifestations if their cigarettes go up a few cents.

       no- I disagree. It's particularly
       <em>
        food
       </em>
       that is going up way more, and "food stamp" type foods: kraft mac n cheese, tortillas, block cheese, ground beef. I do understand inflation and cost of living and etc rather well. What I am trying to post here needs more attention than it is getting, and I wish someone with more clout would address this very important issue.

       there are many sources and much data that refute your statement. One cannot merely brush off the food inflation issue as mere inflation along with other unrelated inflation.

       Do you know what an Emerging Market is?
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't exist in America. So I'm positive your EBT card isn't what's causing food inflation in third world countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you've posted so much here in disagreement with people pointing out this simple fact is a demonstration of your insistence to be ignorant.

       Who cares about 3rd world countries. I'm talking about the USA and food prices.

       Yes, and if you contained the ability to actually comprehend the words on the screen in front of you, you'd realize the article you linked to is not about USA food prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, you'd understand why I referred to 3rd world countries because that's where the emerging markets are... as the article you linked to pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore - I'd really love for you to explain how the price changes in the article from a year is related to EBT (even though they are talking about price changes outside of the US).

       I don't think you know what your own point was/is.

       Inflation=higher prices for same or lesser product.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly didn't deny that food and other necessity prices are up, only that they always go up during hard times for people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason is easy.  If a store has to take in 10K per month and everyone stops buying chocolate, the price of hamburger has to go up to take up the slack, as do all the prices of all staple foods and necessary items, toilet paper is a favorite to raise the price on during hard times.

       I know what inflation is, who doesn't- my point was food inflation as opposed to say, general inflation. Seems to me you are brushing it off as mere general inflation. Toilet paper hasn't gone up the way cheap foods have. Just doesn't compare. Did you see the link that I provided about food inflation compared to other things?

       FYI the foostamp program allows you to purchase seeds on EBT. Just thought I'd add this info. Many people do not know this. It can empower a lot of families to grow a small garden for food security. If they grow heirloom they can save the seeds. Food for life basically.

       I wish more people on EBT would take advantage of this. I wonder if there is a way to count the numbers if anyone is buying seeds with it? Would be interesting.

       lol I don't eat Kraft mac n cheese! But a lot of people on EBT do. I eat homemade stuff, I'm in to eating well. My point about Kraft and other foods was not a complaint about what I buy but what others buy.
