       OP, I think we are all fortune tellers. I agree with your pattern observation, but would like to see some data points on where ISON it, if it is actually still there, or if it's nothing. If my incredulity seems strange, please consider the number of posts on ISON that have come to nothing.

       Thanks. It's not the comet itself, it's the tail of streaming debris behind it that hasn't reached the sun yet. We'll be crossing right through several million miles of that stuff for a week starting 10 January roughly. NASA says it will be harmless and will dust the earth mildly. But that's not what happened 333 years ago, this time. Also 666 years ago, this time. And before that. And more than freaking likely before that. Etc.

       I thought ISON was a new comet? Last i read, they were saging its period was much longer than 333 yrs, something around a few thousand i believe. I wasnt aware if they had changed their mind on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, anyone who is interested in this idea can google comets and plagues and you can see a weird correlation between pandemics/plagues and notable comets. This was one of the reasons the ancients thought of comets as harbringers of death...

      </p>
      <p>
       There were other plagues breaking out and happening before and after so you can say that the plague-from-a-single-comet hypothesis is oversimplified as it may have been a cluster. The
       <a href="https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php?topic=29292.0">
        notable comet activity
       </a>
       observed around the 17th century plagues years is rather spooky when you take into account the +- 300 year interval of reports involving bright comet sightings and chaos, disease, and destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, it points to a plausible hypothesis that comet dust / debris may have contributed to a weakening of the immune system which would result in widespread plagues. Additionally, the comets' mass/gravity/composition may also have played a role in electromagnetic/geomagnetic disturbances resulting in the associated earthquakes and tsunamis also widely reported along this particular interval of comet activity.

       39 people died. But it's not about the plague only. If that was even what happened. There's a better theory (imo) that the Black Death was actual factual space debris bringing poisonous and toxic dust to Earth.

       You can imagine the debris trail as a river flowing towards the sun, full of icy rocks, meteors, asteroids, toxic gases, possibly bacteria, all sorts of nasty outer space shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth is crossing that river, which is several million miles wide, over the course of 10 Jan - 20 Jan roughly. See for yourself at

       Even NASA says the Earth will likely be 'coated' in a bit of space dust. 
But what they don't mention is that humans have had foreknowledge of this 333 year cycle of space doom for thousands of years... Why would those who know exactly what it means (i.e. NASA and yes, the Vatican too) suddenly tell us the truth? You see how Biblical this is? It's not only Biblical, but Mayans knew it too and they literally designed their calendar to end on 2013 because this is possibly the big one.

       But if it's going to hit us in 2014, that's not a 333 year cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       That'd be 334 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why the fear mongering? The earth is being bombarded by space dust and debris all the time, ever seen a 'shooting star'? Meteor showers?

       The debris trail takes a while to impact, or cross, with Earth. The ancestors who knew this was going to happen based their human expiration date warnings in symbols depicting dragons, phoenixes, birds, snakes. You can find these symbols (which are utterly cryptic without the context) in ancient art, religion, architecture, astrology, history, etc. Research references to this event with the Hopi, the Mayans, the Egyptians, and also in the Bible and secret societies (this is the kind of knowledge you'd want to keep a centuries long secret for, is it not?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Put on your detective Googles, please. GLP has a lot of really insane but seriously spot-on threads about this. I suggest you start with ISON and see how things start adding up and getting cumulatively more coincidental until it becomes screamingly obvious what the hell is going on here on Earth right now already. Or is that all due to Fukushima? That's a rhetorical question... I hope you can suspend disbelief of everything you've heard about ISON and start digging into the secret side of it. Give it half an hour and you'll start to understand. If not, eh... Sorry to waste your time.

       It was made clear already but I will repeat... 333 years puts us at 2013 when the comet slingshot around the sun and now it's on it's way back which just happens to be after the New Years
