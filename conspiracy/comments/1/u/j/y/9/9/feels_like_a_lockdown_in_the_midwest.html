        this article

       I know the area I am in (Chicago) got hit pretty bad, only places I have heard them tell people to keep off was some stuff in Indiana, but they do not salt and plow the roads like they do here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it is they just don't want the idiots that do not understand how to drive in these conditions to be out, because then the police/fire and tow trucks have to go get them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a coworker with a larger 4x4 truck who went around the barricades they put to close some of the highway, he just drove around it and passed by several people stuck with police helping to push and dig.

       I lived in a snowbound region for almost two decades, and I can definitely tell you that most of the vehicles I saw stuck were 4x4s. The common misconception made by those that buy them is that 4x4's somehow keep you on the road. This isn't even usually true. 4x4's can help get you moving, but they mean nothing in terms of stability.
      </p>
      <p>
       So people with 4x4's that have never been told this get over confident and try to drive 'normal' or even 'fast' in bad conditions. And into the ditch they go.

       It's true that 4x4 offers many a feeling of undue over-confidence, but I think the bigger issue is vehicles marketed as 4x4 that really are not. Sure, there is power to all 4 wheels, but if you have open differentials it makes no difference. Contrary to popular belief it is possible to drive a 4x4 responsibly in bad weather when necessary.

       O I am not implying that you can not get stuck in a 4x4, as someone who has owned them before, nothing will really stop you from once ice is involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a 4x4 is an advantage when you don't try drive like there is no snow out there. You have to start slowly, stop shorter, and not accelerate as fast.

       only the dumbest of the dumb would classify this as just 'bad weather', you dont know what the fuck you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night you couldn't travel because there was 4+ feet of snow in the roadway. When people travel unnecessarily they get stuck (because people are stupid) and this causes first respondents to then put themselves at risk to deal with stupid people.

       In a state of emergency they have the option of issuing a $400 fine if there is no reason for you to be on the road. Spare me the macho, we dont live in the north pole like Canadians eh.  This is a very serious storm. And you dont drive your "sports car" through 4 feet of snow, liar. haha :)

       I'm driving a Saab 97-X and bottoming out in some places. If I didn't have snow tires and 4WD I wouldn't be able to go anywhere. The drifts are making for a rough time even with the plows.

       Nah, I just have an odd love for that car, lol. I attempted to use some logic, yet something else always prevails. Trust me, it's crazy here on the IL side of STL too lol. I walk to get around, laughing at the entire STREET I get to walk on, sometimes 4 lane highways without anyone else around. Although that wind has been kicking my ass.

       Northwest Ohio here.  Most counties are in lockdown and it is possible to be fined our arrested for being on the roads.  Honestly... you probably don't want to be out anyway since it is -15 &amp; roads are iced over with 8" or so of snow with large drifts.
Frostbite can set in in under ten minutes on bare skin. 
Wind chill is like -30 forecast to be down to -40 or so tonight.

       Northwest Ohio declared a "Level 3 snow emergency" which requires all vehicles to stay off the road except for essential employees and first respondents

       Interesting:
      </p>
      <p>
       "According to a state legal opinion, that means only emergency vehicles are allowed on city and county roads.  Schools are closed, and your vehicular freedom is temporarily halted."
      </p>
      <p>
       "According to Ohio Attorney General Opinion 86-023, the Sheriff of a county may declare a snow emergency and temporarily close county and township roads within his jurisdiction for the preservation of the public peace."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you could argue against this opinion. That's kinda shitty that you can be fined due to someone's legal opinion :P

       During D.C.'s Snowmageddon back in 2010 they did the same thing. Roads were extremely bad, a 40 min drive to work took 4 hours. Snow was piling up 2-3 feet in areas. I was forced to drive to work or face losing my job (security guard, I've moved on to an office job). Interstate 95 was insane with the amount of people off on the sides and the amount of accidents was boggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       During extreme weather they really do do this for public safety.

       That depends fully on the county you are in, and what level Snow Emergency that county is in.

       We had a good dumping of snow before the weekend in New England, but last night and this morning was 40-60 degrees and pouring rain. It's a slushy mess in the yard. At 20 degrees &amp; falling, it's a clusterfuck of black ice now. Peeing the dog is potentially dangerous! Fucccccck this.

       Yesterday in South Central PA, we had freezing rain and they were telling everyone to not travel unless you had to.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't get as severe cold temps as everyone out west did, and I heard on the radio this morning that it's a law in some places that only emergency vehicles are allowed in severe weather conditions; unless you yourself have an emergency.

       In the STL metro area(IL Side) we have a shit ton of snow, hasn't been seen for 20 years(1984). Although this is the case, people around here tend to do whatever the hell they want. I walk everywhere, and I have a carhartt cold suit that is amazing. While walking, you could hear people in 4 wheelers and such cruising around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people drive like idiots, but that's because they ARE idiots. Needless to say, it would take quite a bit to keep people in their homes around here. -32F? Lol, walking to the gas station, bring it mother nature. The 14' snow piles in parking lots are pretty cool too.

       In Wisconsin here and there is no lockdowns yet here. Most schools are closed for a few days, but we haven't seen the worst yet. We have the cold, but not a whole lot of snow. It's nasty outside with temps of 30 and 40 below before wind chill.

       Nah, I just have an odd love for that car, lol. I attempted to use some logic, yet something else always prevails. Trust me, it's crazy here on the IL side of STL too lol. I walk to get around, laughing at the entire STREET I get to walk on, sometimes 4 lane highways without anyone else around. Although that wind has been kicking my ass.
