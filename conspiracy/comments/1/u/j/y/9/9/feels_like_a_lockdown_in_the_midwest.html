Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard upgraded the city&#39;s travel emergency level to &quot;red,&quot; making it illegal for anyone to drive except for emergencies or to seek shelter.

<p>The way I see it is they just don&#39;t want the idiots that do not understand how to drive in these conditions to be out, because then the police/fire and tow trucks have to go get them out. </p>

<p>I have a coworker with a larger 4x4 truck who went around the barricades they put to close some of the highway, he just drove around it and passed by several people stuck with police helping to push and dig. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ex-northerner here. </p>

<p>I lived in a snowbound region for almost two decades, and I can definitely tell you that most of the vehicles I saw stuck were 4x4s. The common misconception made by those that buy them is that 4x4&#39;s somehow keep you on the road. This isn&#39;t even usually true. 4x4&#39;s can help get you moving, but they mean nothing in terms of stability. </p>

<p>So people with 4x4&#39;s that have never been told this get over confident and try to drive &#39;normal&#39; or even &#39;fast&#39; in bad conditions. And into the ditch they go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that 4x4 offers many a feeling of undue over-confidence, but I think the bigger issue is vehicles marketed as 4x4 that really are not. Sure, there is power to all 4 wheels, but if you have open differentials it makes no difference. Contrary to popular belief it is possible to drive a 4x4 responsibly in bad weather when necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>O I am not implying that you can not get stuck in a 4x4, as someone who has owned them before, nothing will really stop you from once ice is involved. </p>

<p>But a 4x4 is an advantage when you don&#39;t try drive like there is no snow out there. You have to start slowly, stop shorter, and not accelerate as fast. </p>

<p>Interesting:</p>

<p>&quot;According to a state legal opinion, that means only emergency vehicles are allowed on city and county roads.  Schools are closed, and your vehicular freedom is temporarily halted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;According to Ohio Attorney General Opinion 86-023, the Sheriff of a county may declare a snow emergency and temporarily close county and township roads within his jurisdiction for the preservation of the public peace.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you could argue against this opinion. That&#39;s kinda shitty that you can be fined due to someone&#39;s legal opinion :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During D.C.&#39;s Snowmageddon back in 2010 they did the same thing. Roads were extremely bad, a 40 min drive to work took 4 hours. Snow was piling up 2-3 feet in areas. I was forced to drive to work or face losing my job (security guard, I&#39;ve moved on to an office job). Interstate 95 was insane with the amount of people off on the sides and the amount of accidents was boggling.</p>

<p>During extreme weather they really do do this for public safety.</p>

<p>My dad&#39;s a trucker, he was telling me the other day about hoping to make it through some pass before they physically closed it with a bar.</p>
