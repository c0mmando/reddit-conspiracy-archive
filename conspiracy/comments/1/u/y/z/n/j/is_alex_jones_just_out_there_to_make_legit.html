    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with you. I disagree a little with him, too. The character is that of the Saving Voice, so his paranoia would understandably lead him to shout bigger, louder, more impassioned things. But he is just scaring people into buying his advertisers&#39; stuff. And a lot of those ads are scams. But, it&#39;s controlled opposition. Notice he never talks about Israel really, or the Zionists in any real detail except to add that J00 spice. He&#39;s a figure head that people see, and more importantly people like conspiratardians to see and it&#39;s useful for fodder against any real truth seeking. 2% truth, 98% filler that you can connect for yourself. It&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who cares if he makes money and so do his advertisers. I&#39;m a Libertarian who thinks he could be shifty, but not because he makes money. It&#39;s ad hominem and therefore a logical fallacy. Would you disagree? I haven&#39;t heard him say anything at least feasible to some reasonable degree given his public appearance. That&#39;s why don&#39;t listen to him, there are other resources besides him directly.</p>

<p>Just my intuition is why I don&#39;t listen to him. Really just don&#39;t like his vibes. No offense to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not an ad hominem attack to criticize him for making money by pushing products directed at his audience. It raises the same exact conflict of interest inherent in <em>every other</em> mainstream media source.</p>

<p>This is of course <em>ironic</em> because AJ touts himself as an example of an alternative to mainstream media.</p>

<p>However, he is certainly no alternative to their business model of applied psychoanalysis as a tool to stimulate consumption. </p>

<p>But even if he doesn&#39;t use it, so what? How many business owners use  the advertisements they have on their websites or TV? Its called advertisement for a reason, they make money off of it, so they can continue running the business, its called free market, your socialist bullshit always turns into communist China, Soviet Russia, North Korea, if you love it so much, go live there.</p>

<p>Second gold isn&#39;t permitted in use, its a federal crime to purchase with gold, you can only basically barter, but just because you don&#39;t agree something doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t use.</p>

<p>I mean I may not like mobile phones and how they are basically spy devices, but its still useful, you still need to use it in order to operate, not using it would be stupid, retarded, moronic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It&#39;s controlled opposition. The information is all out there, they can&#39;t stop it or hide it anymore. But they can controll how it&#39;s presented. Everything nowadays is more or less controlled opposition. First they lure you in with common sense and powerful ideas, the truth and then dillute and perverse it into something else. These kind of techniques are endless. Its all about How we connect to information subconciously and emotionally. </p>

<p>Alex Jones is definately controlled opposition but lately i&#39;ve been thinking that even the whole Ron Paul movement might very well be also. He was supposedly our &quot;Revolution&quot;. It was all in the air. Ron Paul was designed to break the tention. It&#39;s just how it all got presented to us. What do you think now about the Ron Paul movement and the progress it represents. Here we have an old skinny sicly looking man leading us to freedom pushing papers in a small office somewhere. There goes so much subtle manipulation on his public appearances that subconciously manipulates us to associating the movement into something old, weary and worthless. Technical glitches and so on. 
And then there was the whole r/circlejerk takeover designed only to ridicule, not only Ron Paul but the ideas he represent. It&#39;s a scary thought but what if Ron Paul was our revolution. And look what came out of it. Then theres Alex Jones Who plays out the crazy agenda...
But yeah, ever wondered why there never is a strong, confident honest male leader anywhere in politics, with objectives such as civil liberties and abolishing the federal reserve and so on.  They all got sniped in the 60&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t lump Ron Paul in there with Alex Jones and the like.</p>

<p>Ron Paul was a doctor and flight surgeon. At the very least he knows and has practiced real medicine, so knows a good amount of the physical sciences. It&#39;s at least a basis for rational decision-making, and that in itself should be sufficient to oppose the lunacy going on these days.</p>

<p>What would be the point of supporting a global fascist regime? For one thing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STALIN#Purges_and_deportations">&quot;you can all be replaced&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>For another, if he were hypothetically put in power as &quot;Dear Leader,&quot; what would be the point? It would be like playing with a doll house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve read he ran or was considering running on the Republican ballot, with an essentially Libertarian platform. Republican is a label, and he probably figured he&#39;d garner a larger fraction of the popular vote running under a well-known and popular banner. Also some people assume that the label &quot;Libertarian&quot; = anarchist, so it would risk alienating many voters.</p>

<p>As for what he does, there&#39;s not a whole lot he <em>can</em> do without the support of his comrades, without risking character assassinatian, on account of the political climate in Washington.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he did run for the Republican ballot, do you remember 2012? He was featured in the debates. Having not successfully garnered the nomination he could&#39;ve ran an another ballot. He chose not to. </p>

<p>The idea that he could ever get the nomination is pretty silly. It&#39;s clear that the most he could achieve in a general election is a &#39;ross perot&#39; like effect, which is pretty significant in the general public. The other example that comes to mind is the bull moose party, but rp clearly isn&#39;t <em>that</em> popular. </p>

<p>Ron Paul totally riled up a support base of republican/libertarian voters, however he left these to mitt romney and gary johnson. It&#39;s a shame. I&#39;m not even a ron paul fan personally. But I think he speaks to issues many people agree about. I think he had an opportunity and didn&#39;t take it because he, like everything else, is controlled opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow this is absolute garbage. Jeffrey owns a radio network that Alex Jones show is syndicated on, just like he is syndicated on over 150 other radio networks. </p>

<p>I mean learn about reality, learn how things works, learn basic fucking concepts about radio, before you start spewing your nonsense garbage. </p>

<p>I mean I don&#39;t even want to defend AJ, I just don&#39;t care, but when I see such retarded, moronic posts like yours made of complete and utter garage with no basis in reality I can&#39;t fucking contain myself to not savage your retarded garbage. </p>

<p>He owns his own business, its called &quot;free speech systems LLC&quot; its a privately owned company established in 2010, it has two employees, Alex Jones and Kelly Jones. Both are owners of the company.</p>

<p>His radio show is registered separately as the AJ show and is a separate operation than the internet stuff.</p>

<p>Now is he a good guy, a bad guy, this or that, you can debate and argue about that all you want, I don&#39;t fucking care, I take any info and do my own research. But I&#39;m not going to allow such moronic posts in conspiracy, based on someones imagination. </p>

<p>In fact I actually do think AJ used to work for a certain Israeli group and have knowledge that even his marriage could have been arranged, but that doesn&#39;t make your stupid garbage true, okay?</p>

<p>Like seriously, stop being retard and do a fucking research and know basic stuff before you post something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry you are a foaming at the mouth Alex Jones fan, have you ever met the guy in real life? At an actual protest?, where you can see firsthand his behavior? Because I have, I was at the g20 protest in Canada, and that guy is a fucking piece of shit, literal scum of the Earth, he made it impossible to speak in an organized way, he turned a peaceful rally into a 12 year old screaming match, where even the people who might agree with 10% of what he says want him to shut the fuck up.</p>

<p>I always wrote him off as just a really stupid immature dude that wants to make money, but, after the g20 protest, and seeing him on major news networks purposely making conspiracy look horrible with his childish performances, I cannot for the life of me understand why any sentient person would buy into his fear mongering. He never tries to purpose anything he just fear mongers for ratings, if he actually cared he would do something besides spew.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got some chants on T.V great! It will go perfect with Alex Jones foaming at the mouth while screaming at Piers Morgan. The media couldn&#39;t ask for a better side segment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure nobody who was watching that broadcast searched &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot; after hearing and seeing that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what tells me you are unable to comprehend the larger picture, you had one or two good protests with AJ? Cool! He also ruins some faster than riot police, and when it really matters,  on mainstream media he makes himself and anyone associated with conspiracy theory look like a raving lunatic. </p>

<p>Why is this so hard to understand?</p>

<p>and for FFS, watch his Y2k podcast, can&#39;t really get anymore stupid and pure fear mongering than that, he does it to get more attention/views to make more money.</p>

<p><strong>If Alex Jones changed today, started spreading real valuable information and spending his money towards helping people organize he still would not negate the negative impact he has had with just his Piers Morgan shouting match.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>As soon as he started building this narcissistic schedule of him having to run his mouth four hours a day plus random youtube videos... I just got tired of him saying the same thing over-and-over day-after-day.  At least the mainstream news just reruns the same stories, Alex just blabbers continuously.  I think this has hurt his effectiveness.  The empire he is building is not something which he is particularly good at running.  A weekly two-and-a-half show would have been great.  No one has the life to just listen to 4 hours of shit every day and just pick out 20 minutes of actual material that matters.  Blabbering is just ineffective and pushes away people who value their time.  With this subreddit&#39;s /new I can cover more ground and filter out bullshit much better (don&#39;t know about you guys).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alex Jones: Father Knows Best, Updated for the Apocalypse
The times have created this man, this nexus of patriotism and fear. Depending on who you talk to, he is a plague on or a tonic to our discourse, and we should all be horrified or grateful.</p>

<p>By John H. Richardson on August 20, 2013  </p>

<p>None of this is true. However extreme and paranoid and downright cartoonish his unending stream of alarm can be, Jones believes every word he says and can prove it with a personal stash of food big enough to last three years. And if they bothered to look without prejudice, these righteous leftists would see that Jones covers issues like the drug war, the growing security state, and Monsanto&#39;s genetic modification of food exactly the way they do, just as many of his themes were echoed by the Occupy movement...&gt;<br/>
