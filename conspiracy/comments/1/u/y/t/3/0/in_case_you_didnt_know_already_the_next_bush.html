<p>IN American Politics and Business you Fail Upwards
The Next Bush  has already been chosen and he is a far better politician than Bush JR could ever dream of being, this guy is clever and devious.</p>

<p>George P. Bush - Jeb Bushes Son has been chosen . . and when I mean chosen I mean he is going to be President if we like it or not, votes do not matter.</p>

<p>George P Bush is in Texas now following the proper political course like Bush Jr did .. .most expect GPB to run in 2020</p>

<p>Remember he WILL Win, there is no option, luckily I will be out of the country by then.</p>

<p>So yeh George P. Bush + Condelleza Rice VP(my best guess) coming 2020 . . same old crew back in the White House, Rumsfeld, cheney, etc . .</p>

<p>This is from a few hours ago - George P. Bush campaign for Texas Land Commissioner to kick off statewide bus tour in Pasadena - <a href="http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/tomball/news/george-p-bush-campaign-for-texas-land-commissioner-to-kick/article_f35adb46-79a9-11e3-ad1d-001a4bcf887a.html">http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/tomball/news/george-p-bush-campaign-for-texas-land-commissioner-to-kick/article_f35adb46-79a9-11e3-ad1d-001a4bcf887a.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I just don&#39;t think it matters who is president anymore. Obama was supposed to be &quot;the man of the people,&quot; fighting for the 99%, hope, change, etc. Instead, he has surrounded himself with wall st. bankers and appointed corporate executives (Monsanto, for example) into key decision making positions where they can directly lobby for their industry. </p>

<p>Best case, Obama really did have our best interests in mind, and someone pulled him into a room and suggested he could be the next JFK if he doesn&#39;t do as he&#39;s told. Worst case, he&#39;s just another fucking liar and he willfully deceived his constituency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, &quot;hadn&#39;t to&quot; is new to me, as I am quite low brow. American public education system and all... </p>

<p>I&#39;m not happy paying taxes into such a corrupt system, however I don&#39;t really have a choice in the matter if I&#39;m to stay on this side of iron bars. If US taxes went towards providing Americans with a better quality of life and modernization, I&#39;d be very happy to fork over my $$$ - as is the case in many northern European countries. The fact that US tax dollars go towards imperialism and failing social programs promised to baby boomers is tough to swallow. </p>

<p>That said, US corporations shouldn&#39;t be able to subvert US taxes with loopholes, especially when they don&#39;t utilize US labor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but allowing the economy to actually crash and then resetting the currency might have been a far better option than accumulating a giant debt that future generations have to deal with. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-the-world-can-learn-from-icelands-default-model-2011-8?op=1">Check out how Iceland</a> dealt with a similar scenario (granted they aren&#39;t the world&#39;s reserve currency). Absent a genuine economic recovery, the <em>only</em> ways to resolve this debt is to either default and then reconstitute the dollar, or seriously devalue our currency and accept the inflation. A $16 Trillion debt now is the same thing as an $8 Trillion debt if the dollar was worth half of what it is today. Of course, that also means your grocery bill would double. If this scenario happens, pray that wages keep up with inflation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may have no idea what I&#39;m talking about but it sounds like hoping that wages keep up with inflation could be possible with some socialistic government regulations. Forcing minimum wages to keep up with inflation would in turn hurt the economy in terms of unemployment, no? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Inflation (or dollar devaluation) happens because of two things - one of which is really good and one is really bad. </p>

<p>In a healthy and growing economy where unemployment is low, companies are able to pay employees more in order to retain talent. If company A wants to stay competitive, they will pay employees more in order to compete with the wages that company B is offering. This in turn puts more money in the hands of consumers, who are then able to afford more goods and services. Because of this, prices for things like houses and cars rise, because manufacturers know that their customers can afford more. Also, due to the increase in how much money is floating around and how quickly consumers are spending it (money supply, and the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money">velocity of money</a>&quot;), each dollar is in turn worth less than it used to be worth. In this scenario, wage inflation <em>causes</em> the overall price inflation, but it&#39;s considered healthy because consumers are maintaining a high quality of life. One way that governments can slow this down (since too much inflation is bad) is to increase interest rates, which increases borrowing costs, and reduces how much consumers and companies can expand. This removes some of the liquidity from the system and slows down the velocity of money, keeping growth and inflation in check. </p>

<p>In a bad economy where a government is printing money to avoid major defaults, but it&#39;s not reaching consumers&#39; pockets, inflation comes from the fact that there are so many more dollars in the system that each dollar is worth less than it used to be. This weakening of the dollar reduces confidence in our currency, and most of the inflation initially comes from foreign goods that we import. If BMW wants to sell cars to Americans, they are going to demand more of our (now weaker) dollars in exchange for 1 BMW. But because of the bad economy with high unemployment, and the fact that the money being printed doesn&#39;t reach the pockets of consumers, BMW is still going to demand more of our weaker dollars for a car, but the pool of people who can now afford the more expensive BMW is smaller. This extends to all imported goods and services. Over time, this forced lack of demand for &quot;stuff&quot; (due to an inability to afford said stuff) impacts companies like BMW, who sell fewer cars and make less money. This is known as &quot;stagflation,&quot; and it can eventually lead to a downward spiral where companies have to lay off more and more people due to their lack of sales. </p>

<p>The only thing that&#39;s keeping our imports &quot;in check&quot; is that the USA isn&#39;t operating in a bubble. That&#39;s to say, the Eurozone is also suffering from a horrible economy, and the Euro is also weakening along with the dollar. If the currencies of our trading partners are all weakening together, that inflationary effect is kept somewhat in check. The question though, is whether or not the USA is going to be able to service it&#39;s debt (pay the interest payments on it and redeem bonds when they come due). If we can&#39;t, we default, and that then leads to a complete loss in confidence in the dollar. Then we get to deal with hyperinflation, and anyone who owns hard assets (gold, commodities, land, etc.) will come out on top. </p>

<p>edit: I didn&#39;t really answer your question, sorry. In the bad scenario, you can&#39;t legislate higher minimum wages to keep up with inflation, since companies will maintain fewer employees, charge more for their goods/services, or go out of business. </p>

The El-ites do of course.</p>

<p>Also look at the Spanish language with its heavy Arabic desert language influence.  In Spanish &quot;el&quot; means both &quot;the&quot; and &quot;he&quot;.  So what better way to express a singular masculine god then a word that means both?  Then look at &quot;a&quot; in Spanish.  It means &quot;to&quot;.  &quot;a&quot; and &quot;el&quot; can be abbreviated into &quot;al&quot;.  So al-umni means &quot;to the he&quot;.  It is a dedication to god.  Which god?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All things end. You never know when or how but nothing will last forever and up until the last moment it&#39;ll seem like it will never end. I don&#39;t expect a bloody revolution, but a revolution of mind in which the whole societal structure changes radically is certainly possible. Look at the shift we had between Nixon and the Dixie-crats, one presidency changed the entirety of the political structure of the states why couldn&#39;t it happen again?</p>

<p>As it stands both parties are worthless, but it&#39;s not impossible that it will change radically in the next 6 years. Maybe I&#39;m an idiot but I&#39;d like to think that people have it in them to move toward a better and brighter future because the alternative is extremely depressing and makes life not really worth living. It&#39;s the same reason people believe in Heaven and God, there will be something better down the road and it&#39;s worth living and striving to see that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We already lost our free speech and guns in quite a few states that are governed by federal lickspittles. They favor their own pay over standing up for the principles of our country&#39;s founding. Some other states, Colorado for a recent example hasn&#39;t been putting up with federal surveillance drone laws and the laughably deplorable &quot;drug&quot; war.</p>

<p>This is why I believe the country will be split into two divisions, once again creating a second American revolution. It&#39;s coming. The federal government is like the most sadistic bully one could ever imagine only in nightmares, it has it&#39;s hands clenched on the balls of it&#39;s citizens, squeezing harder and harder (all while stealing the lunch money) to the point right before we bite back. Then they ease up and throw some duck dynasty bullshit to distract us for a month and continue the facade of national defense.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think something major will happen in 2015. Obviously I don&#39;t have conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m thinking will happen is a major economic collapse, the USD goes to shit. Inflation starts to becoming a more sinister problem as we continue to make fake monopoly bux backed by air.</p>

<p>At this point, the younger generation can&#39;t pay off their student debt because they can&#39;t work, because there is no middle class anymore, at all. Start up a government controlled work force and voila! You have your communist regime. Just add (fluoridated) water.</p>

<p>Also, money isn&#39;t fake just because it isn&#39;t backed by gold.  A dollar has as much value as a brick of gold has, which isn&#39;t much.  A dollar is valuable because people accept it for goods and services.  If it was backed by gold it would be the same thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I believe that we will lose world reserve currency status. It&#39;s a wild guess, and in reality it would probably take more than 6 years to take full effect, but no more than 20.</p>

<p>For the fluoride thing, if you want fluoride in your water, knock yourself out. A company can make little Mio fluoride supplements for those that prefer it, I just don&#39;t want it anywhere in my innards, no matter what scientific study has to say... I can&#39;t believe everything I hear. I also don&#39;t ever eat anything synthetic. It&#39;s just a preference, but I don&#39;t mind people who do use it. None of my business.</p>

<p>All in all, the government collapsing thing in the beginning was the absolute upheveal of the non-functioning federal republic system, to be replaced literally with a communist paradise.</p>

<p>Many people say 1984 is where we are headed, but I believe Huxley had it more accurate with A Brave New World. We&#39;re distracted with a sea of relevance to the real problems as the modern American culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your disclaimer, and I agree that A Brave New World is a better look at our society than 1984 is.</p>

<p>On the fluoride issue, you do realize that it is found naturally in some locations, along with other minerals.  It is actually partially removed from some areas because there is unsafe amounts in it.  I honestly don&#39;t understand why fluoride is hated by so many people, and so singled out so much.  It&#39;s safe and effective.  Why the distrust or hatred?</p>

Obama was supposed to be &quot;the man of the people,&quot; fighting for the 99%, hope, change, etc. Instead, he has surrounded himself with wall st. bankers and appointed corporate executives (Monsanto, for example) into key decision making positions where they can directly lobby for their industry. </p>

<p>Best case, Obama really did have our best interests in mind, and someone pulled him into a room and suggested he could be the next JFK if he doesn&#39;t do as he&#39;s told. Worst case, he&#39;s just another fucking liar and he willfully deceived his constituency.</p>
