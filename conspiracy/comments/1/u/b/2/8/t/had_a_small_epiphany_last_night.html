       While lying in bed I realized that the NSA and US government are basically assuming the role of God to control the people. For thousands of years religion did this quite successfully and still does in many parts of the world but the speed in which people are turning away from religion nowadays has increased exponentially. Without this form of control in peoples lives to insure that they are being "good citizens" this is where the government steps in to assume that power and let everyone know that with religion or not they're being watched and better be "good citizens".

       Hmm, kind of like how children are made to behave by making them believe in a santa clause who is always watching, making a list and checking it twice.

       Interesting concept, indeed. Could provide an alternate or supplementary motive for the theories about edward snowden being a spy and thst the gov allowed him and actuslly wanted him to release the info thst he did.

       That is an epiphany?  Why do you think the communists enforced atheism as part of their belief system?  Because they wanted the masses to look to state to be their god.  This has been the method for establishing totalitarian governments for many years.

       Ive used the same argument trying to wake up friends to the systematic destruction of our culture and society. I am not religious but I see the void it fills. Along with that we have lost a sense of community as well.

       They don't want you to know that everything we need can be produced on a local level. They rather have us eat gmo corn dripping with pesticides and preservatives being trucked in from across the country. There is definately an Agenda here.

       My religion frees me from the state. That's what it teaches me, non-violent resistence. It doesn't teach me to "obey the state", or anyone else. It teaches me that when I go protesting and the gendarmes threaten me with violence, I should stand my ground without resorting to violence myself. It teaches me that powerful men will stop at nothing until we're all tagged and through the government, they will know everything we do. If anything, my religion has made me more anti-system than anything else. I'm orthodox Christian by the way, one of the "blind sheeple" around here.

       Without religion is not the same as godless.  Over Thanksgiving one family member who is atheist tried to sneak me into his hard line camp with an argument of
       <em>
        "well which one is more likely"
       </em>
       to imply that a 51% (maybe 66%) more likely choice that there is no god implies that there cannot be one.  I took exception to this definition and another family member went on my side.  Then next we were looking up the exact definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently I am actually agnostic as defined by the word and I held my line on that one.  The hard line atheists seem to like to swell their ranks.  Just look at the difference between the subscribership of
       <a href="/r/agnosticism">
        /r/agnosticism
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       .  I'm basically agnostic and I could really give a shit about talking about that all day.  I have more freedom to explore ideas and I also don't have to beat myself up if I feel one way or another at a moment.  If there is a god is it more like a wave or a particle?  Whatever.  The answer doesn't really change anything for me even if the question doesn't make any sense.

       The grand majority of atheists are agnostic. To be a gnostic atheist requires 100% proof that their is no god. As proving a negative is virtually impossible without being omnipotent yourself, being a gnostic atheist is about as unrealistic as being religious.

       I believe god to be kind of a guiding intelligent force that shapes existence. I think it transcends time and space. I kind of see it in terms of the whole hermetic "conscious universe" type of thing. I don't see the boundary between science and TRUE religion, true religion being the truth of existence, not dogmatic interpretations. Like Einstein said, something along the lines of "Science is simply understanding the mind of God". The more we learn from science, the more it makes me realize that there is an incredibly unique, harmonious and perfect order in the universe. I guess I kind of think of god like a metaphor for the intelligent force guiding and shaping the universe, when it's all said and done.

       I think people take it too literally. It has some good ideas in there, but I think a large part of the Old Testament is, in my opinion, meant to be taken allegorically/metaphorically. I think that of all of the old scriptures, the ones that actually resonate with me would be the Gnostic Gospels of the Nag Hammadi library, which were only discovered in 1945. They humanize Jesus, instead of placing him on a pedestal of idolatry. The teachings of Jesus in the Gnostic Gospels are incredibly interesting. It's no wonder why they had to be buried/hidden...the Roman authorities wanted to cherry pick the teachings to control people's perspective of their state religion, and keep them subservient... Like a modern day book burning.

       I don't believe the creator thinks things out. In my philosophy classes I was taught that god would be considered the greatest conceivable intelligence, far faster than quantum computers and the speed of light. I think that it's largely about instant harmony and adaption/evolution. As a conscious energy, god may be omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. This applies to more than our observable universe. Given that, and as I said this concept transcends time and space...this conscious existence already knows the future...hell, it IS the future, because it's eternal and infinite. We as humans cannot grasp this because we were born imperfect and limited in our perspective.  Hell, take a look at the tiny portion of the visible light spectrum we have access to, and realize that's only light. We are talking about the infinite and eternal here, light is only a small part, and we cannot even comprehend the full spectrum of THAT.

       Some UN minions told us that to accept the new world order they have to destroy three basic pillars that keep the population grounded and then replace that space with their ideology. The pillars are 1. family bounds, 2. nationalism and 3. religion. Ask which nations are in favor of this pillars and which nations are detroying them on purpose and you will know the sides of the global war. Which countries are destroying the familily with gay rights, gender studies, agitation between men and woman and much more? Which are the countries that are not protecting their countries from foreign influences? Which countries are opposed to religion and whose population is mocking every religion but have cultural events full of satanic symbols and rituals. If it is not done by design then the coincidence is staggering.

       I had to read my comment again. No, there was no evaluation of good or bad that I wanted to express. There might be people out there that think destroying the family bounds is a great idea, but really I am not one of them.

       It is obvious to me that Putin is acting diametrically opposed to everything the USA or the EU does. How do you explain that? Maybe because he wants opposed poles sharing the power of the world and is opposed to the globalist dream of the one world order?

       Putin is the head of a former super power hoping to claw its way back into relevancy on the strength of natural gas and an aging nuclear stockpile.

       Vladimir Putin would sit the thrown if he knew where it was and how to get there. So would every other elected politician serving in office in a wealthy country today, I think. I don't need Illuminati cabals to explain that this is how the game of thrones is played. You cling to the comforting notion that the enemy is known and therefore can be exposed and defeated and the good can finally get back to the way things were before the cancerous evil, but when? When, exactly, was this golden age of peace and free thought? The real world has a hundred hundred viscous, bloodthirsty dictators waiting for the right opportunity, silently biding their time and doing their part at their level. The enemy is not some otherworldly devil or attainted cabal, but the very fact and frailty of human nature. We are the sum total of our many possibilities, each one of us every hero and every monster. By shifting the blame to metaphysical dichotomies, you excuse yourself the responsibility to make the world a better place.

       I am myself an atheist, but I consider religions to be of philosophical value and they provide help and keep people grounded. Some humans need them, they represent the individuality of people and should not be forbidden or be controlled by the state. There are two examples from last century where they forbade religions in a state and it went miserably wrong (social-nationalistic Germany and communistic UDSSR). The UN should better not tamper with religions and not try to force the clash of civilizations to discredit every religion.

       The problem is that none of the countries in Europe have enough military power to oppose the globalist agenda and they can not even protect their population from being spied on by the NSA. So in reality there is only China and Russia left. And for sure there are some countries that claim to be independent and  sovereign nations, but they are instantly attacked like Libya (oil, gold dinar) or Afghanistan (opium, Caspian see gas pipeline) or are not important enough to have a military intervention at the moment (for example Cuba, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela). And for sure there are some countries that are vilified all the time because they are not licking the boots of the Anglo-American establishment.

       That's a perversion of what the actual Bible relates to the fundamental aspects of The Human Condition. It starts with the primary tenant that man has free will. "Religions" may prescribe what you must do, but you need to take into context that the initial act that defines man's realm, is based on doing what he chooses irrespective of any command from anyone. That is why "they" will fail.

       <br/>
       The Tower of Babel scripture has fascinated me for years - 9 simple lines that most churchgoing people pay little mind to but really speaks a lot to me about the true nature of the "God" portrayed in those books:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        1 Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. 2 As people moved eastward,[a] they found a plain in Shinar[b] and settled there.
       </p>
       <p>
        3 They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. 4 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”
       </p>
       <p>
        5 But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. 6 The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”
       </p>
       <p>
        8 So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. 9 That is why it was called Babel[c]—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Throughout the Old Testament, the depiction of God seems more to me to be in the nature of a lab tech than a beneficent deity.  Multiple times, God will scatter man across the Earth or even extinguish life on a mass scale and "Start Over".  Like a trial and error pattern.  That doesn't sound like All-Knowing and All-Powerful to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If God is afraid that man can come together as a collective and accomplish so much, and our government is acting as God, then I believe the solution to our government problem is not a new form of government led by a small group of people.  The solution is a collective, a hive mind that checks itself and is not bound by secretive and corrupt power mongers.
      </p>
      <p>
       A true collective is what the NSA's far-reaching information theft is designed to conquer.  Turn the individual against their neighbor and they will never cohere.

       Are they polluted with religion... or using it as a means of exploiting people who believe in God? "Look! We're the
       <em>
        godly
       </em>
       candidates, vote for us!" It's a clever angle. Even the devil masquerades as an angel of light. I would.

       Very well said.  I do think the evidence shows that they use religion as a means of exploiting people who believe in God.  If they do worship a god, it's clearly not the god of the bible.

       I think people take it too literally. It has some good ideas in there, but I think a large part of the Old Testament is, in my opinion, meant to be taken allegorically/metaphorically. I think that of all of the old scriptures, the ones that actually resonate with me would be the Gnostic Gospels of the Nag Hammadi library, which were only discovered in 1945. They humanize Jesus, instead of placing him on a pedestal of idolatry. The teachings of Jesus in the Gnostic Gospels are incredibly interesting. It's no wonder why they had to be buried/hidden...the Roman authorities wanted to cherry pick the teachings to control people's perspective of their state religion, and keep them subservient... Like a modern day book burning.

       I am myself an atheist, but I consider religions to be of philosophical value and they provide help and keep people grounded. Some humans need them, they represent the individuality of people and should not be forbidden or be controlled by the state. There are two examples from last century where they forbade religions in a state and it went miserably wrong (social-nationalistic Germany and communistic UDSSR). The UN should better not tamper with religions and not try to force the clash of civilizations to discredit every religion.

       Perhaps you are not paying attention. They try to protect themselves and I think you do not understand what is going on in Europe. 
All sorts of countries are trying to get out of the grip of the globalists. Some just have to flee under the belt of one of the super powers and Russia is still one and gaining influence and military force by the day.

       The problem is that none of the countries in Europe have enough military power to oppose the globalist agenda and they can not even protect their population from being spied on by the NSA. So in reality there is only China and Russia left. And for sure there are some countries that claim to be independent and  sovereign nations, but they are instantly attacked like Libya (oil, gold dinar) or Afghanistan (opium, Caspian see gas pipeline) or are not important enough to have a military intervention at the moment (for example Cuba, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela). And for sure there are some countries that are vilified all the time because they are not licking the boots of the Anglo-American establishment.
