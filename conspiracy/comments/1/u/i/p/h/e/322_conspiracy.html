<blockquote>
<p><strong>More than three dozen religious leaders today (March 22) unveiled a “faithful budget” that they say will address the nation’s needs and priorities rather than partisan political considerations.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The actual religious-leaders-press-faithful-federal-budget.PDF in the article is not found or on web archive.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do Skull and Bones, ancient German secret societies, the Georgia Guidestones and the Health Care bill have in common?</p>

<p><strong>The answer is March 22nd.</strong></p>

<p>The Georgia Guidestones were christened on March 22 1980. The first commandment on the stones was a pledge to keep the world&#39;s population under 500,000 people.</p>

<p>March 22nd 2010 (Universal Time) is also the day that Health Care finally passed in the United States. (Universal Time is Greenwich Mean Time. This is the &#39;time&#39; that the Illuminati use.)</p>

<p>3-22, or March 22nd, is also the sacred number to Skull and Bones, the secret society from Yale that produces the leaders of the United States and the world. When Tim Russert asked President George W. Bush what the Skull and Bones special number - 322 ­ signified Bush replied that this was a secret. Senator John Kerry, who ran against Bush in 2004, is also a member of this ultra-secret society. He also refused to tell us what the number 322 meant to Skull and Bones.</p>

<p>Skull and Bones is a German secret organization that successfully transferred itself across the Atlantic Ocean in the early 1800&#39;s. When you back-engineer the secret societies from which the German version of Skull and Bones emerged one finds a strange fascination with Mars.</p>

<p>March is the only month of the year that is named after a specific planet in the solar system. It is also the first day of spring as well as the first day in the zodiacal sign of Aries, which is the Greek word for Mars, and it is where &#39;March&#39; gets its name.</p>

<p>The number 322 is vitally important to these secret societies especially Skull and Bones, which has the number, enshrined in their tomb at Yale.</p>

<p><strong>The number 322 is actually the number for March 22nd. The first day of Aries, also called Mars.</strong></p>

<p>The great alchemist Fulcanelli was a member of a secret society in Europe. He tells us of a secret elite that rule the world. In his obscure book Mystery of the Cathedrals he tells us that there is a secret science called alchemy that only the elites understand. He also tells us that all alchemy begins in Aries (Mars).</p>

<p><strong>For some reason these secret societies are fixated on March 22nd. Perhaps this is because of a special relationship between these secret societies and the planet Mars.</strong></p>

<p>The ever stranger Georgia Guidestones were created in 1980 by a mysterious gentleman named R.C. Christian. They are huge granite columns, which have new set of 10 commandments etched into them. These are new rules for the future. While most of the new commandments appear reasonable enough there is one commandment that makes one wonder what is really happening in our world and what these secret societies are really after. That is new commandment - number one, of course - commands that the population of the world be reduced to 500,000,000 people.</p>

<p>The name R. C. Christian is a pseudonym and only one man named Wyatt Martin, who is in his 80&#39;s, knows Mr. Christian&#39;s real identity and Mr. Martin refuses to talk. We can be assured that this pseudonym signifies the Rosicrucian secret society founded by &#39;Christian&#39; Rosenkreuz supposedly in 1407. The German Rosicrucian&#39;s are the godfathers to many other German secret societies including Skull and Bones. In keeping with this important linkage it is worth noting that the Georgia Guidestones, created as instructed by Mr. R. C. Christian, were christened on March 22nd 1980. Exactly 30 years ago today.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t going too far out on a limb to say that population reduction is a major goal of these secret societies ­ for better or worse.</p>

<p>Normally I wouldn&#39;t put this much time into this small curiosity of ancient German secret societies. But as I watched the Health Care Debate over the last few weeks I suddenly saw that it was beginning to appear that President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats were going to vote the Health Care Bill on March 22nd.</p>

<p>On Sunday March 21st as I watched C-Span I suddenly got a tingle up my spine. Were they purposely putting this off until the clock hits March 22nd  Universal Standard Time? Is this thing being orchestrated so that it falls on 3-22, March 22nd, the Holy Day of some crazy secret society? And a secret society that has built a monument, christened on 3-22 that announces their plans?</p>

<p>Then that would mean the &#39;Health Care Plan&#39; is something far more sinister.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you heard of the 188 day cycle? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those new to this subject, its one of the most intriguing dates and debates going on right now around the net due to claims about the numerical connection that 3/22 has to a major Illuminati power number/sequence/algorithm 322 and another numerical anomaly thats been discovered allegedly connected to a bizarre PATTERN called the 188 DAY CYCLE that seems to correlate to MAJOR quakes in which 3 out of the 4 IN A ROW, knocked the earth off its axis. </p>

<p>What has yet to be conclusively established beyond a doubt though, is whether this 188 anomaly, is random or follows any trackable, predictable or consistent cycle/pattern. So far, there&#39;s been 4 quakes in a row that can be connected or attributed to this latest 188 CYCLE which began on 2/27/11 with the 8.8 quake in CHILE, then the 7.1 quake on 9/4/11 in CHRIST CHURCH, followed by the 9.1 mega quake in JAPAN on 3/11/11, and the last date on 9/16/11 in FIJI that another huge 7.3 mag struck.</p>

<p>Alias for the hermetic union of a new androgynous being. The new messiah for the freemason / occult / pagan / satanic / luciferian world expecting him. (You might know him as the anti-christ / Dajjal)</p>

<p>A hegemony of male and female personality traits. Like the goat of Mendes symbolizing the devil. This is the freemason &quot;Great work&quot;. The worker bee. The peaceful cattle. The new race that is smart enough to operate machines but never enough to make or repair them.</p>

<p>The ideal serf-race for the new world overlord elite classes. And all those &quot;poor people&quot;. The coloreds, the white trash and all in between, the deformed, the disabled, religious zealots... Well thanks to the miracle of eugenics and &quot;Keeping the population below 500 million&quot; statute at the Georgia guide-stones, the new world will offer to them the option to become the slaves they were meant to be (Under the lie / pretext of becoming gods {the singularity dude!}) through leaving all love behind or an unhappy death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not a new androgynous being. Its based on Platonic ideas of the original androgyne cosmic man, before the fall and entrance into physicality. The anti-christ is any &quot;other&quot; that sets itself as intermediary between the self and the higher self. We will all be faced with our own false prophets as we make the journey to full individuation and union with the cosmic man. </p>

<p>The true goal of any alchemical work is the liberation of the individual from worldliness and perfect union with the spiritual self. The means by which this task is undertaken is known as &quot;The mysterium conjunctio&quot; wherein opposite elements are united. The last book-length works of Carl Jung&#39;s life/career were all devoted to a study of alchemy as it pertains to the individual psyche.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ummm. Yeah. This health care plan is going to be chaotic when the diseases start. It&#39;s all happening at the right moment. Economy, social life, world politics, food supply, pestilence. We are headed towards WW3, the end of America, and the great tribulation.</p>

<p>Side Note: Think whatever you&#39;d like. To me, the bible is the word of God. Men will contort it, but its value and truth can be observed by those with eyes. It has never been more clear than now considering these events coming to pass have been in the works since post-WW2. </p>

<p>Understand, to be where we are at this precise moment in history, you&#39;d have to have history occur exactly as it did. The bible describes the events coming to pass, in this decade, that started unfolding or beginning in the 1940s. For example, Israel being a nation on the precise day identified in the bible. And the necessity of Israel to be a nation on that exact day and hated by the world. Surrounded by its enemies. In a region, holding some of the largest reserves of gas for some reason.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not implying that anyone should become Christian or that just because the bible outlined events occurring, and the world being setup perfectly to fulfill the scripture, doesn&#39;t 100% prove anything. Yes, I understand this.</p>

<p>But, you&#39;re never going to prove your theology in anyway whatsoever with absolute proof (100% certainty). Never ever. Even if you had a NDE and were thrown into a spiritual life. Even if you mathematically demonstrated that God doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s not 100%.</p>

<p>Given that fact, really consider the situation of our world and the goal of the last book of the bible. And don&#39;t give me any bs about how &quot;christians have always been predicting the end times&quot;. This is true, but, for the world events to follow the scripture, we would need technology that puts humans in touch instantly. That way, the events can occur as they need to during the last days. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about what religion you prescribe to because the religious entities of our world are corrupt and have proven themselves unworthy of leading Gods people. That&#39;s why Jesus came to the earth. He is the savior of everyone and everything. Without Him, we would still put lambs blood over the door, we would still sacrifice animals, and still be controlled by men. </p>

<p>Christ, ironically, may resemble stories of saviors from older cultures and religions, but He&#39;s the only one that came and died for man, then conquered death and rose again. </p>

<p>Other cultures and religions had a similar story because psychologically, humans have a desire for a savior or super human entity that saves our problems or sets an example (superego). Christ wasn&#39;t around until a few thousand years after man had already had a long history.</p>

<p>That would explain the similarities, but as stated, Christ conquered death and died for the sins of the world (which is unheard of in any other religion.) Not only that, but Christ takes you away from the bondage of the church created by man.</p>

<p>He gathered disciples, toured the Middle East and acted as the church itself. Christ taught that we are the temples and living within the teachings of Christ is how we are to spread the word and share our light with others. The word light in this case not only means sharing your fulfillment of life, but also your knowledge on how to live.</p>

<p>So am I Christian, technically, do I think you should become a Christian and start repenting? No, not in the way that comes to mind for the majority of the population. Don&#39;t go to a church and &quot;see&quot; how it goes. This is probably why the religion is so unpopular. It&#39;s because you treat it as a religion instead of a life advising or guiding. Religion is different than living in Christ. </p>

<p>All I think is that Id prefer that people read the bible and try to live in Christ. For me, thats the only way you&#39;ll find any truth worth observing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the longest time I was a member of the baptist church, I believed the bible, the creation story, the earth was only 6000 years old, all of that. Only when I realized that the only reason I was a Christian was because my parents were did I start to question everything. Guess what? The bible is just a story written by scared Jewish Arabs before we knew what natural forces were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have Love. Regardless of your bravado and &quot;rudeness&quot;you name shows a sense of humor. Did you know good humor was a grace from God? Your life seems good in that you have access to the internet. You have a good working knowledge of how it works and use it comfortably. You have more knowledge at your fingertips than in the thousands of years history of the spoken and written word. Librarians of monastic monasteries would have wept at the prospect of having so much knowledge at their fingertips.</p>

<p>God is Real. God is Good. The Bible is his word. God bless you.</p>
