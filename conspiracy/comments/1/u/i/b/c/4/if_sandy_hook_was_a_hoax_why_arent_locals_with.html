       I would like to think I would realize if 20 victims and their families appeared out of nowhere for an event like this.

      <p>
       Wouldn't some families have community ties or other kids in the school that could be easily verified?

       Because it's not a hoax. Not EVERYTHING is a conspiracy. Focusing on this is a distraction, imo. There are much bigger fish to fry, with much better evidence.

       I live literally one town over. It was a normal functioning school, where school buses dropped kids off every day. Teachers went to work there every day. They stopped at the stores on the way, people knew them. The school was real.

       The fact that there is no solid proof or video to prove it, proves that it didn't happen. Things like this don't happen with video to provide irrefutable proof. Not today. They have not even proven that these people exist and lived in that area. Nothing exists to prove it in a respectable courtroom, beyond a reasonable doubt.

       Did we ever see hundreds upon hundreds of students evacuated that day?  On the "evidence" video proof that this many classrooms, 20 students per room, were in use that day? Not a single holiday decoration, typical of every elementary school in America seen on the walls or windows of the supposed school?  All evidence points to this being a false flag attack.  Now legal propaganda on the American public, with the goal of making personal protection, the primary use of firearms, illegal.  Have their been any other cases where emergency medicine on the scene, emergency response personnel and ambulances turned away, no children (effectively, excluding 1-2 kids, and one silent since adult), rushed en mass to the ER, then rushing the "bodies" out under the cover of night
       <strong>
        the following night
       </strong>
       many hours later. Any other similar cases have been handled in similar form?  Or all children witnesses forced to cover their eyes, and other than a small number of actors, not a single child that witnessed any blood or bodies of wounded or dead kids?  A .223 rifle sounding like "the janitor setting up the bleachers" was all that was heard?  All audio coming only over a hot PA?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding one small element of the story and using that to counter the mountain of proof is hardly enough to change many people's minds.  It sure hasn't changed mine, and I'm surprised that it has for you.  They fucked up bad. Incidents of this scale, such as 7/7, they have been found to botch quite regularly.

       It's been documented that many, if not all of the families affected were recent transplants to Sandy Hook.  The majority left shortly after the supposed attack.  We've seen a mother clearly using hand signals on her daughter during multiple interviews. Also, how can anyone explain the following:
The.bodies of the children were not immediately rushed to the hospital.  They were transported out with no witnesses
       <strong>
        the following night under the cover of darkness.
       </strong>
       The janitor nor wounded teacher have not provided any public statement or interviews.
The use of green screens and anomalies in the footage of the site.
The timing of the supposed lockdown, yet social people were let out?
Everything dealing with the man that looked total Chester Molester, or public support of the children he "saved"
One word: ME

       Well basic conspiracy theory would suggest the idea of a hoax based upon nonexistence would seem to be a prime example of spreading wild dis-info to discredit any question of the idea. I agree the idea of paid actors, shills, cover ups, and relocating seems ridiculous and too much effort. Wouldn't it be much easier to set up your missionaries create the event with the smallest amount of loose ends possible and forget about how many heads it takes to make it happen? If feel like there is a conspiracy involved. However I'm pretty sure people were killed there, it would be ridiculous effort to pull off what some people suggest. And, since the #1 concept people seem to bring up about the event is that the children never existed the idea of questioning the rest of the story is written off.

       They did good. They did
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       good.  They executed this thing with impeccable planning.  Just because we can't exactly prove what is wrong with it, we know something is wrong with it.  Compare to Kant's refutation of Anselm's "proof" for the existence of God.  Everyone knew Anselm's argument was off, but Kant showed why after hundreds of years.

       This wasn't raised as an odd issue by any locals?  If a take school appeared in a story like this in my town, which is large, everyone would call it out as a fraud.
