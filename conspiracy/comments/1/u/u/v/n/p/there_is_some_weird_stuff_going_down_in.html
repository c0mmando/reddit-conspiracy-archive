<p>I go to find the MSDS on the chemical. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1uunyw/4methylcyclohexane_methanol/">used source</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB8455037.htm">Notice click &amp; read the &quot;risk&quot; &amp; &quot;safety&quot; statements</a></p>

<li>37:   <strong>Irritating to the respiratory system</strong></li>
<li>38:   <strong>Irritating to the skin</strong></li>

<p>&amp;</p>

<ul>

<p>Q: WTF is used poor worker dude being subjected to? A: IMO Unsafe ill  likely non legal working conditions that lack intelligent caring leadership that would if in existence be providing safety clothing for the apparent lowly pee on worker.</p>

<p>I clearly &amp; immediately noticed the MSDS chemical safety information is not being acted on. </p>

<p>Does anyone here think OSHA is acting upon the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/a7KMeH9.gif"><strong>patriotic ill eagle company</strong></a> for such violations clearly shown in a publicly widely disseminated incriminating image? </p>

<p>The ill eagle freedum company clearly does not care about its people &amp; until I read an article that shows me OSHA acting upon the lack of safety garb not being provided for the human being in the image, then I continue to accrue more knowing that &quot; we the people&quot; are not well cared for or about by either of the orgs that apparently only act safely or caringly toward the mass population only if they are forced to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not as dangerous as your trying to make it out to be. Almost every chemical I have handled in organic lab will say it causes irritation on the MSDS. A good counterexample is acetone, the most common organic cleaner used in lab (its also the main component of nail polish remover). The MSDS says :</p>

<p>INHALATION: vapor irritating to eyes and mucous membranes; acts as an anesthetic in very high concentrations. </p>

<p>INGESTION: low order of toxicity but very irritating to mucous membranes. </p>

<p>SKIN: prolonged excessive contact causes defatting of the skin, possibly leading to dermatitis.</p>

<p>This is worse for you to inhale and similar for ingestion, and yet from my experience plenty of students (myself included) take little precautions in using the stuff. We let it get on our  hands and lab station, as long as its cleaned up soon its not a big deal, after all it only causes mild irritation. Remember that we are neglecting safety on our own accord,which may be what the clean up workers are doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>IMO I did not <strong>specify</strong> an amount of danger.</p>

<p>What I am <strong>specifying</strong> is that MSDS recommendations exist for human <em>worker</em> safety.</p>

<p>IMO possible legal ramifications exist? or should exist!!! for any &amp; all failure to adhere to MSDS <strong>specifications &amp; recommendations</strong> in all worker workplace chemical interactions, due to potential health risk reactions now or in the future.</p>

<p>Acetone in a small beaker in a small &quot;organic lab&quot; setting is much smaller in amount than what is seen of this chemical in this stream of water. </p>

<p>Dude seems all alone &amp; is perched upon a slope. He could fall in to the chems, if he had a negative reaction, &amp; then become soaked in a chemical he may not have had such exposure to. No one seems near enough to throw dude a line as he performs unfamiliar non routine actions. I notice these things because I care.</p>

<p>I wisely realize a few beakers full of acetone is not going to permeate the air like I can only imagine this chemical does @ such amounts spewed into the shown living/dying water shed system. That looks like lots of chems on the shoreline to me.</p>

<p>I did not state dude was in dire danger. I stated he is IMO neglected by way of BS mingled with incompetence, &amp; greed. </p>

<p>BS is having OSHA &amp; MSDS documents that are often non lived up to recommendations of health info mingled with incompetence such as mid level management &amp; big shots not wanting nor not caring enough to buy safey equipment to comply with what is recommended. </p>

<p>It seems to me MSDS <del>recomendations</del> recommendations like the U.S. Constitution &amp; other important documental safety papers are often not allowed true life anymore &amp; instead lead the led into an artificial illusionary life by providing false senses of security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember that <strong>we are neglecting safety</strong> on our own accord,which may be what the clean up workers are doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First I am not we. I am not neglecting safety, a corporation you defend is, by allowing a <del>depandable</del> dependable expendable do so IMO @ risk levels documentation indicates as not wise. </p>

<p>Second you are IMO blindly ill to blame the low end worker for not applying technical safety information. You make it sound like a choice by a well informed worker is happening. With your ill line of logic toxic waste handler corporations should just hire the illiterate &amp; cheaply watch laughing all the way to the banks as their workers do not follow anything in the MSDS nor use hazmat suits or <del>resperators</del> respirators unless demanded. </p>

<p>Low level workers can not afford to stir up shit in the boat they work on!!! Telling the the captain bossman you want safety gear can make ones job disappear. &lt;-----I know that for fact.</p>

<p>I agree to disagree with your rationalizations for corporate ill&#39;ete cockrer&#39;ill&#39;s &lt;-- yes I know I spelled those words &quot;ill&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly don&#39;t know what your talking about. Methanol was not spilled, it was 4-methylcyclohexane methanol. Im not sure why they decided to write it like that, its less confusing to call it 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol as theres not two components. I am acting like this chemical is similar to acetone since that is exactly what I said earlier by comparing their MSDS. You can go and debate above if you feel its a weak argument. </p>

<p>Rivers are much much much much much much larger than 35,000 gallons. An olympic sized swimming pool contains 550,000 gallons of water, to visualize.. </p>

To allow them to do so IMO reduces health safety as low in illiteracy low in knowledge lowest level workers take the jobs of those who want  &amp; demand safety gear. This allows &amp; feeds wage stagnation &amp; reduces job security @ the cost of valuable life.</p>

<p>I agree to disagree, for IMO that is sad &amp; ill for you to think. I implied nothing so wide reaching or drastic. My quoted sentence also does not imply all my statement was <em>all</em> &quot;in the name of <em>safety</em>&quot;. I also think workers should wear hairnets if the work with food. That sentence does not imply I wish to remove more worker &quot;personal freedom/choices&quot; than applies to hairnets. I spelled some out wider socioeconomic ramifications than safety. </p>

<p>Your reply is weak &amp; IMO hopefully not serious, for it seems very overblown like you use drama queen tactics in serious discussion.</p>
