<p>This was on the 13 Dec 2013 at Arapahoe High School, where an &quot;active shooter&quot; situation occurred and FBI were on the scene within minutes. </p>

<p>I have no idea how long they plan to keep these up but if it&#39;s ongoing into 2014... Watch for another one of these tragedies taking place 24 January 2014. </p>

<p>Grab popcorn, because you will need something tasty to chew on to stomach the bad acting and sloppy gun &#39;prevention&#39; rhetoric. </p>

<p>These are the operations that had an exercise of the same thing as the event going on a the same place and time of the event.</p>

<p>They generally have less victims as they go along, since they don&#39;t need as many to keep up the security theater as they did  at first to establish the need for it.The latest ones are just &#39;booster shots&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read on a forum how some of them follow a repeating 1-2-3 cycle, where each number is a different category of event (such as local, national, political... just examples, I can&#39;t recall them, sorry). The poster gave no explanation for this theory but I think it&#39;s worth looking at as a possible pattern. Patterns are definitely the key to unraveling what&#39;s going on here. </p>

<p>As for a progressive pattern, like ever-increasing... Well, Boston was much more brazen than a high school shooting which is much easier to stage, and beyond that it would make sense to end things on a high note. Unless they plan to keep it up forever... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the six week cycle pattern discovery comes from them, but if you mean the alternating scenario pattern idea, I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t listen to the No Agenda show, I came across that bit about possible alternating patterns reading some forum chatter surrounding this, though maybe they were talking about something mentioned on the show?

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, that was just to get the attention of as many people as I could. A white lie, if you will. However, the last interval was 42 days - exactly six weeks - and that was the time between LAX shooting and Arapahoe. That&#39;s why I decided to put my reputation on the line and make a little &quot;prediction&quot;. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how the <a href="http://6weekcycle.com/what-is-this-cycle/">6weekcycle.com website describes it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For almost a year, the No Agenda Show has seen a trend of “crises” with evidence of FBI intervention about every 6 weeks.  These events are used to keep a strangle on the public, usually to pass a law to restrict your rights.  It also boosts ratings for cable TV, especially for CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc.</p>

<p>“Never let a good crisis go to waste”</p>

<p>The most notable NA prediction was the Boston Bombing. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfXaTOtxDA4">Listen Here</a> | <a href="http://505.nashownotes.com/">Link to Shownotes</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite a few people already know that &quot;active shooter&quot; events are being created as realistic simulations intended to look real to bystanders and the media (social media is used, too). </p>

<p>What most don&#39;t know is how to spot them - and that&#39;s what this cycle (pattern/interval) gives a clue to. Common sense tells you that it takes preparation and rehearsal for any kind of live event, so if they have only one set of secret organizers - possibly in government, but they could be private contractors - then they&#39;d also likely need a few weeks to finalize assessments and reports and all that, after the detective work is complete. </p>

<p>So no, &quot;many others&quot; were not predicted like clockwork. But hey, the last one did (42 days exactly), and I used that to nearly &quot;predict&quot; this latest one, 1 day off from 42. Whatever that means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that happened too, indeed. I left it out for simplification. Though, maybe it would have helped drive home the point that this is theatre - everyone knows how many FBI-created bomb plots the FBI have &quot;foiled&quot; in recent years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm! Take a look at the news reports, less than an hour after taking place, the story is on: BBC, Reuters, NYT, USAToday, The Guardian, CNN, Fox News, Yahoo News,  plus dozens of other major outlets. So pretty much absolute coverage on this one, that&#39;s a check. </p>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/police-3-dead-shooting-maryland-mall-174420449.html">This Yahoo report</a> has racked up 700+ comments in under 20 minutes of being published. Wow. </p>

<p>Definitely looks &quot;big&quot; enough to be a hit. Thanks for the heads up! Will be following this. </p>

<p>Also, I like how RT ends <a href="http://rt.com/usa/columbia-mall-shooting-dead-200/">their initial report</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Random shootings have occurred with <strong>disturbing regularity</strong> in the US in recent years. One of the most shocking was the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in December 2012, where twenty children and six adult staff were shot dead.</p>

<p>Since then, there have been plans to provide schools with resource officers - a law enforcement officer who has the authority to make arrests and carry a weapon in school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found a bit of discussion on <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2415685/pg2">possible locations</a> (like using the 39th parallel for Arapahoe&#39;s location). Some interesting things in that thread, including the potential for this upcoming event to be on either the 21st or 23rd as those dates magically (I assume Gematria, I have not verified) reduce to nice spooky numbers like 9 and 13. As did previous events&#39; dates.</p>
