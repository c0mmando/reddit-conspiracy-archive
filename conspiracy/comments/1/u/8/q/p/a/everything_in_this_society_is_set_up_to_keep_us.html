We are feed garbage media that comes in the forms of mind-numbing idiotic television and meaningless sports that most of the populace will never be able to relate to and yet they worship them as heroes. IT&#39;S A FUCKING GAME. Then we have the social networks that people willingly sell all of their personal information to in exchange for likes that are supposed to compensate for self-esteem. Then we have alcohol, tobacco and other drugs that are glorified in media in order to makes us think that this will feel the void that most people feel when in truth they only keep us dumbed down and numb to everything around us. I&#39;m so disgusted with all of it and I will have no part in any of it. Fuck society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you are mistaken. Racial divisions have always existed. They are less pronounced in modern America than in most societies, but they can never be eliminated because they are part of our genetic programming. That&#39;s why multiculturalism is failing -- because it flies in the face of reality. We are not all the same. We will never all love each other. That isn&#39;t going to happen, ever. Races compete. Sure, you can train a dog and a cat to sleep on the same pillow, but at the end of the day they are still a dog and a cat, and if the food runs low they are back to the imperative of eat or be eaten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i would say america is a quite racist society.  there are many examples throughout history and the present of races and religions living in harmony.  it is not impossible.  the key is for people to realize that they can gain more through cooperation to create resources than by fighting over available ones.  whether or not this shift in goals is going to happen is uncertain, but there is just as much reason for optimism as pessimism.  of course, many powerful people are benefited by such divisions and the ensuing conflicts.  our job is to maintain the truth that all humans deserve dignity and are not just animals seeking to kill each other.  to believe otherwise is to fall prey to machiavelli&#39;s great maxim.</p>

Do you think the ethnic atrocities in Eastern Europe are flukes or coincidences? They are caused by two ethnic groups seeking control over the same territory.

    <div class="md"><p>i wouldn&#39;t necessarily call tribal warfare racial.  some of it is some of it is not.  it&#39;s certainly easier to target a particular group if they are visually distinguishable.  but there are lots of peaceful tribes as well.  humans fight for control of scarce resources, not just because of racial bias.  if we are able to have a high universal standard of living then there will be less incentive for mass violence, although i can&#39;t imagine violence being completely eradicated because of &quot;human nature.&quot;  that is not, however, my concern.  rather, i would like to see a less violent planet.
i&#39;m not sure what you mean by the myth of multiculturalism.  as i see it, it is the idea that your culture or race is not inherently superior to others.  this is not something i will argue over, if you don&#39;t agree then you are just a racist who has a prejudiced view of reality.  perhaps your prejudice is justified, but i think that we should assume that all races and cultures are equal anyways to avoid justifying genocide.  but maybe you have a different view of multiculturalism that justifies (or somehow enables) genocide?  i&#39;m not clear on what that reasoning is.</p>

<p>Of course I didn&#39;t keep any links, but there was at least three movies out in the past year in this vein, which seems excessive to me.</p>

<p>My guess is that we are going to see a push for more crap like this, if not with the target of legalization of the depravity, then for the distraction value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our masters -- the elite who control our minds through our media and our schools -- are determined to destroy our Western Christian culture. That means destroying everything that is good and pure.</p>

<p>They cannot do this all at once, so they move progressively from one moral outrage to another, desensitizing us to one perversion after another after another. They do it so well, most people forget that the activities they now embrace as the latest trend were once classed as abominations.</p>

<p>But as we eliminate one perversion after another from our moral outrage, we are left with only the more extreme perversions. OK, we got rid of the outrage and shock over birth control. So we move on to abortion. We got rid of the shock and outrage over homosexuality. So we move on to pedophilia. And bestiality. And cannibalism.</p>

<p>Do you see where this is going? It is a suicidal course that seeks to destroy any moral code, any sense of rightness, or the sacred, or the good. We have been &quot;progressed&quot;, by our overlords, about as far as the Caesars progressed ancient Rome, shortly before it fall to the barbarians.</p>

<p>Well, as various writers have pointed out, the barbarians are knocking on our doors, but we are too busy performing fellatio on sheep with carrots up our asses to listen to them.</p>

Lack of knowledge is made to appear heroic in media entertainment -- for example, John Belushi smashing the guitar in the movie <em>Animal House</em>. Greater than average intelligence is presented as somehow comical, pathetic, contemptible, undesirable. The desirable thing, according to this cult of ignorance, is to play sports. Those who play sports are presented as the leaders, the heroes. Those who read and think are presented as pathetic misfits who are to be mocked, or at best marginally tolerated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO Andy Warhols expression  &quot;In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes&quot; in 1968 acted as a &quot;whore all&quot; seed. One of many cultural pivot points of sorts. IMO he made the expression partially to express one hit wonders that he was possibly deserving of &amp; maybe wished he was. He was known to dread the losing of his privacy to the cultural masses &amp; vulturous media that would often no leave him alone in public. Once famous imprints are made &amp; one is often forever noticed by the public. The ill machine grinned  with disease causing humor as 15 minutes was an unintentional carrot on a stick creating a newer illusion to the BS american dream. The masses still think they shall get 15 minutes of fame, while Andy said it IMO as that was all he could take on some levels &amp; was sick of the ill liked aspects that go along of the fame. <em>IMO dude had OK skills &amp; was innovative, but was mostly all hype. IMO canvas paintings &amp; signed prints should not ever be worth massive amounts of money, but that is another rant</em>.</p>

<p>@ one point in time blacklisting was a reality. sometimes the shunning was ill applied, but it is a thing needed to keep the fabric of a culture clean IMO. </p>

<p>Move forward..., 1987 Joel Steinberg  Hedda Nussbaum &amp; the adopted/stolen baby Lisa they both murdered. He went to prison on first-degree manslaughter &amp; served 17 years. IMO baby killers should not ever walk among the civil again in a civilized society. His cohort &amp; seemingly assistant cokehead murderess co~killer Nussbaum testified for the state in  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedda_Nussbaum"><strong>The legal case was one of the first to be televised &quot;gavel to gavel.&quot;</strong></a>. IMO she may have been the one to strike the killing blows these blow head sadomasochists inflicted upon a 6 year old child they stole. She was paraded as an abuse woman, as if she had little role in the murder. Here nose was all bashed in making her face look ill &amp; I suspect cocaine use had a role in why her face was soo injured due to softening of tissues combined with the abuse Steinberg inflicted on her. I am not trying to state she was not beaten hard, but even in run of the mill domestic violence the woman often plays a role &amp; is not always totally innocent. I am making the observation coke use was spotlighted on Steinberg &amp; not Nussbaum. I have known cokeheads with the same look as Nussbaum. A collapsed nose is common with heavy use. I suspect he was hitting her &amp; she may have been hitting the child to vent in a domestic abuse downward cycle. He likely noticed this becoming cold to seeing the child hurt &amp; possibly jumped on board hitting the child, but men most often beat wives &amp; sons while they tend to rape young girls. Just my detective profiling guess upon the defective national spectacle. No matter the exact detail she was an active party to the child death.</p>

<p>Nussbaum walked away from being tried as an accomplice &amp; she clearly was. She made a deal with people magazine for large loot &amp; profited on the slaughter of a baby. She went on to make a career of <a href="http://articles.philly.com/1989-04-07/news/26143385_1_hedda-nussbaum-joel-steinberg-disbarred-lawyer">selling her story</a> I doubt the IRS even knows <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surviving-Intimate-Terrorism-Hedda-Nussbaum/dp/1413756522">how many ways she has milked money</a> from the ill machine she is a gear in.</p>

<p>When people magazine payed that evil woman, It was the first time I blacklisted a media source. The current modern mass media &amp; their masses indoctrinated reality has stopped shunning even minor celebrity criminals. Killers, criminals, &amp; racist make big top circus loot $_$ &amp; sell large plots in the current hell on earth, while the people eat it like bread. Today blacklisting is almost non existent, if charlie manson got released he would have record deals &amp; possibly his own talk show. The ill machine would milk his 15 minutes of evil for every cent it could.</p>

<p>Society means &quot;companionship, friendly association with others&quot; &amp; it ended long ago outside of small groups, if it ever really existed on the worlds stage ever, in the modern industrial eras. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything in this society is set up to keep us dumbed down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Soo many reasons too many to list 0_-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. The key point you mention is that the entire structure of society is arranged to distract us all with meaningless trivialities and hide the truth about important issues. The ruling class in charge does not want us thinking important thoughts, or asking the big questions.</p>

<p>Have you see what happens when someone from alternative news asks a politician a question ... a <em>real</em> question? The politician freezes like a deer in the headlights. He hasn&#39;t been programmed to answer real questions. He doesn&#39;t know what to say.</p>

<p>Those of us who are awake represent the future. The rest of society are zombies and will take whatever is given to them, as they are taking it now. It is a fight between the elite ruling class, and the rest of us who are awake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point, but I think it&#39;s actually less that society is designed to keep people occupied with trivial things than society has been whittled to give the majority of people the trivial things that they worship. It&#39;s not like there weren&#39;t incidents of people trying to ban triviality, but if the majority of people want it, you can&#39;t stop it. The media merely fans the fire because they just want to get money. </p>

<p>Basically, the worst punishment you can give people is to let them suffer the fruits of their own labor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What needs to happen is a global awakening of consciousness. Why? Because where most of the world currently is consciously is rather sad and low. You can&#39;t blame the masses though. They don&#39;t know any better because they&#39;ve been indoctrinated from the minute they entered grade school and if their parents aren&#39;t self aware, then they have no chance to rise. It&#39;s always a choice to desire to see the Truth but many people don&#39;t know they even have that choice due to the fact that the way They structured society makes it seem like this is all we will know and ever amount to. There is NO GAME. There is only CONTROL. </p>

<p>They want to control virtually every aspect of your life. Above all, they want your Mind because Mind is All. All is God. God is your wonderful human imagination. I don&#39;t care for atheists and their arguments because they&#39;ve already lost themselves and they&#39;re exactly the type of people the NWO wants to introduce into society. You have the Power. YOU can change the way it is if you really want to see it happen. Remember that YOU are never alone in your idea of a righteous world. Once you see it in your Mind to rise then millions  will follow. We are consciously connected to the whole universe. </p>

<p>Start with the paper from 10/18, and read towards the present to get a nice read about how the CIA has systematically destroyed rational thought and art to help make the rich richer. There&#39;s other very good conspiracy stuff on there too. </p>

<p>There is the old saying, &#39;Be the change you wish to see in the world&#39;. I&#39;m summarizing perhaps, but it&#39;s true. Live life exactly how you want to, find your niche, then when you are a success people around you will listen. Build your library up, on your shelf and in your head. Don&#39;t be a dick about it, but show people the way to a better life is living it better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m happy I took the red pill. I wouldn&#39;t want to live a life of ignorance. And yes, you are correct, in many cases the only escape is to take yourself apart from society. This is what the early Christians did during the decadence of ancient Rome. Read the autobiography of Saint Augustine. He couldn&#39;t stand the corruption of Rome, so he left to live in the countryside where the stench of corruption was less. We are in exactly the same position today as the early Christians faced in decadent Rome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a very gloomy and depressed outlook. You can f.ex. start by moving to a country that is more socialist. I&#39;m in scandinavia which is more socialist than most which makes for a pretty big difference to hard-capitalist countries. Also there are many other options to those you listed. You could go be a kung-fu monk in China f.ex. etc etc.</p>
