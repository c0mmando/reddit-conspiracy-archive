    <div class="md"><p>Just to be clear, we need to hit &quot;report&quot; beneath the comment that we want to report, and then message one of the mods personally to explain why we are reporting this person, right?</p>

<p>When I have used the &quot;report&quot; link I have been told that I need to also do the 2nd step if I want any action.  </p>

<p>This is the message I sent to both <a href="/u/mr_Dong">/u/mr_Dong</a> and <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowaway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowaway</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure if it rises to the banning level, but <a href="/u/Literally_A_Fedora">/u/Literally_A_Fedora</a> seems to exude hostility with every comment. He likes to tell people they are &quot;a fucking moron,&quot; &quot;a cunt,&quot; &quot;crazy,&quot; &quot;forgot to take their meds,&quot; etc.  As I recall you are on troll patrol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the entire comment is just an insult towards the previous commenter, I call that useless trolling and hostility.  These are clearly &quot;posts that attack users.&quot;  There is no meaningful content, just an insult, usually from the conspiratard position.  Looking at <a href="/u/Literally_A_Fedora">/u/Literally_A_Fedora</a>&#39;s page, I see that other subs also consider him a troll and he is continuing to spew venom on a daily basis.  </p>

<p>If you hit the report link and you just send a PM to a single mod that&#39;s okay. However, not all mods are available all of the time. You may happen to message one that&#39;s unavailable for a couple weeks. When sending a PM to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> it goes to &quot;modmail&quot; and all available mods will see and discuss it.</p>

<p>Perhaps this information should be stickied so everyone knows how to report trolls.  This thread has so many downvotes (by those same trolls) that it won&#39;t be seen by many people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I don&#39;t even, wow.</p>

<p>I suppose I claimed he&#39;s a shill because that&#39;s all he does, spam that one image all over conspiracy in the comments section.</p>

<p>Why would some random troll focus all of his time and attention just on conspiracy?</p>

<p>I mean honestly, Reddit is owned by Conde Nast, what if they are paying people to shill here?</p>

<p>I bet they are paying shills to censor information all over Reddit so that the comments don&#39;t turn completely against the interests of their many various publications and other financial holdings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why?</p>

<p>There are multiple levels of shills, and I feel these obvious ones are an amalgam of shills, like they&#39;re constantly running 5 accounts like that.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t use actual research like the higher level shills do, who probably get paid more.</p>

<p>People get paid to do horrifically shitty things and keep it a secret all the time, because people suck ass.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to propose a rule change or addition we&#39;re certainly willing to discuss it. This issue has been taken up in the past and it seems, to me at least, the problem is actually defining the difference between trolling/shilling and legitimate disagreement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not report the comment, and this is why I posed the question.</p>

<p>This account needs to be banned because he is at the least, clearly trolling.</p>

<p>I feel that accounts that are less than a year old ( 3 months in this case ) whose majority of posts to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are conspiratard images that are mocking this sub should be banned.</p>

<p>I feel like we need to implement a way to report suspected users in a manner that would allow for the reporting party to present solid evidence as to their accusations.</p>

<p>I think an easy solution for this would be a mod whose sole responsibility is to sort out these claims in a manner where there are case logs so as to allow for transparency.</p>
