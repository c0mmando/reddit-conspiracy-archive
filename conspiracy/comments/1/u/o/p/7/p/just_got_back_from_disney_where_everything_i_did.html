        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just returned from a family trip to Disney, and I feel like my eyes were opened. I was tracked everywhere, and in the name of &quot;convenience&quot; I was encouraged to give them information (financial, personal, etc).
On one end of the spectrum, it&#39;s innocent-just a company trying to maximize profits and tailor their advertising and the consumer&#39;s experience. The other end of the spectrum is wide open. With the recent revelations that corporations are working with the government, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a company like Disney was a great place to try out technology.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I noticed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/doug-lansky/disney-magic-band_b_4528094.html">Track location and purchase history/patterns-They are now rolling out arm-bands with RFID. After your visit, you take the bands home with you.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2012/08/02/disney-rolls-out-free-wifi/">Track location and potentially collect computer/phone info and more-They offer free unsecured wifi throughout parks and resorts</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/mobile-apps/">Collect unique phone data-They provide users with a smartphone app that links their RFID wristband with their smartphone</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney&#x27;s_PhotoPass">Collect photo ID-They link your profile to photos with a Photopass, meaning they have picture ID on you as well</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.biometricupdate.com/201303/walt-disney-world-introduces-biometric-verification-for-passholders">Collect biometric data-Since 1996, each person entering the park had to provide a fingerprint ID.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Clearly they are collecting my financial information, my biometric info, my picture, tracking my purchases and more. I know they can track my phone anyways throughout the park/resorts via the wifi. </p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<p>Once i download their app and link it to me, do they then link my phone&#39;s ID to me for tracking? </p>

<p>Can they track the RFID chips in the band&#39;s once I bring it home? </p>

<p>Do you think Disney works with the US government in areas like this (data mining, tracking people)? </p>

<p>Is this a thinly veiled roll out to get people from all over the world used to being tracked via RFID?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a friend who worked at a big box store corporate office.  Decently high up the chain involved with designing store displays and store layouts for the nationwide chain.  This is back in around 2008-2009. </p>

<p>He had access to their national data in terms of how people interact with the stores, tracking, and so on.  The tech was beyond what you&#39;re describing at Disney, back in 2008.  </p>

<p>1) They don&#39;t need RFID.  They can use face scanning.  The tech for this was actionable around the turn of the century.  That means they know its you by looking at you.  Or rather the system knows its you.  </p>

<p>2) They tie that face scan to your credit card, address, and other data when you stop at the register.  Because of course they are filming your face there for your security.  </p>

<p>3) They therefore have years of data on what you buy and how you interact with their locations.  </p>

<p>4) The level of detail is this precise: They know every time you paused in front of a display for more than 5 seconds, and every time you reached for something on the shelf, as well as what you ended up buying.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s 2008 level technology.  And it was passe at the time.  It makes sense if you think about it for profit making, but in the hand of a tyrant it is something else entirely.  </p>

<p>Just so you know.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question, I don&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t think the full tech is rolled out at every store.  My guess is A) They use it at a few select locations and use that to extrapolate the information to the rest of their stores, because this is a cheaper solution that gives them nearly-as-good data about customer behavior, and B) the data-collection system is set up for store optimization and not loss prevention.  </p>

<p>In other words for as many millions as they lose from theft they make substantially more millions by getting into your head, and chose to invest in that.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Can they track the RFID chips in the band&#39;s once I bring it home? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. RFID is a very short range radio technology. They typically only hold a large serial number. They mostly work by having many RFID readers spread out. By logging when your serial number was seen at multiple RFID reader locations and at what time, one can plot a path you took. </p>

<p>When you go home, your RFID is sitting there doing nothing. It requires the radio signal from the RFID reader to even power the electronics in the RFID tag. </p>

<p>Now when you have RFID readers spread out over an entire city, like they did with the non-toll areas of the NYC tool fast pass RFID car tags, then is when you get into privacy issues.</p>

<p>So if there are no RFID readers around, your RFID tag does nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question, I don&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t think the full tech is rolled out at every store.  My guess is A) They use it at a few select locations and use that to extrapolate the information to the rest of their stores, because this is a cheaper solution that gives them nearly-as-good data about customer behavior, and B) the data-collection system is set up for store optimization and not loss prevention.  </p>

<p>In other words for as many millions as they lose from theft they make substantially more millions by getting into your head, and chose to invest in that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You most certainly do get fingerprinted. My family and I went to the Orlando, FL parks in August, 2013, and part of the admissions process was to offer up the thumb into a scanner. Ostensibly, it&#39;s to prevent you from sharing your admission with someone else, but it creeped me out.</p>
