<p>First, I&#39;m just asking a question. Second, where are the pissed off young people that you speak of? There are a few on this board and some others after the NSA scandal. But, which ones are planning on forcing the government to change? That&#39;s a serious question. </p>

<p>it&#39;s where you take something nice that your friends worked hard to create and you shit on it. in this case, thousands of people worked their asses off on failed petitions and marches and shit. they finally won and now you want to claim that their hard work was part of some reactionary plot.</p>

<p>do you know anyone who works for norml/ssdp/aclu or any of these advocacy organizations? they&#39;re cool people and you&#39;re calling them all stooges or narcs.</p>

<p>But, which ones are planning on forcing the government to change? </p>

<p>everyone in WA/CO who passed the referendum. all the medical mj advocates. people are going to jail and losing their right to vote or be arrested for civil disobedience without going back to prison. when we change the laws, all these people will get their votes back. it&#39;s like a legal jailbreak!</p>

<p>TPTB sure as fuck did not spend decades locking up the poor and minorities because they want them out, voting, and pissed off. </p>

<p>do you think a peaceful revolution is more or less likely if all the police and soldiers and their families are stoned/tripping on acid/giving E backrubs?</p>

<p>i think more hallucinogens means more chance for world peace and justice. it forces violent and greedy people to deal with their psychological trauma without hurting others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except cannabis tends to open people&#39;s minds to political reality, instead of the other way around, and it played a big role in the near-revolution of the late 1960&#39;s. The federal government has waged war on it for decades, and arresting young people for pot is a great way to wage constant low-intensity warfare on them. And the handful of legalization victories we&#39;ve had are because of the hard work of grassroots activists.</p>

<p>You&#39;d prefer to keep locking people in jail for a harmless plant that brings a lot of people joy? You think that&#39;s revolutionary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for weed legalization. I was doing research into the history of legalization and saw that D.C. and Tennessee are both considering some level of legalization. I do thing that it has the potential to open the minds of people. </p>

<p>But, I think those people need to have some questions about the current situation first. At least that&#39;s how it worked for me. If you look at today&#39;s youth compared to the youth of the 60&#39;s, you see a startling difference. To put it briefly, were stupider. That that as offence if you want, but if you study the data, you see a sharp decline in test scores across the board. In fact, they have started making a lot of college entrance tests easier just to make sure kids can still get in compared to previous decades.</p>

<p>The plant is harmless and can bring people joy, but it makes you lazier. If you disagree with that, then you are just as bad as the people who claim all the negatives about weed without looking at the studies. That type of drug in the hands of kids who are already lazy and stupid is a scary combination to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What on Earth makes you correlate the stupidity of my generation to weed? My guess is that you don&#39;t smoke yourself. Yeah? Do you not have much experience at all with it?</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that weed contributes to laziness if it&#39;s heavily abused. If it&#39;s used moderately it does nothing of the sort. It certainly doesn&#39;t do that to me- quite the opposite; it inspires me. You find that with most older people who have been smoking for a long time. I don&#39;t know what examples to use- maybe start with Carl Sagan. Cannabis does not make people stupider, sorry; good luck finding anyone who&#39;s actually experienced with it who agrees with that. I find exactly the opposite. I think we should be looking for other explanations for why the young generation is less intelligent. Heavy prescription pill prescribing to little kids, perhaps? Kids being brought up on television and video games? Diets totally devoid of actual nutrition? Schools that don&#39;t encourage creativity and for poor kids are like prisons? That would be a start.</p>

I&#39;ve been smoking for years and I&#39;m currently working on my masters in health sciences.

    <div class="md"><p>Im looking a lot farther down the road I guess. The people who are going to do the rising up is the youth imo. Nothing is effecting them right now, and likely wont until years in the future. If the trend of legalization continues, then more and more of our youth will have access to weed. I can guess that people would rather stay inside and smoke a joint when things start to look scary outside instead of going out the protest.</p>

<p>First, I&#39;m just asking a question. Second, where are the pissed off young people that you speak of? There are a few on this board and some others after the NSA scandal. But, which ones are planning on forcing the government to change? That&#39;s a serious question. </p>

<p>Last time I checked, revolution isn&#39;t a parade. Its a serious concept with serious consequences. </p>
