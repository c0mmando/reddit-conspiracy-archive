       First, I'm just asking a question. Second, where are the pissed off young people that you speak of? There are a few on this board and some others after the NSA scandal. But, which ones are planning on forcing the government to change? That's a serious question.

       it's where you take something nice that your friends worked hard to create and you shit on it. in this case, thousands of people worked their asses off on failed petitions and marches and shit. they finally won and now you want to claim that their hard work was part of some reactionary plot.

       do you know anyone who works for norml/ssdp/aclu or any of these advocacy organizations? they're cool people and you're calling them all stooges or narcs.

       everyone in WA/CO who passed the referendum. all the medical mj advocates. people are going to jail and losing their right to vote or be arrested for civil disobedience without going back to prison. when we change the laws, all these people will get their votes back. it's like a legal jailbreak!

       TPTB sure as fuck did not spend decades locking up the poor and minorities because they want them out, voting, and pissed off.

       do you think a peaceful revolution is more or less likely if all the police and soldiers and their families are stoned/tripping on acid/giving E backrubs?

       i think more hallucinogens means more chance for world peace and justice. it forces violent and greedy people to deal with their psychological trauma without hurting others.

       Except cannabis tends to open people's minds to political reality, instead of the other way around, and it played a big role in the near-revolution of the late 1960's. The federal government has waged war on it for decades, and arresting young people for pot is a great way to wage constant low-intensity warfare on them. And the handful of legalization victories we've had are because of the hard work of grassroots activists.
      </p>

       You'd prefer to keep locking people in jail for a harmless plant that brings a lot of people joy? You think that's revolutionary?

       I'm all for weed legalization. I was doing research into the history of legalization and saw that D.C. and Tennessee are both considering some level of legalization. I do thing that it has the potential to open the minds of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I think those people need to have some questions about the current situation first. At least that's how it worked for me. If you look at today's youth compared to the youth of the 60's, you see a startling difference. To put it briefly, were stupider. That that as offence if you want, but if you study the data, you see a sharp decline in test scores across the board. In fact, they have started making a lot of college entrance tests easier just to make sure kids can still get in compared to previous decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plant is harmless and can bring people joy, but it makes you lazier. If you disagree with that, then you are just as bad as the people who claim all the negatives about weed without looking at the studies. That type of drug in the hands of kids who are already lazy and stupid is a scary combination to me.

       What on Earth makes you correlate the stupidity of my generation to weed? My guess is that you don't smoke yourself. Yeah? Do you not have much experience at all with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say that weed contributes to laziness if it's heavily abused. If it's used moderately it does nothing of the sort. It certainly doesn't do that to me- quite the opposite; it inspires me. You find that with most older people who have been smoking for a long time. I don't know what examples to use- maybe start with Carl Sagan. Cannabis does not make people stupider, sorry; good luck finding anyone who's actually experienced with it who agrees with that. I find exactly the opposite. I think we should be looking for other explanations for why the young generation is less intelligent. Heavy prescription pill prescribing to little kids, perhaps? Kids being brought up on television and video games? Diets totally devoid of actual nutrition? Schools that don't encourage creativity and for poor kids are like prisons? That would be a start.

       I'm not sure which part of my statement correlated smoking weed with being stupid. I've been smoking for years and I'm currently working on my masters in health sciences. I'm not sure how to respond to anything else you said because I clear indicated that stupidity and marijuana use are two separate things. Your a little too quick to defend weed.

       Even though a state might legalize recreational use, it still violates federal law. I think we're looking more at shifting demographics and a desire to increase tax revenue.

       That might be the case it were legalized, but it's not. It's not technically legal in the states where it's been legalized. These states have legalized it in defiance of the federal government, and it was because the citizen's wanted it.

       I mean, marijuana is big news right now, and the public has shown it supports it even more now. I feel like marijuana articles will have a good reader turnout with current events going on. Whatever brings in more viewers.

       I get where your coming from. This isn't really an argument but, Ill leave it hear anyway... 60 Minutes did a report on exactly what you are talking about. In that report they talked about how it was still illegal but, they wouldn't enforce it unless you tried to take the weed out of state.
      </p>

       Just think about that for a second. 60 Minutes..

       No. It never should have been prohibited in the first place. It was big business (alcohol/paper) that got it banned. I think people will still up rise even if it's legal. Shit has to hit the fan first. People won't do anything until it starts effecting then personally

       Im looking a lot farther down the road I guess. The people who are going to do the rising up is the youth imo. Nothing is effecting them right now, and likely wont until years in the future. If the trend of legalization continues, then more and more of our youth will have access to weed. I can guess that people would rather stay inside and smoke a joint when things start to look scary outside instead of going out the protest.

       George Washington and others had their own marijuana fields and it was illegal for years. Smoking won't stop people from standing up for themselves. People just don't feel personally threatened yet. I bet they won't get active till marital law is declared

       I'm honestly hoping for the opposite.  Perhaps the marijuana issue will be the thing that shows young people the importance of voting and the power of their vote.  I'm hoping that marijuana will galvanize the youth and get them to show their power so we can get these war profiteers and dinosaurs out of government.  With voter apathy at an all time high, the Old White Boys (neo-cons) count on us not voting.  GET OUT AND VOTE GUYS!

       That's not true. They have the same stance as South Korea. You get caught with any amount and you will be sent to jail for a few years. Probably longer in the North since they tend to be crazier.

       First, I'm just asking a question. Second, where are the pissed off young people that you speak of? There are a few on this board and some others after the NSA scandal. But, which ones are planning on forcing the government to change? That's a serious question.
