I believe all this Rodman going to N Korea bs is a cover for the CIA or whoever to gain intelligence on North Korea. Think: why the everloving fuck would Dennis rodman of all people just randomly decide to befriend modern day Dr. Evil? He&#39;s the only person who can safely go there without raising suspicion. Everyone thinks he&#39;s a joke, a little off his rocker but harmless. Now they have the perfect cover for some serious spy motherfuckers to pose as part of his entourage, get into North Korea, and gain intelligence. Snoop around, see what Kim jong is actually up to. This serves a purpose because that country is a lockbox.</p>

<p>Rodman says nothing but positive things because that&#39;s his role. He is forever the diplomat and doesn&#39;t need to explain or justify his actions because he&#39;s Dennis MF Rodman, and he do what he want. He plays nice, puts on some games, but above all he KEEPS GETTING INVITED BACK. I think it makes sense and his refusal to speak out about Kenneth Bae only reinforces this theory; by not speaking out Rodman may be opening the door for some under the table dealings to actually free him. </p>

<p>Thin...but this is r/conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two possibilities:</p>

<p>Scenario 1: The Zoolander plan</p>

<p>The United States needs to find someone completely beef headed to become a Manchurian Candidate for brain washing to assassinate Kim Jong.  When he is ultimately executed for his crime by North Korea, the United States will not have lost anyone of significance but planted the seed for ultimate NK take over.</p>

<p>Scenario 2: An omelet from an egg plan</p>

<p>The CIA or what have you needs a fall guy to go over to NK, get drunk, snort 17 kilos of blow, and then do something stupid that gets him murder/raped with an ak47 buttstock.</p>

<p>They realize Kim Jong likes basketball and they quickly review the candidates from the pro basketball scene who might just be correct for this type of job.</p>

<p>Obviously, Dennis Rodman is the top choice and when he ultimately is executed for peeing on a statue, the USA will use his death to invade NK and take over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we at least need to acknowledge scenario 3.</p>

<p>Dennis Rodman is eccentric as fuck. Well before he ever left the NBA Rodman was one of the strangest people you&#39;d ever see.  Yes, that makes him a perfect candidate for the CIA, but it also makes it somewhat reasonable to think he may just be doing this on his own.</p>

I honestly just think he&#39;s some crazy guy (I feel comfortable saying that because I was and am a big fan of his basketball career) that has chosen to befriend some other equally crazy person (not a fan of him though).

US has tons of allies that also have prison camps, crush dissent, run by megalomaniac dictators, but we don&#39;t paint them so harshly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well actually the goverment doesn&#39;t call them death camps, that&#39;s what I called them. The US doesn&#39;t really give a fuck and a half about North Korea though. They barely have mentioned them since the Bush years. No profit in North Korea so they don&#39;t care. However they have a  despicable disgusting leader and no one should defend him. How is it when the US does horrible stuff they are worse than Hitler, but when North Korea does horrible stuff it&#39;s all propaganda. Please, if you think the US is unfairly treating Iran then that&#39;s a legitimate argument, but North Korea is actually terrible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are a lot of terrible places in the world that dont get the attention PRK does.  PRK makes headlines once a week.</p>

<p>washingtonpost.com and cnn call them &quot;death camps&quot; and &quot;horror camps&quot; (quick google search)</p>

<p>I try not to criticize the US in any more harsh terms than I do PRK or any other country. But to call PRK terrible makes it seem like you have some experience, and its significantly worse than the US.  But you dont have experience; the points you make generally have comparison to happenings in the US and its allies; youre citing US media, known to be controlled by US govt, which has a history of trying to destroy the PRK, and seems to be continuing that agenda (though as you pointed out, they have other more important govts to topple as well).</p>

<p>Please, if you have legitimate criticism of PRK, we&#39;re all interested as there is very little reliable information available, but its pretty useless to say things like &quot;terrible&quot;, &quot;prison camps&quot;, &quot;disgusting leader&quot; given these things exist in the US and dont reference actual events/evidence, therefore not enabling a reader to accurately compare PRK to anything.</p>

<p>Dennis Rodman is eccentric as fuck. Well before he ever left the NBA Rodman was one of the strangest people you&#39;d ever see.  Yes, that makes him a perfect candidate for the CIA, but it also makes it somewhat reasonable to think he may just be doing this on his own.</p>
