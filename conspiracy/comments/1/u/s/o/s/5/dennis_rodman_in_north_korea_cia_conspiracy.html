       Please give me karma because this might get me arrested?
I believe all this Rodman going to N Korea bs is a cover for the CIA or whoever to gain intelligence on North Korea. Think: why the everloving fuck would Dennis rodman of all people just randomly decide to befriend modern day Dr. Evil? He's the only person who can safely go there without raising suspicion. Everyone thinks he's a joke, a little off his rocker but harmless. Now they have the perfect cover for some serious spy motherfuckers to pose as part of his entourage, get into North Korea, and gain intelligence. Snoop around, see what Kim jong is actually up to. This serves a purpose because that country is a lockbox.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodman says nothing but positive things because that's his role. He is forever the diplomat and doesn't need to explain or justify his actions because he's Dennis MF Rodman, and he do what he want. He plays nice, puts on some games, but above all he KEEPS GETTING INVITED BACK. I think it makes sense and his refusal to speak out about Kenneth Bae only reinforces this theory; by not speaking out Rodman may be opening the door for some under the table dealings to actually free him.

       Two possibilities:
      </p>
      <p>
       Scenario 1: The Zoolander plan
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States needs to find someone completely beef headed to become a Manchurian Candidate for brain washing to assassinate Kim Jong.  When he is ultimately executed for his crime by North Korea, the United States will not have lost anyone of significance but planted the seed for ultimate NK take over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scenario 2: An omelet from an egg plan
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA or what have you needs a fall guy to go over to NK, get drunk, snort 17 kilos of blow, and then do something stupid that gets him murder/raped with an ak47 buttstock.
      </p>
      <p>
       They realize Kim Jong likes basketball and they quickly review the candidates from the pro basketball scene who might just be correct for this type of job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, Dennis Rodman is the top choice and when he ultimately is executed for peeing on a statue, the USA will use his death to invade NK and take over.

       I think we at least need to acknowledge scenario 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dennis Rodman is eccentric as fuck. Well before he ever left the NBA Rodman was one of the strangest people you'd ever see.  Yes, that makes him a perfect candidate for the CIA, but it also makes it somewhat reasonable to think he may just be doing this on his own.

       You're talking about the "leave it to beaver" or "wildcard" plan where a willing participant of a rogue status infiltrates an organization completely on their own fruition and turns the entire place upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just don't see too many of these anymore from a foreign perspective (rogue agents going outside of the USA).  We have a ton of these patriots trying to bring down establishment from within our country though like Jenny McCarthy and Fred Phelps.

       While I really do like what you were suggesting, it's actually not what I meant.  I honestly just think he's some crazy guy (I feel comfortable saying that because I was and am a big fan of his basketball career) that has chosen to befriend some other equally crazy person (not a fan of him though).  I would love to find out that what you said ends up being true though, I'll take any positive change.

       That'd make for an awesome movie! "Dennis Rodman: Secret Agent" starring Daniel Day Lewis.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a serious note, he's probably not a spy. We all know he's been a weird dude for years. Which I guess makes it the perfect cover. But I don't know what information he can gather that nobody else can.

       I don't think he's a spy or gathering info. I think he's the Trojan horse. An excuse for others with skills to get into the country and seemingly bs around.

       Or maybe he just works for vice, who likes doing edgy shit. And maybe, just maybe kim jong un is an avid basketball fan. Maybe it was a hobby he picked up when he attended university in the USA. Maybe his favorite team is the bulls?

       Rodman is definitely being debriefed by the CIA and State Department, but that doesn't mean he's acting as a spy but more of a diplomat of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are a few people in the Vice entourage who are more directly connected with the CIA.

       Personally, I enjoy watching it and love the idea of ronery rittle Un paying rarge sums of cash to hang out with The Worm...even under the guise of human rerations. I'm usuary wrong, but unrike his fathers, this Un rikes basketbar, and is at reast open-minded enough to have us over for dinner...seems rike a step in the right direction to me.

       ...but I can't help but think, Rodman's traveling with a huge posse, at least as large as a U.S. basketball team...which one of those guys has go go gadget gear or a phone in his shoe????

       its not that hard to get into North Korea. Chinese go in and out all the time (former Chinese roommate lived just across the border and did biz and travel in PRK all the time). Tour groups go in and out all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the real conspiracy is that North Korea isnt that bad of a place, and the US govt tries to pretend its run by Dr Evil because they dont want a "Rothschild" central bank and western masters.

       I'm not saying PRK doesn't have concentration camps; I'm saying so does the US, so why are they so different?   I'm not saying the PRK doesn't crush dissenters,  but so does the US, so why does the US gov act like they're so evil?  US has tons of allies that also have prison camps, crush dissent, run by megalomaniac dictators, but we don't paint them so harshly.

       You don't think its odd the only countries without a western model central bank are PRK and Iran (and in recent history used to be Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan)?

       No.  The US govt's message on PRK is that its evil, the Axis of Evil, its leaders are more incompetent than US leaders, their prison camps are "death camps", they do not deserve any international rights, their methods are worse than the methods the US wants to implement a la South Korea, etc.
      </p>

       Its all relative.  Its the us vs them. Its good vs evil. Its extremely biased with an obvious objective. Its textbook propaganda.

       Well actually the goverment doesn't call them death camps, that's what I called them. The US doesn't really give a fuck and a half about North Korea though. They barely have mentioned them since the Bush years. No profit in North Korea so they don't care. However they have a  despicable disgusting leader and no one should defend him. How is it when the US does horrible stuff they are worse than Hitler, but when North Korea does horrible stuff it's all propaganda. Please, if you think the US is unfairly treating Iran then that's a legitimate argument, but North Korea is actually terrible.

       there are a lot of terrible places in the world that dont get the attention PRK does.  PRK makes headlines once a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       washingtonpost.com and cnn call them "death camps" and "horror camps" (quick google search)
      </p>
      <p>
       I try not to criticize the US in any more harsh terms than I do PRK or any other country. But to call PRK terrible makes it seem like you have some experience, and its significantly worse than the US.  But you dont have experience; the points you make generally have comparison to happenings in the US and its allies; youre citing US media, known to be controlled by US govt, which has a history of trying to destroy the PRK, and seems to be continuing that agenda (though as you pointed out, they have other more important govts to topple as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, if you have legitimate criticism of PRK, we're all interested as there is very little reliable information available, but its pretty useless to say things like "terrible", "prison camps", "disgusting leader" given these things exist in the US and dont reference actual events/evidence, therefore not enabling a reader to accurately compare PRK to anything.

       Dennis Rodman is eccentric as fuck. Well before he ever left the NBA Rodman was one of the strangest people you'd ever see.  Yes, that makes him a perfect candidate for the CIA, but it also makes it somewhat reasonable to think he may just be doing this on his own.
