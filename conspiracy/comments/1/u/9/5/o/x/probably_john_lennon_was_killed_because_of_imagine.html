This song contains the basic answer about how to stop people from suffering. This song become the anthem of all aware people living around the world during the 70&#39;s, and still is now. It represents all the basic ideas that the ruling elite is afraid of. No wonder somebody appeared and killed him 10 years right after this song.</p>

<p>Here is the song - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwUGSYDKUxU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwUGSYDKUxU</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen to Bob Dylan&#39;s new album Tempest and the last song on it, <em>Roll On John</em>, describes the occult imprisonment that the soul/spirit of John Lennon has been under since his murder. I used to think that the conspiracy around John Lennon&#39;s death was bullshit but now I am sure that he was murdered by mind control victim Mark David Chapman...JOhn Lennon actually had an influence on the baby boomers morale. He was like a keystone propping up the hope that the baby boomers had for mankinds future. The death of John Lennon reverberated through the baby boomer psyche so hard that it firmly established negativity in their hearts and souls and spirits and minds. He was not killed over ONE song, he was killed because he was that song and others liked and emulated who he was and what he was saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are saying is all reasonable to me. But I never had any problem in thinking about the murderer as a victim of mind control.</p>

<p>There are two interesting facts here:</p>

<p>1 How many people do you know personally who would kill a celebrity?</p>

<p>2 The killer was caught and ended up in a prison, he was an expendable slave.</p>

<p>BTW - Thanks for the info. I will try the new album.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait. You mean to say that the Illuminati or NWO or something has the power to trap imprison people&#39;s souls after they die....and that Bob Dylan knows all about it and wrote a song about it?</p>

<p>Also, he wasn&#39;t killed because he &quot;was that song and others liked and emulated who he was and what he was saying.&quot; He was killed because that song was a lie. He was filthy fucking rich, with yachts, huge pieces of land, expensive houses, etc, etc. He didn&#39;t share it with others, all the while he was singing &quot;imagine no possessions.&quot; He was an enormous hypocrite. Mark David Chapman has explained that this was the reason he killed him --- for his hypocrisy. </p>

As you might know almost everything in US is based on geometrical figures, symbols and numerology, that are making sense only to THEM. All I can see, is that all the states have geometrically square boards, and cities like NY have square streets. </p>

<p>The only two things I was able to witness trough documental material that showed me he was somehow mentally twistewd are:</p>

<p>1 John Lennon was a guest on some tv show, and he was not feeling well. He had all the signs of mind control, he was unable to stay calm, and was having visible episodes of psychopathy.</p>

<p>2 John Lennon started defending criminals by calling them brothers, apparently because drugs were illegal, so he thought all the people on prison were related to him, and other drugs consuminig hippies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two main signs of mind control that are visible during his interview:</p>

<p>1 The skin on his face was glowing, this happens always when somebody is mesmerized, because the hypnotized brain is blocking the normal functioning of secretions in human body.</p>

<p>2 He was clearly unable to say something he wanted, in case of mesmerization it is common, because the hypnosis is blocking the victim from saying something, even if he knows the answer.</p>

One could make a similar argument with Bob Marley, who I personally think was a victim of assassination.  If you listen to many of Bob Marley&#39;s songs they talk about change and revolution. I didn&#39;t grow up black, but I did grow up poor.  If one changes the thought behind Bob&#39;s songs from a race to an income strata you&#39;ll notice the become universal.  Some examples:</p>

&quot;Today they say that we are free, only to be chained in poverty. Good God I think it&#39;s illiteracy, it&#39;s only machine that make money&quot;
Pure genius.</p>

&quot;Through political strategy, they keep us hungry.  And when you gonna get some food? your brother got to be your enemy&quot;
First stanza about CIA giving weapons to rebels.  This song was written after an attempt on Bob Marley&#39;s life.</p>

<p>I could probably go on hopefully some people will get a new view on Bob Marley&#39;s music that isn&#39;t as well known but I place in higher regard for it&#39;s music and content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. I agree with you. Bob Marley was too young to die. He was one of those singers that all died young and were against the system. Something is really suspicious about all those deaths. Also I wonder why there is still brainwashing going on, even if there are so many artists who say the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it took me many decades to see it clearly but to answer your question yes indeed I do believe that. We can see a.crowley  making an appearance on many albums. This is no coincidence. I have really enjoyed  some of the freeman videos. There is an interview with b.dylan by ed bradley.60 minutes where it is discussed very briefly but a very potent video. It still kinda creeps me out when I see it . A demon can work through any living being as I understand it. The entire entertainment biz is completely committed to lucifer as are the corrupt beyond belief usg and mic. You may never see the horns fire and pitchfork but you will get to see massive corruption,killing lying deceit torture false flag ritual killing control fake war civilian killings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most known hypothesis. You are right about this being very plausible. All those musicians who reached great enlightenment, prosperity, popularity and influence died in that period. It really looks like they had some kind of contract with secret societies.</p>

<p>BTW - It looks like only Jim Morrison tried to tell what is going on, by saying things like &quot;This is the end, my friend&quot;, &quot;Riding the snake&quot;, and other interesting quotes. Probably they were under mind control, that&#39;s why they were unable to explain what was happening to them.</p>
