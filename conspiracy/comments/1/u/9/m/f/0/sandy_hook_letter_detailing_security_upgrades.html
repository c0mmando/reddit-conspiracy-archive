        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I knew I had seen this letter a long time ago and haven&#39;t been able to find it since. I was starting to think I was crazy until I found this link to theblaze talking about the letter in question. I searched and searched and all I could find about it was security measures taken at other schools AFTER sandy hook. No mention of this security upgrade before the shooting.</p>

<p>I found a link talking about the letter on the blaze, but when you click to the link to the site that hosts the letter the page is not found. In my mind this is fucking HUGE. They will not talk about the security cameras they don&#39;t want us to see whatever the fuck actually happened in that shcool that day. This is blowing my fucking mind.</p>

<p>Link to the blaze article: <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/12/14/read-the-letter-sent-to-sandy-hook-elementary-parents-about-security-earlier-this-year/">http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/12/14/read-the-letter-sent-to-sandy-hook-elementary-parents-about-security-earlier-this-year/</a></p>

<p>Link to the site that originally hosted the letter: <a href="http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/news/fairfield_cty/sandyhook-security-policy">http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/news/fairfield_cty/sandyhook-security-policy</a></p>

<p>If anyone can find a copy of this letter that would be awesome. No one ever believes me when I say there was a letter sent out to parents BEFORE the shooting talking about new security measures and cameras.</p>

<p>also, on the widipedia page, this is written in the background section, one of only two items in that section:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of November 30, 2012, 456 children were enrolled in kindergarten through fourth grade at Sandy Hook Elementary School.[17] The school&#39;s security protocol had recently been upgraded, requiring visitors to be individually admitted after visual and identification review by video monitor. Doors to the school were locked at 9:30 am each day, after morning arrivals.[18]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUP1jNwGWNA">here is a vid</a> of Lt Vance talking about the broken glass around the school, and that the first responders or police that first entered the building from multiple positions forced their ways in.</p>

<p>here are some photos from the final report.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/27/article-2530129-1A4FC95C00000578-87_634x717.jpg">this one shows a large hole in a window near the door</a>. we see someone could have entered without using the door, and <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/27/article-2530129-1A4FC95400000578-465_634x416.jpg">the door itself was not shot up</a>. this window is broken but by whom? as Lt Vance stated, law enforcement did break glass to enter the building. <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/28/article-2530129-1A4FFE8100000578-981_634x430.jpg">here&#39;s another of the window.</a></p>

<p>here is a photo of [spent shells] on the ground in front of the school, presumably used to shoot the window out. yet do recall that <em>every single one</em> of the bullets examined in the final report was described as being inconclusive in respect as to whether they came from lanza&#39;s bushmaster.</p>

<p>so, should there have been video of lanza, considering how we are told he entered the building? would he have still been in the camera&#39;s FOV? if so, why hasn&#39;t a single still of him from that video, before the carnage, not been released? </p>

<p>finally, not directly related, but the daily mail article i&#39;ve linked to has a quote at the top from one of the student survivors, &quot;a bad man came into class wearing army clothes&quot;. yet, i didn&#39;t think all black clothing was specifically recognized as &quot;army clothes&quot; to a child, rather than camo clothing. <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/28/article-2530129-1A50052100000578-957_634x429.jpg">this photo in the final report suggests lanza was wearing all black</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the prosecutor&#39;s report, there was no video recorder:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exterior of the main entrance door way had a call box, buzzer system with a video camera. The call box was installed in 2005. The video camera did not record, but the video could be viewed live on three monitoring systems on the secretaries’ desks in the main office, with no recording capabilities. The electronic unlocking of the front doors was done by using a “key button” on any of the three monitoring systems.</p>

<p>The bullets were inconclusive, but all the shells matched the Bushmaster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anybody watches the Sophia S. &quot;documentary&quot; on the Sandy Hook op you will see that, on the day that the op went down, there were not ANY security cams visible. A few days after the op, there was one on the outside school wall--only to disappear again a few days later.</p>

<p>This is just TOO blatant folks. The internet really messed this whole operation up for &quot;them&quot;--and I cannot WAIT until it comes &quot;crashing down on their heads.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I recall correctly it discussed how the school had been upgraded with security cameras, how the doors would be locked at a certain time (9:00AM I believe) and how you would have to buzz in at the main entrance, show your photo ID to the camera, and then they would unlock the door and allow you to enter.</p>
