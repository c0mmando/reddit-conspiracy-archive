<p>It is obvious, that we have a lot of mentally degenrated people in th emilitary, they belong to sects, cults, gangs, or just act alone. But the truth is that any soldier is in danger when he has those poeple around him.</p>

<p>1 She was under mind control, it makes the victim become guillible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, I know that sometimes there are victims of this kind everywhere. And this kind of murders is associated with some kind of ritual, where the victim is a martyr, and the killers are teached to act this way because of some sort of occult excitement. </p>

<p>First the victim is being put under mind control and made belive that evevryone is a friend around, becoming an easy prey because unaware of the danger, and easy to kill. THen one day they just jump on him / her and commit murder, aware of getting away with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about her being a woman. It happened before to men too, and in many countries. All connected trough NATO. Probably her case is paticular, because her parents are intelligent people, and were able to expose somehow what happened.</p>
