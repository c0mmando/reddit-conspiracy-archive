       Happy new year r/conspiracy!
      </p>
      <p>
       2013 proved to be a good year for the sub, 200,000+ subscribers,front page posts and some great additions to the moderator line up. Let's keep moving forward as a popular page for conspiratorial and alternative news stories,
       <em>
        all of you
       </em>
       can help us achieve this.
      </p>
      <p>
       We often face difficulties on how we should best improve the page, as such we want to use this post as an opportunity for everyone to recommend how we can best take r/conspiracy onwards into 2014, and on to a quarter of a million subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone who contributes, up-votes and comments are friends of the community here. We would ask that you give us some input, this is your thread and we are listening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moderator team wish you all well going into the new year. We would ask that you continue to be civil and also respectful of each other. Everyone is entitled to opinion so we hope to further encourage healthy debate on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, whether your preference is politics gone mad, Fukushima, False-flag terrorism or UFOs keep your posts worthy of discussion and check your sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       We want to continue to see improvements with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       over the course of the next year. Encourage debate and discussion and keep faith in the concept of wider truths. Let's keep moving away from name calling and shill shouting. Help the page grow in maturity, invite critical thinkers and work together to challenge corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep it polite and make this thread and the new year postive.
      </p>

       Considering Rule 1 - No Racism of any kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I feel there are way too many undeserved accusations of racism. Perhaps we need a new rule immediately following that says something like:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No accusations of racism. Report any comment you feel violates Rule 1.

       They're not Zionists, they're Jews. Not every Jew is on the same page regarding Israel, but you can be damn sure most are on the same page when it comes to various "hate speech" laws (they drafted and enacted most of them).

       If someone denied evolution I might call them a science denier or an evolution denier.  If someone denies the Holocaust I might call them a Holocaust denier.

       Shouldn't be allowed because he makes an unfounded generalisation about all Jews. This should not be viewed as holocaust denier however. Even if some Jews exaggerated the number killed and if some had a role in Hitler's plans a holocaust still took place. I think we have a duty to recognise that various other holocausts have taken place throughout history also however and give these atrocities against humanity the same respect.

       I have an idea, stop calling people shit because you believe differently than they do.

       What if someone likes Burger King better than MacDonalds, can I call them a golden arches denier?

       You Sir, are a discussion denier.  You have nothing to add because you are too busy running around with your label maker sticking little labels on everything.  I hope you run out of tape and office max closes their doors to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you fall asleep on your friends couch, I hope they draw penises on your face because that is the level of intellect required to prefix the word denier with whatever subject your butthole is chapped over.

      <p>
       No I'm saying calling someone a Holocaust denier is roughly equivalent to calling someone a cream denier, instead of having a DISCUSSION about what their actual views on the Holocaust are or why they don't like cream in their coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its intellectually LAZY to end a discussion by calling people names.  Just because the name you are calling them is crafted out of words that aren't commonly insulting, the intent is to "label them" as a group of people you find distasteful.  This is only slightly higher effort than just outright calling them a retard, but on the scale of effort it is still VERY LOW effort and not at all a DISCUSSION.

       If you want to talk about the holocaust to a denier that's cool I respect that.  But for me, it tells me the person is coming from a pathetic place.  It's not a genuine argument.  Only thing I was asking is it ok to draw attention to someone for making a silly ass argument by calling them what they are.

       Yes I was just thinking about this over the past few days. It can be very unhelpful when users attempt to enforce the rules in public  (especially those rules which have a certain degree of grey area) and I, personally, would much prefer that these matters be reported to the modmail or via a PM to any of the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was on some old phpbb forums back in the day they called it "_____ modding", I just forget the first word. "Couch modding" maybe? "shadow modding"? Damn it I know I'm close I just can't remember the exact term for the behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I would like to possibly see a general rule that prevents users from attempting to enforce the rules in public (as this tends to cause nothing but hostility and degraded discussion), but even your proposed change to rule 1 sounds really good.

       If accusations of racism are only reported to mods, then it seems it would stand to reason that less community input through discussional involvement happens, thus leaving it all in the mods hands not fully in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often enjoy reading the open racism, the accusations of racism, &amp; then how the community responds. Sometimes positive change happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: Sometimes stereotyping stops &amp; direct focus results. A racist statement calling all jews this or that sometimes evolves after group confrontation into "right wing zionists". or Blaming all African Americans for violence using racial slurs becomes inner city gangs or specific individuals or subset groups of them cause [non exclusive to them] violence. Racism often has realities shuffled under the rug that need discussion, under the rug = often reeks of conspiracy &amp; stereotyping is a common ignorant hot headed mistake that needs to not be quickly banned IMO, but given efforts to educate away. If a green dude has his wife raped by a blue dude, then I expect hot headed ignorance venting to be dealt with &amp; not punished by banning, unless the behavior is done continual &amp; troll like, with non opened to earnest cerebral discussion attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just sayin... reporting like hall monitors, is like behind the back snitching &amp; could lead to abuse depending on the mods sole opinions.

       I agree troll type racism accusations are often disruptively ill, just as is non cerebral slur only trolling racism stances most often are, &amp; some that act out to the displeasure of the majority need to be dealt with somehow.
      </p>

       I am not much of a sports fan, but maybe an open discussion call for strike flair or a mod strike flair system could be used for both. [Mostly just thinking aloud, more so than seriously suggesting.]

       None of it makes for much of an issue to me, as I RES tag mark, &amp; I also update my tags in many ways often, to deal with those I find ill.

       Thank you for your civil logical reply to me 0_- &amp; your suggestion that has been placed on the sidebar is also a logical one. I am sure if mods get too wacky with the ban hammer upon people whom do not genuinely need it as the majority of the community desire, then the whole community would find out one way or another &amp; raise a fuss.

       I preferred "No racism." tbh. We can all agree criticising a person for their country of birth or color of their skin is wrong. Religion, creed or doctrine are much greyer areas and should be open for debate. With this rule someone could complain for criticism over being a communist/zionist/nazi/rich and actually have a case...

         Racism
        </a>
        : the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.

       <p>
        <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/slur?q=slur">
         Slur
        </a>
        an insinuation or allegation about

         someone

        that is likely to insult them or damage their reputation
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As used in Rule 1, that "someone" is taken to mean all members of a certain "race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, social order or creed". When "slur" is use in conjunction with "race", as it is in Rule 1, it has the same effect as "no racism".

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't see a problem with that. Typically any "spurious/bogus" posts like that are factually debunked on a regular basis here and end up being detrimental to the posters own agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do see your points though. The terms "insult them" and "damage their reputation" used in the definition of "slur" could be taken to extremes and we'll have to walk a fine line trying not to limit people's freedom to speak their beliefs. The definition of "racism" is only about the
       <em>
        belief
       </em>
       that the races are different. There's no possibly way we can prevent people from having those beliefs. As long as they can express those beliefs without using derogatory terms and without suggesting that different races should be treated differently, then I don't think they should be censored.

       I just wanted to take the opportunity to encourage people to continue to do their own research and don't hesitate to make self posts, especially ones that are well-sourced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Original research by folks who frequent
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       will really boost the credibility of the sub.

       Then it is up to you to make a difference in what they believe. Not all of my friends and acquaintances listen to what i say, some do. I tend to focus on those individuals. many people are comfortably numb, they with bitch and moan about the smaller issues without seeing bigger patterns. Microcosms and macrocosms.

       I think that applies to all of us to a certain extent. Still, as long as we keep trying then we can stand up tall knowing that, win or lose, we did our best.

       Thank you! 2013 Was a crazy year but i don't think we are done. 2014 could prove to be the strangest one yet. Things are unravelling and that could in turn makes agencies like the NSA move it up a gear. Dollar decline, environmental issues and amazing advances in civilian technology point towards the next year being an interesting one to say the least.

       Hello to all the posters here! I wish you a Happy New Year. Let's hope the next year will bring more safety to all of you, your family and friends. Let's not lose the hope, and keep up fighting for the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are down and in trouble, keep fighting. Don't give up, keep kicking. It won't help to wallow in self-pity, or curse your stars or play the blame game. Every adversity has an opportunity couched within. It is up to us to grab it. And what you do when the going gets tough, is what defines your outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is not a battle that we have to keep fighting for everything, but about survival, make sure you help others survive as well. Its not about what we achieved, but how we achieved it.
      </p>
      <p>
       HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!

       I think it would be good to have an updated list of resources, perhaps formatted into a wiki. Another good thing to have in said wiki might be a couple of user-submitted pieces on rationality, skepticism, hope etc..

       Could turn some of armchair activists or lurkers into more active members, and promote the spread of a mindset antithetical to the status quo.

       2014 is the year we will stand up even more. We have now replaced their gubbinmint money system, and we will replace their leadership as well. Do we need drug pushers, liars and murderers in our government?!? Where are our children right now?

       Enjoy the ride, my beloved ;) We'll outsmart them any day, and they know we are coming for justice now - fear not the night.

       It's a whole new game, gentlemen. The initiative is now on our side. Happy New Year to you all!
      </p>

       I love you!!!

       I've had too many occasions trying to explain to someone the proper use of these words and was baffled by how many use it incorrectly.

       Glad to see that a moderator has taken the time to attempt to fix such a pet-peeve of mine.
