       I had my doubts that this would be anything other than another subreddit brigading stuff in here that they don't like.  I was wrong about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also had doubts that people could be respectful toward each other.  I wasn't wrong about that but I wasn't right either.  People do jump out and make bullish attacks, then they get banned and the rest of us continue to discuss things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you guys aren't very trusting of this situation because of solidwhetstone, and his pavaler with conspiratard.  But... what do you have to lose?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my proposition,
      </p>
      <p>
       Go visit
       <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">
        /r/conspiratocracy
       </a>
       ,  read some of the discussion.  Participate in the ones you can.  But do me this one great service - follow the rules to a T.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let yourself get baited into breaking the respect rule.  And if someone is bullying you, calling you names, accusing you of being a racist, DRI (downvote, report, ignore)
      </p>
      <p>
       So far conspiratard has proved what we already know, they can't follow rules and they deserve to be banned.  Can you participate in a respectful discussion without calling people shills or racists?  Are you better than conspiratard?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       So join me, read my posts and chime in.  Let's prove to SWS that we are better than conspiratard, hell let's prove it to ourselves!

       Reposting a comment I made yesterday: 
I can't help but feel like the splinter subs are a bad idea. In AA, when a group starts fracturing and people want to start a new group because of difficult personalities, they have a saying: all you need is a resentment and a coffee pot...
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to work through some unregulated rules here and really have a thread that gets a TRUE consensus of this sub. If we let "the tards &amp; trolls" have THIS much power, wtf will happen when SHTF? We should UNITE in our common beliefs and respectfully disagree about smaller details. Otherwise, we are subverted so, so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       And wtf does conspiratacy or however you spell it even fucking mean?!

       Hey, I'm the second mod over at
       <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">
        /r/conspiratocracy
       </a>
       and I wanted to offer my perspective on how this sub can serve as a compliment to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has proven to be a great place to share information with other people who already think, let's say for instance,  that 9/11 was an inside job. I am going to continue participating here to engage in these kinds of discussions because this is where I first learned so much about all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, we have to recognize that there are many people out there who do not agree with us about many things. While talking amongst ourselves is important, it is also important to talk with people who are not yet convinced of the things we think are important to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the subreddit has been created, there has been much respectful discussion about a wide variety of subjects. Think about it this way: if engaging with people in
       <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">
        /r/conspiratocracy
       </a>
       leads some users of
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       to change their mind about 9/11 truth, won't that be a good thing? And if our hypotheses and theories are exposed to healthy skepticism, won't that be a good thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is much to be gained from subscribing to this subreddit and I hope some more people here join us there.

       I for one will give it a go. I appreciate this respectful approach and, as long as
       <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">
        /r/conspiratocracy

       is allegiant to the facts (and not the Official Facts), then I'm all for seeing what gets posted up there. If I end up in a quagmire of debating hardcore debunkers with their blinders on, then I'll dump the sub.

       Conspiracy has an uphill battle as it stands so I'm certainly not interested in any attempt to undermine it any further.  The conspiratards know they were caught so I believe this new sub is just another rally point for them so they may continue their efforts.  It may appear pristine but it's just a white wash for now.

       I announced it here as well- but it didn't do as well in the voting. I have also announced it on a handful of other conspiracy related subreddits.
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       is so far the only subreddit that was very interested in
       <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">
        /r/conspiratocracy
       </a>
       . That doesn't always have to be the case. Flytape is not from ctard and despite his fringe views on the holocaust- he has been very respectful in his discussions- so he is welcome in
       <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">
        /r/conspiratocracy
       </a>
       . All we ask is that people have respect for each other (most of the sidebar guidelines are variations on that theme). If respect can be had- any viewpoint (no matter how controversial) is welcome.

       Guys, I am ashamed to see
       <a href="/u/solidwhetstone">
        /u/solidwhetstone
       </a>
       's comment in negative territory here. Maybe some of y'all don't like him or feel mad about the moderator thing, but, he stepped down honourably and so far, from what I can see, this post here is respectful. So what if some of you disagree with the splinter sub? We're supposed to be above downvoting just for spite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm subscribed to see what happens. And I can tell you that, yes, if it fills up with the same
       <a href="/r/conspiritard">
        /r/conspiritard
       </a>
       bullshit then yes, the sub will epic-fail. BUT, I personally see this as a huge opportunity to engage those guys on a foundation of respectful rules. IMHO,
       <strong>
        this is what has always been lacking
       </strong>
       . They do drive-bys of our sub here all the time. But if they're willing to handcuff themselves from all their
       <em>
        ad hominem
       </em>
       arguments and insults, well, heck, if what WE over here believe to be the truth can't stand on that foundation, then, hell, we didn't have a leg to stand on anyway, if that's the case. I personally welcome the idea.

       It can and i think this subreddit will help facilitate that. Our userbase consists of subscribers to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       , and many other subreddits of course. If engaging skeptics in this subreddit leads to some people changing their mind about important conspiracies like 9/11, then they'll find their way here too.

       So, just got done checking it out, reading posts and comments. My take on it is that it's a conspiratard hatching ground (recruiting ground). Or better yet,
       <a href="/r/ConspiratardRebooted">
        /r/ConspiratardRebooted
       </a>

       It's not a matter of who "runs" it. My observations are that the tone of the sub leans to a "moderately skeptic" mindset with conspiratard undertones. I saw some thinly veiled disrespect towards conspiracy believers as well. Not a place I'll be visiting in the future.

       The comments why I was banned. Only 2 different comment chains, and one was where I told someone to "kiss my insecure ass". 
Kinda bullshit when one dude is calling sources and theories "retarded" or saying that people who subscribe to certain theories are "insecure" in their "basements", and I'm the one who gets banned.
Sucks for solid cuz his subreddit is about to become a little more circle jerky than before (though before it was a little less circlejerky than r/conspiratard, because the most obvious shill/disinfo posts were dv'd).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I wish I could say I wanted to be unbanned at this point but I
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       don't trust solidwhetstone to be at all partial or fair in his moderation.

       can you link me to the 'retarded' comment i am personally enforcing a strict removal policy re: that kind of language and will give this person a warning if that has not already been done. if there are repeat offenses of this magnitude a ban is in order.
      </p>
      <p>
       i sympathize with where you're coming from but would like to suggest that fighting fire with fire may not be the best response. toning down the rhetoric will make your argument more persuasive
      </p>
      <p>
       all bans are subject to negotiation, and we intend to be very flexible w/r/t unbanning people. We are also going to work hard to ensure that respectful discourse is maintained in the subreddit and will be enforcing a very strict policy against trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       please keep in mind that solidwhetstone is not the only moderator in this subreddit. we will work together to make decisions about things like this. i am coming at this from a perspective that does not see the kinds of generalizations you are referencing as respectful. we will talk about whether or not these kinds of generalizations are worthy of warnings/bans.

       Come post and comment. It's easier to change people's mind in there than r/conspiratard. And it's also a good place to back up your claims with facts and put people on the spot without them being able to go off on circlejerk comments about how edgy we are and whatnot. It's a good idea, and there good discussion going on.

       Yea, how vulgar of me. I'm very ashamed of myself /s. 
Actually, I told sws exactly how I thought about the decision, and how calling out an obvious douchebag, who's comparing the entirety of r/conspiracy to retards and insecure basement dwellers, should not be against the rules. If he wants to ban me for a mild put down seen on PG movies when others are generalizing an entire group of thinkers and using terms demeaning the mentally disabled, then he can have his subreddit.
