<p>I respect everyone&#39;s opinion on vaccinations - some people are for, some people are against, whatever. Your personal choice is just that. I find it really odd, however, that there are so many front page posts that bash anti-vaxxers. It seems like I see at least one post a week where an anti-vaxxer is made to look like a fool, and then a huge circle jerk begins. It&#39;s weird that a place like Reddit, with so many supposedly open minded people, would all unite against anti-vaxxers and be pro vaccinations. Is it just me, or does anyone else find this strange? With so many people who have alternative ideas, I find it off putting that seemingly everyone agrees on this one huge issue. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Especially since most people I know who are described as &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; are not actually anti-vaccine, they&#39;re just pro-holding vaccine makers to account for the safety of their vaccines and investigating/questioning things they put into their bodies. I.e., people smeared as &quot;anti-vax&quot; or &quot;anti-science&quot; are actually pro-choice and pro-scientific method.</p>

<p>Questioning whether all vaccines are safe or necessary isn&#39;t kooky or &quot;woo&quot; - we and our friends and family members are given one body, as far as we know, it&#39;s stupid to blindly, unquestionably accept everything without doing the research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty accurate from my experience.</p>

<p>I tried posting this website <a href="http://www.twoandtalking.com">www.twoandtalking.com</a> a few times. All it is is a site by some doctors who are very experienced who suggest that you space out your vaccines and try to hold off on giving them to your child until they are 2 and talking. They provide a vaccine schedule that they think is more moderate than the one pushed by hospitals and doctors.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even claim that there&#39;s a link to any illness, they just don&#39;t see any reason to put these vaccines into kids who are not likely to be getting any of the illnesses they are vaccinating for.</p>

<p>Anyways, as you can guess, I was always downvoted for posting it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even against vaccines, I just saw that the opposition to people asking questions was so strong that it was not good for any type of real discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing I find funny is that they think they are smart, but are actually quite foolish.</p>

<p>Arguments used are things like:</p>

<ol>
<li>THEY WILL SPREAD THE DISEASE, OMG, I DON&#39;T WANT MY KID GETTING IT FROM YOUR UNVACCINATED KID!</li>
</ol>

<p>Putting aside the fact that most of the outbreaks that have occurred, such as whooping cough, came from the vaccine/vaccinated children, your kid should already be vaccinated, and it shouldn&#39;t matter.</p>

<ol>
<li>AREN&#39;T YOU WORRIED YOUR KID WILL DIE?!? YOU MONSTER!</li>
</ol>

<p>There is something called herd immunity; As long as something like 70% of the population (depends on the disease I&#39;m sure) is vaccinated, then it shouldn&#39;t matter.</p>

<ol>
<li>WHAT IF IT MUTATES AND THE VACCINES ARE NO LONGER EFFECTIVE, YOUR KID WILL KILL ALL OF OUR CHILDREN, YOU MONSTER!!</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, lack of common sense. If these known diseases could mutate so easily, they would have rendered the vaccine useless within a year, much like the flu vaccine. Not to say it can&#39;t happen, but if it is going to happen, it will, whether the kid is vaccinated or not, eventually.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, these same people that are against circumcision (which can become necessary as an adult, better take care of it now, and has no real world provable negative, aside from the rare botched one) are for pumping unknown barely tested drugs into their babies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right but this is still missing a few key things, the main being that anti-vaxxers not vaccinating their kids effects everyone else because these diseases have more chance to mutate with isolated cases, with more people not vaccinating.  It&#39;s a snowball type of effect, with many more unseen causes I&#39;m sure... but feeling lazy to source</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is they are injecting weakened versions of the thing they are vaccinating against, which can cause mutations if the persons immune system decides to not be as good as it needs to be right at that moment. The recent outbreaks were among vaccinated individuals, no non-vaccinated individuals got sick (to my knowledge, at least not during the first round of people getting sick.) I would source, but I have the same excuse.</p>

It seems like anyone who even so much as questions the integrity of vaccinations here on Reddit is labeled as an anti-vaxxer (which seems to have a negative connotation) and is berated.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Mountains&quot; of flawed evidence, sure.  It&#39;s an absolute myth that has been forced as fact.  The risks are clear, yet you&#39;re told not to worry.  To get the vaccines.  To pump your newborn with dozens of full syringes, overloading their system.  Do you feel everyone needs the tetanus vaccine? Why or why not?  Should it be forced on everyone, when the chance of a fatal response is higher to the vaccine, than to the illness itself? It makes no sense.</p>

<p>A goood read about your duping: <a href="http://dprogram.net/2013/05/01/vaccinations-do-we-fall-prey-to-the-herd-mentality/">http://dprogram.net/2013/05/01/vaccinations-do-we-fall-prey-to-the-herd-mentality/</a></p>

<p>Personally, I do not buy in.  The fact that liability has been removed.  The WHO stated that millions were exposed to a cancer causing virus while receiving the vaccine.  Sealing the fact thY they would die early of cancer.  Very powerful people and groups have a shared interest in you living a short, but highly productive life.  I look to them and always question.  Perform my due diligence, without relying on their biased &quot;facts.&quot;</p>

<p>Based on what? If less people are immune, more get infected. If more infected are about the risk to immune-weakened people increases. If you willingly increase the risk for everyone, you are responsible if people die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The efficiency and usefulness of vaccinations, especially against the classic childhood diseases, has been proven repeatedly and consistently; the &quot;alternative&quot; objections have been uniformly disproven. The matter goes beyond personal lifestyle choice, because certain groups cannot be vaccinated yet (babies) or not during certain times (pregnancy, chemotherapy, other diseases), or are usually not refreshed. So when large numbers of people begin refusing to have their children vaccinated, diseases we&#39;ve long believed defeated in the western world, like polio or measles, suddenly spread again, using the unvaccinated populations, but also endangering babies and immune-weakened populations due to more widespread contagion. When your toddler or cancer-afflicted dad dies of measles because some musli-muncher refused to vaccinate his kid based on disproven &quot;science&quot;, it becomes a public issue. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Anti-vaxxers endanger others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And when Merck accidentally distributes a couple million viles of contaminated or otherwise defective vaccine doses..... it also endangers people... arguably more people than would have been endangered in its absence.</p>

<p>tl;dr; - manufacturing defects in vaccines are a closely guarded secret and drive much of the actual problems with vaccines.... but inevitably the argument strawmans into this herd immunity discussion which ignorantly assumes that hundreds of millions of vaccines are manufactured without defect. </p>

<p>im so over this debate. The history of the idea of a &quot;vaccine recall&quot; is interesting..... inasmuch as that its really blown up in frequency lately....  Could it be that for 100 years vaccines were miraculously and perfectly manufactured 99.9999% of the time and then in 2010 they just start making a bunch of shitty batches of vaccines? </p>

<p>then we look at the business consequences and perceived public health consequence of publicizing vaccine defect, contamination, and recalls.... its decreases vaccine use. According to the pro vaccine, this is detrimental to herd immunity....  its also bad for Merck&#39;s bottom line, brand image, share holders and employees for financial reasons....  Its a breeding ground for corruption and MASS distribution of a product who&#39;s development process is more the result of politics both national and corporate... than the result of sound reliable science, manufacturing processes, and quality control processes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not comfortable with voicing my opinions on the matter, so no, I don&#39;t have anything to say. My point is not about the validity of the biology, it&#39;s about people on Reddit being very vocal about their opinions, yet no one is about this. We have people who masturbate to cartoon characters, yet no one opposing vaccinations? There are so many off the wall ideas bouncing around this place, but not anti-vaxxers? The math isn&#39;t adding up, and there&#39;s an underlying problem here. I&#39;m not talking about science, I&#39;m talking about statistics</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Statistically, it checks out. How many people out there are anti-vax? 1%? 0.1%? Now how many of those people use reddit? 10%? 5%? So you can have anywhere from 0.1% to 0.005% of the population of the developed world that&#39;s allowed on the open internet that even believes in the anti-vax movement, never mind enough to openly talk about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I&#39;m not going to continue this argument because neither of us are getting anywhere. You can look at the top comments in this thread and see that something is amiss. Pharma companies have a lot of power and have a monopoly over many things in the US, and I feel that that is reflected on Reddit. If you would put your opinions about vaccinations aside for a moment, I&#39;m sure that you&#39;d realize the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t said anything regarding my beliefs on the matter. Whether I am pro or anti vaccination is not anyone&#39;s business, and I have not attempted to make it anyone&#39;s business, including yours. What I am talking about is not the validity of vaccinations, it is the simple observation that there are not many anti-vaxxers on Reddit, yet there are many people who entertain thoughts, ideas, and beliefs outside of the norm. This is the conspiracy thread, where we talk about companies, politicians, the government, and all kinds of other things controlling our thoughts and ideas, so I thought I&#39;d bring it up. </p>

<p>I am not an idiot or a moron and do not appreciate your presumptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually pretty funny - we have a local news channel that posts scary &quot;So and so is dead. Get your flu shot NOW&quot; articles to their Facebook. (What&#39;s funny/sad is that they post a few days later that the woman didn&#39;t die at all!). Anyway, there are like 50-75 comments under each article, 95% of the comments underneath are people griping about getting sick after the flu shot, people saying they never got one and they never will, people upset with the news for scaremongering, people posting article links to side effects and so on. Every now and then, a comment saying, this is no joke, someone I know died or someone I know is in the hospital, so get your shot.</p>

<p>I can conclude from this that anti-<em>FLU</em>-vaxxers are out there in force. I doubt these folks are 100% against all vaccines, but they&#39;re not buying the flu vaccines. The fact that we see none of this folksy wisdom about the flu shot&#39;s shortcomings in any mainstream thread here on Reddit indicates that your question is definitely a valid one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;All vaccines are 100% safe and only effective if everyone gets all of them.&quot;
Yes. I&#39;ll believe your words when you back them up with a smallpox and an anthrax vaccine. Shit I&#39;ll even pay for those vaccines. Show a video of you getting them and send me the bill. Actions speak louder then words.   </p>

<p>Vaccines like all things have risks and some are more risky then others. The risk of infection from some diseases is higher then others.   </p>

<p>Deaths from small pox vaccine approximately 1 to 2 primary vaccinees died per million vaccinated.<br/>
1,000 people for every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time experienced reactions that, while not life-threatening, were serious.<br/>
52 people per 1 million vaccinated experienced potentially life-threatening reactions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is strange...</p>

<p>But tell me this--is it <em>strange</em> that my local supermarket should give me 25% off of my food bill if I get a flu shot? Since when (and WHY) is my health of such HUGE concern to them??</p>

<p>My 2-year-old has had NO vaccines and has not been sick a day in his life. EVERY one of his friends--flus, colds, ear infections, chicken pox, you name it.</p>

<p>You know what? If they&#39;re so great have them injected into YOUR kids people...we&#39;re doing just fine without them. And FUCK your &quot;herd immunity&quot; statements--they&#39;ve been proven false time and again.</p>
