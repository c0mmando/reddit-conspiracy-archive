    <div class="md"><p>Listen. The NSA shit and 911 is just scratching the surface. The truth is so crazy and convoluted and fucked up that not even the people who think they&#39;re running the fraud know exactly what&#39;s going on. If you need proof of this fact, go to the Stratfor email dump on wikileaks and search &quot;INSIGHT: CIA&quot;. The point is, there&#39;s so much infighting between the elites and the spooks that when shit hits the fan, I&#39;m confident that they will start killing each other as the ship goes down. Obviously a lot of us will be collateral damage but waking up to the fraud and being prepared for it&#39;s collapse is half the battle.</p>

<p>Of course you are going to feel helpless and hopeless and stay up all night shaking in fear at first. We&#39;ve all been there and it&#39;s completely normal. Don&#39;t let this shit ruin your day to day life though. Once you face the truth and start taking the steps you need to be prepared, you will not only feel better but you will feel empowered and in control. </p>

<p>These are the steps I have taken and continue to take to prepare myself and my family for the worst case scenario. I hope it never comes, but if it does, I know that me and my family will be much further ahead of the curve than the people that laughed at the idea that America could ever collapse:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make your family and loved ones aware of how you feel and why. Explain to them why you are stressed and why you are taking the steps you are.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit your exposure to the dollar. The QE bubble has to pop sooner or later. Buy real estate, buy bitcoins, exchange dollars for other currencies and/or gold. Anything. Just don&#39;t be left hanging with all your money in dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>BUY A RIFLE. Do not wait.</p></li>
<li><p>Have food and water on hand. God forbid there is ever a shortage.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak out. If ALL of us continue to SPEAK up about and call out the FUCKING FRAUDULENT pieces of shit that are destroying this country, there will be too many to round up just based on internet chatter. OBAMA IS A PSYCHOPATH MURDERER, there I said it.</p></li>
<li><p>Accept death and pray to God. Don&#39;t be afraid to die standing up for what you believe in. They can take your life but not your soul. Whether you believe in God or Blind Chance, we all must come to terms with the fact that some things are simply out of our hands. Say a prayer to Jesus Christ or The Spaghetti Monster, tell your family and friends you love them and have fun and enjoy life while you have it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, remember that knowing the truth is half the battle. Remember that when a Whistleblower comes out and gives up their life to tell you something &quot;crazy&quot; or &quot;tinfoil fedora conspiritarded&quot; that they know that&#39;s how the public will react. They know that they will be called a pyscho and a &quot;conspiritard&quot; and BE KILLED but they still speak the truth. And for that, you have to hear them out and listen to their stories and take them seriously. Because if you don&#39;t, you won&#39;t be prepared for the moment their words come true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need to read up on it more, but to play devils advocate just for a second
if the most powerful leaders get together now and again behind closed doors they may be able to avert wars and various other unpleasantness be reaching an agreement face to face.   Away from the media. </p>

<p>I see the flip side of it, which is that a lot of policy might be made there
that we are not privy too at the time. </p>

<p>But when these people take the policies back to the US then they have to go through congress and the house and the president right?  They might
vote it straight through but still?  </p>

<p>I have seen some trade agreements be made thought that somehow seem to exist outside of the regular governmental bodies so maybe its the same.</p>

<p>But the media does not have access to regular meetings between heads of state. They make a &quot;media show&quot; before, after, but their meetings are almost always withheld from the public. </p>

<p>I think most what G7, G20, G6 does it behind closed doors too. 
Not that I can advocate that being a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is it isn&#39;t just politicians in these meetings.  Heads of media, large corporations,  just people in power.  What are they in there for?  Making decisions for all of us without our knowledge. Again...this is what makes the whole thing seem shady.  What are they talking about.  We don&#39;t need to know because it&#39;s way above us right?  These are the folks that are running the world from behind the scenes.  I&#39;d love to know their motives.  I&#39;m sure some of it is money but we all know money is nothing without power.  So really its a big power play...for what!?!?!?  World domination?  No thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not tested properly, their use is based on assumption; that they will do more good than harm, but we have no evidence that they do.  Vaccines have induced autoimmune diseases and allergies in millions.  Big Pharma profit greatly from these complications, that is why they refuse to test the vaccines properly, they make most of their money from the complications which vaccines cause e.g. Diabetes Type 1, Asthma, Alzheimer&#39;s etc</p>

<p>The Polio vaccine causes Polio, but they rename name it if it&#39;s from a vaccine so as it doesn&#39;t show up in statistics.  Small Pox was eradicated through quarantine, but Big Pharma try to rewrite history and tell you it was their dangerous vaccines which eradicated it; the Small Pox vaccine was one of the most dangerous vaccines of them all.</p>

<p>It recently turned out that the BCG vaccine wasn&#39;t working for all those years, now they have a new one which &#39;they say&#39; does work, but they said that about the first one too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in the 1940 and 1950s according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_poliomyelitis">WikiPedia</a> at least 500.000 were paralyzed or killed per year. Mostly during the summer months in cities. </p>

<p>If the vaccine did not affect the global polio numbers
Taking the world population at the time, comparing it to our present population and not taking any growth into account means that in 2010
136.978.658 would die or be paralyzed per year, in the summer months in big cities.  For 3 months that means about 1.5 million paralyzed or dead per day. </p>

<p>Some of those cases would be in Europe and the US, since we have pretty good sized cities. (Though not as dense as those available in China, India and other nations).</p>

<p>I dont see how we fail to notice that Epidemic X, or disease Y, or whatever it is called now, is causing such widespread paralysis and deaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a very small percentage of people who were left paralyzed, those were mainly in the third world, this was due to poor sanitation, malnutrition, the problem is that the Polio vaccine also leaves many paralyzed as we saw recently in India, it was also spreading Cancer-causing viruses according to Merck, which have now killed 100&#39;s of thousands.  In the first world if you are well nourished and living with high levels of sanitation, Polio is not a risk, most wouldn&#39;t even know they had it.</p>

<p>There would be no problem at all from Polio if we left Tonsils intact; this is where Polio antibodies are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They cause autoimmune diseases and allergies which are highly profitable to Big Pharma, they want you to have lifelong disease so as they can profit. </p>

<p>Diabetes Type 1, Asthma, MS, Lupus, Peanut Allergies, Epilepsy etc are all from vaccines.  Big Pharma aren&#39;t trying to help us, vaccines are how they increase the size of their market.</p>

<p>Well done for avoiding vaccines :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is mostly correct. He&#39;s a little light on the involvement of Zionist Jews, and something embraces crazy conspiracy theories, but most of what he said in the social and political veins is accurate.</p>

<p>The thing I like most about Jones is that he picks up on trends most others overlook. Right now he&#39;s going on about the media using the &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;white supremacist&quot; slurs to silence anyone who speaks out against liberal socialist policies. He&#39;s right on this. White people are called &quot;racist&quot; for wanting to own guns to protect their families, for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just flew from California to Denmark and then onto Poland yesterday for a total of 30 hours with layovers.  its very tiring and the worst part was the American side.  The baggage checking lady wouldn&#39;t check me until I proved that I had onward travel capabilities from the EU.  So I had to very quickly find a bus from Poland to Ukraine with my notebook and fortunately I&#39;m a quick researcher.  Then I had to race to have it printed.  This was stressful as shit.  Then of course the Danish passport control didn&#39;t ask for that and didn&#39;t even look at my passport stamps nor did they eye me up and down.  Well its obvious that my own country is trying to impede me.  Then of course I did the enhanced pat down instead of using that fucked machine.  Just go travel to see the difference.</p>
