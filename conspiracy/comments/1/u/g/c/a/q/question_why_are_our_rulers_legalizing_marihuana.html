    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://readyfortheshift.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/DenverAirportMuralsSlide09.jpg">And they even told us when it would start happening</a>. </p>

<p>Above picture is one of the Denver international airport murals from the 90&#39;s. It shows people of all cultures coming together around a glowing plant. </p>

<p>Some of the people (i.e. nations) closest to the colorful, psychedelic-looking plant look happy and almost euphoric. Their palms are turned upwards in a silent gesture, &quot;May I have some?&quot; </p>

<p>This otherwise mysterious mural appears to be foreshadowing the legalization of marijuana in the Americas (the child &#39;overseeing&#39; the plant looks South American, with the bright feathery head-dress <a href="http://8c4625.medialib.glogster.com/media/e72452a92025e620fc60fd52e201f90f2eceee14e3574850f69cd5edc3c6b252/mayan-headdress.jpg">reminiscent of the Mayans</a>).</p>

<p>Too symbolic; didn&#39;t understand? The mural linked above in the Denver airport back in the 90&#39;s was part of an Illuminati inside joke - announcing their plans in plain sight. Or plane sight? Hmm... Bad pun, sorry.  </p>

<p>More confirmation that this interpretation is correct is seen in other recent news and another mural painted at the same time as that one was. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.santafe.com/images/articles/wygwam/Denver-mural-1.jpg">See how this particular mural depicts the (now fulfilled) death of a world leader whose coffin was to be draped with the skin of a leapard</a>. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a hint, it depicts Nelson Mandela&#39;s death. </p>

<p>See here: <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/contributor/upload/5385/images/s(1).jpg">http://beforeitsnews.com/contributor/upload/5385/images/s(1).jpg</a> (and you can also read about how leopard skin being draped across the coffin is a traditional thing for Mandela&#39;s adoptive royal family - he was the adopted son of a Thembu king, and that&#39;s how they do things.)</p>

<p>Which happened a month before Colorado made headlines with their $1 million in legal marijuana sales. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a lot of death, fire, and shit fucking out in the Mandela funeral mural - the genocide coffins at the bottom, surrounded by extinct &amp; endangered animals and that unhealthy-looking whale swimming in crimson water. Check out the island-in-the-sky city bringing fire to the land and trees from the sea... Could that be Japan? </p>

<p>Spooked out, yet? Here&#39;s some more of this symbolic Masonic art you can look into: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone with a legal way of obtaining MJ will have a medical marijuana card. Creating a much bigger list of people that they can nix from gun ownership. Due to phycoactive chemicals it contains (canibinoids) deeming them a potential &quot;threat&quot;. This goes for other medications that alter the state of mind. If you don&#39;t think so I&#39;m willing to take bet on this. DEA and private prisons are far to lucrative for them to give up their bread and butter without ulterior motives. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Anyone with a legal way of obtaining MJ will have a medical marijuana card. Creating a much bigger list of people that they can nix from gun ownership</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is already the case in California with 215 card holders (patients with medical MJ prescriptions).  If one has a 215 in California and tries to purchase a firearm, they will be denied and have an &quot;official&quot; come to their house to check for firearms.  This has happened to two of my friends so far.  </p>

<p>The thing I don&#39;t get is that the law doesn&#39;t include people with scripts for psychological drugs (Zoloft, Adavan, etc.).  People on those types of medications are much more likely to have an adverse reaction to their meds than someone taking MJ.</p>

<p>So I think you have nailed it in your assessment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the book:The Marketing of Evil: How Radicals, Elitists, and Pseudo-Experts Sell Us Corruption Disguised As Freedom Hardcover, by David Kupelian </p>

<p>and you&#39;ll get a pretty good idea how this is happening but to break it down, it boils down to one concept not in the book....Satan&#39;s attempt to get YOU to disobey God!</p>

<p>Notice how in recent times  there has been an enormous movement toward practices focusing on spiritistism (blood sucking vampires, zombies, the undead etc), sexual immorality -homosexuality, drug use/specifically marijuana, idolatry (sports hero&#39;s, music hero&#39;s- american idol etc...) ????</p>

<p>Most pass these off as harmless fun but Jehovah God- the God of the Bible absolute condemns theses practices. Acts 15:29, 1Cor 6:9-10, Gal 5:19,20 yet they have recently and very subtly made a reentry into our society as commonplace and acceptable.</p>

<p>Do not be mislead!!! those who practice these things will not inherit God&#39;s Kingdom.</p>

<p>At Galatians 5:19 it states &quot;Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct, idolatry, <strong>spiritism</strong>, hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects, envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and things like these. I am forewarning you about these things, the same way I already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p>The Greek word for Spiritism/witchcraft is Pharmakeia. It&#39;s where our modern day word pharmacy comes from, also translated druggery. The thought expressed by this in the bible is that the use of mind altering drugs is a gateway into the practice of spiritism and witchcraft. Think about a scene whereby three witches are sitting around a bubbling  cauldron brewing up a spell.... It causes people to let go of their clear  thinking abilities and engage in things they would not normally do when not under the influence. How many times have you heard about somebody doing something that was totally out of character, and their excuse was &quot;I was high or drunk&quot;?....stoned people seldom keep to the pointings of a finely tuned moral compass. Proverbs 3:21, 16:25</p>

<p>This is a very real issue.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 18:10 &quot;There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, anyone practicing magic, anyone who looks for omens, a sorcerer, anyone binding others with a spell, anyone who consults a spirit medium or a fortune-teller, or anyone who inquires of the dead. For whoever does these things is detestable to Jehovah...&quot;</p>

<p>And lastly how your heart reacts to the Kingdom message as found in God&#39;s word as you&#39;ve read it here now from the bible, are a basis by which everyone is being “marked” either for preservation through the great tribulation or for destruction by God. (Ezekiel chpt 9, Matthew 24:21, Hebrews 4:12)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the reviews - </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I literally couldn&#39;t stop laughing, this book is just page after page of credulous nonsense, scaremongering and outright fabrication. Highlights include the way the author uses the very same techniques he &#39;exposes&#39; to convince you of his own half-baked ideas, the &#39;gratuitous&#39; use of &#39;quote marks&#39; throughout, and the way the entire book rests upon the premise that certain ways of life are evil with no real exploration of why other than &quot;because they are different to mine&quot;.</p>

<p>The section on Alfred Kinsey, I think, is my personal favourite, as it relies almost exclusively on Dr Judith Reisman&#39;s allegations against Kinsey of mass fraud and active involvement in paedophilia, despite these having been thrown out of court with prejudice (a fact the author could not fail to have known if he simply wikipedia&#39;d the people involved), as well as ascertaining that the reports opened up an era of sexual licentiousness, despite the whole point being the way they documented the double standard at the time between what people did in the bedroom and what was &#39;proper&#39;.</p>

<p>In the words of seemingly every other reviewer: a real eye opener :D </p>

But the skeptic in me wonders if marijuana legalization will turn into &quot;registering&quot; for recreational use similar to how the nazis made people register their guns before they took power. Once you have everyone registered, you can re-illegalize it and you know where to go to get the users. Once seen as an &quot;undesirable&quot; due to marijuana use, they can throw you in along with all the other undesirables (homeless, infirmed, CRIMINALS)...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t matter that it&#39;s for some high and mighty idea; the people who push the gay agenda do so to subvert the existing culture.</p>

<p>Even if someone can argue that it&#39;s done for good, it doesn&#39;t change the true intent.  The gay marriage laws are designed to weaken marriages.  And, marriage is the glue that holds together much of western civ.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that the civil rights movement had the same intent.  Blacks marry the same as whites, and that&#39;s what holds families together, and provides for a way for wealth to be maintained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you really explain how the subversion occurs? I&#39;ve never heard of any language in gay marriage laws mentioning hetero marriage at all. I really don&#39;t see the connection. I&#39;d believe you if you said divorce codes and family courts are culturally subversive; they do quite a bit of damage and are likely the leading cause of divorce in America. The statistics show women primarily instigate divorce and it&#39;s obvious that they get the better end of the deal, that&#39;s a subversion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that it even occurs.  There was a question, and I gave the correct answer.  What do I win?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are our rulers legalizing marihuana all of the sudden ???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is subversion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are our rulers legalizing gays all of the sudden ???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is subversion.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.  I have not given commentary on the morality of it.</p>

<p>Divorce being popularized in the media is subversive.  Its simple existence is not really subversion.  But, the media has turned it into something never used, unto what happens.</p>

<p>Gays will be around, and they are not the issue.  But, subversion of any bit of nationalism is the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>respect your opinion but I think its the exact opposite (and I dont smoke)</p>

<p>2 The corpovernment make$ a killing by jailing people, CIA &amp; friends are perhaps the biggest drug traffickers in the world, insane profits</p>

<p>3 I believe users tend to be more open minded and question more, both are dangerous factors for the establishment. Low paying jobs you mean? They are the worst plague in the USA, for stoners and non stoners. Legalization is irrelevant.</p>

<p>4 Pot to harder drugs is a myth. Alcohol may be closer to it since it kinda helps you take dumb decisions (scientifically proven I think?)</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Alcohol is worse, yes, but I think pot is in the mix. Esp. if you were raised that pot is horrible, and then you try it and find out it is not that bad, so maybe LSD is not so bad either, and it isn&#39;t, and then maybe H is not so bad either, and it is....</p></li>
