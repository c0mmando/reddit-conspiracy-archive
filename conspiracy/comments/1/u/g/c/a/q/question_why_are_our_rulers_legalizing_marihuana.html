        And they even told us when it would start happening
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Above picture is one of the Denver international airport murals from the 90's. It shows people of all cultures coming together around a glowing plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the people (i.e. nations) closest to the colorful, psychedelic-looking plant look happy and almost euphoric. Their palms are turned upwards in a silent gesture, "May I have some?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This otherwise mysterious mural appears to be foreshadowing the legalization of marijuana in the Americas (the child 'overseeing' the plant looks South American, with the bright feathery head-dress
       <a href="http://8c4625.medialib.glogster.com/media/e72452a92025e620fc60fd52e201f90f2eceee14e3574850f69cd5edc3c6b252/mayan-headdress.jpg">
        reminiscent of the Mayans

       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Too symbolic; didn't understand? The mural linked above in the Denver airport back in the 90's was part of an Illuminati inside joke - announcing their plans in plain sight. Or plane sight? Hmm... Bad pun, sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       More confirmation that this interpretation is correct is seen in other recent news and another mural painted at the same time as that one was.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.santafe.com/images/articles/wygwam/Denver-mural-1.jpg">
        See how this particular mural depicts the (now fulfilled) death of a world leader whose coffin was to be draped with the skin of a leapard
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you a hint, it depicts Nelson Mandela's death.
      </p>
      <p>
       See here:
       <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/contributor/upload/5385/images/s(1).jpg">
        http://beforeitsnews.com/contributor/upload/5385/images/s(1).jpg
       </a>
       (and you can also read about how leopard skin being draped across the coffin is a traditional thing for Mandela's adoptive royal family - he was the adopted son of a Thembu king, and that's how they do things.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Which happened a month before Colorado made headlines with their $1 million in legal marijuana sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a lot of death, fire, and shit fucking out in the Mandela funeral mural - the genocide coffins at the bottom, surrounded by extinct &amp; endangered animals and that unhealthy-looking whale swimming in crimson water. Check out the island-in-the-sky city bringing fire to the land and trees from the sea... Could that be Japan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Spooked out, yet? Here's some more of this symbolic Masonic art you can look into:

       In my opinion, it symbolically comes together as an announcement for "phase X" coming into play... So what comes next is whatever phase X is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't really guess from my research what comes next, but it seems to involve something big enough (possibly a Black Swan Event) to "prophesy" a decade ago.

       I wasn't swayed either way, but it seems like you're baiting him. If you have an argument against his position, either present the facts you mentioned or stop resorting to ad hominem. You're only giving him more plausibility.

       The prohibition is unsustainable. The Rulers are not making legal. The people are making it legal. There are more people living now, that have personal experience with marijuana,than ever before. Silly scare tactics don't work anymore. The medicinal benefits, which the U.S. government has known about for Idk........sixty plus years, its just starting to be understood by regular folk.

       Anyone with a legal way of obtaining MJ will have a medical marijuana card. Creating a much bigger list of people that they can nix from gun ownership. Due to phycoactive chemicals it contains (canibinoids) deeming them a potential "threat". This goes for other medications that alter the state of mind. If you don't think so I'm willing to take bet on this. DEA and private prisons are far to lucrative for them to give up their bread and butter without ulterior motives.

       This is already the case in California with 215 card holders (patients with medical MJ prescriptions).  If one has a 215 in California and tries to purchase a firearm, they will be denied and have an "official" come to their house to check for firearms.  This has happened to two of my friends so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing I don't get is that the law doesn't include people with scripts for psychological drugs (Zoloft, Adavan, etc.).  People on those types of medications are much more likely to have an adverse reaction to their meds than someone taking MJ.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think you have nailed it in your assessment.

       I completely agree. With the advent of GMO weed, people are going to be causing themselves more damage by smoking which will benefit the medical industry and fit in with the elites plans to weaken the populous. Why else would GMO week have been developed if they weren't going to let people have access to it?

       Marijuana plants have been selectively inbred for higher THC levels and, less often, higher CBD and CBN levels. The breeding has been done by marijuana enthusiasts in America, Holland, and all over the world. Current strains are the products of this cottage industry and are not the product of MNCs.

       It is so they can have an easy to rule population. They will get all this done and then the federal government will step in and make states enforce federal laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you notice all these so called steps toward are not really working cause they laws are still enforced federally.  Yeah local cops won't do shit. The fbi, dea, as well as a few other three letter agencies will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah some local authorities say we won't let them do shit here in this state. Guess what money makes the world go around and when the federal funds get cut for roads and schools as well as their kickbacks they will buckle.

       None of the above. Money! they are evidently not making enough off of the drug busts and property confiscation and the prisons are full. It's also a good way to track and control through medical prescriptions. Colorado is a danger because it's legalized. People can grow it in their yards. Let's watch and see what happens to those people that don't pay the tax.

       that being said, I see the legalization of medicinal and recreational marijuana being one aspect of the majority taking back control while the minority's agenda continues to crumble and fail.

       Read the book:The Marketing of Evil: How Radicals, Elitists, and Pseudo-Experts Sell Us Corruption Disguised As Freedom Hardcover, by David Kupelian
      </p>
      <p>
       and you'll get a pretty good idea how this is happening but to break it down, it boils down to one concept not in the book....Satan's attempt to get YOU to disobey God!
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how in recent times  there has been an enormous movement toward practices focusing on spiritistism (blood sucking vampires, zombies, the undead etc), sexual immorality -homosexuality, drug use/specifically marijuana, idolatry (sports hero's, music hero's- american idol etc...) ????
      </p>
      <p>
       Most pass these off as harmless fun but Jehovah God- the God of the Bible absolute condemns theses practices. Acts 15:29, 1Cor 6:9-10, Gal 5:19,20 yet they have recently and very subtly made a reentry into our society as commonplace and acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not be mislead!!! those who practice these things will not inherit God's Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       At Galatians 5:19 it states "Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct, idolatry,
       <strong>
        spiritism
       </strong>
       , hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects, envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and things like these. I am forewarning you about these things, the same way I already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Greek word for Spiritism/witchcraft is Pharmakeia. It's where our modern day word pharmacy comes from, also translated druggery. The thought expressed by this in the bible is that the use of mind altering drugs is a gateway into the practice of spiritism and witchcraft. Think about a scene whereby three witches are sitting around a bubbling  cauldron brewing up a spell.... It causes people to let go of their clear  thinking abilities and engage in things they would not normally do when not under the influence. How many times have you heard about somebody doing something that was totally out of character, and their excuse was "I was high or drunk"?....stoned people seldom keep to the pointings of a finely tuned moral compass. Proverbs 3:21, 16:25
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a very real issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deuteronomy 18:10 "There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, anyone practicing magic, anyone who looks for omens, a sorcerer, anyone binding others with a spell, anyone who consults a spirit medium or a fortune-teller, or anyone who inquires of the dead. For whoever does these things is detestable to Jehovah..."
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly how your heart reacts to the Kingdom message as found in God's word as you've read it here now from the bible, are a basis by which everyone is being “marked” either for preservation through the great tribulation or for destruction by God. (Ezekiel chpt 9, Matthew 24:21, Hebrews 4:12)

       From the reviews -
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I literally couldn't stop laughing, this book is just page after page of credulous nonsense, scaremongering and outright fabrication. Highlights include the way the author uses the very same techniques he 'exposes' to convince you of his own half-baked ideas, the 'gratuitous' use of 'quote marks' throughout, and the way the entire book rests upon the premise that certain ways of life are evil with no real exploration of why other than "because they are different to mine".
       </p>
       <p>
        The section on Alfred Kinsey, I think, is my personal favourite, as it relies almost exclusively on Dr Judith Reisman's allegations against Kinsey of mass fraud and active involvement in paedophilia, despite these having been thrown out of court with prejudice (a fact the author could not fail to have known if he simply wikipedia'd the people involved), as well as ascertaining that the reports opened up an era of sexual licentiousness, despite the whole point being the way they documented the double standard at the time between what people did in the bedroom and what was 'proper'.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the words of seemingly every other reviewer: a real eye opener :D

       The correct understanding of John 3:16 is not just "believing" (as faith without works is dead- James 2:26) but faith with action...and is also in perfect harmony with the quoted scriptures. Jesus said that those who
       <strong>
        remain in his word
       </strong>
       would be his true disciples. John 8:31
      </p>

       it's not a matter of one scripture "trumping" another  it's a matter of faith in action....“Exert yourselves vigorously [

       It did everything!!!....it cleansed you from you sins, but now you must remain clean, and that's where the faith in action comes in, you need to be obedient. (1Cor 6:9-11) ...

       The hippy side of me wants to celebrate the movements success thus far. But the skeptic in me wonders if marijuana legalization will turn into "registering" for recreational use similar to how the nazis made people register their guns before they took power. Once you have everyone registered, you can re-illegalize it and you know where to go to get the users. Once seen as an "undesirable" due to marijuana use, they can throw you in along with all the other undesirables (homeless, infirmed, CRIMINALS)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, thats just the skeptic side of me.

       It is actually very easy to explain. Morality has nothing to do with conspiracy members. There are a lot of low level people who belong to the conspiracy. These low level people do like doing drugs a lot. This is happening simply because the low level dudes asked their bosses to make it legal, in order to smoke it in a relaxed way. The bosses have nothing against legalizing drugs, because it is still about money.

       It's not like gay people are picking straight people up off the street and forcing them into gay marriages. I'd say some of the resistance tactics against gay people are far more of a subversion of basic human empathy.

       The term "subversion" has negative  connotations, and frankly, expanding the rights of a people is far more positive than restricting them. Would you say giving blacks rights and freedoms a subversion of the past culture?

       Doesn't matter that it's for some high and mighty idea; the people who push the gay agenda do so to subvert the existing culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if someone can argue that it's done for good, it doesn't change the true intent.  The gay marriage laws are designed to weaken marriages.  And, marriage is the glue that holds together much of western civ.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that the civil rights movement had the same intent.  Blacks marry the same as whites, and that's what holds families together, and provides for a way for wealth to be maintained.

       Can you really explain how the subversion occurs? I've never heard of any language in gay marriage laws mentioning hetero marriage at all. I really don't see the connection. I'd believe you if you said divorce codes and family courts are culturally subversive; they do quite a bit of damage and are likely the leading cause of divorce in America. The statistics show women primarily instigate divorce and it's obvious that they get the better end of the deal, that's a subversion.

       Divorce being popularized in the media is subversive.  Its simple existence is not really subversion.  But, the media has turned it into something never used, unto what happens.

       Gays will be around, and they are not the issue.  But, subversion of any bit of nationalism is the issue.

       3 I believe users tend to be more open minded and question more, both are dangerous factors for the establishment. Low paying jobs you mean? They are the worst plague in the USA, for stoners and non stoners. Legalization is irrelevant.

         Alcohol is worse, yes, but I think pot is in the mix. Esp. if you were raised that pot is horrible, and then you try it and find out it is not that bad, so maybe LSD is not so bad either, and it isn't, and then maybe H is not so bad either, and it is....

       That is your experience and it is the most real thing to you. However, there may well be a great deal of individual variation in the reaction to the drugs due to differences in the body, upbringing, present situation etc.

       indeed many factors come to play and varies between individuals but to say that herb Will take you to dumb drugs every time  does not make sense.  Many junkies start with herb, many junkies start with alcohol, etc etc

       I did not say "every time", or at least, I hope I didn't. It does not sound like something I would say. What I meant to say was that it happens.

       I think alcohol is the big gateway. Most people drink beer before they get stoned/weed in my guess.

       Marijuana plants have been selectively inbred for higher THC levels and, less often, higher CBD and CBN levels. The breeding has been done by marijuana enthusiasts in America, Holland, and all over the world. Current strains are the products of this cottage industry and are not the product of MNCs.
