       The following is mostly taken from "A Little Book of Coincidence in the Solar System" by John Martineau.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've attempted to summarize some of the coincidences described in this book. While doing so I came across even more coincidences to add to this burgeoning list.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There may be fundamental relationships between space, time and life which have not yet been understood.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is it all just a coincidence, or do the patterns perhaps explain the scientists?

      <h2>
       The Seven
      </h2>
      <p>
       There are seven clearly visible moving heavenly bodies and
       <a href="http://infinity-codes.net/raah/_archive%28infinity-codes%29/earth-codes/heptagon-of-7-days.jpg">
        they may be arranged around a heptagon in order of their apparent speed against the fixed stars
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Moon appears to move the fastest, then Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each heavenly body was assigned to a day of the week.
       <a href="http://www.schoolofwisdom.com/ChanceandChoice/7days.jpg">
        Starting with the Moon
       </a>
       , the order of the days of the week can be derived by first following the path towards Mars:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Moon (Monday), Mars (Tuesday), Mercury (Wednesday),  Jupiter (Thursday), Venus (Friday), Saturn (Saturday), the Sun (Sunday).
      </p>
      <p>
       In English, the names for several of the days of the week come from Norse mythology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tuesday is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BDr">
        Tīw's day
       </a>
       . Tīw is equated with Mars (Martedì, Mardi).

       Wednesday is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%8Dden">
        Wodan's day
       </a>
       . Wodan is related to the Germanic god known as Mercury by Roman writers (Mercoledì, Mercredi).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thursday is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor">
        Thor's day
       </a>
       . Thor is associated with Jupiter, also known as Jove (Giovedì, Jeudi).
      </p>
      <p>
       Friday (venerdì, vendredi) is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyja">
        Freyja's
       </a>
       or
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigg">
        Frigg's day
       </a>
       . The Norse name for the planet Venus is Friggjarstjarna (Frigg's star).
      </p>
      <p>
       In antiquity the seven planets corresponded with the seven known metals,
       <a href="http://htmlimg1.scribdassets.com/4hlxb9tu2o387zxm/images/11-82681b5002.jpg">
        their compounds giving rise to color associations
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This ancient system
       <a href="http://homepages.ihug.com.au/%7Epanopus/metalplanet/metalplanet.jpg">
        predicts the modern order by atomic number of the metals
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom image gives the order of elements with increasing atomic weights, starting with iron:
      </p>
      <p>
       Iron – 26 (Mars)
      </p>
      <p>
       Copper – 29 (Venus)
      </p>
      <p>
       Silver – 49 (Moon)
      </p>
      <p>
       Tin – 50 (Jupiter)
      </p>
      <p>
       Gold – 79 (Sun)
      </p>
      <p>
       Mercury – 80 (Mercury)
      </p>
      <p>
       Lead – 82 (Saturn)

       The electrical conductivity sequence

        also appears round the outside starting with lead
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The orbital motion of the planet correlates in sequence with its corresponding metal's conductivity. The slower a planet moves, the less able its corresponding metal is to conduct electricity!

      <h2>
       Ratios, Rhythms and the Golden Section
      </h2>
      <p>
       In the 17th century
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler">
        Johannes Kepler
       </a>
       set about to calculate the Harmony of the Spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
       He noticed that ratios between the extreme angular velocities of the planets were all harmonic intervals. He wrote a book called
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis">
        Musica Universalis
       </a>
       that shows the relationship between geometry, cosmology, and harmonics.
      </p>
      <p>
       A century after Kepler's death, the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode%27s_law">
        Titius–Bode law or Bode's Law
       </a>
       hypothesized that the bodies in some orbital systems, including the sun's, orbit in a function of planetary sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, many more patterns have been discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The periods of the planets sometimes occur as simple ratios of each other. For example,
       <a href="http://planetfacts.org/orbit-and-rotation-of-jupiter/">
        Jupiter and Saturn have a 2:5 ratio
       </a>
       , with an accuracy of 99.3%.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes Jupiter 11.86 Earth years to orbit around the Sun, and Saturn 29.5 years, forming the 2:5 ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are especially rhythmic and harmonic, displaying a 1:2:3 ratio of periods with an accuracy of 99.8%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neptune completes its orbit approximately every 164 Earth years, and Uranus every 84 years. Add them together to get Pluto's 248 year orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance">
        Another example
       </a>
       is the 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europa and Io.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our two planetary neighbors resonate a 3:4 rhythm, a deep musical fourth. Earth kisses Mars three times
       <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/14820/when-will-mars-be-close-to-earth/">
        every 780 days
       </a>
       for every four Venus kisses,
       <a href="http://www.lunarplanner.com/HCpages/Venus.html">
        every 584 days
       </a>
       , with a 99.8% accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth and Mercury kiss
       <a href="http://htmlimg2.scribdassets.com/4hlxb9tu2o387zxm/images/16-bbacbfd703.jpg">
        22 times in 7 years, and Mercury and Venus are beautifully in tune after 14 kisses
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The first planet is remarkable, for
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28planet%29">
        one Mercury day is exactly two years, during which time the planet has revolved on its own axis exactly three times
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And now we meet the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi">
        Golden Section (Φ or phi)
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The golden section often appears as 0.618, 1.618, or 2.618, and is found throughout plant and animal life.
      </p>
      <p>
       A pentagram, embodying the Golden Section proportion,
       <a href="http://www.astrozero.co.uk/astronomy/earth_and_mercury.html">
        both spaces Earth and Mercury's mean orbits and sizes their relative physical bodies with 99% accuracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Another instance of a two planet relationship like this also involves Earth.
       <a href="http://davidpratt.info/physics/pattern25.jpg">
        Earth and Saturn's orbits and sizes are related by a fifteen-pointed star
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For the next coincidence take three circles and put them together so that they all touch. The orbits of the first two planets are hiding in this simple design.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Mercury's mean orbit passes through the centers of the three circles
       <a href="http://urbanspaceman.net/shared/jm_coincidenceSolarSystem/MercuryVenusOrbits.gif">
        then Venus' encloses the figure.
       </a>
       (99.9% accuracy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Venus, our closest neighbor, kisses us every 584 days. Each time one of these kisses occurs the Sun, Venus and the Earth line up two-fifths of a circle further around, so a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Venus_pentagram.png">
        pentagram of conjunctions is drawn
       </a>
       , taking exactly 8 years, or 13 Venusian years (99.9%).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">
        Fibonacci numbers
       </a>
       : 5, 8, 13. The periods of Venus and Earth (583.92/365.25) are also closely related as 1/Φ (99.6%).
      </p>
      <p>
       The harmony of Earth and Venus draws a beautiful pattern.

        Here's the sun-centered version of this five-petalled flower
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you think this is all pure lunacy, then you're in luck, for we've arrived at the moon herself.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Luna
      </h2>
      <p>
       Have you ever wondered why the Moon appears to fit precisely over the Sun during an eclipse?
       <a href="http://earthsky.org/space/coincidence-that-sun-and-moon-seem-same-size">
        The Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun, yet it's also 1/400th of the distance between the Earth and the Sun
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaac Asimov described this as being 'the most unlikely coincidence imaginable'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sizes of the Moon and Earth also relate as 3 to 11 (99.9%).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sum of the radii of both the Earth and Moon (in miles) is 3960 + 1080 = 5040. This means that
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5040_%28number%29">
        the sum of their diameters is also the number of minutes in a week (7 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes = 10,080).
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The ratio of the radius of the moon and the radius of the earth is 1080/3960, which simplifies to 3/11. This ratio can also be expressed as (4 - π)/π, when using 22/7 as the value of π. The sizes of the earth and the moon are related by a simple function of π.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sum of their radii in miles is 5040, which when divided by 14 is 360 (the number of degrees in a circle). This would not happen for another pair of objects with radii in the same ratio—it only happens when the sum of their radii is 5040.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you draw down the Moon to the Earth,
       <a href="http://urbanspaceman.net/shared/jm_coincidenceSolarSystem/earth-moon-wedding-2.gif">
        then a circle through the center of the Moon will have a circumference equal to the perimeter of an earthly square enclosing the Earth
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The sizes of the Moon and the Earth “square” the circle. The ancients seem to have known about this, and hidden it in the definition of the mile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Radius of the Moon = 1080 miles = 3 x 360
      </p>
      <p>
       Radius of the Earth = 3960 miles = 11 x 360
      </p>
      <p>
       Radius of Earth + Radius of Moon = 5040 miles = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 = 7 x 8 x 9 x 10
      </p>
      <p>
       Diameter of Earth = 7930 miles = 8 x 9 x 10 x 11
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 5280 feet in a mile = (10 x 11 x 12 x 13) – (9 x 10 x 11 x 12)
      </p>
      <p>
       The 3:11 ratio is also invoked by Venus and Mars,
       <a href="http://ensign.editme.com/t43dances">
        as the closest:farthest distance ratio that each experiences of the other is 3:11
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       3/11 rounds to 27.3%, and 27.3 is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon">
        the number of days it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth
       </a>
       , and 27.3 days is
       <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1935PASP...47..180S">
        the average rotation period of a sunspot
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There are an average of
       <a href="http://moonphases.info/for-how-long-does-a-full-moon-last.html">
        12.37 full moons in a year
       </a>
       . This number can be derived using two simple mathematical techniques:
      </p>
      <p>
       First, draw a circle, diameter 13, with a pentagram inside. Its arms will measure 12.364, almost the right number.
      </p>

       , orbit around Jupiter at exactly 60° ahead and 60° behind the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the orbit of Jupiter and the pair of Trojan asteroid clusters, you can produce Earth's mean orbit

       Interestingly enough, 8,600 / 1.618 gives the number of feet in a mile to 99.3% accuracy (my own observation...I was unable to find a more accurate number than 8,600, so the relation between Saturn's hexagon, the golden section and the mile may be more or less accurate than 99.3%).

       Here are some more coincidences that wouldn't fit in the main post:
      </p>
      <p>
       The ratio between Earth's outermost orbit and Venus' innermost orbit
       <a href="http://htmlimg4.scribdassets.com/4hlxb9tu2o387zxm/images/20-c04c86ff63.jpg">
        is intriguingly given by a simple square
       </a>
       (99.9%).
      </p>
      <p>
       Venus rotates extremely slowly,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus#Orbit_and_rotation">
        and is the only planet that rotates in a “clockwise” direction
       </a>
       . The rotation period of Venus, 243 Earth days, is two-thirds of an Earth year (99.8%).
      </p>
      <p>
       Venus orbits the Sun approximately every
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus">
        225 Earth days
       </a>
       (224.7). A cute trick to remember this lies in the word Venus itself:
      </p>
      <p>
       V is the 22nd letter, E is the 5th, and NUS is SUN backwards. Thus, it takes Venus 225 days to revolve around the Sun.

       shows further harmonic patterns: two from the orbits of Jupiter's moons, two from Saturn's moons, and two from the outer planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although tiny inaccuracies are visible, an easy way to visualize the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus is to

        three times during five Jupiter years and two Saturn years
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       From Earth, this pattern is seen as both a triangle of conjunctions, 20 years apart, and as another opposing triangle of oppositions,

       When I was a kid, there was a guy in the class who'd have this magic trick with numbers. "Choose a number, divide by .. , add ..., etc." and the answer would be a constant. He'd never do that trick more than once, and if he played the trick to multiple kids, they had to agree on one number to not make it obvious that the answer was independent of their choice. So the day he tried the trick on me, he said "pick a number", i said "ok, let's say n". He knew he was fucked.

       This is the apparent root of everything.  From the micro to the macro, and everything in between.  There are apparent groups that seek to pervert this and keep it hidden from the masses.  Our music has been perverted.  Kept just off the mystocal tune.  They appear to want to keep this to themselves.
      </p>

       The meaning is much greater than shapes, tones, and mathematics.  Though they are all part of it.  When looking to the planets, celestial bodies, and even the universe as a whole, this seems to indicate one of two things.  We are perceiving and applying a secret underlying truth of everything that exists, or the entire universe is a construct, built for us.  Very intriguing.

       That's where so many of these otherwise pretty and lovely sounding neo-mystic ideas run afoul of my senses. They erroneously imply that humanity is special in the universe beyond having been simply lucky enough to avoid catastrophic destruction long enough to evolve. This place is far too big for that.

       I don't see the point you're trying to make. The sum of the interior degrees of any polygon with n sides will be
       <a href="http://www.qc.edu.hk/math/Junior%20Secondary/interior%20angle.htm">
        (n-2) × 180°
       </a>
       . 180 is divisible by 9, so any integer multiple of it will be divisible by 9 too.
       <a href="http://www.pseudorandom.co.uk/2002/maths/divby9/">
        Any number divisible by 9

       Because we picked a number that was divisible by a lot of other numbers. 360 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, and 180. This makes it very simple and convenient to do mental math with it without being as restricted to something like, say, 100, where we'd be restricted to 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50.

       That's a valid point and I used to think exactly that. 360 has a lot of divisors and it's roughly the same number of days in a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes sense, but is that all there is to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       d8_thc is referring to gematria, "casting out nines" and it's kindof a religious thing that goes way back. They do it with Hebrew text, for instance, I've heard the mathematical value of mother and father added together equals the value for child when you do this casting out nines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway i find it reasonable to believe that the ancient people who set our numerical systems up noticed that all the angles in any polygon adds up to 9 when using 360 and base 10. Perhaps they thought it was interesting. Maybe they also thought it was interesting that when you divide 360 by 2 any number of times, the digits add up to 9 still. For example: 360/2
       <sup>
        6
       </sup>
       = 5.625 -&gt;18 -&gt;9 
same with 4
same with 5
same with 8
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not 3, 6, or 7? well 3 and 6 make sense but division by 7 is an interesting topic I suggest you look into if you find any of this interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other numbers have a lot of factors?
12 and 60 do, and we use them too for a lot of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they just liked them because it's easy to calculate that 8 hours is 1/3rd of a day and so on. But it's quite a coincidence that the number of seconds in a day is almost exactly equal to one tenth the diameter of the sun in miles as stated by modern astronomy. 86,400 seconds; 864,938 miles. 99.9% accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many astounding coincidences like that. In our solar system, in the length of a foot or a meter, in the size, shape, and location of the pyramids. So many that it makes me think there is more to it than the most simple explanation possible.

       Because 360 is a highly composite number. It has a large number (24) of integer divisors, which make it ideal for engineering (radians are often used elsewhere, since irrational numbers are no problem in analysis, but hard to build to since pi is irrational).

       I don't think you should completely discount the possibility that 360 was chosen (in the mists of human history) as the number of degrees in circle, to reflect the Earth's annual orbit around the sun. 1 degree equates quite closely to the distance travelled in 1 day (24 hrs) of solar orbit .

       I love this stuff. What about time measurement? Is it all arbitrary?
There are 86,400 seconds in a day.
There are 1,440 minutes in a day, 525,600 minutes in a year.
The earth has a wobble to it. The time is takes to complete 1 cycle of this wobble is 25,920 years. This is called the precession of the equinoxes and is where our zodiac comes from, because this precession is subdivided into 12 "ages" according to which constellation the earth is pointing to as it slowly completes its wobble. Each age lasts 2,160 years. Now what are the digital roots of all the numbers in the last paragraph?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where it gets really weird. The diameter of the sun is 864,000 miles (432,000 mile radius). The diameter of the moon is 2,160 miles. Would it surprise you to know that all the sacred ancient texts our modern religions are founded on are actually astrological allegories and are chalk full of these "sacred" numbers? In Sumerian religion the ancient kings of the world ruled for 432,000 years before the flood. In the old testament the ancient kings ruled for 86,400 weeks before the flood. The ancient Hindu ages last 432,000 years. In the book of Exodus, it is said that God's true name is 216 letters long. Moses came down Mt. Sinai and ushered in the age of Aries, 2,160 years later Jesus ushered in the age of Pisces (this is where the Jesus-fish comes from). And the biggest bombs of them all? The height of the Great Pyramid of Giza (metres) x 43,200 = The exact polar radius of the Earth. The perimeter of the Great Pyramid of Giza x 43,200 = the exact circumference of the Earth. 432²= the speed of light in miles/second.  And of course there is 432 hz music.

       I believe before the time of written history there were people with intimate knowledge of the sacred fractal geometric creationary principles of the universe, along with PI and Phi.  They encoded it everywhere in megalithic structures and a lot of it is hidden in religious texts.  It's spectacular how these numbers and patterns appear everywhere and are intimately linked to how we tell time.  It's stuff like this along with some intriguing paradoxes in physics

       The sun's mean diameter is 1,392,684 km. If you want to convert that into a unit of measurement that is outdated and less than 5% of the world uses, you get 865,374 miles.

       I watched the first part of the video and I need to put forth this thought before it gets away from me. 
The video asserts that the base 60 math that the ancient Babylonians decided on derived from a mathematical sequence using fingers and knuckles to multiply to 60. This base 60 is the reason why we have 360 degrees in a circle, and the basis for the harmonic work that the video goes on to do. 
My thought is this. How are we supposed to create a universal harmonic language that is based on maths that are completely homocentric? How would an alien know that there are supposed to be 360 degrees in a circle? The geometry resulting from a different phenotype would be completely alien to us, rendering our efforts and communication through geometric harmonics completely useless.

       I'd like to go on record saying this is misguided analysis. Many of these examples are really contrived ways of fitting geometrical shapes. There's so much arbitrary meanings with the selection of the seven planets, the seven known metals, the atomic weights, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, this is too geocentric of a way of viewing patterns in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a pattern to how solar systems form and their attributes like number of planets, sizes of planets, locations of planets and their conditions for life, you should be comparing star system to star system, not looking from earth's perspective. And I'm pretty sure the people doing that research aren't drawing heptagrams. They're making models of how gravity collects a space cloud and condenses it into a self-sustaining chemical fire with a disk of dust and ice spinning around it.

       Very nice post. On a related issue, I am guessing you have seen the excellent documentary called the Revelation of the Pyramids? If you haven't, do, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an interesting suggestion within it that the metric system, which we think of as an 18th century Napoleonic invention, may have much more ancient origins. The Great Pyramid of Giza seems to have encoded messages (relating to phi and the speed of light etc) if you use metres to measure it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A metre is of course 1/10,000,000th of the distance from the equator to the poles, and the suggestion is that  ancient civilizations may somehow have had the technology to make that measurement.
      </p>

       Edit: fat finger.

       Yes! I love that film, and I've even done an in depth analysis of the mathematics presented. It's quite a doozy.

       And the fact that the mile is so related to the size of the Moon and the Earth does indeed indicate that the ancients certainly knew quite a bit about the Earth and much more!

       False. A quarter of the circumference of the earth is between 10,002,000 and 10,018,750 m, depending on if you measure longitudinally or latitudinally. Your ratio is off by a factor of 1,000 and is also an approximation.

       This is wonderful! I've actually been looking into the history of the names for the days of the weeks recently, and something to add on to your initial point is that this is one of the few consistencies between Greco-Roman, Germanic, Indian, and East Asian traditions. Not only is this Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Sun pattern found in English, but in many if not most major languages on earth.

       Starting with the very first diagram...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Moon appears to move the fastest, then Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These speeds change due to the orbital layout of the solar system, a phenomena known as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion">
        apparent retrograde motion
       </a>
       , a problem geocentrists tried to solve, in vain, with the introduction of epicycles.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the order provided is true on some nights, false on others, and hardly the sort of thing you'd want to build an entire theoretical framework on.

       The part about the days of the week is just a tiny portion of this post, and certainly no theoretical frameworks are being built upon it!
      </p>
      <p>
       The diagram of the speeds of the planets is their
       <em>
        apparent
       </em>
       motion against the fixed stars, that's where you seem mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what the ancients observed. In antiquity, this was the accepted order of the speed of the planets, and, incredibly, this order (when deciphered correctly) also predicts the modern atomic weights for the planets and their associated metals, as well as the electrical conductivity of the metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what's amazing about this planetary order.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that explains things better.

      <p>
       Except the apparent motion against the fixed stars changes as a planet switches from retrograde to prograde motion. As that switch happens, the planets apparent motion against the stars goes to almost 0. So even if Mars is sometimes faster than Jupiter, when it switches from prograde to retrograde, it's definitely slower. And being that all the planets switch from prograde to retrograde motion at different intervals, you have to actually look and see (or calculate through n-body codes) which objects apparent motion is fastest at any given time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So regardless of what these nebulous ancients accepted, the stated order is correct only at certain points in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they don't predict anything, this is the Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

       While I appreciate your attempt to rationally discuss some of this information, you do realize that the order of the days point is just a
       <em>
        tiny
       </em>
       portion of this entire post.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the number of seconds in a week relating to the diameters of the Sun and the Moon? Or how their radii relate to the number 360?
      </p>
      <p>
       These "nebulous ancients" had the ability to accurately measure the sizes of the Moon and Earth, and then they used these measurements to define time and distance, measurements which have survived to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the days of the week and the planets, this is about
       <em>
        what you usually see when you look at the stars
       </em>
       . The planets usually appear to move in a certain order of speed. The ancients documented this and ordered the days of the week accordingly. You really are reading too much into that point. No one is suggesting that they discovered the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       speeds of the planets, just their

       I've noticed a few responses pointing out that "as above, so below". Indeed it is and anyone studying alchemy could make good use of this book and others like it. Especially, perhaps, the atomic order of metals and their correspondences.

I would have been able to connect the pythagorean 345 triangle to the dimensions of the earth and moon instead of just memorizing it for a test because "it's important."

       So, the alignment of Venus (the morning star a.k.a. Lucifer) with Earth over 8 years happens to take the form of an inverted Pentagram pointed in our direction.

       I suppose I'm the only one who sees the irony in that coincidence?

       Hey, I apologize for accidentally restating your question. I honestly did not read that far down. Thank you for your work in submitting this. This is something I'm very fascinated with, however I lack the arithmetic knowledge to back up anything lol.

       There is no need for knowledge of arithmetics, that's just another way to look at it. Look at the plants and animals, they all have planetary qualities. The trick is to find balance within yourself, there are many ways to do this.

       I have a question for anyone with more knowledge on this than myself. First, however, thank you for putting this all together. I absolutely love this stuff and I'm going to pick up Martineu's book tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone provide any substance to a correlation between the above, the 432/9 theories, and the Fibonacci numbers? I feel like any info I come across is either focused on one or the other. Thanks again for the good read. You should post this in

       It talks about 432, 9 and how 9 fits into the Fibonacci sequence. It's a mind blower! Get the Quadrivium, it has this book as well as 4 others and is cheap. Also John Michell has some great books that touch on a lot of this.

       Sadly, it's just numbers. It's the equivalent of having an alphabet and then saying "Oh look! Everything has a word that can be expressed using our alphabet!" Well, duh.
