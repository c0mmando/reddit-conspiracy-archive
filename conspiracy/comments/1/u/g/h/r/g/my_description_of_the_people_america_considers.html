<p>No matter big the fool, every fool has a single bit of knowledge that is worth absorbing.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 23 with my Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Finance and Accounting. I graduated with honors from a US university. I base my claims on the vast pool of knowledge that I absorbed and ultimately realized was pretty much a book on manipulation of people and consumers. It only takes awhile to connect the dots, but ultimately you realize that the classes are essentially teaching you how to sell products. </p>

<p>And, you eventually realize that there are people with enough knowledge in these areas to strategically deceive the masses. I&#39;m not questioning whether they exist, I know they exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;ve based you views on a book designed to exploit the most gullible aspects of the most gullible people in America, and from that you&#39;ve extrapolated generalizations about what sanity means.  Got it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way to manage people that act in roles other than what we call the followers? The most gullible people are just the easiest ones to manipulate. Check out McGregor&#39;s X&amp;Y theory and situational management principles. </p>

<p>I assure you, there are many sorts of management theories for controlling other types of people. Studies have been done to show how certain &quot;types&quot; of people are most easily motivated. Despite everyone thinking they&#39;re a unique butterfly, most theories clump people in less than 5-10 groups - and they generally work well with statistic proof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what?  Are you trying to say that managers are bad people, because they understand those they work with?  I would rather work under a good, intelligent manager who knows how to motivate me than an idiot who doesn&#39;t.  And likewise, as a manager, I would do anything to have insight into how to effectively motivate those who I am responsible for.  Of course, I tend to only work with very talented people who need very little motivation, and just communicating directly with them is sufficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;m saying that these management theories <del>could</del> are ultimately being used on a larger level by truly evil people to manipulate things in their favor. Not all are evil, but it only takes a few bad apples high up to truly do a fuckload of damage. And, I&#39;m not saying illuminati or anything, I&#39;m saying there is solid proof that it&#39;s being used in institutions we know exist. It&#39;s definitely being used to win elections. </p>

<p>These people have a fuckload of money, are the best at doing it, and are the best at what they do. They employ the best. I think I wrote out a more thorough answer as to the &quot;how and why&quot; here: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that is certainly true.  They will always be evil people who try to manipulate things in their favor - it&#39;s unfortunately a result of being human.  The challenge, as always, is to find ways to keep them in check so they don&#39;t destroy us all.  It&#39;s a classic good-vs-evil fight.  But even psychopaths can be constrained to be productive and contributing members of society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll for sure have to read it later! It always creeps me out to think that eventually someone will discover some kind of crazy virus/bacteria or something stronger than the nuclear bomb and possibly be able to destroy the world. It&#39;s actually already happened - If you look at the shit the Soviets did with the plague, you&#39;d probably shit yourself. I think it was a Frontline documentary from the early 00&#39;s or 90&#39;s, but the journalists went to a Soviet lab and it was just sitting in a fridge with two padlocks on it. No military protection. </p>

<p>If you have the system we have in place now and are armed with a decent amount of plague, you could easily threaten to and take control of governments without people having a fucking clue. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t tell me that some pissed off billionaire/oil tycoon doesn&#39;t have some fucked up contingency plan in the back of his mind to potentially secure a bio-weapon if his wealth is in danger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am merely filtering through vast pools of information to try and comprehend the mechanics of the environment I have been placed in. I used to fit the perfect model of the 9-5 guy, but eventually realized that it was nothing more than a structured system that limits my possibilities. What possibilities? The pursuit of my own end and fulfillment of my own desires while maintaining true to myself. </p>

<p>I ultimately realized that I get little pleasure from consumption, as in this day and age there is enough freely available information to entertain one&#39;s mind for decades. I realized that the pursuit of goods has a large tradeoff and it doesn&#39;t really matter if you have KitchenAids 2013 model blender vs. a functional one from the 1990s. Most of the crap you buy offers a small amount of convenience in exchange for hours of work and discomfort. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll present you an excellent example. Let&#39;s say I want a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=kitchen+aid+pasta">pasta-making attachment</a> for my kitchenaid blender. I plan on using it once a year. The attachment costs ~100-150 bucks. If I make pasta normally, it takes 30 minutes. Using the attachment, I can make the same amount in 15 minutes. My labor is valued at approximately $10/hr. Each time I use the attachment, I essentially save $2.50 worth labor in hours. In order to break even on a $100-150 purchase, I need to make pasta 40 times. It will literally take 3 years for that investment to pay off. More than likely, I use the attachment 3-4 times per year. At that rate, it takes almost 10 years to pay off. By then, I probably have a new blender. At the end of the day, I&#39;d have been further off to work less hours away from the house, spent the extra time with my SO making the pasta, and have had been with people who actually value my time. </p>

<p>After going frugal for 3-4 years, I have realized that there is nothing I really want or need to buy. I actually don&#39;t really know of anything to buy. A red pizza pan is no different than my 10 year old hand-me-down old one. Aesthetics have little value to me. I do like having new things, but when I do I ask myself &quot;at what cost?&quot; Is it worth an hour of labor to have a pizza pan that is prettier than my already functioning one? It&#39;s actually fairly liberating.</p>

<p><strong>I think it&#39;s ironic that people in this thread seem to think I have some sort of rebellious/angry tendency. It&#39;s the exact opposite. I have lived like this for over 5 years and have never been happier or felt more free. Money is never an issue and I have no stress related to finances. Of course having more money would be nice, but at the end of the day I&#39;ll easily survive and make due.</strong></p>

<p>I just find it sad that people are willing to work away 1/3rd of their life to buy objects that they perceive will make their life easier. My point is we don&#39;t half the shit we perceive we need. New siding on your house is beautiful, but at what cost does it come? Is it worth spending 3 months of your time working for a fresh coat of paint on your walls?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know how we looked at civil war medicine? Or the treatment of tuberculosis? Future generations will probably see what we call &quot;modern medicine&quot; as similar.</p>

<p>Surgery is still pretty god damned crude, despite the illusion of advance. Most of the opiates we know are relatively new inventions and we don&#39;t really fully understand the effects they have on the brain. Sure, we know they increase pain tolerance - but that&#39;s about it. That&#39;s under a generation of study.</p>

<p>Psychiatric medicine is similar - except even scarier as most of your SSRIs have only been around for ~3 decades. We prescribe this shit to 2/5ths of the population (last I checked), yet a full generation hasn&#39;t even seen its end results. </p>

<p>The over-prescription of anti-biotics is an excellent and modern example of the mishandling of medicine. We don&#39;t know what they&#39;re capable of fucking up, yet they were overprescribed to [mainly] animals and humans to the point they&#39;ve become ineffective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m saying is current medicine is far more crude than most people imagine. Ask any pharmacist. We know the <em>effect</em> medicines have on people based on their binding to receptors. But we don&#39;t know the ultimate impacts the binding/inhibition of certain receptors have overall. People think modern medicine is fucking great. In reality, we&#39;re prescribing completely untested medications to 40% (2/5 on psych meds) of the population. </p>

<p>Heroin used to be a cure-all for any type of flu/cold. Now it&#39;s considered incredibly neurotoxic and addictive.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know how long-term usage will effect people 30-40 years from now. Yet, we still prescribe them to the masses. The rest of the world doesn&#39;t have these problems, but for some reason Americans do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hilarious to think that the trend of technology in general, not just medicine, has ever been a long-term thought process. I think you can point to every new piece of technology and explain how and why it had unintended long-term consequences that may alter how or if it was released at that time or even at all. This is how discovery works. If you know 100% (or even 75%) about something, it isn&#39;t cutting edge.</p>

<p>Edit: also, I should say that the prerequisite for introducing and using new technology is that it can have substantial benefits now, of course.</p>

Maybe this is just me, and I agree with you for the most part (ie, antibiotics are prescribed for just about every cough and cold), but I always consider going to the doctor or hospital as a last resort.  People who go to the doctor for every single tiny ailment are just making themselves more sick and exposing themselves to other sick people.  With ow much information you can find online it is pretty easy to diagnose problems you have and solve the problem yourself, but of course the medical community throws out this bullshit that it&#39;s dangerous and they know better than you.  I can provide numerous sources and news stories of people misdiagnosed or mistreated because the doctors jump onto one symptom and ignore everything else, or they just give the person anti-biotics as a cure-all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, mine was interdisciplinary as well, but my degree is a &quot;Bachelor of Business Administration.&quot; I was required to take quite a few management/strategy courses. The management and strategic courses were eyeopening to me. I kind of realized that every tactic I was being taught was already in practice and a lot of the tactics were pretty unethical IMO. Then I kind of realized that the same tactics were used in politics. Naturally I connected Points A and B and just assumed that the richest people got where they are because they were good at what they did. They employ the people who are most skilled at using these tactics and ultimately will try and use them to their own benefit. </p>

<p>Then I started applying that to taxes/global warming/etc., So I realized &quot;Even if things like environmental are happening and are a serious threat to mankind, businesses will naturally try to prevent any progress if it harms their profitability. &quot; I&#39;m not debating whether it&#39;s happening or not - I&#39;m saying if it was happening, no efforts would be made to stop it if it increased costs. </p>

<p>Then you read about all the scandals like Worldcom/Enron and realize that nothing is off the table, even if only a small minority pursues these tactics. So I completely lost faith in &quot;leaders&quot; doing the right thing. In their minds, the right thing is shareholder profit and progression of their own careers. People will always pursue what makes their job easier, no matter what it is. If that&#39;s the case, why not lobby for anti-tax. Even if you settle for a 3% decrease, you increase your net margin by quite a bit. Or even worse, lower wages. If a company can threaten to outsource and therefore reduce the pay of their domestic employees, they gladly will. At the end of the day, the ROI is all your investors care about. </p>

<p>I started going for finance because I started college in 2008 when the economy just tanked. I originally went for Env Sci. I took a business class because my schedule was fucked up, and found it super interesting due to the situation at the time. So I switched my major to &quot;understand more about why stuff happened the way it did.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t go in with paranoia or many conspiracies. I went in questioning how shit happened the way it did. Once you realize that investors only give a shit about profit, management only gives a shit about investors, and employees only give a shit about their position with management, you start realizing how stuff happens the way it did.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all just a giant fucking circlejerk. Few people I graduated with in accounting actually understood it - it doesn&#39;t surprise me that companies can get away with the crap they do. They can do the numbers, but have little understanding of the how and why. I was a teaching assistant after I graduated in the capstone course - no one did their accounting crap close to right. </p>

<p>I just connected the dots in ways that made sense. I think I just figured out what people could <em>potentially do</em> based on the loopholes I saw. Then I realized, if it&#39;s profitable you know damn well someone is going to do it or has done it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with this though. I think it needs to be recognized that there is a problem in order for us to begin moving in the right direction.

<p>I&#39;m very happy and accepting with everything around us. I believe that humans are mostly good, but have ultimately been lead down the wrong track.

<p>There&#39;s no immediate band-aid that can suddenly fix or change things. There&#39;s no magical solution <em>that I know of</em> that will just instantly fix things. It&#39;s a progressive movement that will likely take generations to solve - but until you recognize it&#39;s a problem you can&#39;t really move forward.

<p>:) I went for finance/accounting for a reason. I have aspergers, so I do what I can socially and just try to learn and understand people. That&#39;s why my arguments might seem slightly awkward/unconventional/blunt. That&#39;s also why I might be willing to discuss something that is &quot;assholeish.&quot; </p>

I don&#39;t like knowing that we live in a country that is essentially &quot;subsidized&quot; by the rest of the world. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that 10 foreigners support 1 American (not actual numbers). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m happy and accepting because it&#39;s the world I&#39;m familiar with. It&#39;s the place the people I love exist. People are &quot;insane,&quot; but you love their flaws. I enjoy learning about things and people and have found my position in society. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t see the flaws, like discussing the flaws, and wish for the flaws to get better. I don&#39;t know how to fix things or how things should change, but I don&#39;t &quot;need to know how to fix my broken arm to see that it&#39;s broken.&quot; A lot of things have already gotten better since I&#39;ve been alive (Acceptance of homosexuals is a good one) and other things have degraded. Even if shit gets worse, it&#39;s nice to see what gets better.</p>

<p>I avoid what I can avoid and make the best of it. Of course I&#39;d like to see changes made, but I don&#39;t &quot;hate&quot; society or &quot;hate&quot; people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing that always amazes me about discussions like this and why I have hope for humanity. No matter how different two people&#39;s views seem to be, ultimately there&#39;s always some sort of common denominator that will be arrived at with enough discussion. I don&#39;t think you were an asshole - you were respectful and polite the entire way though. I think this whole discussion is one of those things that everyone kind of sees around them, but refuses to see it for what it is. </p>

<p>Fact of the matter is, everyone on this planet is basically winging it to get by. So many generations of winging it has put us where we are today. It&#39;s one of the problems that is so big that no one really wants to discuss it as there aren&#39;t really any easy solutions. Any solution would ripple through the system upon systems and basically cause chaos and turmoil. The second people have a pocket of power, they protect it at all costs - and changing the way things are would undermine a lot of people&#39;s power and comfort. </p>

<p>I think most people feel overwhelmed by it, some threatened, most try to rationalize away the evidence, and there are those who just don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t accept it because they don&#39;t see how it could &quot;possibly be different.&quot; I don&#39;t expect people to react to what I posted in a way other than they have - it&#39;s an all-encompassing topic that&#39;s in a huge grey area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first response to this was &quot;you&#39;re not wrong, you&#39;re just an ass hole&quot;. seriously though I think you&#39;re on to something but you&#39;ve got things all the wrong way round and I think you should look at each of your points and have a good calm think about each one, work out a better,less insulting way of communicating what the problem is. I remember a time when I was younger when I was angry and thought everyone was part of the problem so I looked down on them and wanted to scream and shout from the roof tops. But they deserve so much more compassion than that. In your opinion, the &quot;sheeple&quot; are suffering and they don&#39;t even know it, they graft to the bone everyday in a situation that is impossible to remove themselves from. shouting insults at them about how they are the problem without giving them any sort of answer will only anger people surely? When it comes down to it I think the problem comes from the top down and the answer lies in small personal choices that you and others make everyday. What is good for me, what is good for the people around me and outward and outward. The people around you will become happier and pay it forward. So you dont like materialism? Get on your bike and visit a friend instead of watching tv tonight? Take up a hobbie and share it with others and you may inspire others to change their lives for the better. But that anger needs to go because its clouding the big picture of whats actually going on and what isn&#39;t. Try looking at some philosophy, both western and eastern also look at some ideas of solutions such as permaculture and some differing political ideals, get involved in activism. Dont get angry get shit done. Oh and careful with that medical stuff... do your research so you can formulate a more informed opinion you can back up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not angry at all! I&#39;m happy I saw the other side of the light. I look at people who are stuck in consumer-land as being &quot;trapped,&quot; like you said. They don&#39;t know any other way of life and feel accepted by those around them by participating in trends/consumption.</p>

<p>I&#39;m the same way with knowledge. I like to &quot;hoard information,&quot; as I call it, no matter how pointless or trivial. I don&#39;t need to talk about physical objects, I can talk about the shit I understand instead.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad people in this thread kind of validated my point that &quot;no one realizes how much of a butchershop modern medicine really is.&quot; I&#39;m not saying that based on speculation, I&#39;m saying it as a fact.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny that people will work 1/3rd of their life to use objects during the 1/6th that they have freetime (assuming the other 1/3rd goes to sleep and the other 1/6th goes to maintaining their finances/possessions). To cope with getting through the 1/3rd they take medication to dull their sensations. In order to rationalize their shitty lifestyle, they develop a form of hierarchy to &quot;improve their situation.&quot; At the end of the day, they might make more money, but they&#39;re still dedicating an entire third of their life to a menial task.</p>

<p>If you build your own wealth, you are still a victim of the same system of &quot;working 1/3rd of your life.&quot; </p>

<p>I was also trying to get at the following scenario. Let&#39;s say a rich person goes to a 5 star restaurant that is privately reserved for them. You then have the entire staff of cooks, waiters, etc., preparing a building for them, making their food, cleaning up, providing them. You&#39;re using probably 50+ man hours of other peoples to time to provide a &quot;nice situation&quot; for 3-4 people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at least they are spending, not hoarding that&#39;s what I would say. As far as time, life is all about time management. Its the biggest challenge to humans. How do you spend your time to make it worthwhile? Work isn&#39;t just wasting 1/3 of your life. It&#39;s being productive and providing something. Are some jobs or products pointless? Probably. But I would bet everyone desires meaning in their work. I don&#39;t believe anyone desires to be meaningless or waste time. Maybe they are searching for purpose and value...  and maybe their idea of purpose and value is different than yours. While your ideals are good, the reality is no two people have the same motives. I applaud your attempt to simplify the world, but don&#39;t get mad when you find out it doesn&#39;t fit.</p>

<p>From a capitalist/financial perspective, this is the proper response as it keeps the wealth flowing. So I don&#39;t agree that this is the &quot;wrong&quot; answer in the market we&#39;re currently in. </p>

<p>My idealistic response would be why unnecessarily use those resources and have people pointlessly exerting effort to supply people with services that they don&#39;t truly need? Why not focus that effort on more important things. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work isn&#39;t just wasting 1/3 of your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with this either. It&#39;s better to work and at least keep your mind sharp than wasting away watching reality TV shows. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not anti-work. I just think there could be <em>more fulfilling</em> activities. I&#39;m awfully jealous of my parents who grew up working on farms <em>with their family.</em> That&#39;s what I think modern society is missing. Kids don&#39;t actually get to experience their youth <em>with their family</em> and don&#39;t get to see the products of their work. Buying food is much less rewarding than having your child work in your garden to grow carrots and be &quot;amazed&quot; about it. The irony is, I say this as someone who never wants children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I would bet everyone desires meaning in their work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is kind of what I just alluded to. People have little meaning in their work if they&#39;re working in a factory/production setting. A person slapping doors onto a chassis never gets to experience the success of a completed car rolling off the line. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe they are searching for purpose and value... and maybe their idea of purpose and value is different than yours. While your ideals are good, the reality is no two people have the same motives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I agree with this completely as well. People definitely have significantly different motivations and receive fulfillment in different manners. My girlfriend fucking loves instagramming her starbucks, in my mind I&#39;m just thinking &quot;Damn you spent an hour in a place where you&#39;re miserable all day to buy a cup of coffee? Why not just spend it doing something you like&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I applaud your attempt to simplify the world, but don&#39;t get mad when you find out it doesn&#39;t fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, one single &#39;bullet point&#39; is a grey conception of something that could have 5+ pages of explanations, exceptions, contradictions, and opinions. There&#39;s no &quot;right answer,&quot; but I just question the short-term sacrifices people are willing to make to pursue a long-term end that is generally unreachable.</p>

<p>I mean, save up for a year to buy a better car? Why not spend that year doing something memorable. </p>

We should work on farms with our family and say fuck modern society. Newsflash, life isn&#39;t all fun.

</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s moreso that the way society is structured almost forces them to participate in the way things are. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If everyone was a subsistence farmer spending their lives working with their families we would all be happier? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on what I said, you&#39;re correct. But I&#39;m not necessarily arguing for strictly that. I think it&#39;s a convenient example as it&#39;s the best known example and historically has been how most families are since the agricultural revolution. However child apprenticeships with their family would also work well. I&#39;m just against the whole &quot;dad works from 5-5, gets home, sleeps, goes to work and never spends a moment of time developing a relationship with their kid.&quot; I understand that&#39;s just being a shitty parent, but I society is partially to blame. If spending time with kin was more important, more people would probably do-so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Newsflash, life isn&#39;t all fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree-I just wish the unfun time was experienced and handled as a family. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we could all stop work that is unfulfilling and spend our lives doing memorable things we would</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying to stop work, I&#39;m saying if we were willing to sacrifice pointless consumption and focused on making the things that mattered more provide-able we would have more time to pursue the memorable things. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, maybe you should hop off the internet and go live in the woods with your family.</p>

<p>I wish I could. I regret not being able to spend more time with them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately, that&#39;s what I was trying to point to with my initial post. :P Everything I listed is pretty much a symptom of pointless consumption. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are addicts of materiality, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nough said. Pointless consumption. I think it&#39;s literally an addiction that&#39;s just as bad as drugs/gambling. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>obsessive over working,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Working for consumption</p>

<blockquote>
<p>conceited about their societal role,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Want things to impress others or have something other people have. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>are as naive as children, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>OOOO! Shiny! I want that! Oooh that iPhone is pink? I WANT THAT!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>act as social creatures functioning as individualistic swines</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will make others suffer for their own benefit. Whether it&#39;s to make them feel better about their position or to balance out something they&#39;re envious of. A lot of this happens in the work place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>value authoritarianism and hierarchy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, to preserve their assets or acquire more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pursue excess at the cost of the well-being of kin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Work a live time while avoiding the people they &quot;work for.&quot; Why &quot;give your child a better life&quot; if you are never going to be around them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are dependent on legally prescribed and untested narcotics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Workplace is one of the highest causes of stress. They&#39;ll work two jobs, destroy their joints, get on pain meds, drink away the pain etc., for what reason? To buy shit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>believe in destruction of the family structure as teenagers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Self-sufficiency/having their own place/being independent is a relatively modern idea. A lot links back to marketing/consumption imo. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>practice a loving religion with a government that is by proxy mutilating and oppressing entire societies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The oppression is generally over natural resources, economic oppression (Iran, which happened after Iran denied Western reform in the Iranian Revolution), or by enslaving a workforce.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>imprisoners of their own species who live in an illusion of freedom and liberty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of property crimes/murder over money. </p>

But in reality, the people buying into the addictive nature of consumption and sadist nature of work-obsession are just as insane as those criticizing it.

<p>I don&#39;t think the human body is really &quot;evolved&quot; to be living how we do. The human brain isn&#39;t really evolved to handle the world we live in. That&#39;s why I say &quot;everyone is insane.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the statement is true for a lot of people because the system induces that behavior. Everything is taxed and what&#39;s not has penalties. It&#39;s hard to live off of cash alone anymore. If you slowdown or stop, you cant pay your rent, mortgage, car payment, etc. Because of inflation you have to stay ahead ofthe curve. You cant just sit comfortably at a job for years and years. If you dont get a raise of 3-4% every year, you&#39;re basically taking a paycut every year.  So there&#39;s this mad dash to stay ahead with only a few avenues available which leads to backstabbing and overworking. Most of Europe avoided this until the European Union put an end to it leading to the breakdown of their way of life that will take decades to normalize (at which point they&#39;ll be just like us, yay).</p>

It&#39;s not that they just willingly act and rely upon the system you described, what happens is people become complacent and understand that it&#39;s really not that bad.  There is nothing inherently wrong or evil about half of what you described, such as: being materialistic, being a workaholic, being conceited, naive...  The thing is, as long as life isn&#39;t <em>that</em> bad, and as long as everyone can get by then nobody really cares about what drugs they&#39;re taking, or who&#39;s spying on them, etc, because in the end it really doesn&#39;t affect them at all, so why should they care?  Actual harm is very different than your perceived harm.</p>

<p>I am in no way advocating the way things are, but just letting you in on why nobody really cares about all the shit that goes on no matter how obvious and terribly it may appear to be.

    <div class="md"><p>ok, lets go over your broad, sweeping statement about human nature here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In what way is materialism part of basic human nature?  There are many, many, <em>many</em> people, both alive today and throughout human history, that neither want(ed) nor crave(d) in an addictive manner the myriad distracting pieces of kitch/tech/whatever that gets waved in out faces every waking moment of every day.  Material Addiction is not human nature.</p></li>
<li><p>work obsession is a pathology.  Casting aside family time/personal time in pursuit of more recognition/cash is degrading the emotional capacity and moral scruples of the current working population.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern Education (either well-executed or completely ignored) has little to do with basic human nature.  Neither does the inane, self-destructive requirements of a social system revolving around sacrifice to beauty, money, and status.  Remember, we are at our core a familial species, meant to learn from and live with our predecessors and peers.  Standardization in education and blind idolatry of social status are <em>not</em> valid.</p></li>
<li><p>There is nothing human about rampant prescription of narcotics and pharmaceuticals to the American population.  There&#39;s another word you&#39;re looking for, and it goes back to money: <em>capitalist</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Spiritualism is in human nature.  Dogma is not.  You will see plenty of this argument on <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>.  Let me be clear on this: <em>blind worship of a deity and strict adherence to the rules of its clergy is a trap</em>.  This applies not only to overzealous religious practices (fundamentalism) but to governments and corporations that are increasingly acting like the gods they think they are (protip: they aren&#39;t, and the more you show them you think they are, the more harm will come to you)</p></li>
<li><p>Death By Proxy and Systematic Oppression is <em>not part of human nature</em>.  A madman using fear, power and corruption to drive a nation to genocide is unnatural (see: Darfur, Nazi Germany).  So is an unmanned drone carrying a payload strong enough to incinerate a wedding party (see: us).</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The person above you put it much more eloquently than I could have. To put it crudely, but to also make a 100% serious point. Let&#39;s say I am poor and have little chance at a job. If I have to give blowjobs to buy food, just because I survive doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the best possible way to live. I survived.</p>

<p>Most people in the world are just surviving. A small minority in the 330 Million Americans/some Europeans are able to live excessively. If we ignore the unrealistic demands of the small minority, it&#39;s possible to provide a solution that is better than &quot;just surviving&quot; to the small minority of the 330 million.</p>

<p>If you consider the richest of the richest, you have hundreds of people working to support their lifestyle. I&#39;m asking why do we choose to do so? If you contribute an hour of labor, you should receive what&#39;s considered an hour of labor in return. Some of the incredibly rich are receiving 100-200 hours for their single hour of input. That&#39;s fine and dandy if they&#39;re contributing something that is invaluable, but in reality most of your high paying jobs are doing jobs that are completely fucking irrelevant to our survival. IE, to support regulations and laws.</p>

<p>Think about how much completely fucking useless shit your family buys year after year after year. </p>

<p>A new set of plates - why not just make one set of metal plates that last a life time. New home decor. New clothes to keep up with fashion. It&#39;s all fucking pointless. Instead of purchasing this bullshit, we could be working less and spending more time with our loved ones. We could be experiencing more than just the menial tasks.</p>

<p>Instead, you have literally 100&#39;s of people working to improve a small minorities excessive life style by an incredibly small amount. No other species does this.</p>

<p>You also have people capable of surviving on their own unable to choose to live that life style - due to land ownership and property tax. Why the fuck can&#39;t I just go in an area, build a log cabin, farm there, and defend it to claim it as my own? </p>

<p>Except ants. And lions. Pretty much every swarm or species with an alpha male. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>So you want us to create one set of plates, and then want us to get away from menial tasks. But aren&#39;t things like fashion and music and art things that get our minds off the menial tasks? The luxury items are what we receive by working hard. We provide utility to one another so that we can spend resources on luxury items.</p>

<p>Because that land is already owned by someone else. </p>

<p>It just means I dont have to do any prep myself. Ill just outwit some survivalist out of his stash, cant see it taking too long. </p>

<p>I dont think you have really thought through how easy it would be to take your log cabin from you. Are you and your family going to maintain a compound and a 24 hour armed watch? </p>

<p>How is that going to affect your quality of life and family time? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 23 and have my bachelor&#39;s degree in business/accounting. I chose that field to &#39;know thy enemy.&#39; I sat through many many many pro-Capitalist classes learning how products are pushed to people or how to deceive workers to &quot;get what you want from them.&quot; I am thoroughly educated in modern management theory and consumer behavior. It definitely works, but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s used for good. Most people are complete suckers for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, mine was interdisciplinary as well, but my degree is a &quot;Bachelor of Business Administration.&quot; I was required to take quite a few management/strategy courses. The management and strategic courses were eyeopening to me. I kind of realized that every tactic I was being taught was already in practice and a lot of the tactics were pretty unethical IMO. Then I kind of realized that the same tactics were used in politics. Naturally I connected Points A and B and just assumed that the richest people got where they are because they were good at what they did. They employ the people who are most skilled at using these tactics and ultimately will try and use them to their own benefit. </p>

<p>Then I started applying that to taxes/global warming/etc., So I realized &quot;Even if things like environmental are happening and are a serious threat to mankind, businesses will naturally try to prevent any progress if it harms their profitability. &quot; I&#39;m not debating whether it&#39;s happening or not - I&#39;m saying if it was happening, no efforts would be made to stop it if it increased costs. </p>

<p>Then you read about all the scandals like Worldcom/Enron and realize that nothing is off the table, even if only a small minority pursues these tactics. So I completely lost faith in &quot;leaders&quot; doing the right thing. In their minds, the right thing is shareholder profit and progression of their own careers. People will always pursue what makes their job easier, no matter what it is. If that&#39;s the case, why not lobby for anti-tax. Even if you settle for a 3% decrease, you increase your net margin by quite a bit. Or even worse, lower wages. If a company can threaten to outsource and therefore reduce the pay of their domestic employees, they gladly will. At the end of the day, the ROI is all your investors care about. </p>

<p>I started going for finance because I started college in 2008 when the economy just tanked. I originally went for Env Sci. I took a business class because my schedule was fucked up, and found it super interesting due to the situation at the time. So I switched my major to &quot;understand more about why stuff happened the way it did.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t go in with paranoia or many conspiracies. I went in questioning how shit happened the way it did. Once you realize that investors only give a shit about profit, management only gives a shit about investors, and employees only give a shit about their position with management, you start realizing how stuff happens the way it did.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all just a giant fucking circlejerk. Few people I graduated with in accounting actually understood it - it doesn&#39;t surprise me that companies can get away with the crap they do. They can do the numbers, but have little understanding of the how and why. I was a teaching assistant after I graduated in the capstone course - no one did their accounting crap close to right. </p>

<p>I just connected the dots in ways that made sense. I think I just figured out what people could <em>potentially do</em> based on the loopholes I saw. Then I realized, if it&#39;s profitable you know damn well someone is going to do it or has done it. </p>
