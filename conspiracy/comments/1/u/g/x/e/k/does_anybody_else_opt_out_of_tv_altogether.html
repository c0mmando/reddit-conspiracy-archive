       I did the same with "Alternative News". It's amazing how obvious it becomes that most sources are only trying to sell things to solve problems that they created. You see things like "GMO seeds are taking over! Get these natural ones before they become illegal!" And then you see it's just wheat seeds with a 500% markup.

       And when you do catch the little snippets now and then its usually "Up next a man who claims he can speak to animals! Is it true? Find out more after the break!" Meanwhile drones are bombing weddings and were selling guns to terrorists and assassinating whistleblowers. Its not even 'news'..

       That's a cop out.  You don't think that if the news reported on some of the atrocities being committed around the world that it would draw viewership?  I think it would.

       I see your point and it is a very optimistic one which I hope is correct.  One way you could prove your point is to actively bring up these topics such as drone strikes killing innocent people to everyone you meet.  And note their reactions.  How will they deal with someone who spoils their world view and upsets their willful ignorance?  It would be good to know about these reactions in detail.

       Considering the corporate media has been hemorraging viewers for the past several years, I'd say the obviousness of your assertion is in doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example,
       <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/randy-hall/2013/08/22/msnbc-still-freefall-loses-22-percent-viewers-last-summer">
        MSNBC recently lost 22% of it's viewers
       </a>
       , so perhaps people are getting tired of the infotainment that passes for news these days.

       I agree to that point. People are watching "news" channels less and less because they can skip the fluff and find the story directly online. It still doesn't change the fact that they are not choosing stories based on importance or anything having to do with journalism but instead ratings.
      </p>

       Notice every time there is a plane crash, for months after anytime a plane has landing gear issues the networks go to live coverage hoping to get film of the crash.

       That is not an established fact, especially in light of the recent update to the Smith Mundt Act, which allows the federal government to direct its propaganda at US citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       The level of government collusion in the corporate media since 9/11/2001 has been absolutely off the charts, and, as such, it is no longer only about ratings.  It definitely appears to be about distraction and crisis management.

       oh dont get me wrong, like others on this thread i've been off tv for about 5 years now and can totally see the mind programming that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       but i think there's something deeper than that. there has to be subliminal messaging as well, either in the form of fast frame rates or something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       while i can still hear my own thoughts watching tv, i cant help but become lethargic. and im sure much more is going on inside me than a sudden urge to nap.

       No, it's just your body releasing lactic acid.

       To test it, just sit down and stare at a light (preferably with a lampshade) and clear your mind. Don't think of stupid it is or how much you have to do tomorrow, just zone out. Feeling tired?

       well when i try meditating its a totally different feeling of relaxation, not just outright laziness.

       i also read somewhere that the frame rates are so high we can only ever really "see" a fraction of whats happening on screen.

       Oh I don't know about that mate. What about the study which showed a decrease in IQ after watching jersey shore, even for those who hated it?  Or how about top 40 hits being used to brainwash enemy combatants, even when they didn't speak English and were actively opposing it?

       For the Jersey Shore one, it seems like the results are statistically insignificant. However, it is plausible that our surroundings do imprint on our psyche.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Top 40 Torture, I'm pretty sure the results would be the same with heavy metal or avant guard. It's torture if you are being forced to do something against your will.

       You're generally correct but I'd point out that the higher powers have known since at least WWII (and likely before) that psychological mind-states can be imposed against a victim's will.

       I was just saying that it doesn't matter what music or whatever is being played. If you're tied up in a chair or however they do it and you're forced to listen to noise, it's not going to matter what genre of music it is.

       I lived without a television for 2 years, it was awesome, i did a lot of reading.  Now that I know how propaganda works and how television utilizes collectivist stereotyping to control opinion and create "new normals" I think watching television is fun because its fun to analyze what is being said and what messages are being pushed.  Its so
       <em>

       Yes they are stupid and believing with the TV-induced illusion of being smart and informed. Have you ever had a "conversation" with a FOX News watcher? They will repeat concepts and thoughts given to them through the box and hold them as their own original thought. It's incredible. They never realize that they are just believing and repeating what they are told. I assume the same thing is happening now with the MSNBC crowd as well.

       I feel the same way, but I can't bring myself to actually watch anything for more than a few minutes.  There's always some hidden message in everything, even a lot of commercials, to be afraid of terrorists, or drugs, or guns.  There's nothing good on anymore either.  I literally was unable to find a channel around Christmas time that didn't have a reality show playing.

       I see propaganda in everything now, movies, tv shows, commercials, and  plenty elsewhere. I only pay for internet, but I'll watch a movie all the same I like to be informed on the propaganda around me so to speak. Television I despise it for the most part, I still have netflix so i watch some tv series.

       But at least with the internet you are exposed to many views and you can make a more informed decision. If you watch cable news you pretty much see the same thing on every station.

       I like to limit the word to its use as a tool to instill a sense of nationalistic pride for use in warfare. If you apply it to consumerism and morality then yeah, you can see it in just about everything.

       I stopped watching TV in 1990 and have only gained from the loss. Living to be passively entertainmed is not living a life. Without an instant distraction box I was able to explore so much of myself and the world since that was my only option. Now with the internet there is no need to have a TV to keep informed and as we all know, the MSM's job is to keep us misinformed and distracted. The only reason now I keep a TV set is to movies at home which is OK by me since my viewing time is specific, targeted and guaranteed to have an end point. Keep the TV and unplug the cable/antenna is always my advice.

       Different year but similiar experience here.  I was greatly amused when my dentist found out I didn't watch tv and went on to lecture me about the wonders of television as though I came from a different planet and wasn't already an expert on the topic like everyone else in America.  He said "so if you don't watch television what do you do then"?  I thought it was a very funny question because it was inconceivable to him that there is a worthwhile existence outside of the mainstream media.  Also, he was filling my tooth at the time so I really couldn't answer.  But, don't get me wrong he is a great dentist and human being.  He just has a different view than I do on this topic.

       Yes I am! Reddit has been awesome for me to keep up. Not with the current trends and popular tastes but with the evolving consciousness and the mind-set of the generation after me. It's been awesome. I have always felt that the younger generation should always be the teachers to the generations that came before them. The youngest among us are the freshest and newest batch of beings who have come to Earth deliver and advance the consciousness of the human race. Why download more bullshit form the generation in front of me-what do they know?-a bunch of hooey pretty much. Reddit has allowed me to interface with a younger mind-set and helped me grow and advance myself by learning how people born in my 20's see and navigate the world. I just hope this place doesn't get fucked-up and messed-over by the controlling-elite who like to piss on parties; they probably will. But by that time something else will have evolved to replace it. Always look to those younger than you too teach you and you will  never get old and stuck in "your own" time. Oh...and never watch television. They're called programs for a reason.

       I believe it was 93. Invasion, yes. All I remember were constant reports about the scud missiles and we're doing the right thing and terror and He gasses his own people and evil and I thought- that's enough of that shit. &lt;click&gt;

       I officially unplugged my tv around the spring time last year. Best thing i've done so far. Everytime im at a friends  house, I just laugh when I see all this bullshit on tv. Celebrity gossip, fake news casts, BUY BUY BUY our product! You NEED it. Be like everyone else (a zombie). I just feel that I've made one of the best decisions in life so far.

       I agree that it is prob one of the best decisions a person can make with their life. im 22 years old and I like to wonder how interesting/ smart I would be if I had never sat in front of a TV and let it fill my head with useless CRAP. Even as it is, I hardly watch TV anymore. I prefer the internet because I can choose better things to absorb. But I can't help but feel like that short time, as a child, that the TV ruined me. Hate it now

       Something else I noticed is how much easier it is to see when "our" news media tells us they are showing reflections of our society, they are often pushing what certain people want us to accept as the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the "technical events" in so-called reality programming are really disturbing, maybe even hypnotic to some.  Seldom is a camera angle held for longer than 6 seconds, even shorter for commercials.  Count the seconds between camera changes and you'll see what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it leads to the addiction.  People's real lives don't move that fast, and they can't imagine what they would do without that rush.  But if you get away from it for awhile, the next time you get around a tv you can better see how the production values, scripting, acting, camera angles, are all a disgusting facade.

       Btw, many of my friends have since unplugged.

       "Reality" tv makes me almost physically ill when I'm around it as well. I just can't believe the stuff is on tv and people watch it. In 2001 when I stopped watching, reality tv was a big deal, but it wasn't as big as it is now.

       It's hard to answer these questions because at this point in my life I've been without a tv for more than half my life if you don't count the first few years of life that nobody can remember. The changes you're asking about happened a long time ago. In the first year that I stopped, my high school grades went up and I developed more hobbies. I played a lot of video games 2001-2003 but I kind of outgrew that too. Nowadays I surf the net, read, and play guitar a lot.

       Yeah. It sounds very 'hipster', but any kind of programming becomes irritating because it's so irritatingly transparent. The news is just a joke now; you can predict what they're about to show.

       Then again, I like to have my mind programmed through movies so I'm not much of a purist but it could be worse.

       I think it's good to watch movies and pick up on the NWO / illuminati symbolism that is present in 80% of them ("them" being action movies and the like, not comedies). Helps reaffirm my beliefs when I see how blatant this bull shit is.

       It's not so much the symbolism that's effective, but rather the messages and narratives within them that can be harmful to the more suggestible viewers. After all, the human brain is a computer and given the right presentation, it can be programmed.

       I haven't watched the programming in 5yrs. but in that span I went back to watching for a couple weeks because my internet was down, and in those weeks I never lost more things in my life and literally felt autistic. and I don't ever lose things and I'm very organized to a point where everything has it's place.

       8 years now without a television.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I'm at a hotel or visit a friend, I'm stunned at how disruptive and degenerating it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put this box in the corner of your room - every 10 minutes, it will tell you for a few minutes that you're inadequate in a passive aggressive way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stunning that some people put away 2 or 3 hours of that every night.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I always remember what Steve Jobs said:
      </p>
      <p>
       “When you’re young, you look at television and think, There’s a
conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But
when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks
are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far
more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot
the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really
in business to give people what they want.”
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the idea of something like The Matrix, Communism, Big Brother surveillance, etc whatever are more possible to be accepted than many people realise.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad and a little frightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Edit: I'm not saying there are no conspiracies, there clearly are.  However, some things we're simply doing to ourselves.  We're remarkably good at enslaving ourselves.

       Peopel watch tv because they don't want to think. I don't agree with all of that though, I like watching documentary/informational shows quite a bit. I get to learn and relax, so why not? I can't stand most sitcoms though.

       I watch public broadcasting when something good is on, I usually check online to see the schedule beforehand, and every once and a while I'll watch Craig Fergusons' late night show. He's a funny guy.

       I have a TV, but I don't watch cable. I feel like I tend to be much more unbiased when it comes to matters that appear on the news, whereas the media would have you believe that all middle easterners are terrorists, and things of that nature.

       When you don't watch hours of them a day, everyday, it becomes very easy to spot the attempt at hypnosis and subliminal messaging. I don't mean like going to sleep hypnosis, just the way they use people dancing around and music to alter your brainwaves. It's insulting actually when you are no longer affected by it.

       For the 4 years I was at uni studying a politics, philosophy and economics degree, I insisted on not owning a TV. This made it difficult with the people I chose to live with (including my now-wife), because they were studying degrees that were less critical on isolating yourself from media guff and relying on journals and so on.

      <p>
       These days I have a TV in the home I share with my wife, she mostly watches drama shows on it. I tend to watch BBC news, which has its faults but to yanks must be the most amazingly unbiased reporting in comparison to what I've seen of your televised current affairs media!

       I own a TV but I setup a media server to download content of my choice. I don't have cable and I'm not hooked up to Australian free-to-air so I don't see shitty news or reality TV bullshit. I don't have a problem with fictional TV shows...I know they're fiction. Its not a crime to enjoy scripted drama or fictional stories. The problem is with reality shows and propaganda pushing news programs.

       No propaganda box here either.  I stream the FEW things I wanna watch and read 2-3 books a week.  Did you know that only 15-20% of Americans read a book last year?!?  15-20%!?!  No wonder we are so fucked....but keep watching big bang theory retards!  A show that implies, basically, that if you are intelligent you are weird, socially awkward and sexually inept.  People don't realize that our subconscious takes all this shit into consideration.  "Don't be smart, be a dumb sheep and people will like you and you will get laid."

       Own it to watch shows like the Simpsons, NCIS, Family Guy and the occasional South Park, but since most of my favorite sitcoms are available on YT or on DVD I see no reason to own a TV actually. News? C'mon, which news?

       I own a television but I just watch shows of my choosing on Netflix and I have a few YouTube subscription. I havent had actual television for about 8 years though....now to wreck that my mom got me an antenna for christmas. Wamp wamp. I suppose it will be nice if a friend wants to come over and drink beer when football is on. (I don't watch football but I drink good beer)

       I love movies so I Netflix.  Haven't had a cable subscription in 3 years.  Absolutely don't miss it.  In fact, when I see a TV at someone else's house, I am amazed how fucking dumbed down it has gotten.  No one in their right mind should pay for cable.

       I no longer watch commercial TV.  I detest commercials. If there's a show that's interesting I'll wait until I can watch it on some format free of commercials.  The sole exception being major sports events.

       No more network or cable news either.  They're only there to do some  specific things; make themselves money, tell you what the government wants you to believe,  keep you pacified, your butt on the couch and uninvolved politically, and make you think that you're always part of the other 50% of public opinion.

       antenna tv is all i watch...i dont subscribe to cable/satelite tv because its not worth $100 a month to only watch 5 channels or so, and watch them seldomly. when cable/satelite providers start providing packages where one can choose what they want to watch, ill get it again. i love motorycle racing so if its on TV ill watch it but i rarely get any news from TV other than maybe watching RT here and there but thats just a leftist version of FOX, IMO.

       I haven't owned a t.v. in at least about 5 years.  People joke about how it's pretentious or whatever to mention you don't own a t.v., but as long as you're not a pretentious douche about it, I think it's obvious how terrible mindlessly watching t.v. is, you can't choose, the programming, only the channel and you get innundated with fucking endless advertisements that take up almost as much of the broadcasting as the actual content.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yea, mainstream news channels are unbelievable.  Whenever I catch a glimpse of one in a lobby or by a house or whatever, it's mind blowing to me to think that millions of people watch that garbage.

       I have ZERO cable and it is awesome!  Everyone should do it.  If they did, the whole system would come crashing down. I haven't had cable for, effectively, about 5 years.  I try to watch at others houses, can't do it.  It's horrible--all of it.

       I download all my shows and movie for free, not torrents but warez. I get all my shows for free and for my regular T.V I have that stupid thing you put on top of it, I get all the major channels like nbc, abc, cbs etc.. a few movie channels and more. It's all free, here where I live they made the state and everyone with a T.V change and buy these boxes we have to use when they went to broadcast instead of antenna. They were like $30 but they payed for $10 or something, big deal. I believe the whole U.S had to do this if I'm not mistaken. Screw paying close to $100 a month for T.V AND internet, I save like $60 a month doing this, my internet is like $55 a month.

       I hate TV, but that's because I am in my mid twenties, we are from the age of the internet, the age where we browse for the content we are actually interested in, not really the other way around which is basically what TV is in a nutshell.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said though, I own a very large screen TV, I use it exclusively for streaming purposes; NFL Sunday Ticket, Blu Rays and HD movies via HDMI and documentaries. I've become a huge movie buff in the last 6-7 years, I enjoy movies thoroughly,  but I've become ignorant when it comes to TV pop culture, by choice.

       so you say f.u. to local, national and world news being spoon fed to you at 7am, 6pm and the late at 10pm.  Good for you...but now you look for real news.  Spending all day and nights trying to see what 7 billion people did today and most importantly what gets set at the priority of the websites...so that now you are in the "know".  You are on the right track, but you may ask yourself... should I've taken the blue pill instead of the red?  It is a lot of work just to be knowledgeable of the real news and still keeping sane.

       My TV broke about 8 years ago and after about a month I realized I don't really need TV as long as I have internet so I never got the damn thing fixed or replaced. Fast forward 7 years, I watched TV at my mother's house when I visited. I was astounded by the sheer stupidity and fakeness of everything on it. Jesus Christ, EVERYTHING was fake and morally depraved. My TV breaking was the best thing that happened to my mind.

       So, from what I've read, we all agree cable &amp; major networks suck, but Roku/Netflix, YouTube, sports &amp; gaming are all "safe alternatives"?! As long as there's no ads? You guys do realize that every single movie, sports broadcast, series and game has some form of bias and programming, right?

       I also find it fascinating that many of you personally avoid TV but have a wife, roommate, parents etc that still demand access.

       I remember watching a program years ago featuring new agey Dr. Andrew Weil. One of his suggestions was taking a media/news "vacation" for two weeks. After two weeks I realized I didn't miss tv at all. Other than an occasional sporting event I don't watch tv at all; probably six or seven years now.

       That's some people's thing. Personally, I find it pointless and boring. I think I watched one superbowl game in high school with friends. I've never watched a baseball, soccer, tennis, or basketball game start to finish, live or on television, in my entire life.

       Really? How much does is cost if i may ask? I presume you are in the states.

       It's important to pay attention to the media only because you know what they want you to pay attention to. Once you know that, you can diverge from the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also important to watch because you know, there's just some things you want to stay relevant for among your peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is that TV can be fun, excellent examples of human creativity and sometimes it's just putting the pussy on the chain wax.
