       Here's background info.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsyku/what_happened_to_leadhelmetsblockelf/">

       Halfway down, you'll see a post containing 4 screenshots that
       <a href="/u/leadhelmetsblockelf">
        /u/leadhelmetsblockelf
       </a>
       took. Those 4 screenshots come from the same person who has many accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the same person attempting to do the same with me:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2qcoAsR.png">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a thread where I believe this same person is manipulating public opinion on a main subreddit:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1u0hkt/15_palestinians_die_of_hunger_in_syria_camp/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1u0hkt/15_palestinians_die_of_hunger_in_syria_camp/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is a photo of that thread with my argument:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/x0ivmEU.png">

       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I know at least some of you will be curious as to why I deleted my other account, so here's the thread where I did so:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1u1qlf/my_comment_history_proves_that_rconspiratard/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1u1qlf/my_comment_history_proves_that_rconspiratard/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I tried to prove
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       vote manipulation and deleted my account to prove that I wasn't angry and getting downvoted myself, but angry that they manipulate votes here in order to change the perceptions of conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, since I deleted my account yesterday, I won't be able to respond to anything in here without specifically asking the mods for approval on every post I make. (3 day rule for new accounts) I don't think I should waste their time, so I won't be responding to anything in this thread. Cheers.

       If reddit admins take no action, that is an indication of their approval of these users making threats. So take note of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, who takes these threats seriously enough to delete an account? If jerks actually show up at my door, they would get laughed at.

       Look at the first 3 posters in this thread. The first is a person who posts twice a month (could be alternative account). The second person is quite obsessed with calling out anti-semitism, but appears to be the main propaganda account. The 3rd poster is clearly an alternative account. Most likely a vote booster account (one of many). That is the only post that account has made since it was created 8 months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at the comments themselves. The second person starts the comment off with "Its true." The third person starts their comment off with "true." Strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, take a look at the first poster. Look at the phrase "etc etc." The poster who responded to this person also uses this same, rare phrase (without periods or a comma) here:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1swbyi/on_eve_of_ministerial_debate_haaretz_poll_finds/ce1zo5d">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1swbyi/on_eve_of_ministerial_debate_haaretz_poll_finds/ce1zo5d
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the third person uses the phrase: "pro pal arguments." Nobody talks like that. It appears to be a poor attempt at making the poster appear to speak differently from the person he is responding to, when in reality, they are all 3 the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another odd quality of the first poster is they only have comments in r/worldnews. This must be the
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       propaganda account. I'll bet there's other accounts just like this dedicated to specific subs. The second poster also seems to stick to
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       for the most part, and since the 3rd poster never commented before ever, it also only has comments here.

       They aren't shills, they are presenting other relevant information. If you don't like it, ignore it. 15 Palestinians died in Syria. Ok. Over 100,000 arabs have died alone in Syria during the Civil war. OK. Just because it isn't anti-Israel doesn't mean its propagated by shills. Trust me, no one wants to sway your opinion we know that isn't going to happen. Just because some asshole messages a threat to you over the internet isn't a cause for calling them a shill. Call them what they are; an asshole.
