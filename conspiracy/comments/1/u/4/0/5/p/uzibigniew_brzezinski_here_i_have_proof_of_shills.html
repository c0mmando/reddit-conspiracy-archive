        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s background info. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsyku/what_happened_to_leadhelmetsblockelf/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tsyku/what_happened_to_leadhelmetsblockelf/</a></p>

<p>Halfway down, you&#39;ll see a post containing 4 screenshots that <a href="/u/leadhelmetsblockelf">/u/leadhelmetsblockelf</a> took. Those 4 screenshots come from the same person who has many accounts. </p>

<p>Here is the same person attempting to do the same with me: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2qcoAsR.png">http://i.imgur.com/2qcoAsR.png</a></p>

<p>Here is a thread where I believe this same person is manipulating public opinion on a main subreddit: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1u0hkt/15_palestinians_die_of_hunger_in_syria_camp/">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1u0hkt/15_palestinians_die_of_hunger_in_syria_camp/</a></p>

<p>And here is a photo of that thread with my argument: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/x0ivmEU.png">http://i.imgur.com/x0ivmEU.png</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>I know at least some of you will be curious as to why I deleted my other account, so here&#39;s the thread where I did so: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1u1qlf/my_comment_history_proves_that_rconspiratard/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1u1qlf/my_comment_history_proves_that_rconspiratard/</a></p>

<p>Basically, I tried to prove <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> vote manipulation and deleted my account to prove that I wasn&#39;t angry and getting downvoted myself, but angry that they manipulate votes here in order to change the perceptions of conversations. </p>

<p>Additionally, since I deleted my account yesterday, I won&#39;t be able to respond to anything in here without specifically asking the mods for approval on every post I make. (3 day rule for new accounts) I don&#39;t think I should waste their time, so I won&#39;t be responding to anything in this thread. Cheers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the first 3 posters in this thread. The first is a person who posts twice a month (could be alternative account). The second person is quite obsessed with calling out anti-semitism, but appears to be the main propaganda account. The 3rd poster is clearly an alternative account. Most likely a vote booster account (one of many). That is the only post that account has made since it was created 8 months ago.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the comments themselves. The second person starts the comment off with &quot;Its true.&quot; The third person starts their comment off with &quot;true.&quot; Strange.</p>

<p>Also, take a look at the first poster. Look at the phrase &quot;etc etc.&quot; The poster who responded to this person also uses this same, rare phrase (without periods or a comma) here: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1swbyi/on_eve_of_ministerial_debate_haaretz_poll_finds/ce1zo5d">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1swbyi/on_eve_of_ministerial_debate_haaretz_poll_finds/ce1zo5d</a></p>

<p>Finally, the third person uses the phrase: &quot;pro pal arguments.&quot; Nobody talks like that. It appears to be a poor attempt at making the poster appear to speak differently from the person he is responding to, when in reality, they are all 3 the same person.</p>

<p>Another odd quality of the first poster is they only have comments in r/worldnews. This must be the <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> propaganda account. I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s other accounts just like this dedicated to specific subs. The second poster also seems to stick to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> for the most part, and since the 3rd poster never commented before ever, it also only has comments here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t shills, they are presenting other relevant information. If you don&#39;t like it, ignore it. 15 Palestinians died in Syria. Ok. Over 100,000 arabs have died alone in Syria during the Civil war. OK. Just because it isn&#39;t anti-Israel doesn&#39;t mean its propagated by shills. Trust me, no one wants to sway your opinion we know that isn&#39;t going to happen. Just because some asshole messages a threat to you over the internet isn&#39;t a cause for calling them a shill. Call them what they are; an asshole.</p>
