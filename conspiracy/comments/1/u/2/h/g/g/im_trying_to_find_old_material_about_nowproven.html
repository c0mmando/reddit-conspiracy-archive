       I don't think all of these are true. I'd go through them individually the ones that I disagree with (not saying they are all false), but the website is incredibly slow and laggy. The only thing I can say towards the bottom of the list is that
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Causation != Correlation, as well as coincidences do happen
       </li>

        A scientist/elected official saying something doesn't mean its completely true, as they can be false and/or bias
       </li>
       <li>
        Off of 2, not all sources are reliable. But pick the ones that a can be backed up by credible sources, not certain fanatics

       What was that one where they were going to remote control a plane and crash it, I think it may have been to justify attacking Cuba so its a bit older.

       operation northwoods. i think if you put it to most people as a conspiracy theory they would call you crazy or even section you, unfortunately it gets put to people as a historical document.

       It also has to do with context.  So many here think that by reading one infowars article about how Syria is all just a big inside job, they are all of a sudden just as informed as people actually watching the conflict.

       personally i think crisis actors is disinfo and the fbi is lying about who did the attacks. it's tricky because it's a logical fallacy to conclude that because some conspiracy theories aren't true others aren't or the official story is true.

       There's a difference between "conspiracy" and "conspiracy theory".  A conspiracy theory is when you start with the goal (usually, govt is evil) and work backward from there, making up "facts".  Just having doubts about some event, and later finding a conspiracy caused it, is not "a conspiracy theory coming true".

       This sounds like a pretty self-serving definition to me, as it a priori rules out the possibility that people have valid reasons for proposing such theories or that they could ever be found correct.

       Umm... The NSA.

      <p>
       In the 90s people were diagnosed with personality disorders for acknowledging such taboo information.
      </p>
      <p>
       My abormal psych professor mentioned, "people that believe all these branches of government are connected and secretly trying to poison and take advantage of us are delusional and at risk for borderline personality disorder."
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned, " well before Snowden, you might've been supported, but now the NSA and its spying is a matter of public record."

       Didn't matter. My prof wanted to be ignorant and leftist. Every prof does. Bottom line, let people think whatever they'd like. They'll end like looking stupid sooner or later.

       I don't know for sure. All I know is that the capabilities are available and the laws are set in place. So, everyone 100% of the time? No, that's not happening right now. But, as I said, its legal. Just wait, the tech hasnt been sold out yet. Everything is in beta right now.

       Even better question, now that the NSA spying is a matter of public record, when are the citizens going to stop it?

       And if they are aren't, the only question we should be asking is, WTF?

       Fair enough, my point is though that most people knew the government could spy on you, and for people now to go 'I told you so!!!' Is stupid, because really it's not that big a surprise. Most people, myself included still don't think the NSA or GCHQ are looking at my spam emails.

       This sounds like a pretty self-serving definition to me, as it a priori rules out the possibility that people have valid reasons for proposing such theories or that they could ever be found correct.
