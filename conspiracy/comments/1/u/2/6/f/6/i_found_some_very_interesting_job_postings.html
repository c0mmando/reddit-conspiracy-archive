       I was pursuing the latest Snowden leaks, which are insanely fascinating to read:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading through most of them I started searching the code words out of curiosity and found this old job posting:

      <p>
       Which is basically the only reference to any of the codewords I can find. If you back up and look at their
       <em>
        current
       </em>
       job postings you will find some very interesting skillsets they are seeking.

       Not a conspiracy, just the way they look for qualified candidates. There are some creative ways they USED to find people also, before all of the IT knowledge stuff. As my old boss in Utah told me- who invited me to take the FBI test (you MUST be invited, you can't' walk into that- only invites!) one of the main parts of their test was logic puzzles. I am a big logic puzzle fan.  In fact, that is how he got to talking to me about it. To answer any possible question regarding, no I did not take the test (it was a couple hundred dollars to take the test which I did not want to pay at the time although it may have been interesting to go through just to say I've done it). The other reason I did not do the test was I was afraid to find out how badly I did on the other test parts, which I would probably fail.

       There are two FBI centres, one in VA one in Salt Lake. A lot of Mormons are FBI. Why? because they have a clean history no problems with criminal background checks, they live pretty clean All American lifestyles. Many Mormons oops "LDS" are multi lingual on account of their mission training, so they are kind of useful for FBI recruiting missions.

       Ex-Mormon here.  A lot of Mormons are also very patriotic in the stereotypical sense(maybe just my family, but in my experiences it has been the case)..  I was raised to believe murder was a sin

       I'm also an ex-Mormon. My parents both were highly patriotic, and supported George Bush during both of his candidacies. I've never met Mormons that weren't staunchly patriotic. Being Mormon alone makes you highly susceptible to propaganda, because the church and the Book of Mormon are overloaded with the shit.

       I don't believe in sin/god/heaven/hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the golden rule can be a good moral compass for just about any situation.  Do to others, only what you would want done to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think war is a horrible product of human nature.  War should be reserved for self-defense, not as a form of coercion.  Coercion is inherently wrong, so just because your country is participating in it, that doesn't make it excusable.

       I cannot speak toward the Mormon perspective but i can explain the cognitive dissonance i experienced preparing for war. In 2002 upon realizing my imminent assignment to afghanistan and considering myself Buddhist at the time initially I told my commander that I was opposed to killing and that I could not participate. After much ridicule and introspection i began to meditate on the symbol of the skull which was on flags and in paintings on the walls of our barracks. I focused on mortality and realized war was with or without me and that murder was a choice. i accepted at once that i may die and that i might have to take life to preserve my own. I went to war and armed myself the same as my peers and served as an infantryman without ever directly taking a life. I witnessed death and never avoided danger out of fear. either i was lucky or there is something to creative design.

       I thought the saying was, "what would Jesus do?", not "what would god do?".
      </p>
      <p>
       If the question was "what would god do?", people could do whatever they want because god is supposed to be infallible and anything god does is somehow morally just.
