The problem is that we have allowed those with agendas in government and the media to convince us that we&#39;re powerless. They&#39;ve confused us, distracted us and made us feel like we barely have the power to get out of bed in the morning. The truth is that every one of us has tremendous untapped strength, intelligence and resources hard-wired into us. The truth is that people can thrive in the worst imaginable circumstances. We can succeed against overwhelming odds if we are committed. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The key if for us to come together as one under a common cause of moving forward as a united species regardless of race, gender, class, status, etc.  We&#39;ve been indoctrinated by TPTB to see one another as different and separate for <em>so</em> many inconsequential reasons that we almost don&#39;t know how to come together as one anymore...yet this is <em>exactly</em> what we must do if we are to overcome the difficulties we face.  This is really the only way.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s exactly what TPTB <em>don&#39;t</em> want.  They wouldn&#39;t be able to control a mass of society all together as one against their manipulation.  This is the reason why they have split us up on so many different issues, and, although I&#39;m not advocating the Christian bible as having &quot;100% truth&quot; (far from it, actually), I am none the less reminded of Genesis 11:6 where humanity <em>was</em> indeed all one and decided to come together and build the Tower of Babel to &quot;reach up to the heavens&quot;, and &quot;God&quot; said &quot;If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.&quot; then in 11:7, this was said:  &quot;Come.  Let us go down, and there confound their language, so that they may not understand one another.&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless of the truth of falsehood of the bible&#39;s information as a historical text, the fact of the matter is that it is in SEPARATION that a people are overtaken and overcome.</p>

<p>We as a society are a nation - are a people - overtaken and overcome.  It is a very easy thing to do as it stands because, again, we have allowed ourselves and our minds to become infected by petty separatist ideologies that cause us to see one another as &quot;different&quot;.</p>

<p>Nothing can be further from the truth, and so long as we continue seeing one another as different, we will continue to fail as a society and as a civilization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I think that &quot;They&#39;ve confused us, distracted us and made us feel like we barely have the power to get out of bed in the morning.&quot; successfully. If you try to organize a force to fight them, be it a labour union or a political party, they will try to destroy your organization. This is the reason that we are de facto powerless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is all the same.  If its the effort to distract or the effort made to remove attempts to break free, it is all the same.</p>

<p>You disagree on the method but you&#39;re saying the same thing in the end.</p>

<p>You&#39;re/we&#39;re &quot;powerless&quot; because of a shit load of reasons but the real issues aren&#39;t even on radar.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real hurdle.  Most don&#39;t actually think we&#39;re under control or in their grasp.  The only issues we can see and thus the only one&#39;s we deal with are the small issues that divide us and keep us conquered.</p>

<p>We&#39;re only programmed to deal with our work/eat/sleep issues.  We&#39;re not in the business of fixing problems, we&#39;re programmed to leave that to other people who never arrive.</p>

<p>Anyway, we&#39;re all mostly on the same page here we just have to come to grips with our collective issues and stand up.  Once they know the game is up, I don&#39;t think a world of people couldn&#39;t NOT be able to resolve the issue.  </p>

<p>Just need to keep talking about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The control extends to the level of the language that we use to think about, and talk about problems. We need new thinking and new terms to express those thoughts. But, we also have to try to understand their level of control. The NSA, the FRB, the IRS, the Cripts and the Bloods, the Catholic Church and the Christian religion, pot and booze and coke are all used to control us, various people in various ways.</p>

I gave up my full time, great paying job to live a simple life. It is back breaking hard work but I wouldn&#39;t change it for the rat race. Give me 8 hours a day on the homestead over 8 hours a day at a &quot;normal&quot; job. It is a humble life but so fulfilling on so many levels.</p>
