<p><strong>Dec 16th 2011 - Dark Knight Rises viral marketing campaign</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://collider.com/the-dark-knight-rises-viral-bane-shirt-cylinder-map/">As part of a viral marketing campaign</a>, packages containing a t-shirt emblazoned with Bane’s image and bearing the motto “Fire Rises”, and a map of Gotham city were sent to various comic fans, bloggers and media.</p></li>
<li><p>The  map of Gotham detailed a number of “strike zones”, presumably a list of targets for Bane’s terrorist uprising in the film. In the South Gotham district map <a href="http://illuminatimatrix.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/batman-gotham-city-map.jpg">there is an area labeled &quot;Sandy Hook&quot;</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>As far as batman lore goes, the area in question was originally called <a href="http://static.infowars.com/2012/12/i/general/gc2_large.jpg">&quot;Tri-corner Yards&quot;</a>, and later became known as <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/South_Hinkley">South Hinkley, in Batman: Gotham Knight, which came out in 2008</a>.This area was named South Hinkley in the first movie (Batman Begins), as evidenced by <a href="http://static.infowars.com/2012/12/i/general/batmanbeginsmapstill.jpg">this screenshot at 14:41</a>, which shows <a href="http://static.infowars.com/2012/12/i/general/nolanmap_large.jpg">This map</a>, yet inexplicably, the name was changed to Sandy Hook on the props somewhere between the first, and third movie. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>July 16, 2012 - The Dark Knight Rises is released, and on July 20, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora_shooting">the Aurora Shooting takes place at a screening</a></strong> </p>

<p><strong>December 14, 2012 -The  Sandy Hook &quot;Shooting&quot;</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is where things get really strange. Youtubers quickly noticed striking similarities between the fictional Batman Sandy Hook map, with the real Sandy Hook map -  which show slight similarities in road layouts. </p></li>
<li><p>Sandy Hook school, is circled in red, on the Batman map. </p></li>

<li><p>In the film, Commissioner Gordon is also seen pointing directly at Sandy Hook school, on the map, in <a href="http://rense.com/general95/sandy2.jpg">this screenshot</a>, + a <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D-mY_foP7XM/UNnU_51s27I/AAAAAAAAC1U/ODRz3LcBTqo/s1600/sandy_hook_map_batman_tdkr_zoom.jpg">closeup of the screenshot</a></p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>So who was behind these &quot;coincidences&quot; in the films? What does it mean?</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://m.imdb.com/name/nm0004050/">Scott Getzinger</a>, is a prop master who provided props for more than 25 films, including the maps used in both the viral marketing, and film. Mr Getzinger also just so happened to live in Sandy Hook. </p></li>
<li><p>Unfortunately, nobody can ask Mr Getzinger why he added Sandy Hook to the maps in the film, <a href="http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Newtown-man-dies-in-Stamford-accident-3465225.php#ixzz2K5e6DQWihttp://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Newtown-man-dies-in-Stamford-accident-3465225.php">because he was killed in a car accident in Sandy Hook back in April 7, 2012</a>. His injuries were described by police as &quot;not life threatening&quot;, on the scene, but he later died in hospital. </p></li>
<li><p>Feb 6 2013 - In another interesting twist, Scott Getzinger&#39;s wife, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woU1XaAc8E0&amp;sns=em">Susan McGuinness Getzinger came forward regarding shady actions in the Connecticut school system, in an attempt to expose abuse</a>, stating that her husband was killed in a fatal car accident the night after she protested local corruption at a previous public hearing. </p></li>
<li><p>Her rambling, mostly incoherent speech makes it clear she believes there is a conspiracy involving the Connecticut education system, and that she is extremely suspicious about the events surrounding Sandy Hook and her husbands death. She is interrupted and asked to stop when she begins mentioning Adam Lanza. </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You walk into your PPT or Educational Hearing, they are all in on it.&quot; - Susan McGuinness Getzinger</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  3/2/2014 -  There may also be some connection to occultism. I haven&#39;t had time to try verify any of it yet, but here is a pic someone linked me - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LKYAaaK.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/LKYAaaK.jpg</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Concluding remarks:</strong> </p>

<p>Did Scott Getzinger know things about Sandy Hook that he wasn&#39;t supposed to? Did he try to tell the world by putting a hidden message in his film props? Was this part of a predictive programming psyop? Was he killed for it? We can really only speculate. </p>

<p>I think most rational people would agree that there was obviously more to Sandy Hook than the official story would lead us to believe though. The coincidences are just too numerous to be explained by chance. </p>

<p>I have a theory that the Aurora and Sandy Hook shootings <em>themselves</em> were designed with a sort of viral marketing component built in to them. The Sandy Hook map in the movie, the suspicious death of Keith Ledger, the Aurora shooter&#39;s self identification with the Joker, the very weird crisis actors. It&#39;s like crack for the web 2.0 conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the people behind the Aurora and Sandy Hook black ops are intentionally using the open mindedness and media processing/dissemination ability of the internet generation against them. Put yourself into the shoes of an intelligence operative:</p>

<p>&quot;Everytime we do a false flag, the inevitable screw ups and flaws in the MSM endorsed story get exposed due to the rapid free flow of information made possible by the internet. Is there a way that we can we turn this weakness into a strength?&quot;</p>

<p>And so what they do is embed a sort of &quot;truther&quot; trojan horse, or virus, into these events. The truther version of events becomes inextricably linked with information which is sure to go viral in the conspiracy minded demographic and yet which sound like the ravings of schizophrenics to most people:</p>

<p>&quot;James Holmes was MKUltra. The illuminati did it. They&#39;re putting predictive programming in the Batman movies.&quot; Or, &quot;The Sandy Hook parents are all actors. Why haven&#39;t we seen pictures of the dead children? It&#39;s an illuminati false flag, just like Aurora, it was even predicted in the Batman movie.&quot;</p>

<p>So in effect, TPTB control both the offical narrative <em>and</em> the &quot;truther&quot; narrative. 95% of the population is going to believe the official version, and be more inclined to view those &quot;conspiracy people&quot; as crazy and possibly dangerous (just like Lanza&#39;s crazy prepper mother).</p>

<p>BTW, I&#39;m inclined to believe most of the &quot;out there&quot; aspects of these events (i.e. Holmes was under some form of mind control, the parents were actors). I just think that things like the map in the movie and the actor parents have been added to the mix for the previously stated reasons.</p>

<p>TL;DR The unofficial versions of the Aurora and Sandy Hook shootings were viral &quot;muddy the waters&quot; campaigns.</p>

<p>Well, like a lot of these things, what&#39;s missing is a plausible reason <em>why</em> these events would occur.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would a propmaster in the film industry know about mass shooting that was going to happen six months later - even if it was as government plot?  If you&#39;re going to conspire to do something simply terrible and never be detected, surely the way to be successful is if only a tiny number of people know?</p></li>
<li><p>But let&#39;s suppose he did somehow have information.  What possible use is simply putting the name Sandy Hook on a map?  It would expose him to the maximum amount of risk - by having this in a huge movie that anyone could see - and yet gives no information that anyone could possibly use to do anything, or actual proof of anything at all.  Just putting the name, with no other information, into the movie seems designed to attract only, well, conspiracy theorists...  particularly since the guy lived in Sandy Hook, which makes for a perfectly plausible reason that he&#39;d put his home town in. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it both be more useful and safer to post more details anonymously, say from an internet café somewhere (this guy travelled a great deal for his job)?  If someone had posted to, say, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> at the time the movie came out &quot;There will be a massacre in this small town Sandy Hook&quot; this would have been near-certain proof that someone was going on!</p>

<p>It seems like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is convinced that many or most mass murders in the United States are run by the government.  </p>

<p>But that statistically makes little sense.  Sizes of murders are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf&#x27;s_law">Zipfian</a>, like almost anything else discrete (i.e. sizes of families, frequencies of word occurrences...) so there is an expected number of mass murders that would happen every year, which roughly matches the actual number of mass murders.  </p>

<p>Translated, it means America intrinsically has a lot of murderers, and varying degrees of brutality and efficiency.  It would be extremely surprising if some particularly brutal and efficient Americans, left to their own devices, weren&#39;t <em>randomly</em> committing more or less the number and sorts of mass murders that we actually see.</p>
