    <div class="md"><p>Because, the official story in some of those cases just does not work with physics, engineering, or chemistry.</p>

<p>Usually when a crime is committed you look for a mistake the criminal made.  Always listen to what people have to say.  Don&#39;t go in with a closed mind already assuming you are correct.   That doesn&#39;t mean blindly believe what you hear.   It just means don&#39;t treat any fact like an unassailable place...  you&#39;re just founding a new religion if you do that.</p>

<p>Now with that... I am not going to answer those particular things.   Do your own research, make your own INFORMED opinion.   Don&#39;t assume... that just makes you a puppet.   That doesn&#39;t mean you have to change your mind.   Just go into research with a willingness to change your mind if you are wrong.</p>

<p>Why do I say it this way?</p>

<p>Because, the way you phrased your question seems to imply that you are correct and those people MUST be wrong.   Which is definitely not a position centered in logic, or science.   It does fit well with religion though.</p>

<p>Also, if you do your own research you might find out something that I benefit from.   If I tell you what I believe, I influence you.   If you are closed minded and what I say does not fit with your beliefs then you&#39;ll just quit listening to me.   If you agree with me then we just do a circle jerk and get nowhere.   The only truly beneficial dialog for me is when I speak with someone with civility that does not agree with me and together we share information, and in some cases one of us sways to where the other was at, and in others we both are moved somewhere new that neither of us were at before.</p>

<p>Summary:  I don&#39;t learn anything from speaking only with people who agree with me, and I also do not learn anything by being closed minded and refusing to listen and debate with people that believe differently than I do.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about those three things with civility... I&#39;ll give you this starting point.
1) WTC 7 - currently the only theory that fits with that building for me (and I have looked a lot) is controlled demolition.   The evidence it was controlled demolition was plainly stated on 9/11 on the news by Larry Silverstein who owned the building.   &quot;we decided to PULL it&quot; was his comment regarding WTC 7 on nationally televised news on 9/11.   Now people can try to twist what he meant with that, but couple that with many many other engineering facts and it really currently is the only plausible explanation that fits completely with the evidence.   That doesn&#39;t mean I wouldn&#39;t love to find something else to explain it.  It&#39;d certainly be a lot more comfortable.</p>

<p>2) Plane and the Pentagon.   I&#39;ve gone back and forth on this one.  For a long time I was of this opinion.   I then saw a really good video that made me think the plane did hit it.  The guy was very convincing.   I didn&#39;t follow it for a few years and saw something this year that leaves me unsure.   I don&#39;t think the plane they claim hit it... hit it.   I do know something hit it.   I have seen no proof of what that is...   not sure.   I&#39;ve heard a lot of theories.   From a crime scene perspective... a crime was committed... they seized all the video footage from nearby businesses with cameras pointing that direction.   They eventually release 5 frames that do not show a plane, but they show the fireball.   I find it strange they confiscated the video and won&#39;t return it.   It seems that&#39;d be a really easy way to shut people up.</p>

<p>3) I don&#39;t know a lot about this.   I am a bit more open minded to it than I once was.   I will admit I have not really devoted much research on this.   Years ago I would have been more likely to think this was far fetched.   Now, I am not certain, and I try to be open minded.   I however do not know enough to debate for/against this.  I am willing to discuss it though.   I might learn something. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve seen all of those.   I think there is a lot of B.S. in Loose Change.   I don&#39;t treat documentaries like food though.   I am not saying that you do.   I don&#39;t consider a burnt part as spoiling the entire dish when it comes to documentaries.   I take each piece of information they provide and mull it over.  Some I patently disagree with.   Others seem plausible.   I do not believe in such a complex topic that any one &quot;expert&quot; will have a single and concise answer.   I don&#39;t believe in a human with such a capability.   I therefore, expect to disagree with some information and agree with others.  The difficult challenge for me is to separate the two.   I certainly have long resisted the idea that because, a person says one intelligent thing that he must be right about everything else.   Though, I think a lot of my fellow humans (again not you) do exactly this.</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t followed 9-11 truth movement videos for awhile.   I figured I&#39;d seen it all.   Then I was reading this year on here over and over people recommending one three part documentary as the best of the lot.   I finally watched that.   It was pretty well made, and I didn&#39;t really find anything that made me shout &quot;bullshit&quot;.</p>

<p>It actually addresses some of the people that challenge AE911 and such as well.</p>

<p>I think it was the &quot;September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor (2013)&quot;.  It is like 5 hours long.</p>

<p>I am a very logical person.   I am a programmer, have studied physics in high school, and college.   I tend to look for logical rather than emotional explanations.   I am fine with people speculating.   I am not fine when they pass speculation off as definitely the truth.   I use this when I watch the 9-11 truther videos, and when I watch the opposition to those.  Key... I try to keep and open mind.   It sounds like you do too.   I don&#39;t expect you to reach the same conclusions and agree with me... just to keep an open mind in everything.  Be willing to change your mind.   It seems like you likely are okay with this...    Draw your own conclusions based upon the best info you can get.</p>

<p>If you know physics, engineering, etc.   It is an eye opener when you start taking volumes of material and doing some math on some of these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sarcasm is hard to keep track of online. And even the most intelligent people have trouble with confirmation bias and discerning between correlation and causation. </p>

<p>I sort of think of this conspiracy forum as a sort of quantum computer. All things are possible, but the truth always lies upon the trajectory with the fewest logical fallacies. It is the data that dictates the truth, and false data is to be accepted as true until it is proven to contain enough logical fallacy to be discounted, and then it becomes a point of reference for disinformation techniques and/or debunking theories that contain insufficient evidence. The search for evidence of even the craziest theory often lends itself to finding other more plausible truths. </p>

<p>Truth is never so simple as black and white, right or wrong, it can be intentional or unforseen, involved but not informed. On a macro scale, individual facts and truths are not always clear and on a micro scale they can be nearly invisible. Being directly responsible for a failure doesn&#39;t mean that you aren&#39;t also indirectly innocent, and vice versa. </p>

<p>The trolls and shills are joined by the type of people who they are probably right to mock, or they mock each other... Some say that it is completely detrimental, but I like to think of it as a bit of a game. Watching what points are ruthlessly attacked without any substantial supporting information is a fun flag to find. Quashing discussions stands out pretty well, and looking for the reasons behind the distraction provides another point of data. No data is entirely useless. Because even if disinformation slows you down a bit, it does make it harder for you to not be critical of the things that you see. And that&#39;s often a good thing. </p>

<p>The best thing that any of us can do is to keep spreading the questions we find, and explaining why we are asking them. If nobody were here to find the truth, there wouldn&#39;t be systematic suppression of opinions and research. Regardless of what anyone says, sitting around and talking about what is wrong is the first step to figuring out how to fix it. When you have an intermittent failure, or a broken feature of something, it&#39;s often forgotten or worked around for so long that people will argue against fixing it. </p>

<p>We need to know what went wrong, because eventually an intermittent failure becomes a regular one, and a regular problem unaddressed eventually results in a total failure. If you don&#39;t know why something failed, you can not effectively address the flaw in a way that avoids repeating past failures. </p>

<p>TL:DR, If you approach everything with disbelief, nothing is credible, but if you can try to prove everything true until it can&#39;t possibly be, you can get on to a new theory with the benefit of increased data. Shills are possibly beneficial to the search for truth. And you can&#39;t fix what you don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>Edit : auto incorrect. </p>

<p>I almost can&#39;t even get into why this is blatantly unwise. There is so much that is covered up about so many different events, that it makes that entire sentence practically a nebulous thought akin to water dowsing. Yes, in formulaic theory, that would be true, and we could all murmur &quot;m,yes m,yes&quot;, shake hands and get on with the day - but the concept of &quot;least fallacies&quot; is predicated on least assumptions and sufficient information about the whole of events. Occam&#39;s Razor can be proven, with little effort, to be fallacious.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is things are much much much more complex than even conceptual flow charting can handle. Reality can be filtered - reality can construed to appear in such a way that it would seem very logical to follow a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. So now we are nit picking over semantics. </p>

<p>So, finding as many facts that can be confirmed, and then analyzing those facts not to confirm a conclusion but to see what is not false is a bad approach? </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say anything about a flow chart or a simple diagnostic tree. I simply advocate discussion and research. I didn&#39;t say that my particular method or interpretation of how I like to not make solid conclusions until the evidence precludes enough possibilities to do so is somehow Infallible. We are all fallible. </p>

<p>If you read the whole thing, you would have seen that I described how elusive the truth is. Your criticism is a good example of latching on to one statement, and then assuming the surrounding words are no longer applicable. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like being afraid of someone who is enjoying a meal and declares that the food is a bomb, because you weren&#39;t listening to the part where he was raving about the flavors. </p>

<p>Some of the &quot;debunkers&quot; here show up in every thread regarding their subjects (they seem to specialize) and show up pretty darn quickly too, no matter what time of day the threads are posted.</p>

<p>Lastly, they are usually not so much trying to argue a different viewpoint as to derail the existing or forming conversation. Sometimes its an attempt at debunking other times it is as simple as asking for citations for everything or chipping away at a grammatical mistake or picking something said in a long and informative comment that has nothing to do with the point and trying to make the conversation about that point alone.</p>

<p>The main point is they do not want discussion to continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, welcome to the rabbit hole. You can check out, but you can never truly leave. :-) </p>

<p>I recommend that you add science, space, chemistry, quantum physics, and declassified military technology to your reading regimen. Finding links to what is possible is impossible if you don&#39;t keep up with what is no longer impossible. </p>

<p>Also, the book &quot;Sway, the irresistible pull of irrational behavior&quot; is a fantastic read about seeing how easy it is to have an influence on public opinion and how to avoid fallacious rationalizations. It also shows how effective compartmentalization is. </p>

<p>Last, just for fun, read up about Vannevar Bush. I saw a post about the guy a few days ago, and the research is fascinating. He developed a method of locating submarines effectively by measuring disturbances in the earth&#39;s magnetic field. It only worked on a wooden ship, but it worked, in the 1940s. He also administrated the Manhattan Project in it&#39;s infancy and used presidential favors to give his scientists the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do with military resources. A pretty fascinating character overall. Essentially the father of DARPA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of people hold conspiracy in contempt for various reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is no proof! (Well yeah if the stuff we discussed here had 100% proof then it wouldn&#39;t be <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would it?)</p></li>
<li><p>So many racists! Look at the overlap with <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a>! (There is like 50 people in whiterights so if all 50 of them also post here that is 50/200,000 or much less than 1%)</p></li>
<li><p>Its breeding violent people with violent ideas (welcome to Earth, a planet full of violent people.  You can&#39;t name one movement that hasn&#39;t been tarnished by a few violent people)</p></li>
<li><p>Alex Jones is a fear monger!  (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t Alex Jones, I&#39;ve never seen an instance of overwhelming approval of AJ within conspiracy)</p></li>
<li><p>Scientific inaccuracies, science as we know it today is a really long list of observed inaccuracies.  What I mean is that we build these models to predict reality and we tend to accept the one that makes the most accurate predictions,  we also know that our models aren&#39;t 100% perfect and that they contain inaccuracies.  They are the best working models we have at this time, that doesn&#39;t mean we should stop trying to make them better.  It is also possible that we have been building a model based on previous models that &quot;had it all wrong&quot;.  For the purposes of illustration think of the terracentric universe model of the cosmos.  The earth was the center of the universe and we had all of these mathematic charts that could very accurately predict when Saturn and mars would show up, or when this constellation would show up again.  These predictions from these old models, that we now know were dead wrong, were accurate predictions.  Even though the model itself was fundamentally wrong, it was capable of making reasonably accurate predictions. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Pig headed people who were disturbed by the very slight failures of those models were constantly trying to make sense of the .002% of the time that the model failed.  Eventually we figured it out and scrapped that old model, started a new one that isn&#39;t based upon &quot;earth being the center&quot; and now we have a much higher resolution model.  Much higher resolution, but still imperfect.</p>

<p>This goes for everything,</p>

<p>Electronics, chemistry, medicine, aerodynamics, agriculture.  Things that we commonly accept as &quot;we&#39;ve figured that out already&quot; are all without question imperfectly figured out.  And as we take steps to removed the fuzz (the imperfections) we get a higher resolution understanding.  With a higher resolution of understanding, we solve problems and make breakthroughs that expand upon our capabilities.  And with a higher resolution of understanding we also find smaller more elusive fuzz, which will in time be understood.  But for now that new fuzz is just a part of our best working model.</p>

<p>Consider the main stream narrative that the earth was flat.

<p>Or consider the narrative that the government does not spy on its citizens and observes the 4th amendment.

<p>&quot;but the truth always lies upon the trajectory with the fewest logical fallacies.&quot;</p>

<p>I almost can&#39;t even get into why this is blatantly unwise. There is so much that is covered up about so many different events, that it makes that entire sentence practically a nebulous thought akin to water dowsing. Yes, in formulaic theory, that would be true, and we could all murmur &quot;m,yes m,yes&quot;, shake hands and get on with the day - but the concept of &quot;least fallacies&quot; is predicated on least assumptions and sufficient information about the whole of events. Occam&#39;s Razor can be proven, with little effort, to be fallacious.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is things are much much much more complex than even conceptual flow charting can handle. Reality can be filtered - reality can construed to appear in such a way that it would seem very logical to follow a lie.</p>

<p>Lastly, they are usually not so much trying to argue a different viewpoint as to derail the existing or forming conversation.

<p>Being downvoted is one thing, but believing being downvoted means you&#39;re telling the truth and paid shills are trying to silence you is another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve seen all of those.   I think there is a lot of B.S. in Loose Change.   I don&#39;t treat documentaries like food though.   I am not saying that you do.   I don&#39;t consider a burnt part as spoiling the entire dish when it comes to documentaries.   I take each piece of information they provide and mull it over.  Some I patently disagree with.   Others seem plausible.   I do not believe in such a complex topic that any one &quot;expert&quot; will have a single and concise answer.   I don&#39;t believe in a human with such a capability.   I therefore, expect to disagree with some information and agree with others.  The difficult challenge for me is to separate the two.   I certainly have long resisted the idea that because, a person says one intelligent thing that he must be right about everything else.   Though, I think a lot of my fellow humans (again not you) do exactly this.</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t followed 9-11 truth movement videos for awhile.   I figured I&#39;d seen it all.   Then I was reading this year on here over and over people recommending one three part documentary as the best of the lot.   I finally watched that.   It was pretty well made, and I didn&#39;t really find anything that made me shout &quot;bullshit&quot;.</p>

<p>It actually addresses some of the people that challenge AE911 and such as well.</p>

<p>I think it was the &quot;September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor (2013)&quot;.  It is like 5 hours long.</p>

<p>I am a very logical person.   I am a programmer, have studied physics in high school, and college.   I tend to look for logical rather than emotional explanations.   I am fine with people speculating.   I am not fine when they pass speculation off as definitely the truth.   I use this when I watch the 9-11 truther videos, and when I watch the opposition to those.  Key... I try to keep and open mind.   It sounds like you do too.   I don&#39;t expect you to reach the same conclusions and agree with me... just to keep an open mind in everything.  Be willing to change your mind.   It seems like you likely are okay with this...    Draw your own conclusions based upon the best info you can get.</p>

<p>If you know physics, engineering, etc.   It is an eye opener when you start taking volumes of material and doing some math on some of these things.</p>
