       Here is the post in question:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1ujpfx/here_is_what_happened_in_fallujah_in_2004_dahr/">
         Here is what happened in Fallujah in 2004 --&gt; "Dahr Jamail on what happened in Fallujah: US Military and Western Mainstream Media trying to conceal War Crimes in Fallujah (Vengeance, Blackwater Style)"
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       ps. I just noticed that the mods tagged the post as "Bullshit". Guess they didn't like what the US did in Fallujah... ooops, I mean they didn't like that the war crimes are now part of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1uibkf/here_is_what_happened_in_fallujah_in_2004_dahr/">
        here is the same post to /r/conspiracy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually feel sad about this one. I like history but will not be able to share some of my finds. Censorship is a bitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT:
       </strong>
       Just to clarify how important Dahr Jamail's reporting was. He was the only Western reporter that stayed in Fallujah after all other Western reporters got the hell out of the city when the US military told them to get out. He was the only one that had the balls to stay there and report on what he was seeing. He is the only legitimate source on what happened in Fallujah. If any of you get the chance, look into why he became a reporter and how he went about it - in short, he was living in Alaska at the time of the invasion, sold everything he had, wrote his will, and went to Iraq to report the truth. He was one of the very few Western reporters that refused to be embedded with the military. And he did all this because he couldn't live with himself if he didn't.

       They have a 20 year rule. Seeing as 2004 is only 10 years aog, it doesnt meet the 20 year rule.

       We act on anything that (a) we spot, (b) the community reports, and (c) automod catches - but that's as much as we can do.  Regrets for the inconsistencies.  After all we're only

        mod here. We don't spot all rule violations because unfortunately the MKULTRA generators that power our orbital mind reading lasers include components manufactured by child labor in countries with poor quality control, and must thus be taken down every 24 hours to be refilled with CIA-provided crack.
       </p>
       <p>
        We act on anything that (a) we spot, (b) the community reports, and (c) automod catches - but that's as much as we can do. Regrets for the inconsistencies. After all we're only alien infiltrhuman.

       I find it absolutely amazing that someone with your level of maturity is a moderator for a major subreddit.  It speaks volumes for the direction in which Reddit is heading.
      </p>
      <p>
       *It is also interesting how you managed to amass so much karma so quickly.  11k in just 3 months as a Redditor...and a mod position to boot...not bad!  It is easy to see the reason with gems like this, because clearly you deserve to occupy such an important position.
      </p>
      <p>
       **Finally, awesome use of sockpuppets.  Your karma is well deserved.

Well I don't know about the other mods and won't speak for them, but I try to tread lightly and only remove stuff that's offensive/against the rules. Content that's stupid and wrong isn't against the rules - it's just stupid and wrong, and unfortunately the community doesn't always vote it into the dumpster where it belongs.
Careful, though, we really should be discreet otherwise the J00 ROTHSCHILD ZOG BANKING CONSPIRACY WILL GET US.

"History" from 2004 is more relevant to modern day politics than anything else, which is not the focus of this subreddit. If you want to talk about Iraq and 2004, you are more than welcome to do so elsewhere, such as in
        <a href="/r/Politics">
         /r/Politics
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="/r/PoliticalDiscussion">

        <a href="/r/Consipiracy">
         /r/Consipiracy

       So according to the mods at
       <a href="/r/history">
        /r/history
       </a>
       , their defintion of "history" is something more than 10 years old, even though there's nothing spelled out in the rules about a time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, war crimes aren't history, it's more like politics lol.  Is every mainstream subreddit a joke these days?  This shit is laughable.

       Dude, did you read the freakin rules?! I am so sick of you whiney bastards coming in here and saying "Oh I got censored" because you didn't read the god damned rules!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you post something in
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       that's written in 2012, it will get deleted. Period. They want current stuff. That's what the mods want for their sub, that's what's stated in the rules, and that's how everyone is treated.
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <a href="/r/history">
        /r/history
       </a>
       , the sidebar specifically says "no blogspam" This is blogspam. The title is sensational. You could have linked to the actual video from the soldier and labelled it "An accounting of Fallujah in 2004 by a former...blah blah"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm against censorship, but dear god, follow the damn rules of the subreddit you're in. The threat you posted even citied how you had reposted this to multiple political subreddit and how your post doesn't fit into what's generally accepted in
       <a href="/r/history">
        /r/history
       </a>
       .
      </p>

       A troll? I don't think you know what that word means. As for your comments, here you go:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Just because something is on blogspot it doesn't make it blogspam.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Many posts belong on multiple subReddits. many people have multiple interests. You are wrong if you think a certain subReddit has a monopoly on a post.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3) The video that was linked was from the only Western reporter that had the balls to stay in Fallujah after the US military told everyone to get the hell out. Dahr Jamail is the only legitimate source of info for what happened in Fallujah. Now that's part of history.
       </strong>

        Edit: By the way, the The title is NOT sensational. If you followed what happened at the time of the attack and follow the links, it's exactly what took place. This was Vengeance, Blackwater Style.

       Look at how many times they get voted up.  I always use that as a gauge as to how hot of a topic someone has touched on.  It's a compliment in some regards.  Keep up the fight.

       Considering that what you posted is a load of bull shit. reporters were in fallujah the whole time the battle was going one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Civilians were told weeks in advance to leave the city. Cordoning off the city was to prevent insurgents from leaving. No snipers were shooting civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously biggest load of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no 350k people in the city. Most civilians left. Shot by US soldiers? How do they know? How do they know insurgents didn't shoot them. I hear a whole lot of accusations with no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did the civilians stay? They were told to leave. There were camps set up by the Americans/iraqi government and food and water given to them.

       White phosphorus is not illegal. Vehicle ban is because of suicide bombers.

       Well what did you expect. History is written from the victors perspective. Especially a European Imperialist (yes White Americans are  also considered European in other countries by race) perspective. The crap I was taught in a 1960 Texas school on the Hawaiian Monarchy overthrow is majority a bunch of bullshit. it took Native Hawaiian Academics spent years of research through Hawaiian language written archives to show it was bullshit, and still today some University academics won't accept such. Because it disturbs their paradigm of how the written history of the world should be. That includes also histories like trans-pacific migration by Polynesians as well. It's strictly racist and political bias.

       It's what happens when you give moderation power to those who give in to their cognitive dissonance.  (e.g. similar to debating religion)  If the information does not fit their personal world view it is far easier to censor it.

       He didn't read the rules, his article needs to be given more time until it can be looked at historically with more context. Just graduated after studying history and twenty years is the minimum before looking into something so it can fully play out.

       Yes, I agree about the rules.   Though to some degree I believe such rules can limit dialog.   They can make it easier for people to use, but I don't think the best path is always the easier one. :)

       a trend in modern thought i have noticed is to separate journalism from history, even though the line quite blurry.  but it's a way to talk about things without getting at the truth value and it serves the memory hole.  when does something become history anyways?
