       I disregard the fact that they "ran" because none of us can say what we would have done in the same position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I remember seeing a photo of one brother running without his backpack but as a professional graphic designer that is one of the easiest possible things to fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       What ACTUAL evidence ever existed between the bombing and the media/government getting onto the loudspeaker and turning them into  public enemy #1?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the public actually shown this evidence? Because I must have missed it and I was following the story like a hawk since the very beginning.

       I indulged myself in this story from the moment it began to even this present day.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolute zero evidence that can uphold the accusations made against him and ironically enough!- There is a shit load of blatant unconstitutional acts made in the chase to obtain this kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention it appeared he was shot and wounded in the back of the neck, which was once headlined as a self inflicted injury until about 3-4 days later they confessed that he was never armed with any type of weaponry.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fucking abomination to see how myopic people are to what is being done right in front of them, this kid was denied his rights- his due process- his ability to testify- everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was all a fucking hoax, a complete setup, the media put on a circus show- and everyone clinched to their seats as if they were watching real life CSI.
      </p>
      <p>
       and im not even going to get into the take down of Boston, martial law rotting the place over. Innocent families having tanks roll down their streets and having assault rifles pointed at them through their windows.
      </p>

       Yea lets not even mention that part.

       Backpack in his dorm room (which should have been destroyed at the bombing, no?), fireworks (despite his tweets of using them w friends), trips to NYC (despite pictures of he &amp; his friends doing the touristy thing) and his recent religious viewings on YouTube (despite being sexually active and an avid pothead/dealer).

       Also, the "running" you mentioned, is it really that clear cut? To stop at an ATM, then grab snacks &amp; drinks at a gas station? If I knew the FBI, DHS &amp; ATF would be looking for me, these are things I would have taken care of BEFORE. I wouldn't return to my home (w my small child &amp; wife, or the security cameras of a dorm), I would have left the state immediately and headed to Canada. And I sure as fuck wouldn't geo-locate myself on Twitter...

       If that ever happens, which I sincerely doubt it will, nobody will change their minds about it. The official narrative has already been implanted in our collective sub(un)conscious and double-think has already occurred.

       The point of this subreddit isn't to automatically assume everything the media tells us is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes we acknowledge they are a puppet and have lost all journalistic integrity, but sometimes they are just simply reporting what actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you also believe that the OKC bomber was somebody else? And the Unabomber? They seem to have taken responsibility for their actions. Maybe the Tsarnev brothers were actually what the media claims them to be.
