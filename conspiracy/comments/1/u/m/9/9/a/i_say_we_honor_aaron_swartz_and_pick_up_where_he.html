      <hr/>
      <p>
       In open-access corners of the Internet, Aaron’s fellow hackers still search for an answer: What had he planned to do with the downloaded files? Most acts of civil disobedience are done publicly, without ghost logins or hidden laptops. Aaron could have done his downloading in the open: MIT’s open-network policies at the time allowed anyone visiting campus to access services like JSTOR. That openness, coupled with the university’s celebrated history of hacker culture, could have led Aaron to think he’d be more likely to be chastised than indicted. But it doesn’t explain why he resorted to clandestine maneuvers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only Lessig, who for a short time served as Aaron’s lawyer, has said he knows for certain what Aaron’s plan was. But he’s not sharing. Instead, he has dropped coy hints. In a lecture at Harvard shortly after Aaron’s death, he floated possible scenarios. In one, Aaron was planning to release the files to third-world countries. Another theory: He planned to analyze the data to search for evidence of corrupt science, just as he had done with a legal database under Lessig’s guidance at Stanford.
      </p>
      <p>
       To Bob, the latter explanation seems more likely. “There was one conversation we had where he indicated that the goal of these documents was to do a meta analysis of them,” Bob says. “He described, similarly, looking at funding associated with the documents.”

       I have only been on reddit about 6 months and I love it. When I heard about the aaron schwartz story I was pretty blown away. I don't know how this is not a HUGE deal on this website. From what I know, he is the co-founder of reddit and was a internet badass/ hacker/ activist. He was making BIG moves for internet freedom and basically American freedom in general. He stole some documents and the government was trying to put him in prison for a very long time. He had hopes of beating the case and even asked his lover to marry him in a few months time..and then he mysteriously hung himself? Let's not forget the America we live in these days. The CIA/ FBI/ COINTELPRO is running around targeting major figures in the freedom/ liberty movement. I would love to believe that Aaron faked his death in a even more badass plan to get off the government radar. But sadly I feel like more often than not the powerful agencies with endless resources and technology get their job done. Also take into consideration how they treated Jeremy Hammond, Bradley Manning, Julian Assange. I think the government knows that these guys operate in a grey area that is not totally controlled by the government. and they don't like the fact that they can't stop these guys making moves against them. so they play dirty. then all of a sudden your car crashes into a tree and explodes. or your plane crashes. or you kill yourself. Or even if you become so powerful they will openly kill you and cover it up for a short time and then it will come out that in fact, they were killed by government agencies. I guess in 1991 Martin Luther Kings family won a court case that proved that the FBI was involved in his murder. and that the FBI had files on MLK, Malcom X, the Black Panthers who were all murdered.

       I assume it has something to do with all the other hard hitting content being removed from front page. Maybe someone at the top is deciding to take reddit in a different direction than Aaron had planned. Very sad

       He didn't even technically "steal" the documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       He downloaded them from a system that he had lawful access to.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was his purported plan to release the cache that apparently got him in trouble with the university initially, though later the university decided not to pursue any legal action. It was government prosecutors that seem to be on a hacker witch hunt who went after him.

       Idk why that got down voted. Your talking about that new internet privacy bill right? Yes those areas where people operate anonymously are slowly being compromised and soon enough you won't be able to Google something without it knowing who you are (it kinda does). Xbox live recently forced everyone to give Microsoft your real name, phone number, and email address. The same time week I logged in YouTube and it wanted my real name. Its happening pretty fast. And when you see the "this content not available in your country" just another example of the walls closing in. The internet was meant to have NO borders so everyone could communicate for free and do good things for each other. And ya hacktivists beware and I'm sure there is a intense internet war going on that is heating up

       It seems to be a bunch of ebooks and docs that Aaron had stored online. It's like reading list for an r/conspiracy member: CIA, NSA, CFR, Psyops etc. Very interesting in light of what happened to him.

       Awesome, I'll have to look at it more tomorrow, but wanted to share this:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Aaron's parents have implicated the prosecutors and MIT in Aaron's death, and I don't mean to disrespect them in this, but I'd like to speculate a little more on all of this, because I've been plagued a bit by this for days.
      </p>
      <p>
       It churns my stomach to think that part of what went into Aaron's thoughts on his death might be a media calculation -- he was so good with that sort of thing -- that his work would benefit better from his death than from his life at this point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that really does make me feel ill, literally. That part of that decision might have been coldly rational, not entirely out of depression, but actually looking at the media map of his work, how the feds were going to work to discredit him and the movement, and where the tipping point might have been -- not knowing exactly what the spin the feds might have had to control the media circus at their end.
      </p>
      <p>
       But think about the parallels on say, Tarek Mehanna (
       <a href="http://www.civilfreedoms.org/?p=11749">
        http://www.civilfreedoms.org/?p=11749
       </a>
       ) who was convicted for "material support" to terrorism for translating web pages from Arabic to English, 17.5 years of hard time, felony terrorism charges. I have no doubt that the charges against Aaron could be made to stick, much to the harm to hacker culture and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can simulate that in my head. Can y'all? Aaron thinking about the harm done to the cause he cares about if this comes to court vs. if he martyrs himself now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am in a very very dark mood myself. Not in any danger of suicide -- thanks if any are concerned -- but in the mood to organize and teach and take these people down a few pegs before more young people fall. We need to get out of our desk chairs a bit more, don't you think? Just a bit? And show that we are not so laughably easy targets, or we will be taken down like this, one by one, unless we can show that we can work the system in a way that is effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm afraid that does not mean filing internet petitions to have people removed from office. It means working social capital within the system, working with groups that have that kind of social capital already (some of our groups in DC have those "ins" like EFF, or even Tor when I was there; not so much now, CDT perhaps, some of the larger foundations have good connections). It means playing politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means doing the righteous good nonprofit side of lobbying that doesn't pay off Congress but really does educate them and petition them for redress of grievances -- work I've done on behalf of digital divide interests, and hardly anyone does any more -- you don't even hear the word "lobbyist" used that way any more although it's the original definition of the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of these things can be done
       <em>
        facilitated
       </em>
       by technology but by GOD they have to be done face to face and they need money and they require bodies willing to take risks and get out from behind the keyboard and to do those ikky things like deal with politicians and compromises and ikky people your friends think have "germs" and aren't part of the cool kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you go to parties, people will think you are too sincere about your work, make too little money, and are obviously making bad decisions, and are probably a little paranoid about life because you are dealing with all these things that involve stuff they'd just rather not hear about.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Which is, by the way, very much like what military people feel like among civilians, who they also believe they are in the business of protecting.)
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in the business of watching the watchers. Of safeguarding justice and liberties. That is what I believe. And although some of you are academics, and study this from offices where you write reports on some of us, some of us are hybrids or activists, and we are on the line, and likely to have shorter less pleasant lives. It makes for an interesting little social dynamic here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Titularly, I am supposed to be pleasant about this, because often enough, activists are petitioning the people reading this list who are not activists for support, places to publish, or grants or recommendations. But mostly these days I am retired, so I get to be a bit of the crone goddess of this list. It's a bit like having tenure in a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can seem very frustrating to those of us in the field to see so many so totally risk averse, where "support" means nothing more than to publish a blog article, signing an ineffective petition, or symbolically rsvp YES to an event with no intent to attend, or send a few dollars to MoveOn when MoveOn does very little except continue MoveOn's work of continuing MoveOn's work of continuing MoveOn's work.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when it comes to attending a meeting, taking an action that would disrupt a routine or risk a blot on an otherwise spotless permanent record, leaving a comfort zone or even a living room, or working with strangers on a project where the suffering-fools-gladly nerves might be a bit abraded -- idealism goes quickly into the crapper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people want to
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       of themselves as idealists and in favor of social change. And if someone like Anonymous tells them "Push this button on this HUD and you can change the world!" they will, without question (which scares the crap out of me). But if they have to actually work to deal with unfamiliar things and unfamiliar people and more evident risks to change the world, they quickly withdrawal, because it is outside their comfort zones.
      </p>
      <p>
       And unless we can solve that with liberation technologies -- as apparently Anonymous has, through sheer coyote duplicity -- we can't solve problems such as those that led to Aaron's suicide, or solve those that we are faced with to prevent the next one, or to continue his work effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because this is an asymmetrical war, and the liberation technologies we have do not stack up to the arsenal of government, and never have. We will always have to supplement them with people power on the ground, with politics, with human organizing. I can't see the way around that. And online means are only seducing people away from effective engagement in the real world at this point. Morosov and Putnam have us by the short hairs and we have yet to answer them effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who killed Aaron Swartz? Maybe in a way it was all of us, too. Because all of us contribute to the environment where -- if I'm right and he might have calculated his media impact -- the government could credibly destroy his work and the movement around it in the popular press around his trial, and he knew that none of us could counter it or save him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can teach people to be clever and full of tricks -- but I can teach, what, fifteen, thirty at a time at most? How deep? How long? Teaching people skills has never been well adapted to automation; ymmv. I could teach a couple in depth as shadows, padawans. Most of us are not even doing that (I'm not, now -- I don't even have funding for me, much less for me and staff or teaching).
      </p>
      <p>
       So where do we go with this? Where have intellectuals ever gone with this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't this, dare I say, a perennial problem?
      </p>

       We certainly have yet to provide an answer; perhaps because the answer is never coming. Our local community and family structures have broken down. This has broken down the social hexis on a macro level. We are not going back.

       I mean I think they're will always be reactionary movements. The Branch Davidians and such, but I fell the hexis is spinning out of control into a state of social decline not seen since the times of the scholastics.
