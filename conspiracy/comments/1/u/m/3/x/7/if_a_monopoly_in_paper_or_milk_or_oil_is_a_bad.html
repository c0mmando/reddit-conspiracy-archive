<p>Fellow Americans, they want us to believe any effort is hopeless. They WANT you to think that everyone is clueless, but there are many of us out there who know what is happening and have power to fight it. In 50 years, do you still want to have the ability to decide how to live your life? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A slight symantic adjustment: the monopoly is more on the use of force rather than law.  Anyone can make rules, and they do.  The government is unique in that it is basically defined as an entity that has a monopoly on the use of force in a geographic area.</p>

<p>But you are correct. This is a very bad thing for the reasons we see today.  That kind of power starts off limited and well intentioned, but invariably slides toward tyranny as it acts as a beacon for sociopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off I&#39;ll say that I don&#39;t agree with your premise.  American government, at least, is neither a monopoly on law, nor on money.  The US government has specific, limited powers which exist only in relation to state governments.  It must operate according to common law.  And, while it has the power to coin money, it was never granted a monopoly on this.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t really change the answer.  Because money is a commodity with a unique property: Money is information.  Money is the token by which we calculate the discount rate of the entire economy, and all the goods and services in it, in relation to all others, over time, in a decentralized manner.  It has value <em>only</em> in relation to its ability to perform this function.  And it performs this function best as a voluntary, natural monopoly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like asking &quot;why is a monopoly on roads a good thing?&quot;  It isn&#39;t, at least in the propertarian sense of any one entity <em>owning</em> all the roads.  But we don&#39;t all just make our own roads for the obvious reason that there would be no usable land remaining if we did.  So while there is one set of roads, it is no more a &quot;monopoly&quot; than any other public good.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I felt this needed to be cleared up. On one hand, it would seem that The Federal Reserve Act does, in fact, grant a monopoly to coin our moneys. They are the sole entity allowed to print our moneys. But, since our Dept. Of Treasury still reserves the right to print our own money independently from the federal reserve, it technically isnt a monopoly. </p>

<p>Thats what you were trying to say, right? (Which, when the DoT and the Fed are in collusion, as some may believe, then , all technicalities aside, wouldnt that represent a monopoly and the negativd impacts related?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t a monopoly on law or money because there are other countries you can go to.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure how having more than one set of laws in a single conutry could possibly work. Do you just choose which part of the country you want to be in? At that point why not just have two seperate countries?</p>

<p>Also, money is just a store of value and a way to barter easier. Money doesn&#39;t have to be the paper the government prints. You can make your own money as long as other people are on board. Start trading bottle caps, it&#39;s the same thing.</p>

<p>which is wrong, the theory about monopolies or the theory about governments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your theory about governments. A monopoly on law would be equivalent to having a single judge, or group of judges affiliated with the same organization (Damn, the BAR) that make their own law, independent of other branches of the government. Having other functions of the government that concern law, could still be a monopoly, but I don&#39;t see how you could call our current system of law a monopoly, not with all the different divisions of power we aspire to have.</p>

<p>Now our executive branch...there&#39;s a monopoly.</p>
