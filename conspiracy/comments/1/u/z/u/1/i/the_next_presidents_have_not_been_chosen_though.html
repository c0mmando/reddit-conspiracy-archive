       Sometimes they may prefer / anoint a certain candidate.  We need a Smiler (Obama) after the Bush family's Beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       But mostly they just let the red and blue parties pick their best guy / gal from the short list of approved candidates and watch as they fight it out in the cage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important that the candidates actually have to fight, because the parasites want the candidate that is best at manipulating the public to be the puppet that gets their cold, clammy hand shoved up his / her ass.

       Funny now that I think about it.  I hate to admit that I once heard Rush Limbaugh on the radio, but supposing I did... he once referred to the parties as "The Evil Party" (in power) and "The Insane Party" (out of power).

       Because they can easily make it a fluff campaign about having the first woman president, now that the ice has been broken so to speak by Obama. The republican party still has a poor image in the eyes of the mainstream, so it's highly unlikely they will win 2016. Chris Christie, if he was intending to make a bid for the presidency, probably doesn't stand a chance against Clinton now. I wouldn't be surprised if the emails that implicated his staff in the "scandal" were leaked by someone in Clinton's staff. 
If WWIII breaks out during her term, I think the presidency will flip back to the republicans in 2020. Maybe then George P. Bush, like others were predicting.
