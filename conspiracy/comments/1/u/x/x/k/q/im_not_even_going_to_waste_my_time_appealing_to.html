       removed the Fallujah story as well, as it was deemed opinion/analysis. Yet isn't the current situation in Iraq newsworthy? We're supposed to swallow anything coming from some servile pundit, but let's stifle the dissenting opinion, the one who diverges from the mainstream. Although he offers a pertinent perceptive, having been there as a U.S. soldier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that strays to much from what's conventionally accepted as a holy truth, or is too disturbing to the dominant narrative is generally
left by the wayside. Or in these cases, "shadow" removed from the queue. No courtesy message from the mods, no justification for the first two subreddits mentioned.
      </p>

       But hey, you know what's newsworthy for
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       , some cooky Canadian ex-politician spouting some nonsense about aliens, which is on the frontage of the sub right now.

       I said it before, Reddit is not the same Reddit we knew when it was established. I've stopped reading most subs and most of the post. Notice how titles are more vulgar, sometimes misspelt, or even "Reddit you'll like this" type of posts? It's gone from realistic discussion to people thinking invisible points are worth it all.

       If it were up to me, I wouldn't let me website keep track of how many votes your post got. Id let people vote of course, but I wouldn't keep "karma" count.

       Not just are titles more vulgar, etc...we're supposed to believe that the average post is just a random Redditor like you or me getting a successful post, when so many of the successful posts (especially if they're political at all) are clearly written with editorialized, marketed titles...

       editorialized?  The most popular posts are stupid memes about stupidity.  In fact, if there is a trend in all subs, it's memes rather than content.  And the content that isn't is usually the same content reposted with a different article.  I don't know how many times you can post the same exact content about McDonald's stupid website, but every week some blogger finds yet another "outrage" about how out of touch the same webpage is, rage posts, and gets posted to reddit.  First the budget, then the au pairs, then the "don't eat fast food" page.  So effing what, the web page
       <em>
        sucks
       </em>
       , it sucked the last 5 times you posted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the titles of the posts, my understanding is that you have to post the title of the article you posted, not whatever you want.

      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, creating a new sub-reddit will simply result in the same subversion and corruption.  As long as there are enough eyeballs on a particular sub, there's going to be infiltration to change the dialog to suit particular interests. The idea I've been discussing with a few other redditors is to disallow deletion of links, but rather to let the moderators hiding poor content.  If users don't like a particular moderators actions, they could "subscribe" to different mods to filter/hide the poor content.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still trying to find the appropriate way to contact the reddit developers so that I can float the idea.  I've posted to
       <a href="/r/request">
        /r/request

       The Reddit devs won't try to fix this.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are intentionally leaving in the "bug" (feature) that makes downvotes early on in a post's lifetime super-downvote it erroneously, precisely because it makes it easy for propaganda bots to control what gets to the front page of major subreddits. Thus I am dubious they will try to fix these issues in other ways either.

       reddit is fine.  The majority of people don't give a fuck about freedom of information, or propaganda.  Look at the top ten subs, gaming, funny, adviceanimals, etc.  People come here to goof off, not to get informed.

       That's pretty much the conspiratard folks.  They troll until something they cannot possibly refute comes along, then they break out the sockpuppets.  Voting patterns are then turned upside down.

       As a conservative estimate, I'd say 80, maybe 85 percent of reddit's moderators are shills for the Zionists, as are all the admins.

       editorialized?  The most popular posts are stupid memes about stupidity.  In fact, if there is a trend in all subs, it's memes rather than content.  And the content that isn't is usually the same content reposted with a different article.  I don't know how many times you can post the same exact content about McDonald's stupid website, but every week some blogger finds yet another "outrage" about how out of touch the same webpage is, rage posts, and gets posted to reddit.  First the budget, then the au pairs, then the "don't eat fast food" page.  So effing what, the web page
       <em>
        sucks
       </em>
       , it sucked the last 5 times you posted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the titles of the posts, my understanding is that you have to post the title of the article you posted, not whatever you want.

       I would think it is obvious to
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       that the site is gamed when you see lots of users with comment karma of zero and a link karma of 19,824. Yet no one seems to have problems with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they cannot see a problem with that, then the bots and brigades will not reach them.
