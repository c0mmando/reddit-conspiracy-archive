Yet isn&#39;t the current situation in Iraq newsworthy? We&#39;re supposed to swallow anything coming from some servile pundit, but let&#39;s stifle the dissenting opinion, the one who diverges from the mainstream. Although he offers a pertinent perceptive, having been there as a U.S. soldier.</p>

<p>Anything that strays to much from what&#39;s conventionally accepted as a holy truth, or is too disturbing to the dominant narrative is generally
left by the wayside. Or in these cases, &quot;shadow&quot; removed from the queue. No courtesy message from the mods, no justification for the first two subreddits mentioned. </p>

<p>But hey, you know what&#39;s newsworthy for <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, some cooky Canadian ex-politician spouting some nonsense about aliens, which is on the frontage of the sub right now.</p>

It&#39;s gone from realistic discussion to people thinking invisible points are worth it all.</p>

Don&#39;t pay to much attention to the link itself, read the comments and my suggestion that reddit change the moderators ability to delete content.  </p>

<p>Basically, creating a new sub-reddit will simply result in the same subversion and corruption.  As long as there are enough eyeballs on a particular sub, there&#39;s going to be infiltration to change the dialog to suit particular interests. The idea I&#39;ve been discussing with a few other redditors is to disallow deletion of links, but rather to let the moderators hiding poor content.  If users don&#39;t like a particular moderators actions, they could &quot;subscribe&quot; to different mods to filter/hide the poor content. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to find the appropriate way to contact the reddit developers so that I can float the idea.  I&#39;ve posted to <a href="/r/request">/r/request</a>, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the place to request changes to reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Reddit devs won&#39;t try to fix this. </p>

<p>They are intentionally leaving in the &quot;bug&quot; (feature) that makes downvotes early on in a post&#39;s lifetime super-downvote it erroneously, precisely because it makes it easy for propaganda bots to control what gets to the front page of major subreddits. Thus I am dubious they will try to fix these issues in other ways either.</p>
