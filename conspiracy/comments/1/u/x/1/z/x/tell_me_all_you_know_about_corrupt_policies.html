<p>Disney plays a big part in the corruption of society by starting with the youth and &quot;getting them while they&#39;re young&quot;</p>

<p>Disney still tries to spread thier <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/gravity-falls-a-new-disney-tv-show-loaded-with-illuminati-symbolism/">luciferian agenda</a> to this day.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one can notice them, take the roger rabbit example,. its literally half a second long, if that.  You wont see it watching normally. Its a message sent to the sub conscious, which see&#39;s all. </p>

<p>The second you opened this page your sub con. read it entirely forward and backwards in a split second. </p>

<p>The intentions for those clips are obvious, to corrupt society, not to entertain adults.  </p>

<p>Being bombarded by these constant subliminal images gets kids pre occupied with sex. </p>

<p>Lets look at reality as a proven example here, how many teens were sexualy active 30, 40 years ago?  and today, the number of sexually active <strong>Pre</strong> teens is disheartening.  </p>

<p>Its not just disney mind you, its the msm at large.  mtv&#39;s teen mom comes to mind. 14, 15 yr olds trying to get pregnant just to be on tv??  </p>

<p>Young ones are just surrounded with this filth in tv, magazines, radio, movies.</p>

<p>One&#39;s really best turning off the tv all together, especially if there are children in the home. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>a more likely explanation for fleeting second innuendos is bored animators. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A cartoon is like a music video, its made in a highly controlled enviorment.  for every second of cartoon you watch 24 or so individual images. They are drawn and then chained together an average of 24 fps.  </p>

<p>Everything in them is 100% intentional.  </p>

<p>The &quot;bored animator&quot; is one of about 20-40 people who checks and approves said screen before it goes main stream</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for lack of a better term, Easter eggs in content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you consider <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eT1QFmQpfGA/Ti6LNJC_6DI/AAAAAAAAAyU/X30-JAe2grU/s1600/Dora_sexplorer.jpg">this</a> an easter egg?  The word sex displayed to a 3-5 yr old?  </p>

<p>The subliminals in the rock btw. </p>

<p>You can call em easter eggs, i prefer the word Agenda. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Video games are loaded with them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, pretty much all sources of main stream content has some message trying to reach the sub consious. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also what would be the point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thought i already explained that?  to corrupt society and a corrupt one is easier to control</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not like they hide much anyway. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;d be surprised just how much is hidden, <a href="http://subliminalmanipulation.blogspot.com/2010/09/odd-usages-or-get-em-while-theyre-young.html">this page</a> alone has several dozen examples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You did quite well just spouting off nonsense like an insider but the guy is right. Bored animators. Not some vast conspiracy ffs.</p>

<p>As for the how many kids were interested in sex 30 40 years ago.... disney was as popular then as it is now ! Maybe its SOME people in the biz that throw in some pedo shit but its not a vast world domination type deal.</p>

<p>Someone pushing an agenda while i&#39;m simply trying to get people to open thier eyes and see whats literally in front of them. </p>

<p>what does your comment add besides biased denials?</p>

<p>i see no links, no proofs to any of your claims?</p>

<p>anyway... (feeding the trolls)  how is any of it a conspiracy?  is it not a fact these drawings are in existance?  all of them are easily verifiable.  where is the line between conspiracy and fact, when&#39;s it begin and end?</p>

<p>yes, ik disney was just as popular 40 years ago, but tv&#39;s werent, every home didnt have 5 tv&#39;s back then.  the indoctrination wasnt in every room, accessable to every man, woman and child. </p>

<p>Walt himself was a pedo,go read some books and educate yourself instead of running in giving nothing more then your opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know &quot;luciferian agenda&quot; drags the entire argument down, but it is the root problem.  The devil rebeling against god and trying to take as many with him when he goes to hell.</p>

<p>&quot;Gay agenda&quot;, the &quot;evil muslim&quot;, w/e.  If its main stream, you don&#39;t have to look hard to see it goes against the Abrahamic teachings. </p>

<p>So much spiel you see on tv is specifically meant to go against the Abrahamic faiths.  Disney (clearly a <a href="http://www.trickedbythelight.com/tbtl/images/disney-666.jpg">satanic organazation</a>) disrupts society by going against Christianity, Islam and Judaism.  </p>

<p>The conclusive evidence is in thier content. </p>

<p>But if you want to leave &quot;God&quot; out of it, even when its the purpose for the Zionist / Luciferian movement... </p>

<p>People benefiting from exposing 3-10 yr olds to sex, pre-marital sex?....  I dont think i can take religion out of this and give you an answer. </p>

<p>I mean its the root problem.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll bite...</p>

<p>You use derogatory language for homosexuals.  Bigot.</p>

<p>You chastise others for associating with homosexuals by calling them &quot;dyke lovers&quot;.  Bigot.</p>

<p>You suggest that homosexuality is morally wrong.  Bigot.</p>

<p>You are admittedly homophobic towards someone who is assumed to be a lesbian.  Bigot.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you are noticeably unintelligent. Your writing style is rife with typos.  Your views on religion are maddeningly simple-minded.  Your analytical skills are insufficient when engaging in debate.  </p>

<p>You will disagree with my last four claims, but I hope that you will at least internalize them on a subconscious level.  You need to expand your mind and challenge your antiquated morality.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;d like to have a little fun with you.  Because I&#39;m bored, and I have nothing better to do.  When you die, you will be banished to oblivion.  When you die, there is no part of your consciousness that survives.  You hang onto your chosen religion because you are in denial of this fact.  Faith is the equivalent to fairy tales for adults who are afraid to face their own annihilation.  Which is cool, I guess.  But when your fabricated defense mechanism discriminates against other humans for characteristics beyond their control, you lose humanity.  Your mental constructs are obscuring reality.  Open your eyes, and then go fuck yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should hope you would think twice before spouting bullshit...</p>

<p>Maybe you should look at the definition of <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot">bigot</a> and try to understand that the comments that both of us presented are accurately described as bigoted.  On the one hand you claim that you are not a bigot, and on the other, you single out Hillary Clinton&#39;s sexuality as a reason to hate her.  You also provide evidence for how your religion (as well as Christianity) consider homosexuality to be abhorrent.  Textbook bigotry.  </p>

<p>It should also be mentioned that my criticism of archaic religions, although valid, can be described as bigotry.  Religions are corrosive to society, and they actually serve purposes that are contrary to the ideals of contributing to humanity.</p>

<p>I just figured you were a troll because the original evidence you provided appears to be clearly an attempt at derailing any legitimate conversation on the flaws of Disney Corp.  Your worldview is so naive and seemingly artificial that I figured that you were just operating as a sock puppet account.  You have basically only commented in TWO subreddits, and your choice of which are an interesting juxtaposition.  You are very active, and I still haven&#39;t ruled out the thought that you are trying to steer popular opinion.  Trolls often feign stupidity and they adhere to particular personality indicators.  When I mentioned your typos, they became more prolific.  You need to try harder.  I&#39;d lilke to see how you function in your other accounts.  </p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the entertainment.  I&#39;ll get back to legitimate investigation of real world problems. </p>

<p>They were once in trouble for an employee complaining about &quot;company provided underwear that was already used&quot;.  </p>

<p>There is a bar towards the entrance called &quot;Club 33&quot; possibly a reference to freemasonry.  </p>

<p>They are actually their own country. They have different laws and no minimum wage.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one can notice them, take the roger rabbit example,. its literally half a second long, if that.  You wont see it watching normally. Its a message sent to the sub conscious, which see&#39;s all. </p>

<p>The intentions for those clips are obvious, to corrupt society, not to entertain adults.  </p>

<p>Being bombarded by these constant subliminal images gets kids pre occupied with sex. </p>

<p>Lets look at reality as a proven example here, how many teens were sexualy active 30, 40 years ago?  and today, the number of sexually active <strong>Pre</strong> teens is disheartening.  </p>

<p>Its not just disney mind you, its the msm at large.  mtv&#39;s teen mom comes to mind. 14, 15 yr olds trying to get pregnant just to be on tv??  </p>

<p>Young ones are just surrounded with this filth in tv, magazines, radio, movies.</p>

<p>One&#39;s really best turning off the tv all together, especially if there are children in the home. </p>
