       I admit I don't know much about Agent Orange or depleted uranium in Iraq, though I've certainly heard both mentioned as serious health concerns.  As for PTSD, I don't know that its existence provides clear reason to distrust the government, unless we're saying that the government knowingly sent men and women to a place where they would fall victim to PTSD merely for the sake of conquering oil, making money, etc.

       You don't really think the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are good causes right? Or Vietnam?  Either you were duped by patriotism and "being heroic" or drafted (which is far more excusable).

      <p>
       Sorry,  I don't bow down and worship soldiers. When you come on here wanting me to summarize shady history done by the govt I can question your motives.  Did you like invading a foreign land, terrorizing a 3rd world and making corporations richer?  Was the paycheck worth being the bad guy?

       It was easier for me to believe the war in Iraq was designed to free an oppressed people from an evil ruler
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       last week's report that Fallujah had fallen to the bad guys again.  While deployed to Fallujah, I typically concluded that despite my lack of understanding of the big picture, I could at the very least ensure that my interaction with the people there demonstrated a level of professionalism that they should expect from an American Marine.  In that, I believe I was successful.  But in spreading freedom . . . mmm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to look back and determine a commander's intent or a grand purpose to our many, many patrols, I struggle with what we did and did not do.  Certainly, we helped some people get on their feet or stay on their feet.  We gave out lots of candy, soccer balls, and money.  We, as a platoon, generally sought to do the right thing, even if it was out of our way.  But ultimately, we were not successful in liberating those people.  They are not free now.  They do not know freedom as I do.  Retrospectively, I see the the only clear win was made financially for companies like Halliburton and other war contractors.  That cannot be denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the war existed for good reason at the macro level.  However, at the micro level, I know of many officers and enlisted men who devoted themselves to leaving their area of operations (AO) better than they received it.  But in the grand scheme of things, what it was worth; I'm not sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't ask to be glorified or worshiped.  If the 'thank yous' and veteran benefits stopped tomorrow, I hope I would remain grateful for the lessons I learned and the men I met.  To address your question: we (my squad) did not terrorize the people of Fallujah.  I'm sure there were a few instances in which we could have been more tactful, but we would not have been invited into peoples' homes if they thought our only motive to be driven by money.  How it is possible for so many men to individually seek to do good while collectively achieving so little of worth, I don't know how to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, I will admit:  I joined the Marine Corps believing it to be America's most elite fighting force designed to defend and support the Constitution, devoted to moral justice, and committed to developing integrity within its members.  I don't believe I was duped in that.  I do question whether or not we, as Marines, were sometimes led in the wrong direction in search of our grand adventures.  I wonder if someone, or several someones, took advantage of our willingness to do anything if we believed it to be of noble cause.  When I was told someone was a bad guy, were they really?  Or was I led to believe something in order to carry out someone's agenda?  If my local police department was briefed this morning on a former Marine living in the area who is believed to have anti-American interests, a proficiency with firearms, and a willingness to defend himself, how might they approach my door?  Are these lies, or mild distortions of the truth generated in order to achieve someone's goal of what they believe will benefit the most?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have too many questions.  Perhaps I'll invest some time today in seeking out the answers, that I might be a resource for the next man with the same questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For now, please note the difference between a soldier and a Marine.  And have a nice day.

       That was well written.  Now that I know your intent I want to bless you on your journey to seeking the truth.  A lot of people are very closed minded and come on this sub and "troll" and I don't think that you are one of them.  I'm sorry I was kind of mean. Its no excuse, but I am not really angry at you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The initial shock of waking up to the truths that you'll fine are going to be very tough to take.  Say some prayers to whatever God you believe in, or meditate and go slow.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time,  I was so happy to hear that iraq had fallen, I was happy they caught saddam.  After 9/11 I was flying a small flag on my car antenna.  Today, I look back and realize I was caught up in a marketing campaign.  During this time I felt like a coward and guilty I wasn't enlisted.  Now, I'm thankful that I didn't.  I don't think I would have woke up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want, I can answer specific questions you have that I may know.Its really tough to just summarize everything, because it really is overwhelming and that's not the best way for you to find out. Iraq,  unfortunately isn't even a huge piece of the puzzle.   The rulers of the world (yes, they exist) have been playing chess with wars probably since time existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can give you specific references or at least try to on a lot topics, if not, take care.

       I am not trying to avoid doing the necessary research.  I only meant to see what those who had already done the research were capable of.  Could the seemingly crazy claims be defended and demonstrated?  Can it be concisely explained in a compelling way?
      </p>
      <p>
       My interest in the realm of conspiracies and secret agendas is recent, but it is affecting important decisions in my life.  So, before I tell the recruiter that my distrust for the government is making me question whether or not I want to return to the military, and before I get into a conversation with a friend that touches on an uncomfortable truth, I would like to have seen someone make a clear and concise case for what many would quickly write off as lunacy.  Because I want to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I must set that example, or seek it elsewhere, so be it.

       Its not my argument. I'm past the stage of going out of my way to write lengthy explanations when Google does the trick.   You either want to know the truth or you want to have someone try to sway you. When I first started researching I tried explaining and swaying for two years.  Now, I'll jot off a few clues here and there and if you want, you can take your own time researching.

       Wiki bilderberg. I hope you find it suspicious that a group of royals, elitists, and decision makers all get together to make their agenda.   I didn't read your post above.  I didn't know you were questioning your enlistment before I ranted on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres just a lot of info to just summarize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heres what started me down the rabbit hole.  Pick something you are suspicious about,  follow that lead. Mine started with the Bush admin trying to tie 9/11 with Iraq.  I then stumbled upon the 9/11 conspiracy, and govt papers(operation northwoods) detailing their agenda.   Then I got on the who did it, what do they want for the world and what spiritual beliefs do they tend to study.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throw in a bunch of researching other conspiratorial events that changed the world,  more religious and spiritual research and that's where I'm at now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it went in a major physical and mental cycle for me as well Started out depressing and trying to wake up everyone.  Gained a lot of weight. 5'7 over 200lbs   Got to the spiritual growth of the conspiracy and now I feel younger,  healthier(down to 165 lbs) and more confident than in my whole life.
      </p>

       What would be a specific example of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I'm not trying to turn this into debate class.  That said:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the claim is, 'don't trust the government because they are not protecting the constitution,' what evidence do you have to support this claim?  And why does it matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: seriously folks?  I'm not an up vote addict, but isn't it possible that someone might ask these questions and try to challenge your claims because he genuinely wants to be overwhelmed by compelling evidence?  Or do we avoid kicking our tires, less they should feel offended?

       MKUltra-
       <strong>
        non-consensual mind control experiments on US citizens
       </strong>
       by hundreds of doctors in conjunction with the CIA. The first head of the APA tortured kids, so badly, for months at a time, that they could no longer recognize their parents. Some became invalids, couldn't use the bathroom on their own.
       <strong>
        Some became permanently comatose
       </strong>
       .

       Navy documents as recent as 2006 discuss approval authority for by passing consent for experiments involving "severe and unusual physical and psychological intrusions such as consciousness altering drugs and mind control..."
      </p>

       CIA veterans have come forward and said that MKUltra never really ceased but only went further underground and began using different acronyms.

       'The government' is just people. There's nothing magical about having your paycheck signed by the state that makes you any less venal than anybody else. I no more trust that Uncle Sam cares deeply about me and only wants me to be happy than I trust that McDonald's is only concerned that I might be hungry or Coca-Cola that I might be thirsty or GM that I might need a ride to work in the morning.

       Not everybody in government is bad - government isn't some evil conspiracy - but certainly some of them are bad and plenty more are well-intentioned nincompoops who don't grasp the law of unintended consequences.

       That's why you have arguments over strategy and tactics and an unfortunate tendency to ascribe bad-faith motives to your opponents. "Let's help the poor by printing up tons of money and hiring people to drive around poor neighborhoods throwing $100 bills out the window." "That's a bad idea." "You're an evil bastard who wants poor people to starve to death."
      </p>
      <p>
       But sooner or later, you wind up with programs that some people are going to argue is not much better than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democracy, as they say, is the second-worst form of government - second only to all the others. I look at it this way: You and I are lost in the woods and looking for a way out. I argue that we should walk 3 miles East while you argue that we should walk 2 miles West so we compromise and walk 2 1/2 miles North. When we wind up still lost, we call each other idiots and blame each other for still being lost. And then we argue over which direction we should go, compromise on our arguments and trudge off yet again to find a solution to our problem in a direction neither one of us thinks is the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why government can't be trusted - not because it's evil but because it's stupid.

       Obama asserted countless times on the campaign trail that his first act upon becoming president would be to close down Gitmo. His very first act. He became president five years ago. Gitmo is still open.

       Understood.  But do the powers that be, to include our governing body, have malicious intent?  And if so, how do you know?  How do you prove it so as not to sound like another wack-job claiming that men in suits are looking for you?

       Its not my argument. I'm past the stage of going out of my way to write lengthy explanations when Google does the trick.   You either want to know the truth or you want to have someone try to sway you. When I first started researching I tried explaining and swaying for two years.  Now, I'll jot off a few clues here and there and if you want, you can take your own time researching.
