       If Saudi is responsible indeed then its a no brainer that they did not act alone. Im starting to think the CIA or mossad or any of those criminal bastards must have high ranking members in jihadists organizations.

        "According to a number of articles, Prince Bandar, allegedly confronted Vladimir Putin in a bid to break the deadlock over Syria. This included security of winter olympics in Sochi if there is no accord. “I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,” he allegedly said. Putin then rejected the proposal furiously by saying "we know that you have supported the Chechen terrorist groups for a decade. And that support, which you have frankly talked about just now, is completely incompatible with the common objectives of fighting global terrorism that you mentioned."

       Prince Bandar has been in this game a long time.

        September 1990 -- Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y) sets up the Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf to lobby for war against Iraq with support from conservatives and some hawkish Democratic activists, along with Saudi ambassador to the U.S. Prince Bandar. A supporter, neoconservative Richard Perle, reportedly raises most of the group’s funding from defense contractors and a right-wing foundation. Bandar attracts support from several Jewish organizations by telling them that if Saddam Hussein were eliminated other governments in the region would deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict on more “pragmatic terms."

       If there are 19 terrorist highjackers from saudi arabia on 9/11 then its obivous that we have to go to war with afghanistan.  The only reason we wont go to war is because they buy our debt and give us oil.  Also these so called terrorists are CIA ops created and trained in the 80s

       Did you even read the article? The title is misleading. There were no threats explicitly made. They just inferred they would be safe if they stopped blocking Syria and made a deal. But "threatening to deploy terrorists" is a gross over exaggeration of what their diplomats said. No one is bombing anyone with the governments help. But of course if there is an attack this subreddit will down vote and burn at the stake anyone who says that the attackers had no government affiliation.

       If this statement is true and accurate, which I 'll try to verify later on today, it's kinda obvious what he meant. Saudi gov has sent hundreds or perhaps thousands of extremists to Syria

       , I dont know many details but its a fact that they have. The question is, do they control their actions? it'd be pretty messed up if they did, possible saudi evolvement in 9/11 have come to light recently though

       It is the same as a country saying they will never, ever suffer any terrorist attack. The only way they can keep that claim is if they control everyone. Everyone.

       You literally just made the same leap that the guy posting the article made. That may be implicit in the statement, but you cannot say for certain that "Saudi Arabia has sent thousand of extremist/militant Islamists" in to terrorize Russia. They haven't even threatened to. I'd call their bluff if I was Russia actually. I'd bet that Saudi Arabia doesn't do that and I wouldn't let them essentially blackmail them into making a decision on Syria because of implicit threats of terrorism

       You countered my argument (that the Saudi government doesn't sponsor widespread terrorism) by making the claim that 911 hijackers were Saudi. In other words, saying they do sponsor terrorism by citing 911 as your evidence.

       Also there is an innate difference in the nature of a "guarantee of safety" when made between a us citizen and a federal agents and two sovereign nations. The Us "guarantees the safety" of many of it's allies and if it wanted to it could use that exact phrasing in the diplomatic community and there would be no repercussions.

       No brainer?  Maybe look into Saudi politics a bit harder.  The guy currently running their GID (imagine the CIA but truly accountable to no one but the president himself) has been playing James Bond since he was like 18.  The Saudis have done dramatically more than the CIA in Syria and have a much greater motivation to do so (denying Iran an Arab proxy).

       CIA would require a presidential directive to do something like that and basically every Chechen group operating in that region are on the Foreign Terrorist Organizations List.  Mossad....really?  Are we sure it wasn't also shape shifting reptilians working with the Finnish secret police?

        No brainer? Maybe look into Saudi politics a bit harder. The guy currently running their GID (imagine the CIA but truly accountable to no one but the president himself) has been playing James Bond since he was like 18. The Saudis have done dramatically more than the CIA in Syria and have a much greater motivation to do so (denying Iran an Arab proxy).

        CIA would require a presidential directive to do something like that and basically every Chechen group operating in that region are on the Foreign Terrorist Organizations List. Mossad....really? Are we sure it wasn't also shape shifting reptilians working with the Finnish secret police?

       Well, the FBI in the US does it bit.ly/1dklBu7 ..... I dont know if you've heard but one time an FBI agent infiltrated a muslim community to "recruit jihadists" and the muslims actually reported him to the FBI LoL
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad is the only foreign agency in the world that gets all the intelligence data it wants from the CIA/NSA according to recent Snowden  leaks. Including citizens emails, phone conversations and messages, tons of information. So nothing about the Mossad would surprise me now really.

       You're assessment is absolutely correct.  The Saudis and The Agency are tight.

       Saudi Arabia had the first outsourced American defense training contract for training their Intelligence forces and Royal Guard
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the educational background of the leaders of the GIP-
      </p>
      <p>
       Turki bin Faisal Al Saud.  Abruptly resigned from head of GIP on 9/1/11.  Schooled at Georgetown (Same class as Bill Clinton)
      </p>
      <p>
       Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz Al Saud:  Made head of Saudi Intelligence 
on September 1, 2001.  Schooled at Georgetown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud: Head of GIP from 2005-1012.  Schooled at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas
      </p>
      <p>
       Faisal bin Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Saud: Current head of the GIP.  trained at Maxwell Airforce Base and schooled at Johns Hopkins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saudi Arabia has played an important role in the West's geostrategy.  That strategy no only includes enabling our own access to energy resources, but disrupting the access of competitors. There is an element of the Intelligence and Defense communities in the US, UK, Israel and Saudi Arabia which has been using Sunni extremists for strategic warfare against Russian (and chinese) interests.  We've seen it in afghanistan, iraq, libya, sudan, somalia, etc, and we'll likely see more in Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Yemen and Russia itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       AQAP is a bit of a frankenstein monster.  They fight our enemies/russia's allies (The Shiite /hezbollah/hamas countries), and reak havok in places that we want destabalized.  They also fight Western interests, but frankly that helps justify large defense expenditures.  If I were a global asset management company with divested interests in defense contractors, large industrial construction and energy companies, I'd probably find that win win.

       You know Ive noticed this in Latin America. Nearly all US gov puppet south american presidents that I can think of, have degrees from the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 main US gov puppet presidents in South America, all of them graduated in the US
Pinera (Chile) - check
Santos (Colombia) - check
Cartes (Paraguay) - check
      </p>
      <p>
       And the socialist presidents considered a "threat" by obama (banks) from the other countries none of them graduated in the US except for Ecuador's president who happens to be like a 21st century Diplomatic Che Guevara who studied in many countries including the US.
      </p>

       Uruguay Nop
Argentina Nop
Brazil Nop

       The president who stole my country's money (Ecuador) in 1999 was a Harvard graduate and is currently a fugitive wanted in Ecuador and he's currently teaching at Harvard. Messed up aint it?

       yes, Ive read about that. Called "School of the Americas", I think one guy, forgot his name ended up blowing up a plane with 300 people.

       this guy. He worked for the CIA, FBI and went to School of the Americas. He commited several terrorist attacks and was on CIA payroll. He actually killed 73 people on the plane attack. He's currently living comfortably in the city of Miami.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which reminds of that declassified CIA document where they said they were planning to blow up a plane full of civilians to then blame it on Castro so they had a pretext to invade and blow Cuba up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damn, imagine if everyone in the US knew all this stuff. CIA is possibly the most evil and successful terrorist organization in human history.

       I disagree man, killing who knows how many thousands or even millions? of people is evil imo, specially when it's for Corporate interests.

      <p>
       All those coupes, killings and massive spying for that one reason only, to make a handful of oligarchs a bit richer.

       edit: Millions for sure, it was us intelligence (CIA) who lied about the chemical weapons in Iraq. Killings and deaths by desease/poverty are easily over 1 million just in Iraq.

       I have and I have also read books about NSA.  The UK and Australia get the same level of access based on intelligence sharing agreements.  All that being said I would advise you to look into who provides the hardware for this kind of stuff.  Long before Snowden guys like James Bamford were writing about the Israeli companies with intel connections selling the hardware to NSA.  Google a company called "narus" if you want some further reading.

       "Unconfirmed media reports claimed in August that Riyadh had offered Moscow arms deals worth $15 billion and guarantees of safety from Islamist attacks during the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi in exchange for Russia not blocking an international military operation against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad."

       Of course it's not a coincidence, whoever is responsible is almost certainly doing it because of the proximity to the Olympics. But that doesn't get you very far in working out who is responsible and why they are doing it.

       Again, do some research.  Islamic terrorism as we know it today was largely seeded by the Russians (Soviets) because of the cold war.  Many of the Arab and Islamic heads of state (Assad, Gaddafi, Saddam and Sadat off the top of my head) have the Soviets to thank for either getting them into power or building their militaries up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what Jihadist does the US back?  I know pressTV likes to tell you that all the Syrian rebels are actually CIA and Mossad but in reality the same guys fighting CIA paramilitaries in Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen are the ones leading the jihad in Syria.  You might also want to catch up on Syrian news since the US never supplied jihadis and has recently even cut lethal aide to secular groups it likes.

       I dont know who or what pressTV is but I have to disagree on your statement. I'm pretty sure though I have no facts that "intelligence" agencies started the syrian war. Knowing all the coups and illegal invasions they are responsible for, it's really a no brainer IMO. All non "allies" (puppets) ME countries were already destroyed and robbed before Syria, the only ones left were Syria and Iran. I hope they don't do the same in Iran after they're done with Syria.

       Nope.  The CIA coordinated through the Pakistani ISI who only helped out their fellow Pashtuns.  The Arabs brought everything with them.  Money, construction equipment, arms and fighters all came from Saudi and other Gulf nations with little or no documented CIA help.  On the other hand the relationship with the ISI and how hard they fucked us is pretty known.

       You really should do some non-conspiracy reading on the middle east.  Syria and Iran are just as hegemonic as the west.  Syria had troops in Lebanon for decades and were behind the assassination of their puppet's political rival Rafik Hariri.  Iran uses Syria as an arms depot for Hezbollah who uses Lebanon as a training ground under the direction of Iran.

      <p>
       The Syrian government got this whole thing going when they started torturing kids and firing on unarmed protesters.  The Iranians did the same thing a few years back but were able to put the nascent revolution down.  Google "Neda video" if you don't believe me.

       First of all Russia has real problems with terrorism, its about the disputed territories and they problems with Chechen people and people in Georgia. Now some Chechen consider themselves Russian and Christian, so its not like its a monolithic body, but still there are real terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second is that the Olympics don't bring any money to any country, most countries that has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics have had loses and the infrastructure build for the games is in ruins and catching dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       China for example is using the stadiums that it build as residential places, there are literally flats and parking spaces inside the stadiums, its like gated community.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they are not going to get billions in profits, in fact they'd be lucky if they are even.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third its important to understand that Russia has hosted the Winter games many times, its one of the rare countries that has the conditions to do so, meaning its cold and snowy and they never had any big problems during these events, so I don't expect this time to be different.

       It does make me wonder who mounts these terrorist campaigns. I no longer think it is a few disgruntled individuals who, in some magic way, found each other and plotted in secret. These things take money and coordination. I suspect agencies, corporations, governments, are behind most of the terror campaigns. By that, I mean the multiple bombings.

       In my opinion, Boston was a massive joint-operations counterterrorism exercise and national emergency preparedness drill. Except it was also covering up something deeper, which really throws people off when they realize it was all set up to look real for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Boston Globe said they had planned for that type of terrorist attack scenario - planning that required every type of law enforcement agency and first responders being "in on the drill" while it was being played out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you ever see on the news anything about shootings or bombings in actual civilian locations turning out to be "just drills" after they've updated their story? No. It never happens. But mass casualty drills like Boston involving civilian and crowded locations... were already being

      <p>
       I'm not yet sure what to think of these two events in Russia, but if the US and Russia have been training together on counterterror stuff then I wouldn't rule out the possibility that it was fabricated and carried out in controlled fashion. Well, that's being hopeful, but eh. We'll see where they take it.

       if it was fabricated, it was definitely not by Russia. First, because the Russia I know of with Putin in charge, would never kill his own people unlike other "presidents". Second, they have probably already lost a butt load of Olympics tourist$$$$$ because of it, so, not good....
