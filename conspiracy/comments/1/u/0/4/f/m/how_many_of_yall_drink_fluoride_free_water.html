    <div class="md"><p>If you use Reverse osmosis to filter your water you should have very little minerals in the water at all.

<p>You wont need to add anything to the water if the rest of your diet has the minerals in it that you need for daily intake.

<p>All water contains trace amounts of minerals unless filtered as mentioned above.  Fluoride if there is a natural source (normally found in mountain states) may be present in water naturally.

<p>If you are in an area with &quot;HARD&quot; water are you may want to filter your water that you drink normally.<br/>

</blockquote>

<p>I just wanted to point out that this is physically impossible and to be careful who you&#39;re advising. Water can only carry out what your body excretes as waste, hence the dilution of urine as you drink more than needed at any given time. That fact was created by a water filtration company about 2 decades ago so they could advertise themselves as being the better option because they left &quot;minerals&quot; and other additives in the water.  </p>

<p>Edit: Not trying to come off as a Dick, but I work for a filtration company and handle misadvised customers with this complaint every day, so hopefully you can understand where the desire to say something lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1- I&#39;m curious what it is that you are advising others, daily working in this field. There may be a reason why this is daily. I&#39;m not on either side of this. I don&#39;t know the truth, and advised speculation. I speculate your opinion as well. Read on.</p>

<p>2- Real fact: Pure H20 is the most universal solvent known to man. There&#39;s no doubt, with this stuff in your body, the water WILL absorb something from you. What happens after that, I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s not my field of expertise. This is just common sense though.</p>

<p>2.1- This subreddit is conspiracy. I only know what I&#39;ve seen it do to copper pipes. If it does that to pipes, it&#39;s contaminating the water. After seeing this, I looked it up and came across some body-robbing statements. I probably should have researched that more before repeating it, yes. </p>

<p>You also have other attributes like PH levels, and electric charges with water (May or may not support) </p>

<p>3- The World Health Organization (WHO) released a study with sufficient evidence of health risks associated with drinking demineralized water. Some commercial entities say otherwise. Links below</p>

<p>3.1- Here are some links from both sides of the argument</p>

<p><a href="http://www.waterbenefitshealth.com/drinking-demineralized-water.html">It&#39;s bad</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.custompure.com/Health-Effects-of-Drinking-Demineralized-Water-W45.aspx">It&#39;s a conspiracy</a></p>

<p>Do you even like the taste of demineralized/RO?</p>

<p>Would you agree the bottom line is:</p>

<p>Good things and bad things can be in water. Test your water no matter what.  [?]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1- Generally, the topic of distilled water and its relation to health arises after customers inquire about the PH levels of our water and all that we remove.  I&#39;ll advised them of the neutral 7 PH level, and go over what constitutes as an inorganic/organic dissolved solid/gas. Those who live in an area where the water naturally has more dissolved solids present will have shorter filter lives and run risk of pipe corrosion (as you mentioned), which can increase the TDS consumed to an even higher level. Those in coastal regions with high concentrations of salt have a TDS around 300. Some parts of AZ around 400-600. US average is 51-200. Max approved is 500 through the NSF/WQA. So, I will advise them that our quality is close to double distilled water without the &quot;flat&quot; taste. We remove anything inorganic or dissolved, and if the water filtered is municipally treated potable water, that means pure H20.  </p>

<p>2 - Yes, the water will absorb something from you. <a href="http://www.durastill.com/myths.html">It absorbs</a> the &quot;rejected, discarded and unusable minerals and, assisted by the blood and the lymph, carries them to the lungs and kidneys for elimination from the body.... It doesn&#39;t leach out minerals that have become part of the cell structure, only those rejected&quot;. It&#39;s possible to die or become sick from consuming water at a faster rate than it can be expelled, though the only point in which the water would absorb valuable nutrients/minerals from your body is if you were suffering from malnutrition and your body were burning it&#39;s own cells to generate energy to function. That is unhealthy, and water will only assist in what the body has already started.  </p>

<p>2.1 - Oh yes, various things both natural and unnaturally present in the water supply can cause corrosion of pipes. Lyme is a large issue in the south and explains a lot of corrosion issues in TX. The PH of our water is a neutral 7, the safest to consume. Higher or lower can be very dangerous for the body (hence avoiding drinking still water as water becomes more acidic as it sits). --- One of the big things about that site that hits me is that it is not the WQA or NSF, or FDA on that note. It&#39;s also like many others I see. She states that her son researched for and composed many of the articles on the site, so the credibility sort of falls for me. That&#39;s not to say it doesn&#39;t hold some factual basis, but it steers me away.</p>

<p>As far as taste goes, I actually do. It&#39;s not the minerals in the water but the amount of actual oxygen that we taste when we drink it. Sweet tastes are attributed to the iron in the water. The higher the level, the more iron.  </p>

<p>All that aside, I agree. Test your water people! TDS meters are easy and awesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here Mr. Complete bs:</p>

<p>RO water is aggressive due to the DO (dissolved oxygen) and CO (carbon dioxide) content. They are more aggressive than low pH acidic waters. DI is equally aggressive. Neither water should be run through metal plumbing. Doing so will damage the plumbing but more importantly, the metal will be added to the water. Use the PE tubing that comes with the RO. The metal faucet is because there is no plastic faucets due to a lack of strength etc. in the design and you should flush to drain the first water out of all faucets anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI for people posting about using high filtration such as RO. Be aware (I believe -not sourcing, no time) that this water is &quot;thirsty&quot; for minerals. It will actually eat your copper pipe (if copper) or other. It can rob your body of it&#39;s minerals from what I understand as well. There are &quot;remineralizers&quot; you&#39;re suppose to have with your system unless you have one of those small RO systems under your sink. If you have the big system and run it to your water heater, I want to say you&#39;re asking for trouble.</p>

<p>Just a heads up. Anyway, after putting in such filtration you really should have the final water tested anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you remove all the minerals the water becomes &quot;dead&quot;. This water can eat through your copper pipes and even rob your body of minerals in search of replacing the minerals and in a fairly short amount of time (months). You basically need to put minerals back in the water.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s not good for you to be drinking RO for long periods of time without a Remineralizer </p>
