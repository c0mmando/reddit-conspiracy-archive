<p>Now that paper isn&#39;t the medium of choice and is even looked down upon (environmentally speaking), what stands in the way? </p>

<p>Now instead of reading newspapers to dumb us down, they want to distract us from alternative media with the very drug they once told us would make us maniacs.</p>

<p>As for marijuana used as a distraction, you must have never eaten or smoked marijuana, it opens your eyes to the world around you it doesn&#39;t distract you from it, it makes people extremely introspective and broadens your perspective&#39;s on the world.

I didn&#39;t suddenly decide I&#39;m never going to work again and all I&#39;m going to do is sit around and watch TV.  Look at people like Kevin Smith and Joe Rogan and Bill Maher who are all creative, very successful people who smoke weed every day.  They aren&#39;t losers.  Smoking helps Kevin Smith write his scripts, and helped Bill Maher write his jokes and Joe smokes and is one of the most informed dudes about every subject you could want to talk about (as well as being a gym rat and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt).

<p>There&#39;s no science backing that up.  What should I call it then.  Ok, I&#39;ll call it anecdotal evidence, perhaps based on your own observations. My anecdotal evidence based on my observations indicates that most people who become pot smokers achieve less.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Defense mechanism eh?  So you are pretentious as well as being an armchair psychologist.  You must really be a hit at parties.  The difference between your &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot; and mine is that I&#39;m not saying that marijuana will completely change somebody&#39;s habits or behaviors.  That is just flat our not true.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta released his findings detailing the medical benefits of marijuana a few months ago (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/08/health/gupta-changed-mind-marijuana/">http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/08/health/gupta-changed-mind-marijuana/</a>).  If you are a loser you are going to remain a loser.  As with most psychotropic drugs it can effect different people in different ways because their brain chemistry will be different but it doesn&#39;t change you as a person.  Motivated people will continue to be motivated.  If your experience with smoking weed is that you became complacent and lethargic that is more of a statement about you than it is about the effects of the drug.  </p>

<p>No it&#39;s more a statement on the kind of weed he smoked more than the person he is, marijuana doesn&#39;t carry just one kind of high there are many kinds of highs, from lockdown body highs to uplifting energetic have to go out and do something highs and everything in between.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you know the kind of weed you are getting you know the kind of high you can expect.  You aren&#39;t ever going to encounter a situation where you smoke up and go from being a happy motivated person to being a person who doesn&#39;t want to leave their room.  I&#39;ve had the misfortune of smoking weed that was laced before and that wasn&#39;t much fun for me but if you know what you are getting you know what you can expect.  Most psychotropic drugs will effect you negatively if you are a person who is insecure or has a tendency to harbor negative thoughts.  I can handle weed in spite of that fact that I&#39;m more of a realist than an optimist but I stay away from shrooms or DMT because of that.  If you know the kind of person you are and you know what you are taking you can pretty reliably predict how you are going to handle it.</p>

<p>Dr Gupta said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do want to mention a concern that I think about as a father. Young, developing brains are likely more susceptible to harm from marijuana than adult brains. Some recent studies suggest that regular use in teenage years leads to a permanent decrease in IQ. Other research hints at a possible heightened risk of developing psychosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some other guy in these comments is explaining to me how all the different types of weed (THC combined with cannibanoids vs not combined with cannibanoids) is what affects the type of high a person will experience.</p>

<p>He says he&#39;s lazy but depending on the strain he gets, he becomes motivated to clean his entire house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as far as the young, developing brains thing goes that is true in pretty much every study I&#39;ve read.  That being said, marijuana isn&#39;t being made legal to people under 21.  That doesn&#39;t currently matter much because minors still can buy it from their local drug dealers.  As far as weed blends go: legalization will allow for marijuana to be grown and sold in controlled settings so people will know what they are buying.  You won&#39;t have to run the risk of getting something laced or getting a blend that is more potent than you are used to. </p>

<p>As far as the politics of legalization goes, currently anybody who wants to smoke will smoke.  They may have to access the weed illegally but they will (do) get it.  When they do the money will go to their dealer, who in turn pays his supplier, who in turn pays the distributor, and the chain goes all the way back to a cartel.  The cartel will then use that money to buy guns to protect their drug trade.  Legalization could potentially put the dealers out of business over night, make the product more reliable, stimulate the economy, and keep a lot of good people out of prison.  Just because weed is made legal doesn&#39;t mean that people who wouldn&#39;t smoke will all of a sudden decide that&#39;s all they want to do.  Everything I can see suggests that legalization is the right decision.</p>

<p>that&#39;s only if you buy <a href="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Zv6cVypo5YI/Tf4iTf-AAuI/AAAAAAAAADk/DdK_8cALrXk/s1600/brick.jpg">&quot;brick&quot;</a> weed which is some of the lowest quality weed you can get. If you buy local <a href="http://california.budtrader.com/files/classipress/30-grams-quality-bud-1238029074.jpg">high quality</a> weed it usually comes from a local grower or from medical states that leaked into the black market side of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any time you buy illegal weed the cartels have their mitts on that.  When you see people getting their heads cut off on the border, 9 times out of 10 that&#39;s from people who try to work their way around having to pay the cartel their &quot;please don&#39;t kill me&quot; money.  Even if the people don&#39;t get their drugs from the cartel the cartel doesn&#39;t let anybody get big enough without getting a piece of the action.  It&#39;s like the Italian Mafia stopping by a corner store to collect their 10% every week cause they sure would hate to see something bad happen to such a nice family.  If you know someone who sells to just people he knows and doesn&#39;t ever try to branch out and he grows his own shit also then you are lucky.</p>

<p>Any time you buy illegal weed the cartels have their mitts on that. When you see people getting their heads cut off on the border, 9 times out of 10 that&#39;s from people who try to work their way around having to pay the cartel their &quot;please don&#39;t kill me&quot; money.</p>

<p>actually most of the time the people getting their heads cut off are rival cartel member and doing such a brutal act it to send a message of stay out of our territory they usually leave behind messages on the bodies for the rival cartels and recently they have started posting the beheading to facebook to get the rivals attention.</p>

<p>The cartels aren&#39;t that heavily invested in the United States yet. Everything they do here is to do with distribution which they control to an absurd extent delivering everything to the smaller gangs across the United states. As for them trying to get their cut from people making less than millions of dollars, they don&#39;t give a fuck about them.</p>

<p>You&#39;re hearing it I&#39;m starting to see it. Here in my state there has been multiple HUGE grows, from many plots near each other numbering from 700-1000, to plots that have over 20,000 plants and multiple growers living on the site. There isn&#39;t really much of an explanation i can come up with other than cartels are starting to grow here in the US because moving marijuana across the boarder is becoming harder to do each year. </p>

<p>Them getting a cut of other dealers/growers profits is not something I&#39;ve ever heard of though and most of those smaller to medium time people don&#39;t make enough for the cartel to even care about, the cartel are moving tons of marijuana at a time i don&#39;t see how they could care about getting a cut of someones profits that&#39;s moving tens of pounds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think if people are small time that they get harassed by the cartel the same way that they don&#39;t get harassed by the law.  Once someone is big enough to start being noticed by law enforcement is around the same time that they are notice by the cartel.  It turns into a turf thing.  The cartel charges you for selling to &quot;their buyers.&quot;  Either pay them or get out of business.  If you are just a kid selling some dime bags you obviously won&#39;t be getting taxed but if you are trying to make some real money you have to pay up.</p>
