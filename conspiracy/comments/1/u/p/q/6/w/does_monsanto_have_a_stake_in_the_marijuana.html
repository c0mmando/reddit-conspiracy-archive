       Think about it - marijuana was originally made illegal to protect the paper industry supply chain owned by Hearst, and was demonized through his own news market channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that paper isn't the medium of choice and is even looked down upon (environmentally speaking), what stands in the way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now instead of reading newspapers to dumb us down, they want to distract us from alternative media with the very drug they once told us would make us maniacs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The known truth is pretty obvious when you open your eyes.

       in the words of immortal technique "monopolizing weed is virtually impossible" so no Monsanto likely won't get involved until they can make loads beyond loads of money which will be never.

       As for marijuana used as a distraction, you must have never eaten or smoked marijuana, it opens your eyes to the world around you it doesn't distract you from it, it makes people extremely introspective and broadens your perspective's on the world. Hell the first time i smoked it i realized all the propaganda they used to demonize it was all flat out lies, it awoken me to the way the government works to sway public opinions using propaganda.

       It does actually happen.  The paranoid part is that people think they need pot to realize it.

       In fact, pot makes people far less likely to do anything about it.

       Marijuana doesn't

       people anything.  If somebody is smart, driven, and successful smoking weed won't suddenly make them complacent losers sitting on the couch.  Tons of successful people smoke weed.  If somebody is already a jobless loser who sits around playing computer games and watching tv all day they will continue to be that way when they are high.  Smoking can have a way of amplifying the traits you already have.  Creative people will become more creative.  Lazy people will become more lazy.

       It's not really magical.  I've smoked.  I know a lot of people who smoke.  I didn't suddenly decide I'm never going to work again and all I'm going to do is sit around and watch TV.  Look at people like Kevin Smith and Joe Rogan and Bill Maher who are all creative, very successful people who smoke weed every day.  They aren't losers.  Smoking helps Kevin Smith write his scripts, and helped Bill Maher write his jokes and Joe smokes and is one of the most informed dudes about every subject you could want to talk about (as well as being a gym rat and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt).  Don't project your experiences with weed onto other people just because you and your friends were lazy underachievers.

       Ahhh so you are a pretentious "know-it-all."  In that case, where can I see you in an interview with anybody about anything?  How many times have you gotten Dan Carlin, Sam Harris, Graham Hancock, Neil deGrasse Tyson, etc. to come and sit down with you for a 3 hour interview?  Or maybe you are still recovering from the harmful effects that marijuana has had on you.

       You are coming off very snide and dismissive.  You said that my claim that marijuana makes creative people more creative is "magical thinking."  I'm not saying you know stuff.  I called you a pretentious "know-it-all" which is to say that you are trying to come across as if you are expert of more things than you actually are.

       There's no science backing that up.  What should I call it then.  Ok, I'll call it anecdotal evidence, perhaps based on your own observations. My anecdotal evidence based on my observations indicates that most people who become pot smokers achieve less.

       Defense mechanism eh?  So you are pretentious as well as being an armchair psychologist.  You must really be a hit at parties.  The difference between your "anecdotal evidence" and mine is that I'm not saying that marijuana will completely change somebody's habits or behaviors.  That is just flat our not true.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta released his findings detailing the medical benefits of marijuana a few months ago (
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/08/health/gupta-changed-mind-marijuana/">

       ).  If you are a loser you are going to remain a loser.  As with most psychotropic drugs it can effect different people in different ways because their brain chemistry will be different but it doesn't change you as a person.  Motivated people will continue to be motivated.  If your experience with smoking weed is that you became complacent and lethargic that is more of a statement about you than it is about the effects of the drug.

       No it's more a statement on the kind of weed he smoked more than the person he is, marijuana doesn't carry just one kind of high there are many kinds of highs, from lockdown body highs to uplifting energetic have to go out and do something highs and everything in between.

       If you know the kind of weed you are getting you know the kind of high you can expect.  You aren't ever going to encounter a situation where you smoke up and go from being a happy motivated person to being a person who doesn't want to leave their room.  I've had the misfortune of smoking weed that was laced before and that wasn't much fun for me but if you know what you are getting you know what you can expect.  Most psychotropic drugs will effect you negatively if you are a person who is insecure or has a tendency to harbor negative thoughts.  I can handle weed in spite of that fact that I'm more of a realist than an optimist but I stay away from shrooms or DMT because of that.  If you know the kind of person you are and you know what you are taking you can pretty reliably predict how you are going to handle it.

       Well as far as the young, developing brains thing goes that is true in pretty much every study I've read.  That being said, marijuana isn't being made legal to people under 21.  That doesn't currently matter much because minors still can buy it from their local drug dealers.  As far as weed blends go: legalization will allow for marijuana to be grown and sold in controlled settings so people will know what they are buying.  You won't have to run the risk of getting something laced or getting a blend that is more potent than you are used to.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the politics of legalization goes, currently anybody who wants to smoke will smoke.  They may have to access the weed illegally but they will (do) get it.  When they do the money will go to their dealer, who in turn pays his supplier, who in turn pays the distributor, and the chain goes all the way back to a cartel.  The cartel will then use that money to buy guns to protect their drug trade.  Legalization could potentially put the dealers out of business over night, make the product more reliable, stimulate the economy, and keep a lot of good people out of prison.  Just because weed is made legal doesn't mean that people who wouldn't smoke will all of a sudden decide that's all they want to do.  Everything I can see suggests that legalization is the right decision.

       Any time you buy illegal weed the cartels have their mitts on that.  When you see people getting their heads cut off on the border, 9 times out of 10 that's from people who try to work their way around having to pay the cartel their "please don't kill me" money.  Even if the people don't get their drugs from the cartel the cartel doesn't let anybody get big enough without getting a piece of the action.  It's like the Italian Mafia stopping by a corner store to collect their 10% every week cause they sure would hate to see something bad happen to such a nice family.  If you know someone who sells to just people he knows and doesn't ever try to branch out and he grows his own shit also then you are lucky.

       actually most of the time the people getting their heads cut off are rival cartel member and doing such a brutal act it to send a message of stay out of our territory they usually leave behind messages on the bodies for the rival cartels and recently they have started posting the beheading to facebook to get the rivals attention.

       The cartels aren't that heavily invested in the United States yet. Everything they do here is to do with distribution which they control to an absurd extent delivering everything to the smaller gangs across the United states. As for them trying to get their cut from people making less than millions of dollars, they don't give a fuck about them.

       Two of my best friends from High School (we are 28 now and still good friends) are twins and one of them works border patrol and the other is ex Navy now DEA.  I hear from them all the time about how the cartel influence in the US is a lot greater than we think.  We might not see it on the news but a lot of shit is going on behind the curtain.  Illegal/unaccounted for drug money turns into illegal guns within and outside of our borders a lot more often than not.  God only knows how many violent crimes can be traced back to something as silly as some high school flunky selling pot at the local 7/11 parking lot.

       You're hearing it I'm starting to see it. Here in my state there has been multiple HUGE grows, from many plots near each other numbering from 700-1000, to plots that have over 20,000 plants and multiple growers living on the site. There isn't really much of an explanation i can come up with other than cartels are starting to grow here in the US because moving marijuana across the boarder is becoming harder to do each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them getting a cut of other dealers/growers profits is not something I've ever heard of though and most of those smaller to medium time people don't make enough for the cartel to even care about, the cartel are moving tons of marijuana at a time i don't see how they could care about getting a cut of someones profits that's moving tens of pounds.

       I don't think if people are small time that they get harassed by the cartel the same way that they don't get harassed by the law.  Once someone is big enough to start being noticed by law enforcement is around the same time that they are notice by the cartel.  It turns into a turf thing.  The cartel charges you for selling to "their buyers."  Either pay them or get out of business.  If you are just a kid selling some dime bags you obviously won't be getting taxed but if you are trying to make some real money you have to pay up.

       Marijuana is not good for developing brains (under the age of 18) and hasn't shown any harm on adult brains. Also Dr. Gupta was vehemently against marijuana until last year but that quote was taken from his article about changing his mind on it so i guess that part doesn't really matter.

       it depends on the strain anyone will become "couch locked" and lazy if they smoke a heavy indica and heavy sativa's will bring an energetic uplifting high, there's a lot of different kind of strains that give you different king of highs and most people don't realize that.

       the THC in the strains is the same chemical but there are also chemicals called

        Cannabinoids
       </a>
       that give you the different kind of highs involved with consuming marijuana. as of now we know of 85 different kinds of cannabinoids so you can imagine the range of highs you can get from cannabis.

       no paranoia is smoking on a train bridge than running back and forth over it for 20 minutes thinking that a train was coming.... you haven't said a single thing that makes me believe you've ever experienced marijuana it doesn't make people complacent why do you think it was such a widely used drug during the biggest counter culture the United States has ever seen? back in the 60's people used to say the world would be a much better place if the politicians just got stoned every once in a while. It's not possible to use marijuana to distract people from the tyranny's happening in the world, it makes people question too much.

       I think they've already infiltrated it. About 3 years ago, I started noticing a certain strain of weed that a)burned rather hot &amp; fast, b) smelled almost exactly like dog shit when burning and c)the stems and seeds were slightly different, thicker and rough. It also seemed to cause asthma attacks. I thought maybe my weed guy was dicking me over w "fake weed", but when I tried growing from seed, it was indeed marijuana, but organically growing it didn't improve anything. I switched to high grade/hydroponics and never looked back.

       You are coming off very snide and dismissive.  You said that my claim that marijuana makes creative people more creative is "magical thinking."  I'm not saying you know stuff.  I called you a pretentious "know-it-all" which is to say that you are trying to come across as if you are expert of more things than you actually are.
