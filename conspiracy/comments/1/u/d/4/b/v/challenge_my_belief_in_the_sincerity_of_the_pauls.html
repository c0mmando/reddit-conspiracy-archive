       Simple as that. I am not fanatic for the pauls, but I think they're sincere and I'm never surprised by anything they do as being out of their character. I may be surprised at what they're doing, but I've never seen them betray their principles. So attack that, because I want my beliefs challenged.
      </p>

       Thanks in advance.

       Edit: Just to clarify, I'm saying I'm the kind of person that detests cult of personality and studies it for fun. And here I am awestruck by these 2.

       i'm a big fan of the Pauls but there are instances where its politics as usual.

      <p>
       Ron Paul getting earmarked federal money for his congressional district.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rand Paul jumping in with the GOP.

       Ron Paul knew that the budgets would always be approved even though he always voted against them. So, he also made sure that his district got back as much of their federal tax money a possible. I can't consider that a flaw.

       I came here to change your mind, but agree with you. I think Rand caters to the GOP a little more than his dad, but I still think he is genuine and one hell of a better pick than the state sponsored candidates.

       Ron Paul is a Republican.  I have the same attitude toward him for that reason that I do toward would-be Democrat reformers like Elizabeth Warren.  In the end, he's just providing a release valve for the Republican party.
      </p>
      <p>
       See also the "Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic party" bullshit.  It's like, "We acknowledge that the party is corrupt and useless, but we're gonna keep supporting it so that nothing changes."  Yeah, right.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Ron Paul wants to change something, then it's simple.  FUCKING RUN AS A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE.  He is one of the few people with resources to do it.  Better yet, JOIN WITH A "LIBERAL" like Sanders (Kucinich?  Grayson?) and RUN AS A COMBINED THIRD-PARTY ticket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, REAL candidates for change are getting arrested just for trying to attend the fucking presidential debates.

       In truth, I had forgotten that.  If he wants to really change things (instead of just staying comfortable), he needs to do that again.  He has a much bigger political network now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The REAL thing to do would be (again) to run on a ticket with a Sanders or a Kucinich / Grayson type.  The message would be that they don't agree on everything, but that they could still represent the vast majority of Americans who know our corporate government is corrupt and needs change.

       hes like 80 years old dude give him a break lol, he did well the last two times he ran AND he got more attention than than he ever would have running as a third party, even with someone like kucinich (I was always hoping judge napolitano would be his running mate).. youd do best to put some faith in his son, and lend support to ppl like justin amash and gary johnson

       Well, that's a bit heavy-handed of you.  The OP is about his sincerity, and I'm just sayin' that the real path to change goes AROUND the Republican-Democratic party, not THROUGH it.  Age aside, if you want to change America, you can't do it with those lobbyist-run machines.

       The point being that Sanders/Paul or Paul/Kucinich for example is actually much more representative of America than an Obama - Bush - Romney - Clinton mush machine.
      </p>

       I don't think the so-called "left" and the so-called "right" are actually that far off.  The REAL divide is between America and its corporate-controlled government.

       I'm not sure what's actually going on in his head, but when you talk about "sincerity" and "loyal but principled Republican" and "revolution" all in the same breath, that's when I say that something is not making sense.

       Well I never said the word revolution, and I said he's playing the loyal republican. Ideologically he presents a different stance but when it comes time for the party to endorse the establishment candidate he didn't make a stink that would have only burnt his own political capital.

       You know how it turns out for third party candidates though. I'm with you, but there's not a political adviser out there that would recommend a third party run, unless he didn't win the primary. In a Christie vs Clinton/Warren scenario, with Rand as a third party, the results would be a toss up. I think his best bet is to win the primary, but I hope he considers running even if he doesn't.

       The Republican party is a machine.  He's not going to win any primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       He won't win an election as a third-party candidate either, but he'd make a hell of a lot more difference than he does now.  Possibly a lasting difference.

       Going back to your statement here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        there's not a political adviser out there that would recommend a third party run
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The question is not whether he wants to WIN.  The question is whether he wants to change the country.  Look how much the shills hate Perot, Nader, and other third party folks.  Third parties can make people think, and that's one thing the Democratic-Republicans absolutely cannot afford.

       I'm not going to disagree with you. Rand Paul as a third party candidate is a best case scenario, but I would still support him if he won the primary. If anyone else wins, I'll support the libertarian candidate.

       Well, that's a bit heavy-handed of you.  The OP is about his sincerity, and I'm just sayin' that the real path to change goes AROUND the Republican-Democratic party, not THROUGH it.  Age aside, if you want to change America, you can't do it with those lobbyist-run machines.
