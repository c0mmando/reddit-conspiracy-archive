I am not fanatic for the pauls, but I think they&#39;re sincere and I&#39;m never surprised by anything they do as being out of their character. I may be surprised at what they&#39;re doing, but I&#39;ve never seen them betray their principles. So attack that, because I want my beliefs challenged.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Ron Paul knew that the budgets would always be approved even though he always voted against them. So, he also made sure that his district got back as much of their federal tax money a possible. I can&#39;t consider that a flaw. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ron Paul is a Republican.  I have the same attitude toward him for that reason that I do toward would-be Democrat reformers like Elizabeth Warren.  In the end, he&#39;s just providing a release valve for the Republican party.</p>

<p>See also the &quot;Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic party&quot; bullshit.  It&#39;s like, &quot;We acknowledge that the party is corrupt and useless, but we&#39;re gonna keep supporting it so that nothing changes.&quot;  Yeah, right.</p>

<p>If Ron Paul wants to change something, then it&#39;s simple.  FUCKING RUN AS A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE.  He is one of the few people with resources to do it.  Better yet, JOIN WITH A &quot;LIBERAL&quot; like Sanders (Kucinich?  Grayson?) and RUN AS A COMBINED THIRD-PARTY ticket.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, REAL candidates for change are getting arrested just for trying to attend the fucking presidential debates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In truth, I had forgotten that.  If he wants to really change things (instead of just staying comfortable), he needs to do that again.  He has a much bigger political network now.</p>

<p>The REAL thing to do would be (again) to run on a ticket with a Sanders or a Kucinich / Grayson type.  The message would be that they don&#39;t agree on everything, but that they could still represent the vast majority of Americans who know our corporate government is corrupt and needs change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know how it turns out for third party candidates though. I&#39;m with you, but there&#39;s not a political adviser out there that would recommend a third party run, unless he didn&#39;t win the primary. In a Christie vs Clinton/Warren scenario, with Rand as a third party, the results would be a toss up. I think his best bet is to win the primary, but I hope he considers running even if he doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>The question is not whether he wants to WIN.  The question is whether he wants to change the country.  Look how much the shills hate Perot, Nader, and other third party folks.  Third parties can make people think, and that&#39;s one thing the Democratic-Republicans absolutely cannot afford.</p>
