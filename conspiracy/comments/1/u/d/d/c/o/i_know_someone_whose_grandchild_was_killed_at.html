A really close family friend of theirs (she lives 3 houses down in the same neighborhood) came over because she was distraught that her in-laws grandchild had died in a school shooting in COnnecticut.</p>

<p>Now that i think about it, its weird Thats how i initially heard about Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading over your comments, and seems you are in the same boat as the rest of us. You don&#39;t know what happened that day, but question the official narrative. What we would like to hear is if you have additional information due to your relationships. </p>

<p>You said they are scumbags. Is this an unbiased opinion? Why are they scumbags? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not necessarily. this is an issue i was running into in the other thread.  Knowing a victim doesn&#39;t negate conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>Knowing a victim only means that presumably innocent people were killed.</p>

<p>Knowing a victim doesnt mean it wasn&#39;t some weird FEMA drill scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>idk.. i just started this thread so hopefully spark some discussion. it seemed that the majority of the people believe the no one died and it was a 100% cover up scenario. Personally i feel like there was a cover-up but innocent people were also killed. Unless, like i said, for some reason this person i knew was somehow part of the coverup. </p>
