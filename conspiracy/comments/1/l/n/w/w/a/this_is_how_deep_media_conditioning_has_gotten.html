        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My grandmother watches TV all day, every day, she has for years. We live in Puerto Rico, so the US is basically our second country, and she&#39;s very respectful when it comes to discussing matters that are related. I&#39;ve been telling her for months that the US is just waiting to go to war with Syria, and she didn&#39;t believe me. Now this is happening, and she still doesn&#39;t believe me. She even goes as far as telling me that if I keep talking about these things in public, I won&#39;t get a scholarship or college, whatever the fuck that means, that&#39;s seriously what she says. Saddens me that I try to show her the truth and she prefers to keep living this fantasy fed by the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are three types of people in the world.</p>

<ol>
<li>Those who refuse to learn.</li>
<li>Those who want to learn, but don&#39;t know how.</li>
<li>Those who learn everyday.</li>
</ol>

<p>Don&#39;t even attempt to teach the first, you will lose confidence and will get frustrated. It is simple to identify them. Don&#39;t waste your time.</p>

<p>The second must be taught through information, not statements. If you assert a statement they won&#39;t understand why, and your time will be wasted. You must ease them in.</p>

<p>The third already knows. Knows how to look, understands that no one truly gives a fuck about anyone else. No matter how hard they tell you they care, they say they care for an easing of their ego.</p>

<p>When people die, you cry because YOU will miss them. Not because of their death, but because of personal connections. Everything in this world is about you, nothing else.</p>

Now that the guys on the Blue Team are pushing it it&#39;s like night and day with him.
