       My grandmother watches TV all day, every day, she has for years. We live in Puerto Rico, so the US is basically our second country, and she's very respectful when it comes to discussing matters that are related. I've been telling her for months that the US is just waiting to go to war with Syria, and she didn't believe me. Now this is happening, and she still doesn't believe me. She even goes as far as telling me that if I keep talking about these things in public, I won't get a scholarship or college, whatever the fuck that means, that's seriously what she says. Saddens me that I try to show her the truth and she prefers to keep living this fantasy fed by the media.

       Sadly I think this is all too common. My parents generation has the mindset that if something isn't in the news then it didn't happen - or is somehow sensational/fictional.

       There are three types of people in the world.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Those who refuse to learn.
       </li>
       <li>
        Those who want to learn, but don't know how.
       </li>
       <li>
        Those who learn everyday.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Don't even attempt to teach the first, you will lose confidence and will get frustrated. It is simple to identify them. Don't waste your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second must be taught through information, not statements. If you assert a statement they won't understand why, and your time will be wasted. You must ease them in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third already knows. Knows how to look, understands that no one truly gives a fuck about anyone else. No matter how hard they tell you they care, they say they care for an easing of their ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people die, you cry because YOU will miss them. Not because of their death, but because of personal connections. Everything in this world is about you, nothing else.

       If she isn't convinced by Wesley Clark nothing will convince her. She is right, however, society doesn't reward political activists. If you want to speak of the conspiracy in public, you will be punished. If you don't care about being punished, then by all means spread awareness.

       What do you mean he's full of crap? He went on live tv and predicted every single government overthrow before it happened. And now all we have left is Syria and Iran.

       My dear ol dad was completely against the Iraq war and predicted most of the 9/11 fallout accurately. Now that the guys on the Blue Team are pushing it it's like night and day with him. Pretty disheartening as he helped teach me to think critically during my teen years in the post 9/11 2000s.
