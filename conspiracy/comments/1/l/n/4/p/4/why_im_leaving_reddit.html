        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I arrived on Reddit, 5 years ago (on a different account), Reddit was a site for nerdy programmers. I went here because I got banned from Digg, and this was the second best thing available.</p>

<p>Even when Reddit got larger than Digg, it was mostly ignored by the media because it was seen as a hotbed for racism and pedophilia. The almighty dollar rules everything, and so Reddit logically responded by banning any subreddit that violates the left wing mindset found in the media. </p>

<p>When the media boycott ended, a new demographic invaded that clashes with the old userbase. This started about two or three years ago, when Reddit began to grow. Reddit went from supporting Ron Paul to supporting Obama and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> went from a hotbed of conspiracy theories, to a hotbed of Republican-bashing. Subreddits such as <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a>, <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>, <a href="/r/cringe">/r/cringe</a> and <a href="/r/shitredditsays">/r/shitredditsays</a> mostly serve to ridicule and drive out the old libertarian leaning conspiratorially minded userbase.</p>

<p>This wouldn&#39;t be a problem, if it weren&#39;t for the fact that the Admins have clearly taken a position in this conflict, and support the newcomers. I am convinced that in a free marketplace of ideas, the truth will eventually come out on top. However, Reddit is no free marketplace.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/1cigdg/this_fella_is_a_true_murican_eat_it_rpolitics/c9gxj64">Left wingers run most of the major subreddits, including /r/politics, where they are paid to submit content from a select few sites.</a> References to this fact are banned.</p>

<p>The major subreddits don&#39;t so much go out and ban non-leftist subreddits, but rather, try to keep the old userbase in a ghettoized position. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1kyff2/why_is_mensrights_not_allowed_to_be_linked_to/">As an example, /r/bestof bans any submissions from /r/mensrights.</a> This prevents people from leaving the default subreddits and being exposed to new non-Soviet approved political content.</p>

<p>The most effective form of control is one where you control your own opposition, and provide a limited hang-out. As an example, The Soviet Union had a satirical magazine named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krokodil">Krokodil</a>, that bashed middle class Soviet bureaucrats for their lack of imagination and initiative taking. Thus, the only criticism the Soviet system allowed the average person to be exposed to was the type of criticism that helped improve its efficiency, not the type of criticism that proposed replacing the system with a different system.</p>

<p>In practice, our political system works similar, and thus, large media organizations such as Reddit fear being perceived as a voice that argues for a different set of values, as this leads to shunning. Dissent from the status quo of egalitarian totalitarian consumerism is tolerated as a pressure-valve, as long as it does not grow influential enough to risk upsetting the status quo. </p>

<p>The way we control the debate in our society is generally not by censoring radical voices, but rather by drowning them out with equally radical voices and irrelevant information. If something that requires your immediate attention is about to happen, like for example, an ongoing nuclear disaster in Japan, or the threat of military intervention in Syria which only 9% of the American public supports, you&#39;ll forget about it because your frontpage will be flooded with pictures of Miley Cyrus&#39;s teenage ass. Alternatively, we try to make you as outraged as possible about as many different issues as possible, so that you are eventually too mentally exhausted to be upset about anything, and succumb to apathy. &quot;Your food is poisoned with nuclear waste material? Well that&#39;s pretty awful, but did you know that gays are STILL not allowed to get married?&quot;</p>

<p>Most of this doesn&#39;t happen through a conspiracy, even though it sounds exactly like a conspiracy. In reality, as explained by Jacques Ellul in his book &quot;The Technological Society&quot;, our society is self-augmenting, it automatically takes whatever actions are required to preserve its own stability and increase its own efficiency. As an example, countries become democratic because democratic countries have a higher GDP, and thus more soft and hard power to forcibly impose democracy on non-democratic countries. </p>

<p>At a smaller level, issues that can be solved and thus give us a sense of power, are given precedence over issues we can not solve and make us feel frustrated. As an example, we prefer talking about gay marriage, because gay marriage can be legalized and thus make us feel a sense of power. In contrast, we don&#39;t really like talking about nuclear energy, because there is no good solution, as we need nuclear energy for our society to function, and yet, nuclear energy is extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>The reason humans occupy themselves with issues that have no direct influence on their own lives is because they have no control over the fundamental factors that make up their own life, which makes them feel weak and vulnerable. You don&#39;t control whether the supermarket will have food tomorrow. You don&#39;t control what&#39;s built on the other side of the street where you live. This causes us to seek to influence other people&#39;s opinions, and together feel a sense of power by influencing what happens to society as a whole.</p>

<p>There is very little reason to occupy yourself with politics, as politics doesn&#39;t directly influence you as an individual, and you have very little control over the outcome, both due to our own psychological biases as well as the large scale of the issues that are discussed. It&#39;s far more time efficient to focus your attention on issues that you do have control over, and where you do see the outcome directly. Don&#39;t waste your time on epic conflicts.</p>

<p>When the land you see is yours and free to do with as you please when you look outside of the window, you don&#39;t care what happens on the other side of the globe. When you don&#39;t have to oblige by petty rules set by bureaucrats, employers, teachers and politicians, you don&#39;t feel a desire to tell other people what to do and how to behave. Try to gain a sense of power in your own life, and you will find that you no longer care about news and politics, and like me, you can leave this cesspool of a website behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been on Reddit for a very long time. In the last three years I have noticed a dramatic drop in quality. With it being censored, groups like srs trying their hardest to manipulate whatever they disagree with and also admins letting them get away with the bullshit. Mods are now running multiple subs and have an agenda. I have actually been waiting a long time for a Reddit alternative. You can count me in.</p>

<p>While I might agree that the usurpation of states over the course of the 21st century is probably a good argument against my claims, I do put forth the idea that States, insofar as they are up-against monolithic MNC&#39;s , are useless. But I do have hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. OP comes close to having a point, but it&#39;s completely lost in false paradigm nonsense. Sounds like the sour grapes of an armchair libertarian. If you feel your ideas are valid, why are you leaving at the first sign of conflict with those ideas? This is exactly why libertarianism is where it is, it can&#39;t handle even the most basic criticism. </p>

<p>The stock response is always the same. Claim the dissenter is uneducated until valid points are made, then deride the messenger by calling them a Statist, then finally the taking of the proverbial ball and going home. </p>

<p>The really disappointing part is that there are grown adults who feel this path constitutes a legitimate ideology. For instance, there&#39;s no possible way that the general public soured on Ron Paul as it learned more about him, nope! Must be a conspiracy! I&#39;m the first person to mention that the media did Paul very very wrong during his campaign, and hamstrung him every step of the way. but to ignore PAUL&#39;S OWN MISSTEPS smacks of zealotry, and we can <em>definitely</em> do with less of that on reddit. </p>

<p>Good riddance, OP. There will be many other pie-eyed libertarians to take your place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;There is very little reason to occupy yourself with politics, as politics doesn&#39;t directly influence you as an individual, and you have very little control over the outcome, both due to our own psychological biases as well as the large scale of the issues that are discussed.&quot;</p>

<p>This is where you fucked up.  You stopped at discussing politics as opposed to involving yourself in politics and thought that would affect change.  How often have you gone to your neighborhood association meeting? How often have you gone to your city councilman? How often have you participated in the primary election process to elect a new community member to run for public office? How often have you volunteered for a campaign and walked?  How often have you proposed legislation to your state law-maker?  All of this, is real politics and how you affect change.  </p>

<p>I told <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> when they were asking for suggestions to include news about real politics.  The news that lobbyists, legislators, their staff, and real inside political people pay attention to.  It is all publicly available in various news media.  These are dates for councilmeetings, meetings that are happening in the state capital, which lobbyist met who today, etc. You think of yourself as having lost some elitist academic forum that once changed the world, but reddit has rarely done so because politics is still the same today.  </p>

<p>I want you to actually occupy yourself with REAL politics.  Go to a neighborhood association and begin changing it when you encounter problems you dislike.  Go to your city council member and talk to them about problems you see in your city.   People commonly think they can&#39;t affect things, but they simply focus on Federal issues which are a whole other beast and take a while to indirectly affect you.  People need to affect their city governments and take back their political parties at the local level.  I do not espouse their beliefs, but the grass-roots sect of the Tea Party succeeded unlike Occupy because middle-aged and elderly people know how to engage and organize in a true civic sense, unlike young people.  They knew what to address first, the locals.  If you can change the mind of the locals, you will have evidence to further change your state, and ideally your federal government.  </p>

No candidates were offered for local positions, no influence was pressed during the primary process, and no legislation was lobbied.

    <div class="md"><p>Ya see thats where you&#39;re incorrect.  It does not take that much time.  It merely is about doing it and prioritizing.  I have seen many people maintain families, full time jobs, sometimes 2-partime jobs, and still influence legislation and attend neighborhood association meetings.    Families are the biggest people at neighborhood association meetings.  I also find it hard to believe that young people do not have a lot of time on their hands.  I also find it hard to believe that anyone who has the time to have a reddit account, even for only 2 months, doesn&#39;t have time to influence politics in a real and direct manner.  Write a letter(the simplest thing) or attend a city-council meeting.   trust me it is considered at the local and state level where your vote is magnified thousands of times.</p>

<p>The other aspect is that PEOPLE DON&#39;T VOTE!.  People don&#39;t vote in the primaries and people don&#39;t vote in the general elections.  The biggest turnout we get is a presidential election in november and even then: roughly 50% register to vote and then roughly 50-60% turn out to vote.  Roughly 10-15% decide an election because you have to split that 25% down the middle due to party affiliation.  If you want, I can provide the actual numbers for California, I have already done it multiple times.  People get politicians who sell to investors because they depend on their funds to spam their name and party because people don&#39;t give a shit about politics in a real way.  People spend time at bars, they spend time at restaurants, and most of all, they spend their time at home watching tv or on the internet.  </p>

<p>This is not wishing for rainbows and unicorns.  This is small changes in priorities that would affect real change.  Instead people waste their time when they could be having fun in their lives, socializing, and influencing politics and legislation.  </p>

<p>You just have fallen into the game politicians hide behind.  </p>

<p>I am being the change I want to be in the world, while the post is about &quot;I am leaving reddit.&quot;  Actually do the things I tell you, and you will soon realize it does not take that much time and you can still have a life while actually feeling positive about it because you can see changes around you.          </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said I have the answers to all of our problems.  But I do know the tool to fix the problem.  Its called engagement because thats how shit gets done.  I am in the system, I see people do it, it just takes numbers and engagement.  There is no conspiracy, there are just bought politicians who hide behind people&#39;s lazyness.  </p>

<p>You know how the banning plastic bags movement started?  some group of teenagers/college students (not originally funded) that got together and started bothering the hell out of their local policitians who are so scared of being voted out that if people actually participate they have to listen because the vote margin is so small.  </p>

<p>If you look at history, progress from grass-roots has happened.  Especially within immigration groups and labor groups that were REGULAR PEOPLE that organized and started bothering their politicians when they could.  It just takes doing it at the local level. </p>

<p>I am not saying this method can immediately &quot;change the fed&quot; or do grandiose political sweeps. I am saying you can actually change things that directly affect you from a range of issues of local and state ordinances/taxes, which at least in my state, affect me very directly.  </p>

<p>I agree that money played a huge role in corruption. The inability for it to decay makes it so that people can endlessly collect and endlessly influence.  With microtransaction came an inflated and powerful financial sector.  But seriously, Any political movement in this history of anything, from peasant revolts, to 1920s labor movements, to Caesar Chavez&#39; labor march, it takes activism on specific issues in order to change them.  </p>

If you will surrender your rights so easily (like right now, the search and seizure of your digital content), would you not sign a confidential affidavit of your vote?

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/UCg0WN5">http://imgur.com/UCg0WN5</a></p>

<p>The problem is revenue, not spending. And even if there was a spending problem there should be cuts in corporate welfare and the military industrial complex, not social programs.</p>

<p>Back to the point, it&#39;s not big government that&#39;s the problem. The problem is that there has been a corporate coupe d&#39;etat of the US government. There needs to be a strengthening of the regulatory agencies so they once again act in their role as corporate watchdogs in policing corporate corruption and malfeasance, not a weakening of these agenices through further cuts.</p>

Whatever that position is, it needs to be distinguished from honest opinion, because they are separate things, even if (and they inevitably do) coincide. </p>

<p>I am a liberal in the sense that I believe in the public good and have faith that maintaining it results in a more peaceful, prosperous society. However, it has been infiltrated by entities who benefit directly, financially.  I voted for Obama because I felt like we needed a leader who could disentangle us from our reaction to 9/11. But he turns out to be working for the same people, those who would benefit financially from our despair, fear and hardship. So I no longer have a political affiliation I can call my own.</p>

<p>Exactly how I feel.  Reddit&#39;s audience has changed simply because it has become less niche and more mainstream.  We know the masses out there are either uninformed, willfully ignorant, and complacent with the status quo.  We need more like minded people who are willing to fight to improve the level of public debate, to shift people away from accepting that choosing between a Republican and a Democrat is the only option, and to get people to care about fixing the real issues affecting America: reforming government, fixing foreign policy, ending the police &amp; surveilance state, improving tax laws, improving the quality &amp; cost of healthcare &amp; education, ending the war on drugs, ending for profit prisons, addressing income inequality, finding a good balance between jobs, energy, and environmental sustainability, reinstating Glass-Steagall,  etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, as Gorbachev even said it himself, Communism was going into phase 2, where they literally take over the world into like a world soviet society.  Under the guise of &quot;environmentalism&quot; and &quot;social equity&quot;.  Gorbachev is the founder of Green Cross International, they push for world government under environmentalism, COINCIDENCE?  Its all the same shit the &quot;leftists&quot; push.  Watch MSNBC, its straight out of that same mindset that is being pushed by the Green Cross and related NGOs and foundations.  It&#39;s all about fake &quot;grassroots&quot; movements to create the perception of public opinion at a local level.  Its a bottom-up take over using fake movements funded by the same people who funded the soviets.  It all relates back to the Reece Committee on Tax Exempt Foundations in the 50s where it was discovered that the big foundations were in control of the educational system, the media and most of the politicians in order to gradually bring about a &quot;world citizen&quot; mindset in order to bring about the New World Order.  This is basic history, let me know when you do a little research and ACTUALLY wake up.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/3683662/Reece-Committee-Hearings-TaxExempt-Foundations-1953-Part-1-of-4">first part of the 4000 page Reece Committee findings</a> have fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/3768227/Dodd-Report-to-the-Reece-Committee-on-Foundations-1954">Here&#39;s the Norman Dodd Report to the Reece Committee</a></p>

<p><a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000681/068197eo.pdf">Here&#39;s Julian Huxley&#39;s paper called UNESCO: It&#39;s Purpose and Philosophy</a> PDF, right from the UNESCO site.  On page 13 you&#39;ll notice it says &quot;The moral for UNESCO is clear....&quot; that paragraph says in no uncertain terms that they will use education to bring about a &quot;world citizen&quot; mindset to undermine national sovereignty.  UNESCO being one of the organizations funded by these foundations, and Julian Huxley, being Aldous Huxley&#39;s brother, is a true Fabian with this article, pulling on heart strings and making a sound case for a world government ruled by a technocratic elite.  </p>

<p>None of these programs were ever stopped they were just briefly exposed during the Reece Committee, Gorbachev&#39;s plans match up perfectly with what was found then as well, meaning that it is still happening, now several generations down the line.  Which is how Fabianism works.  A gradual molding of society literally into the New World Order.  It all culminated at the Earth Summit in Rio where the Agenda 21 document was laid out.  Gorbachev was there, with Maurice Strong and all the bankers and their foundations and NGOs getting marching orders.  There is no &quot;secret conspiracy&quot;, it&#39;s all out in the open, hiding in plain sight so to speak.  You&#39;ve just been acclimated to the ideas presented because the educational system indoctrinated you into accepting this as inevitable.  </p>

<p>I mean shit dude.  DO SOME FUCKING RESEARCH.  </p>

<p>edit: just found this book: <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/129462864/Foundations-Their-Power-and-Influence-by-Rene-A-Wormser">Foundations: Their Power and Influence by Rene Wormser</a> on scribd.  That sums up the Reece Committee, the author was one of the top staff on the committee.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not giving me enough credit dude.  I&#39;m not some fucking retard.  I am not kidding when I say I have been researching.  I have read the 4000 pages of congressional testimony in the Reece Committee, I have combed through the cross references and the books that are written about it.  There really <em>is</em> a conspiracy.  It&#39;s not a communist conspiracy, although it <em>looks</em> like one, its set up like one and the people who funded the communists are the same people funding this one.  Its an open conspiracy, there are no &quot;secrets&quot; its all happening in front of everyone, they are just really good at using &quot;code words&quot; to hide the true nature of things.  Agenda 21 is all about setting up the poverty-friendly infrastructure for the coming world government, where everyone who is not &quot;in&quot;, is going to be very poor, aka &quot;just getting by&quot;.  The whole point of Agenda 21 is to bring about &quot;social justice&quot; and &quot;equity&quot; worldwide.  What does that translate to, to you?  Worldwide &quot;equity&quot;?  Everyone is rich?  No.... the opposite.  Once you realize that, a whole new world of perspective is opened up to you.  Ever wonder why they&#39;re flooding the colleges with poor people via &quot;financial aid&quot; and government loans that don&#39;t go away?  Its similar to debasing a currency.  If a degree is worth more because not many people have them, how much is a degree worth if a shitload of people have them?  Not much.  It&#39;s all a scam.  Its all there to get everyone in debt and everyone reliant on the system to survive.  This is expanding and expanding.  The Reece Committee EXPOSED this plan, the big foundations who funded education and the media and most of the politicians and &quot;round table groups&quot; were planning on creating the welfare state(which didn&#39;t exist in the 50s, it didn&#39;t have to exist) and the &quot;world citizen&quot; &quot;world equity&quot; mindset that all of these &quot;liberals&quot; cherish so much.  They&#39;re what Stalin would refer to as &quot;useful idiots&quot;.  People who fight for a cause without knowing the broader implications of it, kind of like feminists, another movement funded by the foundations.  Feminism transfers the dependence of women over to the state as opposed to a family unit all under the guise of women being more &quot;independent&quot; when its really just a dependence on the state to use force to &quot;equalize&quot; things, divorce rates skyrocketed, broken homes, wages dropped for everyone, etc etc.  Now men are the ones suffering and being stamped down by the system.  I could go on and on.  You need to <em>actually</em> wake up dude.  Calling me someone who thinks reptilians are real and that Agenda 21 is some kind of benign worthless thing is ignorant as fuck man.</p>

<p>The same thing happens on every social forum site, they become big and topical enough that others want to control them.</p>

<p>Why not stay right here and try and fix it, if you leave and use another site the same thing will likely happen again. Unless that other site your running to can regulate itself and keep out shills, there will always be problems to work out. We can do it.</p>

<p>Most of this doesn&#39;t happen through a conspiracy, even though it sounds exactly like a conspiracy. In reality, as explained by Jacques Ellul in his book &quot;The Technological Society&quot;, our society is self-augmenting, it automatically takes whatever actions are required to preserve its own stability and increase its own efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that book also he notes that the inevitable end of law enforcement is pre-crime and literally turning the entire world into a prison camp.  WAY good book.  He also wrote the book &quot;Propaganda: The Formation of Men&#39;s Attitudes&quot; which is, IMO, the best book on the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The average person in 1913 made 740 dollars a year (which is like 17k dollars a year in today&#39;s money). So, to say that 1913&#39;s economy had more purchasing power is absolutely ridiculous. Imagine if the average person in today&#39;s economy was only making $17k a year: the whole country would be one gigantic ghetto (and that&#39;s how it was in 1913, which is why we invented investment banking to grow and fertilize the development of modern civilization)!</p>

<p>So, your Ron Paul sympathy is a bunch of delusional brainwashing. Good riddance, asshole.</p>

<p>That being said, the world economy is still in danger, because the Fed is hoarding $131 trillion in financial assets while they try to make as many people starve to death in poverty and unemployment as possible (basically by building up for one gigantic crash that we&#39;re not being protected from at all).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the powers that be fail to keep the dollar as the global reserve currency. Only then will our wages mean nothing. Only then will our billionaires mean nothing. Only then will our military separate from the federal government and the power be restored to the people. </p>

<p>But before power is restored to the people, there will be widespread chaos as infrastructure fails and the food supply dwindles. Local farms are a thing of the past. </p>

<p>Have fear, for our reckoning is soon, the shutting down of power plants and other public works is the tell tale sign. </p>

<p>Can you smell the ashes?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the echo-chamber you desire is out there somewhere.  Surely, the free-market has a myriad of options for you.  You might have to PAY for some of them, but that&#39;s the market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you are angry that ultra conservative right wing &quot;nerdy programmers&quot; are no longer censoring left wing liberalist ideas? SO instead of having input from both sides, and having both sides making fun of each other for their respective stupidity, you want an enclosed system where only people with your opinion share thoughts. Granted I havent been on reddit for the most part in a couple weeks/months, but im pretty sure in that time, all of the Obama bashing, monsanto hating, infowars loving posts have not ben removed or &quot;censored&quot;... 
enjoy your bubble</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I see what you are saying and agree to some extent, many of the things he is saying are true.  <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has no interest in real issues and will occasionally dig on something that appeals to their single issue mentality (for the most part).  And anyone can see it is run by the liberal left for sure.  As for paid shills, I think that is an impossible to prove fantasy.</p>

<p>That being said, I would really like to see something like <a href="/r/factualfalcon">/r/factualfalcon</a> again, although I never even knew it existed until now.  But something exposing the fallacies of all political sides (or at least a place to discuss this in peace) would be very nice.  <a href="/r/politcs">/r/politcs</a> is not that place.</p>
