       Because there would not be war with Russia or any major power, even if the US sends missiles into Syria.

        Israel has already attacked Syria

       during this conflict and nothing happened in response, as would be expected. I recommend researching into the array of international conflicts and political alignments since ww2, and you'll see just how naive a statement that is.

       Now I don't buy that at all.  Why would Russia, China and Iran enter into a war that they would surely lose?  I'm not saying that as a dismissal of these countries militaries, but they don't stand much of a chance as soon as NATO kicks in.  Why would this proxy war be so much different and inflammatory that the multitude of others we have fought?

       I'm not an expert on this issue by any means but I noticed that someone suggested the US Govt want to secure Syria's gas fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past few years the price of gas in the US energy market has plummeted mainly due (I think) to the introduction of some really dangerous extraction methods such as Fracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many in our industry (I work for a major utility) are divesting from US gas because its so cheap due to over capacity of supply, so my question is this....What would the US govt gain by getting access to an all ready plentiful resource and can natural gas be transported as easily as say oil?

       A few weeks ago it was said we would default if the debt ceiling does not rise. So how are we even able to wage war when we cant even pay the interest on our debt. Are we trying to secure syria's huge nat gas fields to pay our debts? Is that why obama is trying to move so fast

       I would say that at least 110% of the rebels are non-Syrian.  Since it's just my opinion, I can say whatever I want, no matter how illogical, idiotic, unsourced, fabricated or incorrect it is.  I'll just spread my completely false views everywhere, dressing them up as "opinion" which will actually disguise the fact that I have no real clue about what's going on, but it doesn't matter, because it's just my opinion.

       The foreign mercenary composition of the FSA is yet another reason why the finger blame is pointing at the rebels for the chemical attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       These mercenaries are fighting a war against an enemy in a foreign country - they are going to be less inhibited about gassing Syrian civilians than Assad. Assad has majority support of the Syrian people, and this popular mandate would disappear in an instant if he used chemical weapons. The rebels couldn't give a shit about the Syrian people.

       I don't know about this. There may be a majority who
       <em>
        prefer

       Assad to whatever opposition group (foreign or domestic) may take over. The use of chemical weapons wouldn't offend the people anymore than his widespread use of conventional weapons against people.

      <p>
       Remember, this all started with popular protests, and only escalated to force when Assad used it first.

        Assad has majority support of the Syrian people, and this popular mandate would disappear in an instant if he used chemical weapons.

       I don't know about this. There may be a majority who
       <em>
        prefer
       </em>
       Assad to whatever opposition group (foreign or domestic) may take over. The use of chemical weapons wouldn't offend the people anymore than his widespread use of conventional weapons against people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, this all started with popular protests, and only escalated to force when Assad used it first.
