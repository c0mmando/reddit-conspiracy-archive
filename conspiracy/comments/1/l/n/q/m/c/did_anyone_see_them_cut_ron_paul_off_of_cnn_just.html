As Ron Paul began going off about how THE PEOPLE are against this war and started talking about the vote in British Parliament, he suddenly got cut off and pulled from the show (his screen went blue). This same &quot;technical error&quot; always happens to Paul...</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W1nxFciq-A">Youtube Link</a></p>

<p>EDIT 2: While this is at the top spot of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I&#39;ll take this opportunity to also recommend Chomsky&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQhEBCWMe44">Manufacturing Consent</a> for those who have trouble understanding the concept of using media to sway public opinion. (Not saying this <em>wasn&#39;t</em> simply a technical error, just suggesting another possibility. That&#39;s what this subreddit is for, after all.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I was watching that one live when it happened as well. I&#39;ve been following Paul pretty closely since &#39;07, and have seen similar things happen to him several times in the past. Considering how little attention he actually gets in MSM relative to other politicians (with the amount of support he has), it&#39;s very strange how often these &quot;technical errors&quot; occur for him/his ideas.</p>

<p>EDIT: I also noticed the Wolf Blitzer connection. Maybe it&#39;s all that Ron Paul Israel talk he/his producers try to avoid. Also, notice Rand&#39;s smile <a href="http://youtu.be/o0FD8PUG_y8?t=1m23s">at 1:23</a> as Ron mentions him getting cut off on CNN earlier.</p>

Then you know what, it&#39;s SO GREAT that congress doesn&#39;t even have to have it! Wow! Well now that it&#39;s changed.

<p>As a non US citizen I&#39;m confused why there is so much hate for this. </p>

<p>In Many other countries around the world, health is free!  I went to hospital a few times in the UK and Australia and paid nothing after it, because both countries Healthcare comes out of my taxes I pay. And I don&#39;t mind paying for my fellow citizen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in the original obama care you weren&#39;t able to choose your own doctor. Sure, you would get the whole treatment but some people just like the benefit of choosing their doctor because after all if they&#39;re paying for it they want some of the best treatment. </p>

<p>Higher Premiums and High Taxes is coming from Obama Care as well, i understand that some countries have free schooling and free healthcare though when you live in america and have a 8% tax, here in texas it&#39;s 8.025%, higher taxes may scare some people into not buying things even though it would be little to no difference. In lower income homes that 10 cents per purchase will scare some people into not buying things because it just &quot;adds up&quot;. We&#39;re already starting to higher the minimum wage though i am a bit afraid what they will be doing is say well ok, we&#39;ll higher the minimum wage but we&#39;re also going to higher the taxes for &quot;this other reason&quot;, which will in turn get you less money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or it&#39;s possible that GW, being the poor wordsmith that he is, stopped himself from saying conspiracy because he knew that a few people would jump on that term. What&#39;s funny is that it was a conspiracy and so was 9/11... Al Quada planning the attacks and the two kids planning the bombings was a conspiracy in every sense of the word so calling it a conspiracy is accurate. </p>

<p>To say that he almost admitted 911 was an inside job because he called boston a conspiracy is a HUGE leap and its those very leaps that discredit this place. It&#39;s sad.. Because our government is shady and they will lie to us but the real conspiracies like the Gulf of Tonkin or WMDs in Iraq get overlooked because they aren&#39;t nearly as interesting as something like our government being behind 9/11 or the secret illuminati shadow government pulling all the strings. </p>

However it seems that admittance is important to you, in which case i would just like to point out some other things which are a matter of public record: Operation Chaos Northwoods, Gladio, Paperclip and mockingbird. <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/p/series-peoples-history-of-cia.html?m=1">This Site</a> has some pretty in depth write ups on these and others which you may find worth investigation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I never said I believe the official story. Not thinking 9/11 was an inside job =/= believing all of the details we were given. I think the US dropped the ball leading up to 911 which was detailed by Richard Clark. I think that the FBI and CIA dropped the ball and they did everything they could to cover up their mistakes... But ultimately I think that OBL lead the attacks in a very organized and well funded mission and the notion of remote control planes, controlled demolitions, cruise missiles hitting the pentagon in plain site etc..

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But I never said I believe the official story. Not thinking 9/11 was an inside job =/= believing all of the details we were given. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right. I should have been a been a little more tactical in my word choice—when i say &#39;believe the official story&#39; i simply meant that the belief that 9/11 was committed by OBL. I think it&#39;s pretty clear to most people who have spent even a little time researching 9/11 that the <em>exact</em> words of the official story are not accurate. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the US dropped the ball leading up to 911 which was detailed by Richard Clark. I think that the FBI and CIA dropped the ball and they did everything they could to cover up their mistakes... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that &#39;dropped the ball&#39; is very much an understatement. There were literally dozens of warnings months before the attacks, the NORAD response was abysmal, terrabytes of data on Able Danger were destroyed, and much more. After reviewing <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1korgs/the_official_megalist_of_911_suspicious/">the circumstances of what happened on 9/11 and what was subsequently done about it</a> in their entirety, I find it very hard for someone to honestly argue that these attacks were not at least <em>allowed</em> to happen. Of course, I&#39;m sure we disagree. On a side note: My favorite film on 9/11 would be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AJ056Ajqd0">9/11: Press For Truth</a>—I think it will jive fairly well with you (Mostly about the commission report and the circumstances around it). Also I think it is hard to argue that members of the &#39;permanent government&#39;  at least <a href="http://wikispooks.com/ISGP/911/911_WTC_part_2_who_did_it.htm">had the means and motive to commit 9/11 </a>. Who actually did it and how of course we will never know for sure until we get an actual investigation into 9/11 (If you are satisfied with the 9/11 comission report I think 9/11: Press For Truth might cause you to reconsider). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>remote control planes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless I am ill informed, I am of the understanding that this is based on little more than speculation and that there is no empirical evidence to suggest that the planes were remote controlled. And, again assumming i am privy to all the facts, I don&#39;t think any critically-thinking conspiracy-minded individual would claim more (Of course, I&#39;m sure we are both well aware that being interested in conspiracies doesnt [sp fix!] mean one is capable of using inductive reasoning to the extent required when researching this information). I wont take it out of the realm of possibility though,  as hijackers &#39;chickening out&#39; would be terribly unfortunate for whomever it was that orchestrated these attacks–especially if without 9/11 there would be no excuse to invade half a dozen countries, absolve the constitution, or transform the US into a totalitarian state–but i of course dont hold it as a thoroughly substantiated piece of the puzzle.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>cruise missiles hitting the pentagon in plain site etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one never sat well with me, as I always didn&#39;t understand why they would use a missile over a plane (unnecessary complications), or why the claimed &#39;hole proving a missile&#39; was a different wall than those of the pentagon (because it was in the interior hole where the nose poked through), among other things. However, I think it&#39;s pretty clear that the damage is consistent with a 757 when viewed in it&#39;s entirety. unfortunately many conspiracy researchers subscribe to the  missile theory, and unfortunately many people, even those of fair evidentialism, have only seen the evidence when it is cherry picked, like in documentaries such as In Plane Site or Loose Change, resulting ill informed understandings. I believe <a href="http://wikispooks.com/ISGP/miscellaneous/disinformation/911/pentahole_dimensions_est.htm">this write up</a> provides a quite convincing argument against the missile theory (for you or anyone potentially reading this). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>controlled demolitions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won&#39;t claim for certain that these buildings were brought down in a controlled demolition, however the omissions and cortortions of data in both the NIST report, and 9/11 Comission report; the fact that we are now our 3rd &#39;official theory&#39; for how the towers collapsed—First Fema, second NIST, now the Bazant paper (whom is not a structural engineer IIRC); the more or less freefall speed of the towers; the fact that the NIST report was never peer reviewed (nor reviewed in it&#39;s entirety by any of the engineers involved); the fact that explosive materials were never even tested for despite protocol and over <a href="http://wikispooks.com/ISGP/911/911_evidence_for_bombs_thermite_at_WTC.html">200 witness accounts of secondary explosions</a>(Other info as well, definitely recommend giving this one a read) ; and all the other oddities at <em>least</em> warrant it as more than &#39;absolutely silly&#39;. Of course, you have stated you disagree. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And again, they do more to harm exposing true government corruption by diverting attention or discrediting those who criticize the govt. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am fully with you that there are a lot of &#39;conspiracy theories&#39;, even ones regarding 9/11 (such as the missle-pentagon theory or the hologram or HAARP or any of the other stuff) that do more harm than good, however I would argue that 9/11 as a whole is not one of these. of course, i wouldn&#39;t expect you to or at all want you to believe me,  but I do sincerely hope you will check out some of the sources i have provided and decide for yourself (and i hope you will not commit a fallacy of genetics as many skeptics do and actually allow the information to speak for itself). </p>

<p>Even if you are not, after reviewing the provided links in full, at least convinced that we need a new investigation into 9/11, I appreciate that you can see clearly that there is very serious corruption amongst our government and regardless of to what extent to entertain conspiracy theories, I hope you are working to expose what it is that you have been convinced of and help the people of this country understanding that things are not exactly as they seem. Above all else, I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me and being open and polite. </p>

<p>Lastly, I should note, i have no desire to argue with you. I have no desire to argue my sources&#39; quite extensive collection of information regarding 9/11–i believe they speak for themselves (and if they are inadequate then there is nothing i can say to sway you otherwise). I wasn&#39;t even expecting to write such an elaborate response, and in fact am worn out already simply from the polite conversation we&#39;ve had thus far. So, I simply present this on the chance that you will give it an honest, inductive inquiry. Again, thank for you reading and i wish the best to you. </p>

Also i just want to say, in looking through some of your post history, i can see that you are vocal about your stance on Syria (a stance i hold as well) and holding true to skepticism and logic (and holding members of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to the same standards) and that i truly appreciate it. Even though we may disagree on 9/11 i am glad to have someone such as yourself on reddit. Im sure the opinion of a conspiratard doesnt mean much  but i just wanted to express my appreciation. That is all. Cheers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the link but i&#39;m well read on the subject. you suggested that the way he is instructed to speak by his handlers is some occult conspiracy. i explained how that is a misguided extremist idea. there is no need to jump to conclusions. Additionally, in no way did I mention 9/11 or my opinions on what happened during the course of that day. i don&#39;t mean to be a dick but it appears that you define the reason people have negative ideas about anyone who questions the dominant narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think bush was and is still being coached on what to say regarding 9/11, really? That&#39;s quite a silly position to be in considering the only time he spoke officially about 9/11 was behind closed doors to the commission with dick Cheney not under oath. You have to be joking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just that there is no need for any freaky conspiracy angle to it. People go to elite universities and develop relationships. They have similar political interests which is generally the status quo. This is how it works everywhere in life. Maybe they have some secret clubsy thing with a mysterious name because they&#39;re a bunch of young dicks who want to make a big deal about their status and career expectations. As well, logically, some of them hold dirt over eachother and yes that could easily play a part in high level goings-on. Really though, why does that even matter now that it&#39;s official that the NSA is keeping track anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well who gets to use that information held by the NSA? The established powerful. Just like the banks there are people who, politically, are &#39;too big to fail&#39;. There are very few routes to these levels of political power and most start from birth, so we should defiantly keep an eye on these routes (like via skull and bones). Also, it is a crazy conspiracy IMO, but really  its just semantics. The disillusionment created by these processes is what causes people to jump all over 9/11 bullshit, which should be corrected, but also seen as a symptom of a sickness in the current political climate that we need to be aware of.   </p>

Apparently it&#39;s okay to say &quot;organized plot&quot; but not &quot;conspiracy&quot;.

<p>I don&#39;t believe this for a second.  Maybe 5% of that 5% are, but that&#39;s about it.  And, really, that 5% of the 5% are the ones we need to rail against this shit for.

<p>That&#39;s <em>entirely</em> the point.  It was a biased piece.  The only &quot;censorship&quot; I saw was when his polling numbers weren&#39;t included.  That&#39;s about it.  And, to be fair, they weren&#39;t included because the RNC wasn&#39;t going to allow him to be their candidate.  That is to say:  he didn&#39;t matter, and neither did his polling numbers - not as a Republican candidate.</p>

<p>Oh, I realize he gets support - I just think it&#39;s from a very, very vocal minority.  A very, very small minority at that.  People here in Texas won&#39;t vote for him, and there are more Libertarian candidates on ballots here than there are Republicans.</p>

<p>Based on the fact out of all the people I&#39;ve ever actually met in 5 states over the past several years, only maybe 3 or 4 were Paul supporters.  All of the rest, to a man, think he&#39;s a batshit crazy motherfucker.</p>

<p>Those 3 or 4 people were crazy vocal about him though - to the point that I never wanted to be anywhere near them because it&#39;s all they talked about.  Kinda like a newly baptized born-again Evangelical.  Or a Mormon.  Or a vegan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, what are you basing this on? With a dozen people you talked to? Or the television?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I deal with a whole, whole lot of people here in central Texas.  One of my favorite things to talk about is Politics.  I&#39;ve only been in the state a few years, but the general Libertarian atmosphere fascinates me, so I like to talk about it quite a bit.  I&#39;ve met less people here who would vote for Paul than I did in the Washington DC metro area.  They <em>loathe</em> the guy.  The few that do support him are just like the ones back east - they won&#39;t shut the fuck up about it and they have very, very few friends because of it.</p>

<p>Several hundred.</p>

<p>Riddle me this, Batman:</p>

<p>When Paul ran as in Independent what percentage of the vote did he get?  How did he poll?</p>

<p>You do realize that most of the polls being quoted elsewhere in this thread only poll about 1200 people, right?</p>

<p>After the 2010 midterm elections, Silver concluded that Rasmussen&#39;s polls were the least accurate of the major pollsters in 2010, having an average error of 5.8 points and a pro-Republican bias of 3.9 points according to Silver&#39;s model.[64] He singled out as an example the Hawaii Senate race, in which Rasmussen, in a poll completed three weeks before the election, showed incumbent Daniel Inouye only 13 points ahead, whereas in actuality he won by a 53% margin[80] – a difference of 40 points from Rasmussen&#39;s poll, or &quot;the largest error ever recorded in a general election in FiveThirtyEight’s database, which includes all polls conducted since 1998.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to explore other factors which may have explained the effect such as the use of a likely voter model,[76] and claimed that Rasmussen conducted its polls in a way that excluded the majority of the population from answering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rasmussen has received criticism over the wording in its polls.[86][87] Asking a polling question with different wording can affect the results of the poll;[88] the commentators in question allege that the questions Rasmussen ask in polls are skewed in order to favor a specific response. For instance, when Rasmussen polled whether Republican voters thought Rush Limbaugh was the leader of their party, the specific question they asked was: &quot;Agree or Disagree: &#39;Rush Limbaugh is the leader of the Republican Party — he says jump and they say how high.&#39;&quot;</p>

But regardless he almost won the first few states, and things could have been much different if he had. Up until the national convention, Paul supporters had hope that he could have won.

<p>You must be a teenager because there&#39;s no way that you&#39;ve voted before 2012. You would know the difference between a primary and a general election. March, when that poll was taken, was in the middle of the primaries. And PPP took national polls every month, they all looked pretty much identical to that one. In fact the closer you got to the election you saw his support grow slightly as people talked (since he was rarely given TV time). There was even a poll right before the general that showed the same thing, that Ron Paul had better chances against Obama. Probably because many Obama supporters knew Ron Paul was more of a peace candidate than Romney or Obama. </p>

<p>Put as much money behind Paul as Romney had, and it would&#39;ve been a landslide victory. However, no special interests want an independent thinker in the oval office. Not the banks, not the corporations, not the unions, not the public workers, just about the only interest (donations) he got was from active duty military. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rofl. This is a picture perfect example of a ignorant and uninformed conservative that gobbles up everything the MSM tells him.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you never saw this commercial? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHFOZC8ock4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHFOZC8ock4</a></p>

<p>Or that the ACLU scored Ron Paul higher than Obama? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrAXfIdRqmU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrAXfIdRqmU</a></p>

<p>Or that a president of the NAACP defends ron Paul? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXIjq1Y43xk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXIjq1Y43xk</a></p>

<p>Fucking STUPID ass sheep.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know what a straw poll is either apparently. Nor a Primary, versus a General. </p>

<p>You are a good example of an idiot in the military you speak of. </p>

<p>And no rand paul isn&#39;t any more or less racist than his LIBER-FUCKING-TARIAN father. How can you take seriously the accusation that a libertarian is racist? That is completely by definition not libertarian. He is the most un-racist candidate to run, including Obama. </p>

<p>Not only that, Racism is dead, it has been for decades. <a href="http://youtu.be/G_sGn6PdmIo">http://youtu.be/G_sGn6PdmIo</a> </p>

<p>That is, unless we&#39;re talking about the government. Racism is in taxes, benefits, and the justice system. Not in business, politics, or public places. And Obama is doing far less about it than Rand or Ron would.</p>

<p>Wake the fuck up, seriously. It&#39;s a good thing we&#39;re not talking face to face or I&#39;d be strangling you by now. </p>

<p>The newsletter is his. He didn&#39;t write them. Are you familiar with ghostwriting...? Mr. I been an adult since 1986...Every politician or political figure has a ghostwriter or maybe more than one. Saying Ron Paul wrote the newsletter is like saying Obama writes his fundraising e-mails.</p>

<p>90% of the newsletters didn&#39;t have any &#39;racist slurs&#39; in them. It&#39;s one newsletter that everyone talks about. It&#39;s obvious that he never read that particular one.</p>

<p>Regardless, you&#39;re going to need more proof than a ghostwritten newsletter to make the case that a libertarian is a racist. That doesn&#39;t fucking add up at all. The narrative needs to fit the facts. The fact is Ron Paul has spoken out against racist government ways, more than 90% of congress has. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not anti-racist it&#39;s constitutionalist. If you don&#39;t like it change the constitution. Regardless, that&#39;s not what he says.

<p>You&#39;re a conspiracy theorist, you realize that? You&#39;re saying someone read something 25 years ago, with absolutely no proof. And it&#39;s unbelievable because ron paul is a equal-rights activist.</p>

<p>He did not back up any racist shit. It&#39;s your pea brain incapable of understanding there&#39;s a difference between believing in law, and believing what the law stands for.</p>

<p>The law is that state&#39;s decide everything that designated to the federal government in the constitution. The law is also that the government cannot discriminate. There is no law that people cannot discriminate. Not until the civil rights act, which was actually not about civil rights and didn&#39;t accomplish anything.</p>

<p>He would allow states to pass discriminatory laws.  That&#39;s institutionalized.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not exactly true.  Allowing such laws to pass is tacit approval.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s saying people have the right to discriminate, by the constitution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they don&#39;t - another example of Paul not knowing what the fuck he&#39;s talking about.  He&#39;s just looking for a way to get his racist agenda out there in the main stream.</p>

<p>I suppose you&#39;re unaware of the 14th Amendment, and specifically the Equal Protection Clause.  Let me share with you:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re a conspiracy theorist, you realize that? </p>

<p>No.  This is reality. It&#39;s not a conspiracy and it&#39;s not a theory.  He had racist shit published under his name, he backed up that racist shit until he was called out on it.  Then he acted like he wasn&#39;t even aware that it was written.  What about this is confusing for you?  Surely you can&#39;t actually be this stupid, can you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not until the civil rights act, which was actually not about civil rights and didn&#39;t accomplish anything.</p>

<p>I take that back - you actually <em>are</em> that stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup exactly. How can people know what to do to improve the world unless they are aware of what&#39;s actually happening? </p>

<p>But first to make the improvements to the media, it seems we must change the laws and enforce them equally (even  put some powerful and rich people in jail for financial and media and monopoly/collusion crimes), which would also entail regaining control of our government from corporations and big money interests. It is a monumental task, but one worth undertaking. Imagine a government that worked <em>for</em> the people, instead of against us. Life could be so much better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the only reason he gets as much TV time as he does is because there is at least enough demand from supporters for them to deem him worthy enough from a viewer-base perspective (maybe with online content particularly). But I also think they don&#39;t like to give too much airtime to certain ideas/perspectives. So it&#39;s about striking that balance between appearing to give opposing perspectives fair time/treatment, but not allowing them to outweigh or possibly sway the viewer from the perspective they&#39;re <em>trying</em> to reinforce.</p>

<p>Just my opinion, of course. I&#39;ve read and listened to a lot of Chomsky, so I&#39;m probably a bit more suspicious of mainstream media than the average person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>WikiLeaks cables show that the US had been funneling money to Syria&#39;s opposition for several years,</strong> even as it tried to reengage with President Assad&#39;s government.</p>

<p>By Ariel Zirulnick, Correspondent / <strong>April 18, 2011</strong></p>

<p>Newly released WikiLeaks cables reveal that the <strong>US State Department has been secretly financing Syrian opposition groups and other opposition projects for at least five years</strong>, The Washington Post reports.</p>

<p>That aid continued going into the hands of the Syrian government opposition even after the US began its reengagement policy with Syria under President Barack Obama in 2009, the Post reports. In January, the US posted its first ambassador to the country since the Bush administration withdrew the US ambassador in 2005 over concerns about Syria&#39;s involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri.</p>

<p>The Obama administration has been trying to draw Syria away from its key ally Iran and closer to the US and its regional allies. The effort seems to have been largely unsuccessful so far, and antigovernment protests sweeping the country have complicated the issue. The US is struggling to determine how to support Syria&#39;s democratic protesters while not alienating the Assad government, which has cracked down brutally on demonstrations and blamed them on &quot;foreign saboteurs,&quot; as The Christian Science Monitor reported last week.</p>

<p>Cables reveal covert US support for Syria&#39;s opposition</p>

<p>By Ariel Zirulnick, Correspondent / April 18, 2011 (Christian Science Monitor)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is a dilemma that concerned the US government even before the protests began. <strong>The author of an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/wikileaks-syria/cable1.html">April 2009 cable</a> expressed concern that some of the projects being funded by the US, if discovered by the Syrian government, would be perceived as &quot;an attempt to undermine the Asad [sic] regime</strong>, as opposed to encouraging behavior reform.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post reported that <strong>much of the money – as much as $6 million since 2006 – has been funneled through a group of Syrian exiles in London, known as the Movement for Justice and Development. The group is connected to a London-based satellite television station that is broadcast in Syria, known as Barada TV</strong>, which has recently expanded its coverage to include the mass protests. </p>

<p>Several other civil society initiatives in Syria received secret US funding, but by 2009, US officials were concerned that the Syrian government had discovered the US funding. The Post was unable to confirm whether programs are still being funded, but cables indicate the funding was planned at least through September 2010.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Barrie Zwicker&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Towers-Deception-The-Media-Cover-up/dp/0865715734">Towers of Deception</a>&quot;:</p>

<p>&quot;An odd thing occurs about 10 minutes into my interview.  CJBK lost its transmission signal around the time I was expressing my opinion that the bombings were not the work of al Qaeda or such at all, but most likely the work of black operators in Western intelligence.  The show&#39;s producer came on the line during a commercial break to tell me of the loss of signal.  I asked him how often this happened.  &quot;Never,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>(Five days later on July 12, I was being interviewed by Meria Heller for her webcast program seen in 60 countries.  About 10 minutes in, a listener contacted her on Yahoo! Messenger to report that she was &quot;off the air.&quot;  Meria told me this had not happened in four years, since shortly after 9/11.  A few minutes later her Yahoo! Messenger went down.)</p>

<p>This day I place a call to Webster G. Tarpley, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/11-Synthetic-Terror-Made-USA/dp/1615771115/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1378257137&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=synthetic+terror">9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA</a> to get some information.  While we&#39;re on the line he tells me that when he was on Pacifica&#39;s WBAI New York for a fund-raising drive, a short time before, &quot;all the telephones went haywire.&quot;  The station staff had to improvise in order to take calls and pledges.  As the &quot;coincidences&quot; piled up I wondered whether covert operators were sending signals to the 9/11 Truth movement and to those media that would give us time, that they were monitoring us and letting us know they could escalate from &quot;shots across the bow&quot; to more serious disruption.  I took these surveillance and disruption events to be positive.  I took them to mean the dark forces of the Anglo-American establishment now considered the 9/11Truth movement more than a minor irritant to be monitored, but perhaps a major irritant to be disabled.  This would mean that their masters, with their superior psycho-political measuring instruments, had begun to see us as a threat.  This, if true, would be the equivalent of a campaign victory in a conventional war.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 2000 primaries Ron Paul was winning straw polls and surging in the polls. CNN finally ran a short piece on him, and the piece also ran for a day on Headline News channel. I heard it was going to be on so I watched Headline News waiting for it to air since the channel loops the same stories. The segment came on and a commercial immediately, and abruptly aired. The commercial ended and the segment was still on. Two seconds later another, longer commercial came on and by the time it ended, the segment was over. I used to watch Headline News regularly and never saw anything like this ever happen. The odds of it being a technical problem is almost zero. </p>

<p>&quot;<em>You&#39;re not blaming the US for the civil war in Syria, over the past 2 and a half years, that have already resulted in more than 100,000 people dead?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>And then Paul has no response, and then all the viewers are left with is Blitzer&#39;s dumbass <em>assumption</em> of the situation in Syria, rather than a valid rebuttal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, i respect this guy a ton. Regardless of me not being American or subscribing to his religious views. He&#39;s one of the only politicians i&#39;ve ever seen who actually tells things as they are. Though, if he were ever to be elected president (unlikely) would his integrity still be intact?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about American politics tbh, but how much power does he hold at the minute? I do believe that power corrupts people, and i&#39;d like to think with the highest power available, he would still be the same guy, but i don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>And yeah, the media is fucking bullshit. I can&#39;t believe people put up with this blatant censorship. I can&#39;t believe Paul does either, but what&#39;s he gonna do i suppose? Stop giving interviews?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I contacted the FCC last year about a conflict of interest in their journalism based on defense contracts from sister companies.  And talked about how they lie on air.  Here is how the FCC responded. </p>

<p>&quot;Although the FCC licenses broadcast stations, we have virtually no control over the content of what they air.  That’s because stations enjoy freedom of speech under the First Amendment.  Further, there is a section of the Communications Act, which established the FCC in 1934, that specifically prohibits this agency from censoring or dictating the content of programming.  That means that stations (and networks) are free to air pretty much whatever they want (short of obscenity or indecency), even if the material is false, misleading, or slanted.  &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see this one, so I can&#39;t comment on it. I did follow the last election pretty closely, though. It was a common thing to see him get skipped in debates, cut off during interviews, and basically just ignored entirely... when he wasn&#39;t being made fun of or the target of someone who wanted to make him look like a fringe lunatic. As an ardent Ron Paul supporter, this confused, saddened, and angered me, especially since it often felt like I was the only one who noticed or cared about what was going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your observation about media manipulation and bias, this just doesn&#39;t seem to be a very good example.</p>

<p>Generally the manipulation is more subtle and consists of miss-reporting of events (eg Egyptian Brotherhood burning Churches when the little evidence available points to supporters of the Military doing this), repeating a &#39;big lie&#39; (eg Israel is only democratic Government in Middle East), miss-characterisation of groups (is it ever mentioned that Hamas runs orphanages, schools, hospitals, medical centres and ambulance service ? And has done for several decades ? )  and includes only reporting from embedded journalists (who have an inter-dependancy with their information source, be it Military or Political ).</p>

<p>This incident may have been a mistake, and Paul did get his point across well and was given reasonable time to speak, I suspect they will pull the plug (sorry, experience a technical error) on him at a more crucial time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After watching CNN off/on for the past few days/weeks, I can assure you that MOST of the Republicans they&#39;ve had on have been pro-intervention. And when Ron/Rand are brought up at all, it&#39;s almost always in association with the term <strong>isolationist</strong> (which they then explain is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible). Most people on CNN seem pretty certain about the &quot;fact&quot; that Assad was responsible for the recent attack, and that we <em>should</em> do something about it. Though the Republicans do like to criticize Obama&#39;s handling of the situation in general, while the Democrats generally praise his every move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Ron Paul is a nutcase</p>

<p>However - I also think he&#39;s one the most honest men in politics right now, and he&#39;s correct about most of what he says. He wants to expose an obviously corrupt system and reform it into something that works for everyone.</p>

<p>But he just sounds batty as hell, exactly the kind of &quot;tinfoil hat&quot; job that can be easily dismissed and discredited.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>EDIT: at the same time, I think maybe the general public is starting to give more credibility to &quot;conspiracy nuts&quot; who are turning out to be right about a lot of major stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah - I guess maybe it&#39;s both.</p>

<p>At this point, getting on television and simply saying what you actually believe without being coached by an entire team of PR specialists <em>is crazy</em></p>

<p>He&#39;s honest and truthful, he just says what he means and doesn&#39;t care if people like him or don&#39;t like him for it. Kind of proven by the fact that many people <em>don&#39;t</em> like him and he keeps doing the same thing anyway. It&#39;s not a popularity contest for him, it&#39;s running the damned country.</p>

<p>So yeah, I guess I do think he&#39;s a nutcase <em>and</em> I think he&#39;s right about much of his ideas. And even if I disagree with him, I can respect that he sticks with what he actually believes instead of just saying whatever I&#39;ll agree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I voted for Obama in <del>2004 and 2008</del> - because I thought he would be different.</p>

<p>EDIT: doh! I meant 2008 and 2012. Wrote this post in kind of a hurry, should have double checked these things.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what we were told too, that he was different from the others. Obama wasn&#39;t going to be a pawn of the corporate party, he can&#39;t be bought by lobbyists. He&#39;s going to end the wars, improve the budget, and improve the economy.</p>

<p>And now, he&#39;s done very little of that.</p>

<p>The economy has improved, although not as much as anyone would have hoped. We have withdrawn a significant number of military presence out of Afganistan. But we&#39;re still involved in so many wars, our nation commits crimes against the world as well as its own people, we&#39;re not improving in anything other than war.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>So all those things that I wanted from Obama, it seems like Ron Paul is all of those things. I used to think voting for a 3rd party candidate was throwing away your vote, now I&#39;m starting to think voting for one of the main parties is throwing away your vote.</p>

<p>If he runs again, I might vote for the guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does he sound &quot;batty&quot; to you? I&#39;m honestly curious. I disagree with him on several pretty big issues (I used to be more libertarian, now I&#39;m more anarcho-socialist...which isn&#39;t extremely far off except I&#39;ve become <em>very</em> anti-capitalist), but he&#39;s always sounded very well-read and informed to me. I&#39;ve never understood how he comes off as &quot;batshit crazy&quot; to people. Maybe it has something to do with his excited energy when talking about certain things? For me, that was part of what made me initially take interest in him...seeing someone who seemed genuinely passionate about those issues. Is it his character or his ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe being passionate can be mistaken for being manic</p>

<p>I guess that &quot;nutcase&quot; is more of a personality trait than a specific statement or issue. Some of his ideas are drastically different than what is considered normal (abolishing the federal reserve, abolishing public schools, eliminating the FDA). He speaks and behaves in a manic fashion, he seems obsessive and dangerously impulsive.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>But at the same time, he&#39;s saying what a lot of people are thinking. His ideas are very much counter to established norms, but many people are starting to disagree with the established norms.</p>

<p>He wants to stop harshly criminalizing drugs, stop meddling in the affairs of other countries, stop being the world police, stop infringing on domestic civil rights, stop making people dependent on government money, stop telling people what they can&#39;t do in their own homes, stop telling people who they can&#39;t have sex with, stop telling people what they can&#39;t own.</p>

<p>Lots of people seem to want our government to stop working against us and start working for us. </p>

<p>.</p>

<p>I disagree with him on a lot of things, and I don&#39;t claim to fully understand the consequences of some of his ideas. He wants to privatize stuff like medical care and education, I&#39;m not sure how that would affect things - it seems like that&#39;s a government service we <em>want</em> to keep around.</p>

<p>But I respect him for being genuine about it, he doesn&#39;t just say whatever will make him popular. He doesn&#39;t treat government like a popularity contest and he doesn&#39;t seem to be there for personal gain. So I can respect that.</p>

<p>TV serves to keep you distracted and consuming, <em>even football</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but lets be fair here. Bush probably meant Al Qaeda or other terrorist organizations conspiring against the United States, not the government planning an attack on it&#39;s own people. I think he&#39;s inferring that he hopes that these attacks are just the two bombers, rather than them being controlled by an organized group who may plot more attacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just that there is no need for any freaky conspiracy angle to it. People go to elite universities and develop relationships. They have similar political interests which is generally the status quo. This is how it works everywhere in life. Maybe they have some secret clubsy thing with a mysterious name because they&#39;re a bunch of young dicks who want to make a big deal about their status and career expectations. As well, logically, some of them hold dirt over eachother and yes that could easily play a part in high level goings-on. Really though, why does that even matter now that it&#39;s official that the NSA is keeping track anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in the original obama care you weren&#39;t able to choose your own doctor. Sure, you would get the whole treatment but some people just like the benefit of choosing their doctor because after all if they&#39;re paying for it they want some of the best treatment. </p>

<p>Higher Premiums and High Taxes is coming from Obama Care as well, i understand that some countries have free schooling and free healthcare though when you live in america and have a 8% tax, here in texas it&#39;s 8.025%, higher taxes may scare some people into not buying things even though it would be little to no difference. In lower income homes that 10 cents per purchase will scare some people into not buying things because it just &quot;adds up&quot;. We&#39;re already starting to higher the minimum wage though i am a bit afraid what they will be doing is say well ok, we&#39;ll higher the minimum wage but we&#39;re also going to higher the taxes for &quot;this other reason&quot;, which will in turn get you less money. </p>

<p>If i missed anything or if i got something wrong feel free to correct me on that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed that too.  In my opinion there is a clear difference, at least to what the words would mean in my mind.  Isolationist would be a country completely shut off from the outside world, limiting trade, etc.   Non intervention means we don&#39;t stick our nose in other countrys&#39; affairs. </p>

<p>isolationists are like those rich people living in a gated community with armed guards and strict HOA,  shut off from the outside world</p>
