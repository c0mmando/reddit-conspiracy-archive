       Wolf Blitzer was having a discussion with Ron Paul and a Democrat Congressman regarding Syria. As Ron Paul began going off about how THE PEOPLE are against this war and started talking about the vote in British Parliament, he suddenly got cut off and pulled from the show (his screen went blue). This same "technical error" always happens to Paul...

       <em>

       simply a technical error, just suggesting another possibility. That's what this subreddit is for, after all.)

       That was so blatant. They're not even trying to hide it anymore. Before they "lost" his satellite feed, Blitzer was shuffling him off saying they had little time, right before a FIVE MINUTE schlock self-promo fest with Newt and Van Jones who had NOTHING TO SAY.

       Kudos to Paul for even going back on the air with them even if only to show what hypocrites they are.

       I liked "isolationists...non - interventionists like yourself". He knows if he just says isolationists (basically a slur for non interventionists) Ron will put him in his place, so he then follows with noninterventionists but isolationist is still on your mind.

       I noticed that too.  In my opinion there is a clear difference, at least to what the words would mean in my mind.  Isolationist would be a country completely shut off from the outside world, limiting trade, etc.   Non intervention means we don't stick our nose in other countrys' affairs.

       isolationists are like those rich people living in a gated community with armed guards and strict HOA,  shut off from the outside world

       Why would a US politician promote the idea that we caused the civil war in Syria? They wouldnt for any logical reason, so what else could have been the point of it, other then make him look bad and give him no chance to respond?

       Yeah, I was watching that one live when it happened as well. I've been following Paul pretty closely since '07, and have seen similar things happen to him several times in the past. Considering how little attention he actually gets in MSM relative to other politicians (with the amount of support he has), it's very strange how often these "technical errors" occur for him/his ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I also noticed the Wolf Blitzer connection. Maybe it's all that Ron Paul Israel talk he/his producers try to avoid. Also, notice Rand's smile

       It's simple. In the US "democracy", citizens have no say on the composition of their "money", the countries the president sends the armed forces into, or the "laws" enacted by their bought-off legislature. They
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have inconsequential safety valve issues like those you mentioned where all kinds of "controversy" is endlessly debated. The winners of those debates think they're making a difference cause "the system works". Then everyone goes back to watching basketball and cop shows.

       i actually thought obama was going to do great things, during his campaigning i rooted for him so much. some people said i just didn't want to be racist but with that said a lot of the things he said he changed his mind right after presidency. Sure, he went in and tried to do obama care though KNOWING it was pretty much unconstitutional with his original idea. Then you know what, it's SO GREAT that congress doesn't even have to have it! Wow! Well now that it's changed. Seriously though, obamas views changed drastically ... yet so few really realize it.

       In Many other countries around the world, health is free!  I went to hospital a few times in the UK and Australia and paid nothing after it, because both countries Healthcare comes out of my taxes I pay. And I don't mind paying for my fellow citizen.

       Well in the original obama care you weren't able to choose your own doctor. Sure, you would get the whole treatment but some people just like the benefit of choosing their doctor because after all if they're paying for it they want some of the best treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Higher Premiums and High Taxes is coming from Obama Care as well, i understand that some countries have free schooling and free healthcare though when you live in america and have a 8% tax, here in texas it's 8.025%, higher taxes may scare some people into not buying things even though it would be little to no difference. In lower income homes that 10 cents per purchase will scare some people into not buying things because it just "adds up". We're already starting to higher the minimum wage though i am a bit afraid what they will be doing is say well ok, we'll higher the minimum wage but we're also going to higher the taxes for "this other reason", which will in turn get you less money.

       Or it's possible that GW, being the poor wordsmith that he is, stopped himself from saying conspiracy because he knew that a few people would jump on that term. What's funny is that it was a conspiracy and so was 9/11... Al Quada planning the attacks and the two kids planning the bombings was a conspiracy in every sense of the word so calling it a conspiracy is accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say that he almost admitted 911 was an inside job because he called boston a conspiracy is a HUGE leap and its those very leaps that discredit this place. It's sad.. Because our government is shady and they will lie to us but the real conspiracies like the Gulf of Tonkin or WMDs in Iraq get overlooked because they aren't nearly as interesting as something like our government being behind 9/11 or the secret illuminati shadow government pulling all the strings.

       As a 'conspiracist', i agree with everything you have said except for the part where you are certain that the 9/11 official story is true or that there isnt a shadow government who more or less 'controls' how things work. However it seems that admittance is important to you, in which case i would just like to point out some other things which are a matter of public record: Operation Chaos Northwoods, Gladio, Paperclip and mockingbird.

       But I never said I believe the official story. Not thinking 9/11 was an inside job =/= believing all of the details we were given. I think the US dropped the ball leading up to 911 which was detailed by Richard Clark. I think that the FBI and CIA dropped the ball and they did everything they could to cover up their mistakes... But ultimately I think that OBL lead the attacks in a very organized and well funded mission and the notion of remote control planes, controlled demolitions, cruise missiles hitting the pentagon in plain site etc.. Are absolutely silly.  And again, they do more to harm exposing true government corruption by diverting attention or discrediting those who criticize the govt.

       Right. I should have been a been a little more tactical in my word choice—when i say 'believe the official story' i simply meant that the belief that 9/11 was committed by OBL. I think it's pretty clear to most people who have spent even a little time researching 9/11 that the
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       words of the official story are not accurate.

      <p>
       I would argue that 'dropped the ball' is very much an understatement. There were literally dozens of warnings months before the attacks, the NORAD response was abysmal, terrabytes of data on Able Danger were destroyed, and much more. After reviewing
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1korgs/the_official_megalist_of_911_suspicious/">
        the circumstances of what happened on 9/11 and what was subsequently done about it
       </a>
       in their entirety, I find it very hard for someone to honestly argue that these attacks were not at least
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       to happen. Of course, I'm sure we disagree. On a side note: My favorite film on 9/11 would be
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AJ056Ajqd0">
        9/11: Press For Truth
       </a>
       —I think it will jive fairly well with you (Mostly about the commission report and the circumstances around it). Also I think it is hard to argue that members of the 'permanent government'  at least
       <a href="http://wikispooks.com/ISGP/911/911_WTC_part_2_who_did_it.htm">
        had the means and motive to commit 9/11
       </a>
       . Who actually did it and how of course we will never know for sure until we get an actual investigation into 9/11 (If you are satisfied with the 9/11 comission report I think 9/11: Press For Truth might cause you to reconsider).

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Unless I am ill informed, I am of the understanding that this is based on little more than speculation and that there is no empirical evidence to suggest that the planes were remote controlled. And, again assumming i am privy to all the facts, I don't think any critically-thinking conspiracy-minded individual would claim more (Of course, I'm sure we are both well aware that being interested in conspiracies doesnt [sp fix!] mean one is capable of using inductive reasoning to the extent required when researching this information). I wont take it out of the realm of possibility though,  as hijackers 'chickening out' would be terribly unfortunate for whomever it was that orchestrated these attacks–especially if without 9/11 there would be no excuse to invade half a dozen countries, absolve the constitution, or transform the US into a totalitarian state–but i of course dont hold it as a thoroughly substantiated piece of the puzzle.

      <p>
       This one never sat well with me, as I always didn't understand why they would use a missile over a plane (unnecessary complications), or why the claimed 'hole proving a missile' was a different wall than those of the pentagon (because it was in the interior hole where the nose poked through), among other things. However, I think it's pretty clear that the damage is consistent with a 757 when viewed in it's entirety. unfortunately many conspiracy researchers subscribe to the  missile theory, and unfortunately many people, even those of fair evidentialism, have only seen the evidence when it is cherry picked, like in documentaries such as In Plane Site or Loose Change, resulting ill informed understandings. I believe

        this write up

      <p>
       I am fully with you that there are a lot of 'conspiracy theories', even ones regarding 9/11 (such as the missle-pentagon theory or the hologram or HAARP or any of the other stuff) that do more harm than good, however I would argue that 9/11 as a whole is not one of these. of course, i wouldn't expect you to or at all want you to believe me,  but I do sincerely hope you will check out some of the sources i have provided and decide for yourself (and i hope you will not commit a fallacy of genetics as many skeptics do and actually allow the information to speak for itself).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you are not, after reviewing the provided links in full, at least convinced that we need a new investigation into 9/11, I appreciate that you can see clearly that there is very serious corruption amongst our government and regardless of to what extent to entertain conspiracy theories, I hope you are working to expose what it is that you have been convinced of and help the people of this country understanding that things are not exactly as they seem. Above all else, I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me and being open and polite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I should note, i have no desire to argue with you. I have no desire to argue my sources' quite extensive collection of information regarding 9/11–i believe they speak for themselves (and if they are inadequate then there is nothing i can say to sway you otherwise). I wasn't even expecting to write such an elaborate response, and in fact am worn out already simply from the polite conversation we've had thus far. So, I simply present this on the chance that you will give it an honest, inductive inquiry. Again, thank for you reading and i wish the best to you.

       Sorry for so many comments. I reworded some stuff in the post so hopefully it is a little more up to par. Also i just want to say, in looking through some of your post history, i can see that you are vocal about your stance on Syria (a stance i hold as well) and holding true to skepticism and logic (and holding members of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to the same standards) and that i truly appreciate it. Even though we may disagree on 9/11 i am glad to have someone such as yourself on reddit. Im sure the opinion of a conspiratard doesnt mean much  but i just wanted to express my appreciation. That is all. Cheers.

       Okay, but lets be fair here. Bush probably meant Al Qaeda or other terrorist organizations conspiring against the United States, not the government planning an attack on it's own people. I think he's inferring that he hopes that these attacks are just the two bombers, rather than them being controlled by an organized group who may plot more attacks.

       it's no secret that they have hardcore PR people instructing them. their interviews are orchestrated presentations and he simply started using one of the words that he was coached not to use. And yeah, he was just coached by someone who went to school to study public relations and worked really hard and got lucky enough to ply their trade at the highest levels. No outrageous conspiracy...

       thanks for the link but i'm well read on the subject. you suggested that the way he is instructed to speak by his handlers is some occult conspiracy. i explained how that is a misguided extremist idea. there is no need to jump to conclusions. Additionally, in no way did I mention 9/11 or my opinions on what happened during the course of that day. i don't mean to be a dick but it appears that you define the reason people have negative ideas about anyone who questions the dominant narrative.

       You don't think bush was and is still being coached on what to say regarding 9/11, really? That's quite a silly position to be in considering the only time he spoke officially about 9/11 was behind closed doors to the commission with dick Cheney not under oath. You have to be joking.

       i normally wouldn't say it quite like this: your reading and comprehension skills are awful and i'm not sure why i'm still talking to you. my post was about how politicians are coached by the PR people on payroll and how there was nothing occult about it like you suggested re skulls and bones masters or some nonsense like that. of course he's being coached. that was what my initial reply to you was about. and how you're a moron if you think it's necessary to the narrative to mention something like skulls and bones.

       they don't have a bizarre occult ranking system. they have the titles and roles we know them to have. they meet at the bilderberg group formally and they are probably also friends and hang out at the fancy vacation spots in the world. obviously the richest most powerful people in the world are going to work to maintain their power. but no special symbols are needed to spice up the story.

       It's just that there is no need for any freaky conspiracy angle to it. People go to elite universities and develop relationships. They have similar political interests which is generally the status quo. This is how it works everywhere in life. Maybe they have some secret clubsy thing with a mysterious name because they're a bunch of young dicks who want to make a big deal about their status and career expectations. As well, logically, some of them hold dirt over eachother and yes that could easily play a part in high level goings-on. Really though, why does that even matter now that it's official that the NSA is keeping track anyways.

       Well who gets to use that information held by the NSA? The established powerful. Just like the banks there are people who, politically, are 'too big to fail'. There are very few routes to these levels of political power and most start from birth, so we should defiantly keep an eye on these routes (like via skull and bones). Also, it is a crazy conspiracy IMO, but really  its just semantics. The disillusionment created by these processes is what causes people to jump all over 9/11 bullshit, which should be corrected, but also seen as a symptom of a sickness in the current political climate that we need to be aware of.

       The fact that he was hesitant to say it and it was cut-worthy for the producers says a lot.  Apparently it's okay to say "organized plot" but not "conspiracy".  Plus he prefixes "another" so that would infer 911 was a conspiracy; but wasn't 911 an organized plot?  It's all just bizarre.  I can't remember Bush ever referring to the official story as a conspiracy.  They used a lot of other words but left that one out as far as I can remember.

       interesting vid, but a reply there pointed out that he said "const-", not "consp-", and if you review it, you can both hear and see that they're right. dunno what const- would have been the beginning of but, probably something a bit more benign. Then again the fact that they edited it out strange.

       and they gave Ron Paul a good amount of time to talk - so I can't really feel that upset about it. Sure, I think that CNN are just propagandists for war, but I knew that already... the fact they let Ron Paul talk at such length without interruption is something to be encouraged...

       I agree with this, and I believe they understand that Paul has a pretty big base of support (especially online...they used to always mention the amount of messages they'd receive from supporters whenever he was on). It's just strange to me how many times I've seen something like this happen to him. Maybe this happens to the other former presidential candidates just as often (while they're discussing something that the host is obviously in disagreement with), but I've only seen it happen to Paul.

       But that 5% is a very politically active 5%, unlike most other candidates' supporters. Like I mentioned, they used to always talk about the amount of feedback they'd receive when having Ron on. Ron Paul's rallies were the size of all the other candidates' rallies combined typically (and the majority of

       I don't believe this for a second.  Maybe 5% of that 5% are, but that's about it.  And, really, that 5% of the 5% are the ones we need to rail against this shit for.  Those people are fucking

       I live in Texas Hill Country where Ron Paul is nearly considered a God.  His followers aren't terribly politically active.  A buncha stoned slackers who barely know how to make enough money to have 2 nickels to rub together is much, much more like it.

       You think manipulation of the media and it's viewers is funny?

       You are in the first stage of denial. When presented evidence, you laugh it off since it conflicts with you personal views of what the world should be.

       It also doesn't matter if it's biased or not, because it's simply a compilation of the times he was cut off/censored/not mentioned, despite the polls showing great numbers.

       That's

       the point.  It was a biased piece.  The only "censorship" I saw was when his polling numbers weren't included.  That's about it.  And, to be fair, they weren't included because the RNC wasn't going to allow him to be their candidate.  That is to say:  he didn't matter, and neither did his polling numbers - not as a Republican candidate.

       Oh, I realize he gets support - I just think it's from a very, very vocal minority.  A very, very small minority at that.  People here in Texas won't vote for him, and there are more Libertarian candidates on ballots here than there are Republicans.

       Based on the fact out of all the people I've ever actually met in 5 states over the past several years, only maybe 3 or 4 were Paul supporters.  All of the rest, to a man, think he's a batshit crazy motherfucker.

      <p>
       Those 3 or 4 people were crazy vocal about him though - to the point that I never wanted to be anywhere near them because it's all they talked about.  Kinda like a newly baptized born-again Evangelical.  Or a Mormon.  Or a vegan.

       I deal with a whole, whole lot of people here in central Texas.  One of my favorite things to talk about is Politics.  I've only been in the state a few years, but the general Libertarian atmosphere fascinates me, so I like to talk about it quite a bit.  I've met less people here who would vote for Paul than I did in the Washington DC metro area.  They

       I understand the near lack of difference full well.  What I also understand is that the slightly less conservative Democrats are generally a more inclusive party than either the Libertarians or the Republicans.  Inclusiveness is what I desire, so that's the way I generally vote.

       Less than 5% sounds like a bullshit made up number. Just like the % of people who are ok with NSA spying. Talk to people in real life on the street and no one is ok with NSA surveillance but according to the media the majority is happy about it - more media lies. Just like the unemployment figures. The media is full of shit and help keep people from realizing the elections are fixed by throwing out numbers like 5%.

        After the 2010 midterm elections, Silver concluded that Rasmussen's polls were the least accurate of the major pollsters in 2010, having an average error of 5.8 points and a pro-Republican bias of 3.9 points according to Silver's model.[64] He singled out as an example the Hawaii Senate race, in which Rasmussen, in a poll completed three weeks before the election, showed incumbent Daniel Inouye only 13 points ahead, whereas in actuality he won by a 53% margin[80] – a difference of 40 points from Rasmussen's poll, or "the largest error ever recorded in a general election in FiveThirtyEight’s database, which includes all polls conducted since 1998."

        Rasmussen has received criticism over the wording in its polls.[86][87] Asking a polling question with different wording can affect the results of the poll;[88] the commentators in question allege that the questions Rasmussen ask in polls are skewed in order to favor a specific response. For instance, when Rasmussen polled whether Republican voters thought Rush Limbaugh was the leader of their party, the specific question they asked was: "Agree or Disagree: 'Rush Limbaugh is the leader of the Republican Party — he says jump and they say how high.'"

       Also, that poll was over 8 months ahead of the election.  Polls that early in the race very, very rarely reflect anything close to what happens in the primaries, and they almost never reflect anything even remotely close to what happens in the 2 weeks or so leading up to the election.

       Because he doesn't dance the music that is played by the campaign donors? That would include a few military contractors and some investment funds (isolationist libertarian that advocates gold standard). Nobody would finance the presidential campaign of Ron Paul except American public. And we all know American public cannot fight against transnational media-controlling corporations.

       They didn't like his "isolationist" foreign policy, the media was completely on Romney's balls, he's too old, there weren't enough special interests on his side, etc I could come up with dozens of reasons. But regardless he almost won the first few states, and things could have been much different if he had. Up until the national convention, Paul supporters had hope that he could have won. He actually came in second if you are counting delegates rather than the popular vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must be a teenager because there's no way that you've voted before 2012. You would know the difference between a primary and a general election. March, when that poll was taken, was in the middle of the primaries. And PPP took national polls every month, they all looked pretty much identical to that one. In fact the closer you got to the election you saw his support grow slightly as people talked (since he was rarely given TV time). There was even a poll right before the general that showed the same thing, that Ron Paul had better chances against Obama. Probably because many Obama supporters knew Ron Paul was more of a peace candidate than Romney or Obama.

       The one talking out of their ass here is you.  Let me explain this to you:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the GOP thought they had a candidate that could win an election they would have gone with that guy, specifically so they could appoint more Supreme Court Justices as some of our current justices retire.  This would secure them another 40 or 50 years of political dominance - pretty much everything else is just political theater for the plebes (read: us)

       The GOP thought Ron Paul was "too conservative" to win against Obama. The GOP is not some omniscient omnipotent deity, they made a mistake. Ron Paul was in fact more moderate than any of the other candidates. If you really believe we are plebes, then why do you think they would let someone as independent as Ron Paul in office?

       I'm sick of linking you factual information and you finding excuses to blow it off. People don't change their minds that much in 6 months, not without any scandals. PPP did national polls every month or so and if you find the latest one with Ron Paul VS Obama, you'll see it's still really close.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put as much money behind Paul as Romney had, and it would've been a landslide victory. However, no special interests want an independent thinker in the oval office. Not the banks, not the corporations, not the unions, not the public workers, just about the only interest (donations) he got was from active duty military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, you fucking said he has a base of 5%. And you were dead fucking wrong, and still are. I showed you numerous polls to contest that dumbassedry, and I think I'm done here. Just wait until his son runs in 2016 and keep an eye out for that "5%".

       You're linking bullshit straw polls from the primaries.  No one gives a shit.  They don't relate to what happens come election time in any real way - this is something that is widely known, so I'm pretty well amazed that you don't know it.

       And no rand paul isn't any more or less racist than his LIBER-FUCKING-TARIAN father. How can you take seriously the accusation that a libertarian is racist? That is completely by definition not libertarian. He is the most un-racist candidate to run, including Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, Racism is dead, it has been for decades.

       That is, unless we're talking about the government. Racism is in taxes, benefits, and the justice system. Not in business, politics, or public places. And Obama is doing far less about it than Rand or Ron would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake the fuck up, seriously. It's a good thing we're not talking face to face or I'd be strangling you by now.

       Regardless, you're going to need more proof than a ghostwritten newsletter to make the case that a libertarian is a racist. That doesn't fucking add up at all. The narrative needs to fit the facts. The fact is Ron Paul has spoken out against racist government ways, more than 90% of congress has.

       It's not anti-racist it's constitutionalist. If you don't like it change the constitution. Regardless, that's not what he says. He says he would allow business owners to discriminate. Not "institutionalized discrimination." And he doesn't condone it either. He's saying people have the right to discriminate, by the constitution. If you want to make discrimination illegal you need 2/3s vote in the congress and senate to amend the constitution, or you need to do it at the state/county level.

      <p>
       He did not back up any racist shit. It's your pea brain incapable of understanding there's a difference between believing in law, and believing what the law stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law is that state's decide everything that designated to the federal government in the constitution. The law is also that the government cannot discriminate. There is no law that people cannot discriminate. Not until the civil rights act, which was actually not about civil rights and didn't accomplish anything.

       A state may not deny a person equal protection. That means a state can't pass a discriminatory law.  I think you can figure the rest out from there, Six Degree.

       As a Paul supporter myself, I was enraged at the title, but then watched with angst as I expected Dr. Paul get blue-screened. But it didn't quite work out the way OP suggested. Dr. Paul finished his statements, Mr. Blitzer asked Dr. Paul to clarify his position, and then they lost Dr. Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only conspiracy might be that CNN effectively let Mr. Blitzer clarify Dr. Paul's position by not allowing Dr. Paul to agree (if they intentionally cut him off.)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more egregious actions taken against Dr. Paul than this interview.

       Agreed. Thanks for finding the link. Just watched and about 6 of those 7 minutes was Ron Paul talking. I'd say Wolf gave him pretty free rein actually. OP should save his outrage for a better example.

       Yeah, I mean if they left him talk for that long then maybe it was just technical difficulties, it'd be easier to just not invite him to talk rather than inviting him and cutting him off straight away. I'd still be suspicious though.

       Yup exactly. How can people know what to do to improve the world unless they are aware of what's actually happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       But first to make the improvements to the media, it seems we must change the laws and enforce them equally (even  put some powerful and rich people in jail for financial and media and monopoly/collusion crimes), which would also entail regaining control of our government from corporations and big money interests. It is a monumental task, but one worth undertaking. Imagine a government that worked
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       the people, instead of against us. Life could be so much better.

       I guess most of youtube videos are made by one person or a small team of individual people and reddit it just a website filled with urls and comments.

       Look, video games are fun and all, but they're fundamentally escapist. Moreover, because
       <em>

       players, including casuals, play single-player only it can be construed that it is also largely an asocial engagement.

       I believe the only reason he gets as much TV time as he does is because there is at least enough demand from supporters for them to deem him worthy enough from a viewer-base perspective (maybe with online content particularly). But I also think they don't like to give too much airtime to certain ideas/perspectives. So it's about striking that balance between appearing to give opposing perspectives fair time/treatment, but not allowing them to outweigh or possibly sway the viewer from the perspective they're
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to reinforce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my opinion, of course. I've read and listened to a lot of Chomsky, so I'm probably a bit more suspicious of mainstream media than the average person.

       To give people something to argue about.  The whole thing is a big show like pro wrestling.  As long as people are worried about what politician is getting airtime, nothing will ever be fixed.

       Just wait, in probably three or four iterations of the iOS, the police will basically gridlock any sort of protest for Ron Paul by deactivating features on the phones of protesters mostly video capabilities.

       If they wanted to censor him why would they invite him on the program and let him talk for 7 minutes before cutting him off?

       CNN cares about ratings. The only way they cut him off is if he's making one of their own look bad and risking future audience

       That's possible. I made this comment before watching a clip of it. Still it does happen to him more often than others. But, like I said before this could just be a show. You know the whole world is a stage.

       Not really - it's a standard they've been following for a while. If you watch panel shows sometimes you can see the host getting instructions in their ear piece to shut them down quickly.

       To be fair, CNN messes up its broadcast on a constant basis. You can't watch a half hour straight without something going wrong. It's actually hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday they were showing a video of that woman who swam from Cuba to Florida. She had three important things to say to everyone... 1 was to never give up, 2 was you're never too... And then the signal was lost. The host literally said "nooooo" and turned red from embarrassment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either the control room is run by the most incompetent people ever or there are people actively sabotaging the broadcast for some reason. Hey wait, I came here to debunk the whole Ron Paul thing but I think I just supported it. Hmmm...

       Herr Blitzer asks "youre not saying that the US had anything to do with the outbreak of civil war in syria, are you?"

         WikiLeaks cables show that the US had been funneling money to Syria's opposition for several years,
        </strong>
        even as it tried to reengage with President Assad's government.

        <strong>
         April 18, 2011
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Newly released WikiLeaks cables reveal that the
        <strong>
         US State Department has been secretly financing Syrian opposition groups and other opposition projects for at least five years
        </strong>
        , The Washington Post reports.
       </p>
       <p>
        That aid continued going into the hands of the Syrian government opposition even after the US began its reengagement policy with Syria under President Barack Obama in 2009, the Post reports. In January, the US posted its first ambassador to the country since the Bush administration withdrew the US ambassador in 2005 over concerns about Syria's involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Obama administration has been trying to draw Syria away from its key ally Iran and closer to the US and its regional allies. The effort seems to have been largely unsuccessful so far, and antigovernment protests sweeping the country have complicated the issue. The US is struggling to determine how to support Syria's democratic protesters while not alienating the Assad government, which has cracked down brutally on demonstrations and blamed them on "foreign saboteurs," as The Christian Science Monitor reported last week.

       Cables reveal covert US support for Syria's opposition

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That is a dilemma that concerned the US government even before the protests began.
        <strong>
         The author of an
         <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/wikileaks-syria/cable1.html">
          April 2009 cable
         </a>
         expressed concern that some of the projects being funded by the US, if discovered by the Syrian government, would be perceived as "an attempt to undermine the Asad [sic] regime
        </strong>
        , as opposed to encouraging behavior reform."
       </p>
       <p>
        The Post reported that
        <strong>
         much of the money – as much as $6 million since 2006 – has been funneled through a group of Syrian exiles in London, known as the Movement for Justice and Development. The group is connected to a London-based satellite television station that is broadcast in Syria, known as Barada TV
        </strong>
        , which has recently expanded its coverage to include the mass protests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several other civil society initiatives in Syria received secret US funding, but by 2009, US officials were concerned that the Syrian government had discovered the US funding. The Post was unable to confirm whether programs are still being funded, but cables indicate the funding was planned at least through September 2010.

       "An odd thing occurs about 10 minutes into my interview.  CJBK lost its transmission signal around the time I was expressing my opinion that the bombings were not the work of al Qaeda or such at all, but most likely the work of black operators in Western intelligence.  The show's producer came on the line during a commercial break to tell me of the loss of signal.  I asked him how often this happened.  "Never," he replied.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Five days later on July 12, I was being interviewed by Meria Heller for her webcast program seen in 60 countries.  About 10 minutes in, a listener contacted her on Yahoo! Messenger to report that she was "off the air."  Meria told me this had not happened in four years, since shortly after 9/11.  A few minutes later her Yahoo! Messenger went down.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This day I place a call to Webster G. Tarpley, author of
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/11-Synthetic-Terror-Made-USA/dp/1615771115/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1378257137&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=synthetic+terror">
        9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA
       </a>
       to get some information.  While we're on the line he tells me that when he was on Pacifica's WBAI New York for a fund-raising drive, a short time before, "all the telephones went haywire."  The station staff had to improvise in order to take calls and pledges.  As the "coincidences" piled up I wondered whether covert operators were sending signals to the 9/11 Truth movement and to those media that would give us time, that they were monitoring us and letting us know they could escalate from "shots across the bow" to more serious disruption.  I took these surveillance and disruption events to be positive.  I took them to mean the dark forces of the Anglo-American establishment now considered the 9/11Truth movement more than a minor irritant to be monitored, but perhaps a major irritant to be disabled.  This would mean that their masters, with their superior psycho-political measuring instruments, had begun to see us as a threat.  This, if true, would be the equivalent of a campaign victory in a conventional war."

       In the 2000 primaries Ron Paul was winning straw polls and surging in the polls. CNN finally ran a short piece on him, and the piece also ran for a day on Headline News channel. I heard it was going to be on so I watched Headline News waiting for it to air since the channel loops the same stories. The segment came on and a commercial immediately, and abruptly aired. The commercial ended and the segment was still on. Two seconds later another, longer commercial came on and by the time it ended, the segment was over. I used to watch Headline News regularly and never saw anything like this ever happen. The odds of it being a technical problem is almost zero.

       I like how Blitzer continues to talk, as if he cannot SEE that Ron Paul's screen segment is no longer containing the broadcast signal. He wanted to get his lame-ass question out there:
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <em>
        You're not blaming the US for the civil war in Syria, over the past 2 and a half years, that have already resulted in more than 100,000 people dead?
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       And then Paul has no response, and then all the viewers are left with is Blitzer's dumbass
       <em>
        assumption
       </em>
       of the situation in Syria, rather than a valid rebuttal.

       Seriously, i respect this guy a ton. Regardless of me not being American or subscribing to his religious views. He's one of the only politicians i've ever seen who actually tells things as they are. Though, if he were ever to be elected president (unlikely) would his integrity still be intact?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know much about American politics tbh, but how much power does he hold at the minute? I do believe that power corrupts people, and i'd like to think with the highest power available, he would still be the same guy, but i don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, the media is fucking bullshit. I can't believe people put up with this blatant censorship. I can't believe Paul does either, but what's he gonna do i suppose? Stop giving interviews?

       There is no doubt, and he is a master. I watch CNN but have really come to realize when Im watching propaganda and when Im not. I have also watched news stories be picked up on CNN weeks after a post on reddit. It is even funnier to watch them manipulate stories. Like the story on reddit how a astronaut had to cancel a space walk because water vapor was building in his helmet.....3 weeks later CNN reports ASTRONAUT ALMOST DROWNS IN SPACE.. HELMET WAS FILLING UP WITH WATER. Dat wording

       Sounds like when the BBC reporter on live tv reported that BLDG 7 on 9/11 had already fell well before it actually did fall &amp; suddenly the live feed went to static! An "honest" technical glitch right?

       Hard sales pitch is on for war on all of the corporate media.
CNN and the rest are just the salesmen.

       Am surprised they let Paul on at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of weird they way they cropped him way up high in the frame.  Usually they demote or zoom out on the unwanted opinion maker, and typically run unflattering pictures of the tyrant-of-the month war target in the background.  Pictures speak louder than words--and they know that.

       I contacted the FCC last year about a conflict of interest in their journalism based on defense contracts from sister companies.  And talked about how they lie on air.  Here is how the FCC responded.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Although the FCC licenses broadcast stations, we have virtually no control over the content of what they air.  That’s because stations enjoy freedom of speech under the First Amendment.  Further, there is a section of the Communications Act, which established the FCC in 1934, that specifically prohibits this agency from censoring or dictating the content of programming.  That means that stations (and networks) are free to air pretty much whatever they want (short of obscenity or indecency), even if the material is false, misleading, or slanted.  "

       It's obviously not my go-to source for information, but I was waiting to see the live Syria hearing that followed shortly after this. Usually it's the channel I put on in the background while doing other things (in this case, I was programming) just in case some breaking news event occurs. I admit, I'm a news/information junkie.

       As someone who watches CNN let me tell you Wolf Blitzer is one of the best reporters in giving guests plenty of time to respond, even when they run out of time. Not to mention he is on CNN for more time than everyone else so obviously he has more chances to "cut people off due to time constraints"

       I didn't see this one, so I can't comment on it. I did follow the last election pretty closely, though. It was a common thing to see him get skipped in debates, cut off during interviews, and basically just ignored entirely... when he wasn't being made fun of or the target of someone who wanted to make him look like a fringe lunatic. As an ardent Ron Paul supporter, this confused, saddened, and angered me, especially since it often felt like I was the only one who noticed or cared about what was going on.

       There was 100% no technical error. It was a decision made on the fly when it started getting uncomfortable.

       No one WANTS to do that, but they get into positions where they have to make that decision, or face getting yelled at and possibly fired. Shitty situation the media is in, and shitty for Americans

       Do we know the statistics on this? I only ever hear about when they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       cut him off. How often do they
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       cut him off? I saw them interviewing Rand Paul earlier and they didn't cut him off.

       I agree with your observation about media manipulation and bias, this just doesn't seem to be a very good example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally the manipulation is more subtle and consists of miss-reporting of events (eg Egyptian Brotherhood burning Churches when the little evidence available points to supporters of the Military doing this), repeating a 'big lie' (eg Israel is only democratic Government in Middle East), miss-characterisation of groups (is it ever mentioned that Hamas runs orphanages, schools, hospitals, medical centres and ambulance service ? And has done for several decades ? )  and includes only reporting from embedded journalists (who have an inter-dependancy with their information source, be it Military or Political ).
      </p>
      <p>
       This incident may have been a mistake, and Paul did get his point across well and was given reasonable time to speak, I suspect they will pull the plug (sorry, experience a technical error) on him at a more crucial time.

       Yeah, I agree that there's an equally good chance it really was simply a mistake. My bias comes from the fact that I've been following his political career so long and have seen so many similar things happen...I start to almost expect
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       to happen, so it makes me laugh to see it play out like this.

       Does someone have time to make a compilation of Ron Paul getting cut off on major news outlets? And then maybe publish the video with a sane E-rated title? That would be cool.

       Mann. It's so frustrating to watch all these media lapdogs and sold out Congressman bleat like sheep for War. Ron Paul lays out why it's another bait and switch like Iraq. He also points out that American public overwhelmingly opposes this War.
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep noticing how these puppets keep saying "we have seen undeniable proof that Assad was behind the chemical attacks". OK.. so where's the evidence? I'm sure the UN Security Council would like to see this "evidence" also. How long can they accuse the Syrian Govt without releasing any hard evidence?

       Ron Paul has proven to be a pest to the 'greater good' so why'd they put him on air in the first place? What are the odds that he'd say something out of character? (that being something that doesn't completely spell out how ridiculous our government is).

       I think the bigger deal is that they even had him on there. He's irrelevant, but they trounce him around cable debates as

       After watching CNN off/on for the past few days/weeks, I can assure you that MOST of the Republicans they've had on have been pro-intervention. And when Ron/Rand are brought up at all, it's almost always in association with the term
       <strong>
        isolationist
       </strong>
       (which they then explain is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible). Most people on CNN seem pretty certain about the "fact" that Assad was responsible for the recent attack, and that we
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       do something about it. Though the Republicans do like to criticize Obama's handling of the situation in general, while the Democrats generally praise his every move.

       I think Ron Paul is a nutcase
      </p>
      <p>
       However - I also think he's one the most honest men in politics right now, and he's correct about most of what he says. He wants to expose an obviously corrupt system and reform it into something that works for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he just sounds batty as hell, exactly the kind of "tinfoil hat" job that can be easily dismissed and discredited.

       Yeah - I guess maybe it's both.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, getting on television and simply saying what you actually believe without being coached by an entire team of PR specialists
       <em>
        is crazy
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       He's honest and truthful, he just says what he means and doesn't care if people like him or don't like him for it. Kind of proven by the fact that many people
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       like him and he keeps doing the same thing anyway. It's not a popularity contest for him, it's running the damned country.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I guess I do think he's a nutcase
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       I think he's right about much of his ideas. And even if I disagree with him, I can respect that he sticks with what he actually believes instead of just saying whatever I'll agree with.

       I voted for Obama in
       <del>
        2004 and 2008
       </del>
       - because I thought he would be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: doh! I meant 2008 and 2012. Wrote this post in kind of a hurry, should have double checked these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what we were told too, that he was different from the others. Obama wasn't going to be a pawn of the corporate party, he can't be bought by lobbyists. He's going to end the wars, improve the budget, and improve the economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, he's done very little of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The economy has improved, although not as much as anyone would have hoped. We have withdrawn a significant number of military presence out of Afganistan. But we're still involved in so many wars, our nation commits crimes against the world as well as its own people, we're not improving in anything other than war.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So all those things that I wanted from Obama, it seems like Ron Paul is all of those things. I used to think voting for a 3rd party candidate was throwing away your vote, now I'm starting to think voting for one of the main parties is throwing away your vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he runs again, I might vote for the guy.

       Well, see, that's just it - after I placed so much trust in Obama, now I don't know if I can trust anything in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess maybe there has never been a time when one could trust any politician or political leader of any kind. Even those who truly mean well are influenced by some kind of corruption.

       How does he sound "batty" to you? I'm honestly curious. I disagree with him on several pretty big issues (I used to be more libertarian, now I'm more anarcho-socialist...which isn't extremely far off except I've become
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       anti-capitalist), but he's always sounded very well-read and informed to me. I've never understood how he comes off as "batshit crazy" to people. Maybe it has something to do with his excited energy when talking about certain things? For me, that was part of what made me initially take interest in him...seeing someone who seemed genuinely passionate about those issues. Is it his character or his ideas?

       maybe being passionate can be mistaken for being manic
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that "nutcase" is more of a personality trait than a specific statement or issue. Some of his ideas are drastically different than what is considered normal (abolishing the federal reserve, abolishing public schools, eliminating the FDA). He speaks and behaves in a manic fashion, he seems obsessive and dangerously impulsive.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time, he's saying what a lot of people are thinking. His ideas are very much counter to established norms, but many people are starting to disagree with the established norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wants to stop harshly criminalizing drugs, stop meddling in the affairs of other countries, stop being the world police, stop infringing on domestic civil rights, stop making people dependent on government money, stop telling people what they can't do in their own homes, stop telling people who they can't have sex with, stop telling people what they can't own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people seem to want our government to stop working against us and start working for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with him on a lot of things, and I don't claim to fully understand the consequences of some of his ideas. He wants to privatize stuff like medical care and education, I'm not sure how that would affect things - it seems like that's a government service we
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to keep around.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I respect him for being genuine about it, he doesn't just say whatever will make him popular. He doesn't treat government like a popularity contest and he doesn't seem to be there for personal gain. So I can respect that.

       When he is given a chance to speak (which is few and far between), he sounds whiny and tends to ramble.  A lot.  Even as a supporter, I find it easy to see why people can't take him seriously when they see him speak on TV.

       I've been leaving CNN on in the background for the past few weeks while programming at home during the day, and while they do occasionally give time to the anti-war side...the overwhelming majority of time and attention is given to more hawkish people like William Kristol advocating for intervention in Syria.

       I don't have a TV at home (well, I OWN a TV, I just don't pay for cable service), but I try to check in w the MSM every few days at my friend's, just to see what they're pimping. Flipped from Fox News, to CNN, to HLN, to MSNBC on Monday, (freaking Labor Day, while unions are ACTIVELY striking) and it was all war mongering. Each and every one of them, showing pics of dead or twitching children, screaming for Assad's accountability. Journalism is DEAD...

       It depends on the program really.

       I would say it's not even that they occasionally give time to the anti-war side - more so they give time every single day to it.

       It's
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       possible that this and all the other Ron Paul "technical difficulties" (I remember 3 instances off the top of my head just for CNN) were actually technical difficulties. But it seems to me like there was more time for the segment as Blitzer was prepared to ask Paul another question (with a somewhat long-ish response needed).

       interesting vid, but a reply there pointed out that he said "const-", not "consp-", and if you review it, you can both hear and see that they're right. dunno what const- would have been the beginning of but, probably something a bit more benign. Then again the fact that they edited it out strange.

       Okay, but lets be fair here. Bush probably meant Al Qaeda or other terrorist organizations conspiring against the United States, not the government planning an attack on it's own people. I think he's inferring that he hopes that these attacks are just the two bombers, rather than them being controlled by an organized group who may plot more attacks.

       It's just that there is no need for any freaky conspiracy angle to it. People go to elite universities and develop relationships. They have similar political interests which is generally the status quo. This is how it works everywhere in life. Maybe they have some secret clubsy thing with a mysterious name because they're a bunch of young dicks who want to make a big deal about their status and career expectations. As well, logically, some of them hold dirt over eachother and yes that could easily play a part in high level goings-on. Really though, why does that even matter now that it's official that the NSA is keeping track anyways.

       Along with the other common sense here from F_Y_M et al, the video doesn't appear to have been cut like the youtube video claims.  It's presented uncut online now at least:

       Well in the original obama care you weren't able to choose your own doctor. Sure, you would get the whole treatment but some people just like the benefit of choosing their doctor because after all if they're paying for it they want some of the best treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Higher Premiums and High Taxes is coming from Obama Care as well, i understand that some countries have free schooling and free healthcare though when you live in america and have a 8% tax, here in texas it's 8.025%, higher taxes may scare some people into not buying things even though it would be little to no difference. In lower income homes that 10 cents per purchase will scare some people into not buying things because it just "adds up". We're already starting to higher the minimum wage though i am a bit afraid what they will be doing is say well ok, we'll higher the minimum wage but we're also going to higher the taxes for "this other reason", which will in turn get you less money.

       If i missed anything or if i got something wrong feel free to correct me on that.

       I noticed that too.  In my opinion there is a clear difference, at least to what the words would mean in my mind.  Isolationist would be a country completely shut off from the outside world, limiting trade, etc.   Non intervention means we don't stick our nose in other countrys' affairs.

       isolationists are like those rich people living in a gated community with armed guards and strict HOA,  shut off from the outside world
