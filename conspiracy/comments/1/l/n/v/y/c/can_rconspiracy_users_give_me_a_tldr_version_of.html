        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m just curious as to what some of you have come up with in your research about what exactly is the Big Picture. Everything from the dawn of man, to past civilizations, to banking and wars, to the current situation we find ourselves in and what is the end game.
I realize the subject matter is vast and a TL;DR version might be rather difficult. I&#39;m just curious as to how cohesive or different everyone&#39;s general opinion is. </p>

<p>In my research I&#39;ve basically realized I don&#39;t need to hold anything to a concrete belief. Mine are always evolving. There are a few things I&#39;m more certain about than others, but there are lots of things that I can&#39;t decide about. 
I am certain that our world is not what we think it is.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any consideration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word “govern”, in and of itself, means to control, restrict or regulate. Think of how a companyʼs charter governs how it does business or how a speed governor on a stock car keeps it from reaching its potential top speed. To govern is, quite simply, to control.
The suffix “ment” denotes an action or a resulting state. Words like “refreshment” or “achievement” illustrate this clearly.
So, what is government? Government, by its very definition, is a system in which a few men and women may carry out the act of keeping all the other men and women in a state of control. It makes me wonder if a “republican” form of “government” is even possible. Is there any form of government whatsoever that can honestly say it is there to protect the freedom of the people it governs? I would have to find that the unsettling answer to this question is an overwhelming no. The two ideals, freedom and governance, are inconsistent and cannot cohabit the same space and time. No man can logically seize control over another in order to protect the other manʼs freedoms. One can call this action whatever they will and can label it with whatever “ism” that they want to; it does not change the fact that government, any and every form of government, is, at its very core, only one thing: slavery.</p>

<p>The above is an excerpt from the free ebook titled As King - A Simple Guide to Autonomous Living found <a href="http://livefreefm.com/index.php?conpost=9">here</a>. How this relates, and you&#39;ll find this idea in the book, is all the news and media is <em>largely</em> fabricated to keep humans in a trance state of obedience. It is only illusionary. </p>

<p>There are terrible acts played out by several men and women that work for armed forces or claim to be public servants, but there is no state. It is purely illusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are all ancient gods, born of sacred light. Some gods grew jealous, tried to suppress the light. For millions of years, a select group has been using every means possible (religion, art, culture, laws, societal pressure) to keep the masses unaware that we all have the potential to heal, create, destroy. Only when some select few grow confident enough to go &quot;full god&quot; in this earthly realm, will any real change occur. There will be an epic battle, but balance will be restored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big picture is this:</p>

<p>There are a group of elites; call them the Rothschilds, the 1%, the Bilderbergers, whatever you want.  (The long story is that those groups work together).</p>

<p>This elite group has been preparing for a world beyond governments, beyond nations, beyond economies.  They understand that there is a tipping point, beyond which none of those things function.  In short, they are true &quot;doomsday preppers&quot; but on an almost unimaginable scale.</p>

<p>They have amassed tremendous wealth, but you may be asking &quot;what good is wealth when there are no economies?&quot;  Well, they also understand that wealth is power.  The two are the same thing, and the elites know that money is only good NOW, to get the power that is good LATER.</p>

<p>When the world systems collapse, they want to be on top.  You will have the choice to basically do whatever they say, serve them as a slave, or ... attempt survive on your own with nothing.</p>

<p>Everything they do now is preparing for that.  All the politicians they buy, all the media outlets they control, all of the resources they are amassing are setting the stage for life after the tipping point.</p>

<p>There will be no opposition.  They have all agreed to work together; there&#39;s no point in competition.  Despite numbering in the billions, the non-elites will not be able to rally against them.  They are working, today, to set up the physical infrastructure and mental conditioning to prevent that from happening.  You will be powerless to do anything but what they demand of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you will any consensus here (or anywhere) on the nature of the &quot;big picture&quot;, or whether one even exists.</p>

<p>The general ethos of most &quot;conspiracists&quot; is that the official narrative of many historical events is either sanitised or completely fabricated - there is consensus on that. What actually happened (eg on 9/11) is very unclear, and the achilles heel of the conspiracy community is that we try to fill in the gaps, and multiple alternative explanations evolve, most of which are inevitably just as wrong as the official narrative.</p>
