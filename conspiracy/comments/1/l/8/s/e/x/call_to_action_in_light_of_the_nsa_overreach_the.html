        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In light of the recent several months egregious abuses by the US government against the trust and faith of the citizens of the US, it is time to take the only peaceful, non-violent stand we can which has the potential to affect change: The US government is no longer entitled to the revenue it extracts from the citizens in any manner given their inability to provide even the minimum of representation of our greater interests.</p>

<p>The government by, for and of the people has been usurped, and therefore is no longer entitled to funding from its non-constituency.</p>

<p>This call to action is to open a debate - and move toward public action and demonstration come this October 1st.</p>

<p>There is only one avenue the people of the US have to take, the refusal to be the unwilling and unwitting bearers of funding for the actions of the US government, its corporate agents and interests, in the deterioration of the interests of Humanity.</p>

<p>On October 1st, please participate in a public holiday. A holiday free of any regulation, any taxation, any responsibility to the institutionalized bodies that refuse to represent the collective will of the people.</p>

<p>On October 1st, the US will have its first &quot;tax in&quot; -- the people will no longer acquiesce to the extortion of the US government and its corporate interests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the last several months, spending hours per day in review of the transgressions of the USG, as previously revealed and alluded to but only now 100% confirmed by Snowden; I have been seeking the correct response and course of action that is required. </p>

<p>The Obama Administration, the United States Government, the corporate interests within the US as well as globally, have completely stepped over the line of what is acceptable in our civilization. They are not representing any larger, communal interests of the planet as a whole, rather, they are acting very specifically in a parasitic manner. This must end now.</p>

<p>This behaviour is not acceptable from any person, group, organization or nation.</p>

<p>This is the turning point. This is the time where we, as a species, need to realize that we are not individuals to exploit. We are not nations at odds, governments in opposition or enemies in battle.</p>

<p>The only enemy any Human can have is ignorance.</p>

<p>But the tools and defences we have against ignorance are infinite and innate. </p>

<p>Only the ignorant seek to obfuscate the truth.</p>

<p>It is time to takea stand as a species. Not as a nation, people, color, creed or religion. But as a unit.</p>

<p>No government deserves absolute power. No institution is greater than the race of Man. No corrupt system can stand in the way of unity of Human spirit.</p>

<p>On October 1st, stand up.</p>

<p>Perhaps start growing some veggies so it&#39;s less taxed at the grocery store. Maybe theres some local butcher shops where you can get your meats. </p>

<p>Utilities will be the hardest to avoid taxes I think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with trade/barter is that let&#39;s say I have a basket of apples, you have a basket of corn. I need your corn but you don&#39;t need or want my apples. So now I have to find somebody who has something you want to trade for and will trade me that item for my apples so I can then trade it to you for the corn. That&#39;s where money comes in. I can sell my apples to whoever needs/wants them, then use the money to buy your corn and you can then use that money to buy the things you want/need.</p>

<p>For this to work though the money needs to be backed by some sort of tangible asset. In today&#39;s world though, it is only backed by a promise to pay a debt as the U.S. dollar is no longer backed by Gold and Silver.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we&#39;re fucking sheep.  That won&#39;t be fixed by being led by wolves, however.  We&#39;ve <em>been</em> led by wolves and look where it&#39;s gotten us.  Kravguy is right in the sense that it is WE as a citizenry that need to man the fuck up and become each of us the leaders we wish to follow and be led by.  Anything else will lead to nothing but the same bullshit that we&#39;re suffering through right now.</p>

<p>With great power comes great responsibility.  We&#39;re wanting to live in a strong, powerful nation - a strong and powerful world - yet we&#39;re not willing to do the work to become as responsible as we <em>need</em> to become to be <em>WORTHY</em> of being able to handle living in that strong and powerful world.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t <em>deserve</em> that &quot;freedom&quot; we keep clamoring for and asking for when we&#39;re not willing to do the work to get our asses up and MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.</p>

<p>It simply doesn&#39;t matter WHO it would be that we would &quot;appoint&quot; to be this &quot;new leader&quot;.  It wouldn&#39;t matter where they came from - the alternative media or otherwise.  Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  It wouldn&#39;t be long before shit would yet again hit the fan if the people chose almost ANYONE to be &quot;their leader&quot; instead of the people leading themselves.  That leader/that paradigm of leadership would eventually sooner or later gravitate toward the corruption that exists now.</p>

<p>No.  We need to figure this shit out on our own and BECOME ourselves the leaders we wish to follow.  Nothing wrong with allowing yourself to be influenced by individuals that may know more or have more experience in doing something, etc, but no one should be propped up on any leadership pedestal.</p>
