<p>Whatever happens, there is a terrific end-game at play here, or at least the beginning of one. We get to see history in the making, for better or worse. You would think a &#39;humanitarian&#39; cause such as Lurch&#39;s would be stopped dead in its tracks by the world vowing the destruction of nations because of interference. Just...doesn&#39;t seem like a very good reason to &#39;save&#39; people. Or way of doing it. But that&#39;s what we are doing. As an american I feel we must be stopped. As a human I know that acts of force against the psychopaths running this gong show is going to result in the little guys getting killed. What to do? What to think?! The criminals don&#39;t fight. They send the pawns in to fight. What a chess game we have before us. Whatever happens, I wish all my fellow human beings, brothers and sisters, light and love in this time. </p>

<p>Goodbye. Stay safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure where to post this, but you folks probably would care. My grandpa in New Orleans has informed me there are what sound like B-52 bombers taking off in a constant stream from the nearby military airbase. Have been for a few hours now. This is unusual.</p>

<p>Sorry for the interruption, but this post seemed as relevant as any in which to share this news.</p>

<p>edit: grammar</p>

<p>edit2: It&#39;s entirely possible these were not B-52s and my grandpa misidentified them. He says he&#39;s not mistaken, but he&#39;s also the kind of guy who says he&#39;s only ever made one mistake in his life: one time he thought he was wrong but he wasn&#39;t. :P Regardless of their classification, there were a lot of large planes leaving the air base late in the evening for hours and they sounded like B-52s to an old retired army man.</p>

<p>I asked him how he could tell it was B-52s, and he mentioned a specific sound the jet engines make, like air whooshing out of an old stove pipe. He said you hear that sound with all jet engines, but the B-52s make it with a specific pitch that&#39;s pretty distinguishable.</p>

<p>This could have changed since I moved but I grew up close to Barksdale and have driven by the B-52&#39;s in hangers on countless occasions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I have no idea. I just know what he told me in a matter-of-fact way. I would imagine it&#39;s possible the planes have moved since then. They may have moved temporarily to the Belle Chasse air base in preparation for this deployment (though I&#39;m no expert on protocol for this sort of thing). It&#39;s also entirely possible they weren&#39;t B-52s at all. Regardless, there were a lot of large planes deployed at night from that air base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What gets me is they&#39;re just so fucking blatant about it now. At least in Iraq they actually took time to falsify evidence, now they&#39;re literally just <em>saying</em> shit and knowing nobody can do anything about it. They&#39;re not even trying. </p>

<p>The word &#39;evidence&#39;, when it comes from the government, means nothing. It&#39;s a complete charade. This was one of the best bits for me: some British politician (Milliband i think), said the government needs to <em>try</em> to get UN backing, but that it doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t go to war if the UN said no. So what is the FUCKING POINT THEN? I mean really? &quot;Well i&#39;ll only get on board if you ask, but it&#39;s ok if you ignore them.&quot; Great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah sure. It is an ideal. You can hold ideals and fairly live by them while at the same time understanding that the real world has NO ideals. It is an animal, both kind and cruel. Not killing is a great way to live. I&#39;m not going around killing anyone, nor do I care to.</p>

<p>That being said, in consideration of the earlier proposed hypothetical, where someone murders a family outright, the person who did the murder would fall under the golden rule, with the understanding that killing that murderers family would be barbaric, stupid and would not remove that murderer from society. So the murderer gets the punishment. A fair punishment in a red-handed sort of case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>valid point. i see exactly what you mean.</p>

<p>the real world has NO ideals? bold statement and i have to disagree. this is the glory of being a human being. i don&#39;t have to agree with you and that doesn&#39;t make me wrong.</p>

<p>but you see.. this is where you and i differ my friend. i believe that the universe will handle things on it&#39;s own and i need not interfere. if my family is murdered by someone, i would not take up arms like a comic book hero and claim my revenge. but this is just me. you clearly would take a different route and there is not a damn thing wrong with that :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if by your decision to not interfere that singular murderous individual goes on to kill others? I must say this is a point that I won&#39;t budge on, so we agree to disagree I suppose, though I do not understand your reasoning. How can you have ideals, but never act on them? Or are they selective-use ideals (in which case are not really ideals?)</p>

<p>As for the real world not having ideals, I will clarify. Trees don&#39;t have ideals. Nor do tigers, or ducks or deer or fish...and while people talk a lot, and while an INDIVIDUAL might have a set of ideals, the &quot;whole of humanity&quot; cannot be said to have ideals either.</p>

<p>To try to apply an individuals ideals-set to all of humanity is not only foolish. It may very well be selfish and harmful. I have ideals, but I never assume that others would or even SHOULD abide by them.</p>

<p>Edit: Noting here that I wasn&#39;t speaking to direct revenge. Emotional lashing out is not reliable. That is why we have courts. If one is proven guilty of murder then the death penalty is a fair punishment. Direct action from the one who had thier family murdered would be ONLY in a very clear, caught-in-the-act sort of situation. Which is the sort of situation I had in mind based on the hypothetical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>see.. trees and tigers and ducks or deer or fish don&#39;t have rational thought. they cannot analyze a situation and then CHOOSE how to response. they react, on instinct (maybe not the trees) and just do things out of sheer response. </p>

<p>all i&#39;m saying is that i have ideals, and so do you, and so does everyone on this planet. i&#39;m not saying that everyone should abide to my ideals, you&#39;re right, that would be extremely selfish of me. that&#39;s why i&#39;m not forcing my ideals on ANYONE and i would never DARE to. i&#39;m simply sharing and expressing how i feel. i&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t agree here, but that&#39;s what makes life so wonderful - the sheer fact that we CAN disagree and still live on this giant spaceship traveling at incredible speeds in a vacuum. </p>

<p>to say the &quot;whole of humanity&quot; doesn&#39;t have ideals is an ignorant statement and is not a fact. do you KNOW that the mass population of this planet have or don&#39;t have their own personal ideals? i sure as hell know i don&#39;t know that, but i like to think that people have an idea of how they&#39;d like things to work and i KNOW that other ideals differ from my own. </p>

<p>i understand your reasoning, i&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t realize mine. i understand what you&#39;re saying completely and i&#39;m choosing to disagree because that&#39;s not how i would react to the situation. i&#39;m not a tree, or a tiger, or a duck or a deer or a fish.. i can step back from a situation and make a rational decision based on my previous knowledge and experiences.</p>

<p>i won&#39;t deny that humans are animals, we are, but we are NOT like other animals on this planet. we are not JUST instinctive creatures..</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t matter for shit because all they have to do is create a large false flag where thousands of Americans die.  The larger the death, the more the weak minds can&#39;t handle it and so give into the herd mentality of reactionary policy change.  Plus the world is still run by dollars so people would liquidate a lot of assets into dollars and US treasuries.  The US government always has the huge shock card up its sleeve and it oil went up to $200 a barrel then that means people need a shitload more dollars to get it.</p>

People cryo-freeze themselves in hopes of being re-animated by future technology; there is no shortage of willing participants to try out crazy anti-aging procedures. Unless I am totally wrong and there is some technique that I don&#39;t know about. If there is, please tell me. I would love to read about some mad scientist creating human abominations that spit in the face of god and plan to live until the sun burns out.</p>

<p>Also, interestingly and somewhat along the same lines, they have figured out how to have one person&#39;s brain manipulate another person&#39;s body.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, the beginning of the end started a long, long time ago.  Every generation since has been saying &quot;oh here it is, we&#39;re seeing it all now&quot; and then things just slowly get worse with a whimper instead of a bang.  The truth is, nothing is going to change.  It&#39;s not that we can&#39;t, or won&#39;t; it&#39;s destiny.  We always have to learn from our mistakes as we make them; not from precautionary tales.  How many hundreds of years have men been writing the prophecies of the end of days?  How many men have written on all the subjects and tropes we hold so dear to only be likened to a small revolutionary ideal?  All of these things are nothing but a slowly degrading uphill climb to a pinnacle of our downfall.  The thing is, the pinnacle isn&#39;t quite a mount, but rather just a really low lying hill crested above a long endless plateau.  It&#39;s meant to be.  And by the time our age is over, a new will have begun and all the things we are scared of will be nothing but a new eye opening vignette to our future generations of fringe thinkers.  Until one day, no thoughts are thought and words of discourse are a thing of history never to be referenced again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple thousand years ago, a woman was visited by an alien that told her she was going to give birth to a half man/half alien that would save this world. She was subsequently artificially impregnated. By an alien. Her baby grew up to seem to have special powers. He could walk on water, change water into wine, raise the dead, heal blind men, cast out demons, and most of all he offered hope to humanity—he taught a message of love, pacifism, humanitarianism, socialism, and eternal life after death. He described the world he came from—far better than his earth mother&#39;s world, this Earth, and said any of us could enter—all we had to do was knock. Introduce ourselves to our loving Creator, and accept his invitation by doing as he says—being a vessel of love and light. Show the world that love is better than hate. Interestingly, he also predicted much of the turmoil we&#39;re witnessing.  The leaders of his day killed him, just as TPTB would kill him today. But he didn&#39;t stay dead. (He is risen!) And he told us that he&#39;s gonna come back for us with an army of fellow aliens and deceased followers to save us from the twisted, evil forces of this world. I believe they&#39;ve started arriving. He&#39;s likely right outside &quot;the door&quot; and you still have time to accept his forgiveness for your imperfection and Godlessness. </p>

<p>Jesus Christ could see the future because the dimension he&#39;s from doesn&#39;t experience time the same ours does. They already know who will win the battle. </p>

<p>God woke me up during the Super Bowl. He told me to google the time left on the score board during the 30 minute blackout. So I googled 13:22. The first result was the very last verse I read before I put my Bible in a box 10 years ago and declared myself agnostic.  Thanks for the encouraging words, friend. I hope you&#39;re experience the power of Christ&#39;s name. The &quot;peace that passes understanding&quot; is legit. When you&#39;ve got the &quot;good aliens&quot; on your side, you&#39;re protected. We may be outnumbered (for now), but we&#39;re not out powered. Darkness is easily defeated. 1 candle can light up a huge cavern. Truth is easier to convey than lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With a 9% approval rating, there will be significant push back if they had to start a draft. So significant that it would likely cause revolution and ultimately dissolve our cancerous government. I know I for one will not fight for our government to support Israel and al quieda. I would fight to avoid fighting, if that makes any sense. Maybe that&#39;s what we need to wake all of the couch potatoes that are not living in reality.  Whatever it takes to stop this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way man. What causes aging is still being researched and there are different theories still. Things that contribute to aging have been identified but exactly how all of these factors contribute is not fully understood. There are plenty of people with the motivation and the money to try something like this if it was really an option. People cryo-freeze themselves in hopes of being re-animated by future technology; there is no shortage of willing participants to try out crazy anti-aging procedures. Unless I am totally wrong and there is some technique that I don&#39;t know about. If there is, please tell me. I would love to read about some mad scientist creating human abominations that spit in the face of god and plan to live until the sun burns out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>see.. trees and tigers and ducks or deer or fish don&#39;t have rational thought. they cannot analyze a situation and then CHOOSE how to response. they react, on instinct (maybe not the trees) and just do things out of sheer response. </p>

<p>all i&#39;m saying is that i have ideals, and so do you, and so does everyone on this planet. i&#39;m not saying that everyone should abide to my ideals, you&#39;re right, that would be extremely selfish of me. that&#39;s why i&#39;m not forcing my ideals on ANYONE and i would never DARE to. i&#39;m simply sharing and expressing how i feel. i&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t agree here, but that&#39;s what makes life so wonderful - the sheer fact that we CAN disagree and still live on this giant spaceship traveling at incredible speeds in a vacuum. </p>

<p>to say the &quot;whole of humanity&quot; doesn&#39;t have ideals is an ignorant statement and is not a fact. do you KNOW that the mass population of this planet have or don&#39;t have their own personal ideals? i sure as hell know i don&#39;t know that, but i like to think that people have an idea of how they&#39;d like things to work and i KNOW that other ideals differ from my own. </p>

<p>i understand your reasoning, i&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t realize mine. i understand what you&#39;re saying completely and i&#39;m choosing to disagree because that&#39;s not how i would react to the situation. i&#39;m not a tree, or a tiger, or a duck or a deer or a fish.. i can step back from a situation and make a rational decision based on my previous knowledge and experiences.</p>

<p>i won&#39;t deny that humans are animals, we are, but we are NOT like other animals on this planet. we are not JUST instinctive creatures..</p>
