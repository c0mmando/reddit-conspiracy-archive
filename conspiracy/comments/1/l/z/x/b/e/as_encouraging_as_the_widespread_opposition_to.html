       During the 80's our government drafted a readiness excercise titled Rex84. This program involved the suspension of the constitution, martial law, and the detainment of citizens deemed to be national security threats. (

       ). This program involved FEMA, amongst the various intelligence agencies.  Since that time, two things have happened. One, an executive order under Bush Jr. has revamped this program under the guise of continuity of government. Under a declared state of emergency, FEMA along with DHS will be in charge of securing the poplulace... Now fast forward to project mainframe. This is/was a database of Americans deemed to be threats to American interests. This number was originally under 10 million, during it's inception. The next thing that happened was unprecedented surveillance essentially created profiles on almost everyone in America. This, in my opinion, may have padded this list with data that just wasn't available during the inception of project mainframe. Here is the kicker. In rex84, the original program deemed "widespread opposition to military invasion abroad" as one reason to declare martial law and detain security threats. Given the crumbling status of the petrodollar, and the unprecedented opposition to the plan to invade Syria and destabilize it, I feel the need to bring this to people's attention. It seems as though their original idea was to say "well if you're not on board, too bad... We will do this anyway and will silence the dissidence." be weary, of not only the international response to this debacle, but of the baby in DC who isn't getting his bottle. That is all.

       Edit: I wrote project mainframe when it is in fact project main core

       NSA surveillance is how they construct the lists like Main Core. I wonder how much it has expanded since 2008, and if lists like it will be exposed in future Greenwald leaks.

       Interesting thought.  How can that occur though?  People are against a war/killing and fighting but would stand by while the gov't rounds up 10 mil people and zaps them all?  The rest just go....Okay, we'll be quiet?

       I hope you're just fear mongering.....in a helpful way, I can tell by your post you're trying to inform people but I don't know if that's realistic.  WTF do I know, I just hope that's too hollywood to be real.

       Hmmmmmm. Interesting perspective. It could happen. I've been speculating that a false flag attack in the Mediterranean could potentially ignite WWIII. Many big players would be there. I forget who's going with on our side, I know Britain is sitting this one out, but I wonder if they will play a later role. No I know it will be enough, if Israel, US, China, Russia are all present within view. Granted communications should be completely open and stable. A false flag triggered say, by someone commencing unannounced projectile tests, would be a travesty. I fear of tensions, but I have hope that those souls aboard will keep their cool, and above all think.
