       I see all over the conspiracy sub reddit talking about Syria but this is only a distraction for a MUCH bigger problem that lies ahead the Dollar Collapse. If this happened we would be thrown into complete and utter chaos. Shelves would be empty in stores, people would be rioting, there would be nothing because our money that runs this very country would be worthless. With Fed now spending 40 Billion every month indefinitely on mortgage-backed securities and big countries turning away from using the Dollar for trading our economy that has been in deep trouble since 2008 is going to implode. The financial bubble we have been in will pop soon and everything we have been as a country will be gone. What are your thoughts, what can we do?

       the US oil interests are the only thing keeping the dollar from collapsing. literally the only thing. thats why we're in the middle east right now. fuck those countries that want to get off the dollar. thats why we invaded iraq and afghanistan, and coincidentally installed rothschild owned central banks. next stop, iran, who does not have a rothschild owned central bank. whats the best way to get in their? fuck with their friend syria.
      </p>

       Its fucking crazy. The dollar will collapse unless we kill brown people and take their land.

       I don't know what I find more repugnant, the situation or the fact that the government doesn't have the fucking balls to man up and lay out what choices this country is actually facing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bullshit paternalistic dog and pony is a constant slap in the face to what once was a Flourishing Republican Union. It's almost as if the very men who degraded the public sphere from the time of Bernays onwards would somehow reap unlimited winfall by virtue of the masquerade of Republican legitimacy. God fucking damn it this is a sordid state of affairs indeed, and I truly do worry that there is nothing that can be done by anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       We go out here trying to use the public forum to ward off this malfeasance and we get reddit mods who censor so much it's plausible that they're contracting for the god damn dod.
      </p>
      <p>
       We try to protest and we get fired or arrested, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       We attempt to keep a non vacuous hot button topic around and all of a sudden some "major world event" occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       We fight in vein to save the cogency of this public forum, for we will never win a battle against an ideology with money, guns, and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish only for someone to step forward and proclaim "This will alleviate the burden, this will remedy the disease of vacuity so cyclically entrenched in your culture, this, oh those great men amongst you, will save your Union".
      </p>
      <p>
       But days pass and hopes eventually turn into fleeting memories, while Unions degrade into Empires, and the incorruptible among us find their place to lay as forgotten dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inevitability of history's greasy wheel is relentlessly crushing when one considers the lofty goals of the human spirit as manifest in her eternal struggle for both temporal peace and spiritual uniformity.

       I'd like to elaborate that the big picture is basically the march to convert everyone to the slavery of global capitalism or globalization if you prefer. Poverty is ultimately created by seizing the means of production. At it's most basic is removing the means of subsistence farming by that of sustainable cultures.

       I just assumed that this was already pretty widely known here. Hedge with at least gold, food, and possibly water, energy, guns (?), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand I'm not sure a dollar collapse would lead to apocalyptic type situations...at least not at first.  The world still ends with a whimper rather than a bang.

       That's because we're a little closer every year, we have been since the inception of the petro dollar. Historically most, if not all fiat currencies fail. When you have a currency based on discharging debt, rather than storing wealth the bubble will burst eventually.

       Peak oil is a myth. Oil isn't an infinite resource, but it's much more plentiful than you have been led to believe. A lot of people in the industry believe the abiotic oil theory but they'll never publicly support it. Almost all of our domestic oil is sold abroad rather than used @ home. The industry, much like the diamond industry, wants you to believe in peak oil and the scarcity of oil so you'll continue to pay a premium for it.
