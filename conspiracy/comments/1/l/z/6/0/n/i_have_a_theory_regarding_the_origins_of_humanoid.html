        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been following conspiracy theories for some time now, and though I am generally unable to sort the truth out from all the bullshit, I have come up with a hypothesis involving extra-terrestrials, time-travel, and the importance of Earth.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: These ideas are solely based off of my assumptions, and I cannot say that I wholeheartedly believe them to be true, though they make some sense. It very well could be science fiction. I doubt they are novel.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just dive into it.</p>

<p><em>What if?</em></p>

<p><strong>Extraterrestrials are us</strong>. At some point in our future humanity must find another place to live as Earth becomes inhabitable. At some decisive moment, a habitat of humans are sent on a long slow voyage to another planet (Cliche sci-fi movie, i know; just bare with me). Well, humanity survived (survives?). And we&#39;ve changed. Quite drastically. Think of every piece of &quot;footage&quot; you&#39;ve seen or each &quot;firsthand&quot; account on extraterrestrials. They look like us. Frightening perhaps to some, but, recognizably humanoid.</p>

<p>What if?</p>

<p><strong>They are visiting us</strong>. Why? To ensure that history follows the course which allows this voyage to their home planet (Earth2). Now, what exactly does &quot;follows the course&quot; mean? I don&#39;t really know. It may mean a whole lot for their species&#39; survival. They need that ship to depart. They may even need the right humans to board it. <strong>This would make certain bloodlines very important to the aliens.</strong></p>

<p>But how could they possibly visit us in the past? And why would they need to?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a physicist. I dabble. Time is a funny thing to me. I&#39;ve heard that the faster you move, the slower you move through time. The voyage from Earth to Earth2 took many many years and crossed great distances. The new earthlings expand their knowledge and develop some amazing technology. They can travel here in a fraction of the time the voyagers could. Here&#39;s where I make an assumption. By traveling at such speeds, the extraterrestrials can arrive before the voyage left. I&#39;m in the realm of paradoxes here. Also, it would be a foolish thing for an alien to do. Why risk changing the course of earth&#39;s history when you are the product of it left untouched?</p>

<p>Maybe it happened twice or more. There are really Earth3-Earth17, and each planet&#39;s inhabitants evolved differently. They don&#39;t all get along. Earth7 is particularly vicious and decides they could erase Earth 12 from existing by altering what happens here. </p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve gone too far in my speculation. I&#39;ve jumped to conclusions. It&#39;s just fun to think about. I encourage you to take all this with an open mind and not too seriously. I look forward to your input.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR Aliens are us in the future. They visit in UFOs to make small changes so that we as a race do exactly what allowed them to exist.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think that &quot;aliens&quot; are humans from the past.</p>

<p>Many times the earth has suffered cataclysms, floods, asteroids, comets, flying in space is not a very safe thing to do. </p>

<p>So in one pre-historic civilization earth was doomed, some escaped towards space, and now millennia later they are back, checking us out. Some of the humans survived and had to start all over again.</p>

<p>Also there is some people that leave inside the earth, and have been there for ages, some say.  </p>

<p>Also some say, we do have visitors to Earth that are not human, neither future nor past. They are just from outer space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise some valid points. I have heard of the hollow earth hypothesis. This is another explanation for why we have UFO sightings. They aren&#39;t from outer space, they live beneath our surface. The moon is hollow, could Earth be similar? </p>

<p>And ah, yes, the most likely scenario: Aliens are just from other planets originally. Given the vastness of the universe, I would place the likeliness of life evolving elsewhere to be approaching 100%. But I somewhat fancy the (groundless) thought of Earth being the breeding ground for many future interstellar races.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The average human life span is around 70 years.
Now if by some miracle we could travel at the speed of light, we would only reach around 70 light years away in a human life (born on the ship as it takes off and arrives the day before he&#39;s statistically due to kick the bucket (~70)).
There aren&#39;t many known planets within a 70 light year radius, yet alone inhabitable ones.
How long would it take to settle on earth two? How long until industry exists? What about agriculture? How long until humans would be afforded the luxuries of progressive scientific thought, inventions and advancements unrelated to survival? How long until faster than light travel is discovered on a new earth with limited resources and planetary experience?
Lets give ourselves a statically ridiculous and ambitious 100 years.
If that space ship left earth tomorrow it would still take around 170 years for faster than light travel to be discovered.
The first popular modern UFO waves began during world war 2 (I know it goes back 1,000&#39;s of years but lets just deal with modern cases for simplicity).
That means that the first big incidents were around 80 years ago. 
170 + 80 = 250. That means that in one journey, their new ship would have to travel so much faster than the speed of light that time wouldn&#39;t only slow down, it would move backwards by 250 years. 
No lets take into account that the greys/humanoids would take millennia to evolve as far from us as to resemble the beings in witness accounts and UFO folklore). Do you realise how much energy it would take to travel that far backwards in time?
What would they have to have done to fuck things up so badly that they need to travel backwards in time to make sure that their present/future is preserved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t realize how much energy that would take. I do believe however that the amount of energy in the universe is staggering. I look at how far we&#39;ve come, and see future potential growth to be exponential (provided WE don&#39;t fuck things up). Perhaps we fucked Earth up, which is why it needed to be evacuated. If we are on a path to destruction, they may want to keep it that way. This would definitely go against our best wishes. Choices will be made (and have been made, often) which are totally self-destructive of our species and our beautiful planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of energy in the Universe, the problem is entropy.  That&#39;s when all the stars die out and everything turns to absolute zero.  It&#39;s a scary thought, unless we look at one theory where the entire Universe is inside of a massive black hole:</p>

<p>Maybe at this massive black hole&#39;s event horizon, all matter begins to come back in on itself in a mobius tubes scenario to converge back to a single point. Then BAM, another big bang.  That is a nice thought, entropy is scary.  Doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;ll be dead long before then</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume this to be the case. The universe may not be expanding at all. It&#39;s been proposed that redshift/blueshift is actually caused by stars dimming/brightening and changing the frequencies at which they resonate. If this is the case then it&#39;s possible that by the gravitational power of SMBHs, mass will accumulate at some center point and all matter will eventually become a singularity. I like this idea because it fits with the universe&#39;s tendency for disorder to order (and back again to disorder?).</p>

<p>&quot;The only way John McCain will become the next President, will be if something &quot;happens&quot; to Barack Obama before the election. If there even is an election. If a certain faction get their way, there will not be. Remember, behind the scenes, there is only One Party. Our Party. &#39;Democracy&#39; is an illusion which is created to uphold your slavery. Whichever side &#39;wins&#39;; the Family wins. There are many possibilities and alternative &#39;scripts&#39;. All of them lead toward the ultimate implementation of the overall blueprint of our Creator, </p>

<p>Unless any unforeseen disruptions delay it&#39;s announcement, there will be a new currency by the end of 2008/early 2009, along with a new Union of nations. January has been spoken of in some circles, as the latest, though there are plans underway which could even bring this to fruition much earlier than initially hoped for. It depends upon the results of other upcoming events as to how this will play out. I am not high enough up the Hierarchy to know the intimate details of the dates and times that far in advance. There is a &#39;tree system&#39; in which such knowledge is passed down, as and when it becomes &#39;need to know&#39;. I would be considered to be a &quot;Regional&quot; leader. Above me, are National and International. </p>

<p>San Francisco and Damascus, will be uninhabitable by the end of 2010, possibly even sooner. Again, it depends upon certain &#39;forces&#39; at play, and which timelines are activated. Humanity, though utterly unconscious of the fact, has a significant part to play in this. You (as a collective consciousness of the planet) are choosing the Negative Polarization by default, by the quality of your thoughts and actions. Thought is creative energy, focused. You get exactly what you put out.&quot;</p>

<p>Soo..this didn&#39;t happen. Read as much of this as I could stomach. According to this dude we are all &quot;chattel&quot; thanks to being &quot;incarnated&quot; on earth... There is no free will, events are controlled by rulers with something resembling divine right. Come on, this is the same bs game the few have forced upon the many to control resources for thousands of years. Nothing alien or supernatural about it. Honestly it makes me sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all the months I&#39;ve spent browsing this little community of &quot;free thinkers&quot; I have yet to find but a small handful of ideas that avoided being destroyed by redditers genuine love of being sanctimonious and dismissive. This is a community full of people in the &quot;you&#39;re only entitled to your opinion if it is similar to mine, and if you don&#39;t agree with me, you&#39;re wrong&quot; mindset. The amount of discussion that took place above about the correct term to use for this post - is it a theory/is it a hypothesis/who the fuck cares - and the complete lack of intelligent discussion surrounding said &quot;theory&quot; - or what have you - was laughable. If you find a group of people willing - and seemingly capable - to think critically, openly, and without unecessarily insulting comebacks, do point me in that direction. 
Maybe we are all aliens from the fucking future, maybe such a species doesn&#39;t exist, or maybe a huge vacuum is going to open in the fucking sky and we&#39;re all going to be sucked into oblivion. No one knows, but it&#39;d sure be nice to have a civil, intelligent discussion with someone about the details and theories surrounding an infinite number of possibilities, unlike the pool of nonsense commentary that took place above.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, i gotta agree with most of your points for sure. And i don&#39;t want to sound too cliche, but this place, particularly, used to be MUCH different. Not only that, but this whole site (reddit) used to be much different as well.</p>

<p>Its just hive-mind, white-middle-class-early-20s kids. With minimal opinions of their own, is frustrating. But at the same time i dont wanna talk shit or hate on anyone. Everyone has a right to exist. But i get perturbed often, by people who claim to be critical thinkers or open minded, yet whos opinions are dictated by the general consensus of others. You know what i mean?</p>

<p>I&#39;m old (32). The way i see the world is certainly much different than when i was 22. And that makes me feel good, i can progress, and change and independently come to my own conclusions about anything.</p>

<p>A perfect example is the left/right political paradigm in the US. &#39;Republicans&#39; just hate &#39;Democrats&#39; and vice versa, ad infinitum. But really...they&#39;re two sides of the same coin. I want to know who&#39;s flipping that coin. I want to know who minted it, and under what authority. </p>

<p>Even in private/personal parts of my life. I claim to be (politically) what would be considered as a &#39;radical&#39; or &#39;extreme&#39; leftist. Which is true. But when i say a single point that doesn&#39;t agree with the &#39;traditional&#39; left (even those said to be radical or extreme) then it seems the only reaction is &#39;YOURE NOT ONE OF US&#39;. Rather than &#39;well, we disagree, but thats okay because ultimately we want the same things&#39;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. Reddit is fucked. This subreddit is fucked. middle-class-white-people are fucked (for the most part). I just want discourse, as i have a thirst for knowledge, and i don&#39;t give a fuck about anyones beliefs or motivations, so long as they arrived at them of their own accord, and not because some party, or forum, or group of people told them thats how they should feel.</p>

<p>in summation. FUCK THE RIGHT, FUCK THE LEFT, FUCK REDDIT, AND FUCK R/CONSPIRACY. </p>

<p>I LOVE YOU ALL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet is overflowing with the close-minded, like-minded individuals you just described, and is a breeding ground for popular opinion. Somehow I don&#39;t believe there was ever a time where the vast majority of squabbles weren&#39;t over one &quot;group&quot; arguing over another&#39;s take on the popular opinion they chose to subscribe to. Usually those who cannot agree with what appears to be the general consensus either keep to themselves, or set free their &quot;unique view&quot; only to be then set ablaze by the sparks of disagreement. That&#39;s what sites like reddit - and any other web page meant for the masses to converse and share through - generally appear to be - a wasteland of unnecessary arguing over who&#39;s ultimately right, rather than any sort of intelligent discussion over the actual topic, an example of which took place here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, for sure. The world in general is like that. So much of what is important gets lost in the white noise of irrelevance. But at the same time, the argument over what is/isn&#39;t relevant is a huge part of that. And no one really has any right to say they know better than anyone else. Its just a systematic sort of thing that i honestly believe was pre-concieved and set up on purpose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One could argue about the importance of arguments over what is and isn&#39;t relevant, but that&#39;d be silly and redundant. Perhaps in the grand scheme of things, when a topic is brought up for discussion, discussing the topic is only partially important, and the other key activity is to nitpick what details are relevant. Regardless, people&#39;s inability to focus on anything outside their own frame of beliefs is humorous. </p>
