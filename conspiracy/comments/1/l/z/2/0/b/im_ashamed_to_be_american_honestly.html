<p>Two responses to this, I have.</p>

<p>One is:  I&#39;m ashamed we <em>all</em> have failed at that.  Our duty as free people is to come together, stand up, and protest against this...but we haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>Another is:  We&#39;re <em>not</em> free.  We&#39;re nowhere near as free as we think we are.  We are slaves that <em>think</em> they&#39;re free - slaves that have been brainwashed into thinking they&#39;re free.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your freedom is about being free and each of you argue otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, but that whooshed hard over my head.  Our freedom is about being free?  ...I don&#39;t get it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m ashamed we&#39;re subjected to &quot;vote&quot; under these BS, draconian edicts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve never voted because I&#39;ve always known the system is rigged and voting is generally a joke TPTB laugh at thinking the plebs have any say in matters already decided before any ballots even get filled.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can each accept that your vote is &#39;worthless&#39; and do your &#39;civic&#39; duty and fight harder, stronger and remind me why this shit is supposed to matter...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Again...What?  I got (and liked/agreed with) the &quot;fight harder, stronger&quot; part...but the &quot;remind me of why this shit is supposed to matter&quot; part?  Not sure I got the meaning behind that portion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>chetti990 and no1113,</p>

<p>This BS stops with you. I&#39;m older. Tired. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  Na, my brother.  I might actually be older than <em>you</em>.  Either way, the BS stops with ALL OF US.  Not just me, you, and/or chetti990.  We all have to move forward and do what we can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have plenty of assholes and cretins determined to fuck up this liite blue sphere we call Earth.</p>

<p>Yeah.  It seems the assholes have been winning for a while too, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Do not, for a moment, think that they represent you. <a href="http://youtu.be/9ZuuAuN00xw">They don&#39;t</a>.</p>

<p>They want you to think about flags, allegiance and citizenship. Because then you&#39;ll take respobsibility for their actions. Do not fall for this trap. You are not responsible for their actions. They are responsible for their actions. They don&#39;t want to be responsible for their actions. And now you know why they harp on &quot;we only do what the people want.&quot; Bullshit - they do what they want and then say they&#39;re doing it for you. They&#39;re not. They do everything for themselves.</p>

<p>Do not feel ashamed of these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still trying to grind some solutions out of my idea-making organ.  I&#39;m not as clever as I&#39;d like to be, however.  I&#39;m mostly just trying not to be wasteful or an asshole lately.</p>

<p>The world we live in was built on hard work and also inequality, the way I see it, we need to work hard to make the world we want to see.  Most of our situations boil down to resources and needs, and the disparity between the two.  Consider something like refrigeration, or all the other technologies that have help make us more efficient and less wasteful collectively, that&#39;s what we need more of.  Innovation has long been a positive feature of the USA.  I&#39;m from Canada, and anyone in the world could judge themselves or their communities or countries pretty harshly, yet there is much to be proud of too.  If you can identify a specific problem, maybe it can be addressed somehow.  Feeling shitty because things are bleak might be one of the first problems.  Could you elaborate on what specifically makes you feel ashamed?</p>

<p>But I&#39;m ashamed Americans aren&#39;t going crazy over Syria... Your President, who was elected saying he&#39;d only start a war if it was an imminent threat to America, is about to start a war with no concrete evidence.</p>

<p>I actually feel incredibly anxious and stressed right now... Why can&#39;t the entire world see what a sham this all is </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do see it&#39;s a sham, but the politicians don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass what the people think anymore. They care about big money donors, the super wealthy and the corporate interest. And the corporate interest want this war to happen, so it&#39;s going to happen. Whether congress approves these air strikes or not, Obama is going to do it. There isn&#39;t a chance in hell he won&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be ashamed of America, be ashamed of the greedy elites who installed the modern day class system, the federal government which is their tool, and the lobbyists who work to weaken every form of political mobility and power average citizens have left. The elites have been playing a long con against the entire world, average Americans included. Once we become less comfortable on a larger scale there will most likely be bloody hell to pay. then it all starts up again. It&#39;s a game, see? There&#39;s too many of us to keep an eye on everyone and make sure there aren&#39;t those taking advantage of others, so this is the price we pay for modern civilization.</p>

I am however ashamed of the America I live in. We have stood by and let our lady fall and for that we should all be ashamed. But it&#39;s never too late to take back our home and help fix our nation cause if one thing is true about Americans its that we have a bad ass can do attitude rooted straight to the core. </p>
