       I'm not ashamed because I don't see America as a representation of myself. I feel bad for the people watching mainstream media daily, caught up in the system, believe everything America does is right, and scream that it's the best country in the world.

       My patriotism extends to our people, our mixed traditions, the ideals they founded the country upon. The US Gov't doesn't practice the ideals America preaches. The US Gov't is only renting America.

      <p>
       Two responses to this, I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is:  I'm ashamed we
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       have failed at that.  Our duty as free people is to come together, stand up, and protest against this...but we haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another is:  We're
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       free.  We're nowhere near as free as we think we are.  We are slaves that
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       they're free - slaves that have been brainwashed into thinking they're free.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sorry, but that whooshed hard over my head.  Our freedom is about being free?  ...I don't get it.

      <p>
       I've never voted because I've always known the system is rigged and voting is generally a joke TPTB laugh at thinking the plebs have any say in matters already decided before any ballots even get filled.

      <p>
       ...Again...What?  I got (and liked/agreed with) the "fight harder, stronger" part...but the "remind me of why this shit is supposed to matter" part?  Not sure I got the meaning behind that portion.

       Ha.  Na, my brother.  I might actually be older than

       It's like humanity took a fantastical hallucinatory poison that causes us to be enthralled with an array of flashing lights and endorphins. Little do we know is our state of awe that we are all slowly dying.

       They want you to think about flags, allegiance and citizenship. Because then you'll take respobsibility for their actions. Do not fall for this trap. You are not responsible for their actions. They are responsible for their actions. They don't want to be responsible for their actions. And now you know why they harp on "we only do what the people want." Bullshit - they do what they want and then say they're doing it for you. They're not. They do everything for themselves.

       That's too bad. Especially because the international bankers that are in control of this country aren't even from here. Imagine how you'd feel if you were British. I hope I see you join us in the revolution. I just left a message for the crook I call my congressman. I reminded him of Article 3, Section 3, clause 1 of the United States Constitution and that his job is to IMPEACH our president. Doubt it will happen, but when millions of us are screaming at the same time, we're a hellova lot harder to ignore. Do you even know who your congressman is?

       I'm still trying to grind some solutions out of my idea-making organ.  I'm not as clever as I'd like to be, however.  I'm mostly just trying not to be wasteful or an asshole lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world we live in was built on hard work and also inequality, the way I see it, we need to work hard to make the world we want to see.  Most of our situations boil down to resources and needs, and the disparity between the two.  Consider something like refrigeration, or all the other technologies that have help make us more efficient and less wasteful collectively, that's what we need more of.  Innovation has long been a positive feature of the USA.  I'm from Canada, and anyone in the world could judge themselves or their communities or countries pretty harshly, yet there is much to be proud of too.  If you can identify a specific problem, maybe it can be addressed somehow.  Feeling shitty because things are bleak might be one of the first problems.  Could you elaborate on what specifically makes you feel ashamed?

       We do see it's a sham, but the politicians don't give a rat's ass what the people think anymore. They care about big money donors, the super wealthy and the corporate interest. And the corporate interest want this war to happen, so it's going to happen. Whether congress approves these air strikes or not, Obama is going to do it. There isn't a chance in hell he won't.

       Don't be ashamed of America, be ashamed of the greedy elites who installed the modern day class system, the federal government which is their tool, and the lobbyists who work to weaken every form of political mobility and power average citizens have left. The elites have been playing a long con against the entire world, average Americans included. Once we become less comfortable on a larger scale there will most likely be bloody hell to pay. then it all starts up again. It's a game, see? There's too many of us to keep an eye on everyone and make sure there aren't those taking advantage of others, so this is the price we pay for modern civilization.

       I'm not ashamed to be American. My family has been here since the beginning, since the Mayflower Company. I'm proud as hell to be as American as can be. I am however ashamed of the America I live in. We have stood by and let our lady fall and for that we should all be ashamed. But it's never too late to take back our home and help fix our nation cause if one thing is true about Americans its that we have a bad ass can do attitude rooted straight to the core.
