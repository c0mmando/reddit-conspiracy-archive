    <div class="md"><p>There will probably not much more info coming in the Hasting case.</p>

<p>the offical story is a joke,the evidence is pretty clear.</p>

<p>The people in the mainstream media, don&#39;t dare to speak out because they know what happens.</p>

<p>They, know but are silent like for example Cenk Uygur from TYT.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/xBm-DRmRP9g?t=10s">Michael Hasting calling for a revolution in the Mainstream Media.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/xBm-DRmRP9g?t=10s"> &quot;It sounded like a bomb went off&quot; </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/michael-hastings-feared-his-mercedes-had-been-tampered-with/">Michael Hastings Feared His Mercedes Had Been Tampered With</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/friend-michael-hastings-marked-for-death/">Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly that Hastings was working on his “biggest story yet” involving the CIA. The journalist is known to have made a number of powerful enemies.
Biggs also stated on Fox that it was completely out of character for Hastings to be driving at high speeds that early in the morning. But Biggs made even stronger revelations on the Alex Jones Show as he described how well he knew Hastings.
Biggs and Hastings met in 2008 when the journalist came to Afghanistan to cover the daily combat, an assignment only meant to last one week. That week turned into three months.
“You get to learn a lot about a person in one day of combat, let alone three months of being around them,” Biggs said.
Biggs stayed in touch with the journalist after the assignment, which culminated into a strong friendship.
“I remember when the story broke with General McChrystal and he [Hastings] gave me a call and he’s like ‘man, I’m pretty scared,’” Biggs said. “I told him, ‘You have a reason to be, brother. You basically just got a general of a war fired. I’m pretty sure that doesn’t sit too well with him right now.’”
Hastings’ fear was very well-founded as he received severe death threats over the McChrystal story. </a></p>

<p>An impact with a tree tends to do some amazing things to metal, plastic and fiberglass. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Howabout the numerous accounts of hearing an explosion followed by a crash?</p>

<p>Do the people in these accounts have explosives experience? Can they tell the difference between gunfire, backfire and a firecracker? Ever heard a car crash into a tree at high speed? I bet it sounds like an explosion to someone that&#39;s never heard one before. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard cars bottom out on the street before. Makes an amazing woosh-boom sound followed by flames, sparks, and the driver usually losing control.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The drivetrain? The engine, transmission, driveshaft, differential and rear tires traveled 100 feet away?</p>

<p>No. The engine was thrown from the car from the impact. </p>

<p>And no, it doesn&#39;t. But the information, debate, and logic you bring up is what means you don&#39;t present good information, debate, and logic. For one, it&#39;s sourceless, but it took me less than 5 minutes on your user page to see all the lies you have plastered on here.</p>

<p>Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people, in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an incorrect or deviant decision-making outcome. Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative ideas or viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences.</p>

<p>There are a few people in this sub that think for themselves and aren&#39;t afraid to speak their mind. But if their comments stray too far from the majority, they are ostracized, called names and outright shunned.  </p>

<p>And I just heard that there there is ANOTHER super-secret clubhouse subreddit that was started by the conspiracy theorists so they could all sit around and agree with each other without any of those pesky dissenting opinions getting in the way. This is hilarious to me. Its like a

    <div class="md"><p>Please review my post history, I frequently go to other subreddits and spar with other people who I disagree with. These arguments usually go against what ever the main form of thought is. I also have called out people on this sub a few times for what I viewed to be bad logic or what have you. Frankly I could care less whether or not I conform to any one, especially those on the internet. To be honest, what you&#39;re suggesting about me is laughable. Anyone who knows me would tell you I&#39;m the last person to conform. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I just heard that there there is ANOTHER super-secret clubhouse subreddit that was started by the conspiracy theorists so they could all sit around and agree with each other without any of those pesky dissenting opinions getting in the way. This is hilarious to me. Its like a &quot;loyal order of waterbuffalo,&quot; except their Fez&#39;s are made of tinfoil and the secret password is &quot;False Flag&quot;
Now, how is this NOT groupthink?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For god&#39;s sake, if the people in this sub wanted to just be part of the herd why the hell would they come here? Your argument makes no sense. These people are fringe if anything. Don&#39;t you think we would all just go hang out in r/politics and suck obamas dick if we wanted to be part of a group? </p>

<p>I would argue people here (at least to a greater degree than most of reddit) are here to seek/spread knowledge, nothing more.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wish I could engage you further. At the moment I am at work, and have no internet at my apartment since I just moved. However, I hope you stick around. I would like to continue this at a later date. Please remember my name, as I will yours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drugs were not a factor in his ability to drive a car. Meaning that his motor functions were not impaired. </p>

<p>But smoking pot can make you paranoid. </p>

<p>The side effects of long-term recreational use of Adderall include depression, hostility and paranoia. </p>

<p>According to the coronor&#39;s report, Hasting&#39;s brother claimed that Hastings &quot;believed he was invincible, believing he could jump from a balcony and be okay.&quot;</p>

<p>He also had crashed his car into a pole when he was addicted to Ritalin several years previous.</p>

<p>The report states that he was paranoid to the point of asking one of his friends/neighbors to borrow their car. He also rented two apartments for fear of being spied on. </p>

<p>So....a history of paranoia, prescription drug abuse and a delusion of invincibility, combined with two drugs that can cause paranoia. And this guy just got a top General in the military fired. </p>

<p>No...paranoia COULDNT have been a factor at all in his death.  It MUST be a remote control device planted by the feds that forced his car to speed out of control and crash. </p>

<p>Seems legit to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re focusing your case on his paranoia. But consider the war on whistleblowers and journalists, the nsa spying abuses, and his multiple recent fbi investigations, its reasonable for him the to be concerned.<br/>
Academics studying the hacking of cars have shown how easy it is. Richard clarke confirmed that this matched what a hacked car could be made to do. And according to his neighbor, hastings asked that night if he could use her car because he thought his had been tampered with</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This can go back to his paranoia. If he was really concerned about his car being tampered with, why not take a cab? Why not rent a car and trade it in every few days? This guy was pretty successful and wealthy, so if he was THAT concerned, he had the means to change the game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He asked to use his neighbors car that night, the concern for his car was a recent one. You&#39;re right that he could have/should have just rented a car. But I don&#39;t think anyone, even him, expected his car to be hacked.  But our intel agencies have gone to court over placing GPS units on cars. I&#39;m guessing that he thought he was just being tracked, not targeted for assassination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know if I would call them conspiracy theories, but I dont believe we went into Iraq for the right reasons. The whole &quot;yellow cake&quot; nonsense, the NSA spying thing, etc. I think Snowden should be considered a hero, but Im not sure about Manning, etc.</p>

<p>I try to look at things objectively and with an open mind as much as possible. I fully believe that there is a lot that the government isnt telling us, but stuff like UFO&#39;s? Not so much. I&#39;ve been researching Area 51 since I was a kid. </p>
