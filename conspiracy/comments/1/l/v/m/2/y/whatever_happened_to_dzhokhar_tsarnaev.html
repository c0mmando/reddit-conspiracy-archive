    <div class="md"><p>i stopped reading when you got to the part about the release of the photos and the lack of video evidence of the bags being dropped. Not everything is a conspiracy my friend. You know how much businesses on that street pay in monthly rents? Its like having a storefront on Rodeo drive. Not much money left over for new security cameras every year. Plus if you have security cameras you will always have to be talking to detectives as there are plenty of bars around and the 2am punchups often result in prosecutions. If I had an office on Boylston at ground level I wouldn&#39;t install one. Plus Massachusetts has very strict privacy laws that have only recently been loosened enough to allow the Commonwealth to place cameras on the electronic tolls to catch people driving through them with no transponders. They put the cameras up in the year 2000 and the electronic tolls went up in 1998 so.. ya... we are way behind on the big brother stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the actual area that was locked down was a localized area of Watertown not Cambridge and not Boston. They shut down the MBTA which although it is government owned is a private company. People make a huge deal out of the &quot;Boston lockdown&quot; in this sub and you guys have no concept of what it was like. There weren&#39;t police on the street telling you to go home...nothing like that. The Boston police commissioner ordered the cabs to shut down that are licensed by the city of Boston but they didn&#39;t shut down either. People were mostly asked to stay home and really didn&#39;t have a cheap and simple way to get around as the MBTA was shut down so....seriously stop making it like 4 million people were locked up in their homes waiting for SWAT to kick the door in. It was nothing at all like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>except for one or two houses where people were startled and woken up by SWAT most people in that neighborhood were thrilled to see the police presence as were most people in the Commonwealth. As they pulled him out of the boat my wife and I were having dinner in the Texas road house and one drunk led the bar into a rendition of &quot;God Bless America&quot;  I agree that the 4th amendment is sacred but if you are going to tell this story tell it right. Talk to people actually from Boston and how they felt about the manhunt and how the investigation was handled by our local police. We all loved that BPD pushed the FBI and other local police out of the way and under their command and got the job done. BPD set up a mobile command center in Watertown and called all the shots. As Swat teams from neighboring communities (including my local SWAT METRO NORTH) showed up on scene to volunteer for the manhunt they were all put under command of BPD. Not the State police not the Watertown police not, the FBI </p>

<p>I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are not a shill. However, the only other explanation is that you are profoundly brainwashed. The police have no case whatsoever against the Tsarnaevs other than they (along with hundreds of others) were present at or near the bomb sites before they were detonated. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you look into the real story rather than slavishly believing everything the mainstream media tries to plant in your head?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are far more gullible than I thought. </p>

<p>A policeman was murdered, but you have no shred of evidence that the Tsarnaevs had anything to do with it, just like you have no evidence that they ever handled explosives. Because they didn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may have heard of the fundamental tenet of anglo-saxon justice - innocent until proven guilty? Innocent until a coherent, fact-based and provable explanation demonstrates the Tsarnaevs were more than innocent scapegoats?</p>

<p>When you drill into the official narrative you find nothing. It&#39;s all smoke and mirrors, dead witnesses, one dead patsie and another injured patsie who is supposedly in custody but nobody has seen or heard from for weeks. No lawyer&#39;s statements, nothing from his family, nothing from the media - it&#39;s as if Dzokhar Tsarnaev doesn&#39;t exist any more. And perhaps he doesn&#39;t?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i stopped reading when you got to the part about the release of the photos and the lack of video evidence of the bags being dropped. Not everything is a conspiracy my friend. You know how much businesses on that street pay in monthly rents? Its like having a storefront on Rodeo drive. Not much money left over for new security cameras every year. Plus if you have security cameras you will always have to be talking to detectives as there are plenty of bars around and the 2am punchups often result in prosecutions. If I had an office on Boylston at ground level I wouldn&#39;t install one. Plus Massachusetts has very strict privacy laws that have only recently been loosened enough to allow the Commonwealth to place cameras on the electronic tolls to catch people driving through them with no transponders. They put the cameras up in the year 2000 and the electronic tolls went up in 1998 so.. ya... we are way behind on the big brother stuff. </p>
