       of being a libertarian circlejerk but the ideology is on the right track, the only way to fix societies problems is to limit the centralization of power. Psychopaths make up between 1-4% of the population, many of them are perfectly rational and logical, hiding behind a carefully constructed facade, and they abuse and manipulate people simply for the sake of abusing and manipulating them. When the capacity for abuse of power exists, it will be abused. It doesn't matter if the country is Russia, Germany, or the United States, psychopaths exist everywhere and will end up saturating power structures and continually consolidate their power and wealth.

       I try to avoid associating myself with one ideology over another, as I think the constitution transcends them...but it never ceases to amaze me that upholding the constitution in this day and age is thought of as "extreme", is portrayed so by the media, and people just seem to lap it up.  The establishment propaganda of the last 50 years or so is doing its trick it seems.

       Barack was suppose to be our Mr.Constitutional, it was until he won his presidency that the avalanche commenced.

       Now we are seeing the same people who supported this hypocrite, stand beside him no matter what direction he goes.

       Accepting that you made a horrible mistake is one of the least likely options, but continuing a perpetual state of a dystopia in the matter of debating between two parties that are both similarly deterring us from real coherency, is much- much easier.

       So yes, brainwashing, mind control, conditioning, diluting, processed &amp; regulated information has been a great success for the supremacy. While it remains to be an unprecedented epidemic in our general populations for decades.

       It's important to note that it isn't just the subjugated who are indoctrinated. The ruling class exist in a bubble that perhaps blinds them to an even greater extent.. (positive reinforcement, sycophants, sense of entitlement, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's fair to say that a dystopian soulless future is by no means guaranteed. Everyone reading these words right now was at one time or another an unenlightened person who never even considered the possibility that life was anything other than what they were told. Are we so special? Is it not possible that the natural state of man is NOT unquestioning obedience and servitude? I see no reason to think that only a small fraction of people are capable of escaping the chains of their indoctrination... on the contrary, I see it accelerating.

       It's amazing what Ron Paul takes shit for, when you consider what he really brings to the table.  Here we have, finally, a politician who speaks truth to power, who is honest, who values the constitution, who is consistent, who represents the people, who embraces policies consistent with the values the country was founded on...and yet people will criticize him for some accounting issues with his campaign while defending Obama,  the man in power who consistently rewards and bails out institutions that have done little more than piss on the constitution and sodomize the American people.  It makes no sense.

        <strong>
         Every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of nineteen years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right. It may be said, that the succeeding generation exercising, in fact, the power of repeal, this leaves them as free as if the constitution or law had been expressly limited to nineteen years only
        </strong>
        . In the first place, this objection admits the right, in proposing an equivalent. But the power of repeal is not an equivalent. It might be, indeed, if every form of government were so perfectly contrived, that the will of the majority could always be obtained, fairly and without impediment. But this is true of no form. The people cannot assemble themselves; their representation is unequal and vicious. Various checks are opposed to every legislative proposition. Factions get possession of the public councils, bribery corrupts them, personal interests lead them astray from the general interests of their constituents; and other impediments arise, so as to prove to every practical man, that a law of limited duration is much more manageable than one which needs a repeal." --

       One sign of cognitive dissidence is the inability to address the central issue or context of an argument - Instead looking for any excuse to actually confront their sacred beliefs. In your case you took a word at the very end of my argument and blew it up to the place of the headline.

       I don't think I'm the one who's missing the point.  I have more faith in someone who bases his policies around a constitution that's 200 years old than in people who only act as puppets for the banking/corporate sector and other private interests.

       I have no faith. I have reason. A false dichotomy (yeah I must be a shill, that's it.) is a sign of mental weakness. If that's the best you can come up with I have no choice as to simply categorize you as
       <strong>
        gullible
       </strong>
       .

       The difference is that Ron Paul pretends to support the constitution and the framers of our nation...

       Except that your interpretation of this quote only makes sense when you ignore the entire rest of Jefferson's body of work. Jefferson definitely didn't think that positive law "given by dead generations" is null and void; he was not a moron. He was simply a proponent of regular (and easy) changes and improvements of the constitution, and a proponent of giving the people the possibility of adopting new constitutions if it's in their will. The authors of the constitution were against that, and even adressed Jefferson's critique in the Federalist Papers (No. 80-something). They consciously made it extremely hard to change the constitution. That's why most of the constitutional changes (if you can call them that) in America go the route of judicial review by the Supreme Court.

       I don't support Ron Paul because he doesn't support the separation of church and state in school, is opposed to campaign finance reform, doesn't support legal action against at-work sexual harassment, tried to ban adoption for gay couples and non-married couples, anti-abortion stance, he contests that privacy in regards to sexual matters is guaranteed by the constitution, voted no for human cloning, feels that "education is not a right," supports selling off public land, that states should establish environmental standards instead of the federal government, that climate change isn't such a big deal, that health care is not a right, that government research should be privatized, has voted against Medicare and medical aid to low income families with children, voted against the Genetic Predisposition Act, is opposed to hospitals having to treat people in emergency situations regardless of their ability to pay, is opposed to medical insurance companies being forced to cover people with pre-existing conditions, and wants to get rid of the FDA.

       It's libertarian in the sense of anti-authoritarianism, not libertarian in the sense of the political party named after the philosophical concept.  It's like Drudge tweeted the other day that the paradigm is no longer Republican vs Democrat, but libertarian vs authoritarian because there is no real difference between the parties and the other dichotomy is the only true political paradigm we are dealing with.

       Ron Paul is gaining popularity as we speak. The dominant government paradigm that suppressed him and his candidacy is slowly but surely losing control of the narrative. This is not a conspiracy theory, this is observable fact. If you're like me and you believe that the vast majority of human beings are good, you can take comfort in knowing that just because shit sucks right now, it doesn't mean it's going to suck

       Not sure how old you are but Dr. Ron Paul is now very much older than when he inspired throngs of youth to climb trees to hear him speak. Filled spaces that no other GOP candidate did.

       Yes. Some people in this thread should realize that the US constitution is a notoriously "open" document that can be interpreted in a variety of ways, in contrast to other constitutions that are way more specific. It's one of the major reasons for its "success" - i.e. the fact no other constitution so far has managed to stay in place for over 200 years. That's why the Supreme Court is so powerful and political: the room for interpretation that the constitution leaves is so big that it can easily be read in many different ways, depending on your political stance.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no one, "true" way of reading the US constitution, and people who think there is simply don't know what they're talking about. That's simply wishful thinking, a result of that ridiculous "the constitution is holy and infallible" ideology that's so popular in the USA.

       Last I checked Ron Paul had a large majority of his campaign contributions from direct military sources. That in itself should say a lot. The dude gets major donations from military and its personnel while The other two had a lot of funding from the same financial institutions.

       I really agree with all of that, and it's too damn bad, it really is.  When Ron Paul is on the fringe, I really think it's time to examine your perspectives.  I mean honestly, that CAN'T be right.

       I think there are a lot of people who are disappointed with what is going on with the American government right now, but their views on how to solve it are too varied and complicated to be expressed through the current two party system. I hear a lot of the same common arguments from progressives, libertarians, moderates, etc., and they all agree that the system that we have now is serving those in power, not the public. This is inevitable for any political system, or manufactured intentionally. A lot of protections that were provided by the Constitution and Bill of Rights (4th Amendment, Citizens United), or enshrined in law (Glass Steagall) have been eroded in recent years, and neither of the two parties seem prepared to do anything about it, especially with the NSA and Syria situations dominating the MSM. Frankly, I find it all depressing. I don't see a 3rd party that is capable of uniting a such a disparate group of people against such a powerful and divisive propaganda system. Nor am I able to identify an ideology around which such individuals could be unified.

       I have a high degree of respect for people who sign up for the armed forces under the pretense of defending the constitution...however in recent years it's only amounted to participation in various corporate wars of aggression.  This is why I've always understood Paul to be so popular with people in the military.
