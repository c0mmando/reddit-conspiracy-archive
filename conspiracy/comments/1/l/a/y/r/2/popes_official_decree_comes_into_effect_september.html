      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In ratifying numerous international conventions in these areas, and acting also on behalf of Vatican City State, the Holy See has constantly maintained that such agreements are effective means to prevent criminal activities that threaten human dignity, the common good and peace.
With a view to renewing the Apostolic See’s commitment to cooperate to these ends, by means of this Apostolic Letter issued Motu Proprio, I establish that:
1. The competent Judicial Authorities of Vatican City State shall also exercise penal jurisdiction over:
       </p>
       <p>
        a) crimes committed against the security, the fundamental interests or the patrimony of the Holy See;
b) crimes referred to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         in Vatican City State Law No. VIII, of 11 July 2013, containing Supplementary Norms on Criminal Law Matters;
        </li>
        <li>
         in Vatican City State Law No. IX, of 11 July 2013, containing Amendments to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code;
when such crimes are committed by the persons referred to in paragraph 3 below, in the exercise of their functions;
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        c) any other crime whose prosecution is required by an international agreement ratified by the Holy See, if the perpetrator is physically present in the territory of Vatican City State and has not been extradited.
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         The crimes referred to in paragraph 1 are to be judged pursuant to the criminal law in force in Vatican City State at the time of their commission, without prejudice to the general principles of the legal system on the temporal application of criminal laws.
        </li>
        <li>
         For the purposes of Vatican criminal law, the following persons are deemed “public officials”:
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        a) members, officials and personnel of the various organs of the Roman Curia and of the Institutions connected to it.
b) papal legates and diplomatic personnel of the Holy See.
c) those persons who serve as representatives, managers or directors, as well as persons who even de facto manage or exercise control over the entities directly dependent on the Holy See and listed in the registry of canonical juridical persons kept by the Governorate of Vatican City State;
d) any other person holding an administrative or judicial mandate in the Holy See, permanent or temporary, paid or unpaid, irrespective of that person’s seniority.
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         The jurisdiction referred to in paragraph 1 comprises also the administrative liability of juridical persons arising from crimes, as regulated by Vatican City State laws.
        </li>
        <li>
         When the same matters are prosecuted in other States, the provisions in force in Vatican City State on concurrent jurisdiction shall apply.
        </li>
        <li>
         The content of article 23 of Law No. CXIX of 21 November 1987, which approves the Judicial Order of Vatican City State remains in force.
This I decide and establish, anything to the contrary notwithstanding.
I establish that this Apostolic Letter issued Motu Proprio will be promulgated by its publication in L’Osservatore Romano, entering into force on 1 September 2013.
Given in Rome, at the Apostolic Palace, on 11 July 2013, the first of my Pontificate.
        </li>
       </ol>

       I could not confirm that the scribe link was displying an actual real document. I am willing to consider that the US is a corporation, but I'm still looking for concrete evidence. So far it is a small amount of government legalese, mumbling and stuff. We need hard proof. I tried to find a site map on the delaware web site but could not. Perhaps they changed stuff...probably.

       Yup, this is a fantastic story. The newest Pope has been acting like a completely different life form (in a good way) than any previous in my living memory. Then he busts out this move.

       It's the two beasts of Revelations. The 1st beast is the US, the second is the Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       The First Beast
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelation: Jesus Christ’s Final Message of Hope, the first beast of Revelation 13, rising out of the sea, is virtually unanimously acknowledged to be a symbol of the persecuting force of political Rome’s power against the early Christians. The late brother J. W. Roberts wrote: “It seems clear that the first beast represents Imperial Rome” (1974, 108). Similar comments could be multiplied many times over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Second Beast
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue then becomes: what is symbolized by the second beast that arises out of the earth? This evil force clearly is distinguished from the sea beast, being designated as “another” beast (v. 11). The term “another” (allos) suggests, however, another of a similar devilish character.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scholars who have not been influenced by Catholicism’s brand of “preterism” (an interpretation that does not reach in scope beyond Imperial Rome), contend that the second beast most significantly represented the fomenting apostate church (that is a church that had digressed from the primitive pattern of Christianity; cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:1ff; 1 Timothy 4:1ff; 2 Timothy 4:1ff).
      </p>
      <p>
       These “beasts” are “two agents through whom Satan carries out his war against believers”.

       Don't be so naïve, friend. The Vatican was once a global authority. They are aiming for that again, whether you like it or not.

       Did you not learn any history? Most of Northern Europe split with the Vatican in the 16th century (the Reformation).
      </p>
      <p>
       No Anglo countries owe any allegiance to the Catholic Church, and that is most definitely NOT about to change. The naivety is all yours if you think otherwise.

       Yeah, this is r/conspiracy not r/lunacy. The majority of people on this planet who have triple digit IQs don't believe in deities, or an "antichrist" so a bells and whistles bibletard show is not going to achieve the intended objective.
