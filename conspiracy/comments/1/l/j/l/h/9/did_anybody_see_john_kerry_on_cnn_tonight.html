Well usually when you have a face lift or plastic surgery you usually end up with a couple black eyes because of the surgery. I think he had some work done and now he just looks off.</p>

You and I realize politicians are figureheads, especially the high-power ones, but it seems to escape the grasp of 90% of Americans.

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching CNN and following the 4chan /pol/ thread. </p>

<p>Some interesting quote excerpts for you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>allies in the region
only mentions isreal</p>

<p>comparing assad to al-queda
meanwhile wanting to send support to al-queda</p>

<p>if you&#39;re not with us, you support terrorism</p>

<p>Somebody points out I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about
Must be damage control! I can&#39;t possibly be wrong!</p>

<p>Becoming Al Qaeda&#39;s air force is going to help the US.</p>

<p>killing people with bombs and sending in troops
not war</p>

<p>50 years of wars of attrition is something that should be continued
because it&#39;s our &#39;duty&#39;</p>

<p>B-BUT AT LEAST WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO ATTACK IRAN RIGHT?</p>

<p>OBAMA SAID WE WOULDN&#39;T ATTACK IRAN RIGHT? AT LEAST WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO WAR WITH IRAN</p>

<p>second hour:
&quot;don&#39;t compare this to the strike on Bosnia, because it was different and we didn&#39;t record direct causalities.&quot;
third hour:
&quot;this will be like Bosnia, trust the admin; just grant us the power to strike as a &#39;deterrent&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>how can i brainwash the masses to believe us that we should fight in syria</p>

<p>Bera admitting that Americans are overwhelmingly against intervention in Syria
&#39;How can I tell them they&#39;re wrong?&#39;</p>

<p>it&#39;s clearly in the interest of the american people
but whhyyyyy
it&#39;s clearly in the interest of the american people because MU CHEMICAL WEAPONS THAT WE GAVE TO THE FSA XD</p>

<p>next week we are going to celebrate 9/11</p>

<p>9/11 which was funded by our allies is the same as someone in syria using chemical weapons</p>

<p>classified contingency plans with regional partners to secure the chemical weapons
This says a lot. They are admitting that Saudi arabia, Quatar, Turkey and Isrtael already have plans to take LAND in syria in a ground invasion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so we have to attack Syria, and fight FOR Al Queda, to prevent islamic extremism?</p>

<p>We have to support islamic extremists to prevent islamic extremists?</p>

<p>also</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Goal of removing Assad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>rewind several minutes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is not reigeme change</p>
</blockquote>

<p>several minutes before that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we want to aid reigeme change and result in a western apathetic government.</p>

<p>To be fair, this is just to put on a show. All of the decisions are made behind closed doors where the corporations write the checks to our politicians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re either with Al Qaeda or you&#39;re with the terrorists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they&#39;re all acting. It&#39;s all about selling weapons, getting oil, and taking out israel&#39;s enemies so it can expand. Their goal is perpetual war, they don&#39;t give a shit a bout this generation or the next, they&#39;ll all die for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to celebrate 9/11
I&#39;m not joking he actually said that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lol you just got called out Kerry</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to strikes but want to review the evidence you have first
NO WE MUST BOMB THE BROWN PEOPLE FOR FREEDOM</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to get off Mr. Kerry&#39;s Wild Ride.</p>
