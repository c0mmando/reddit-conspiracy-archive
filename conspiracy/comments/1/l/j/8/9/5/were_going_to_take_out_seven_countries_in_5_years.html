<p>My opinion is that these last 3 will have a total media blackout, and will be done in the dead of night, and quick enough so the people will have no way to react and protest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, what he says is fully backed up by documents. Sorry to keep spamming this here everyone but it&#39;s necessary for people to see it again and again. I suggest you take the time to read all of this because this is the closest you&#39;ll get to the stated goals.</p>

<p><strong>The US had a policy coup in 2001 in the Bush Administration.</strong></p>

<p>As stated since 1996 by Israeli and US interests policy advisors and politicians, the Middle East was to be cleaned out of anyone that Israel perceived to be a threat to its regional security.</p>

<p><strong>1996</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm">A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm Wikipedia</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.israeleconomy.org/strat1.htm">Here is the actual report where the information is sourced from READ IT</a></p>

<p>&quot;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the &quot;Clean Break&quot; report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by <strong>Richard Perle</strong> for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel&#39;s security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on &quot;Western values&quot;. <strong>It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1997</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">Project for the New American Century Wikipedia</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/">The official website</a></p>

<p>&quot;The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. established in 1997 as a non-profit educational organization founded by <strong>William Kristol</strong> and <strong>Robert Kagan</strong>. The PNAC&#39;s stated goal is &quot;to promote American global leadership.&quot;[1] Fundamental to the PNAC were the view that &quot;American leadership is both good for America and good for the world&quot; and support for &quot;a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity.&quot;[2] With its members in numerous key administrative positions, <strong>the PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration&#39;s development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Both these documents were written or had signatories of the same people and also after writing them they were appointed in the Bush Administration.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Signatories_or_contributors_to_other_significant_letters_or_reports.5B15.5D">List of signatories</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Associations_with_Bush_administration">Ties to the Bush Administration</a></p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/Ha1rEhovONU">Here is the four star general Wesley Clarke explaining how he was told that the US would attack seven countries which include Libya, Lebanon, Syria and Iran</a></p>

<p>He also mentions that the coup was done by people aforementioned above in both policy reports and the Bush Administration.</p>

<p>As before, these people sit on think tanks and defence boards and collect up neocon academics to write columns in newspapers, appear on TV and make the case for intervention.</p>

<p><a href="http://henryjacksonsociety.org/about-the-society/international-patrons-2/">Henry Jackson society</a></p>

<p>If you look at the names listed and then go back to the list of signatories link and look who wrote the Project for the New American Century, you can see it matches up with many of the names.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/about/board-of-advisors/">The Washington Institute for Near East Policy</a></p>

<p>Again, some of the same people on the board of directors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/about-fdd/team-overview/category/leadership-council">The Foundation for Defence and Democracies Leadership Council</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/about-fdd/team-overview/category/board-of-advisors">Board of Advisors</a></p>

<p>Same again here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/">The Weekly Standard Conservative Magazine</a></p>

<p>William Kristol is an editor and they often have columns or pieces written by people from the list of signatories to The Project for a New American Century.</p>

<p>What is happening here is the central message is being spread out to satellite organisations where people perceive that a greater number of experts think war is a good idea. <strong>This is how public perception is shaped.</strong></p>

<p>Many times you look at who is calling for intervention on the news and it will be from one of these think tanks like the communications directors of said think tanks or one of the contributors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even disagreeing that he could be partially correct. I hold the view that there is a plot to systematically weaken middle eastern countries, the ol divide and conquer. But, I think people should be suspecious of why he is saying it out loud. </p>
