    <div class="md"><p>The darkness of the revealed items reflect the reality of what is really there. There really are bad groups of people out there who hide everything they do from us. They distort true revelations of their activities so that the muddy waters of the conspiracy world leave people floundering for truth and light. Revealing the darkness is the job of the light. However truth of this darkness is not pretty. </p>

<p>While it would be lovely if we could spend as much time on teaching and elevating, the real subject matter must still be posted. Each day new people learn these things and come in here to read them. </p>

<p>To spend equal time on both revealing the darkness and in showing people the answers to such difficulties is a great goal. Trying to do so without revealing the depths of the darkness will not be truthful and therefore would take away the power of the defense against it.</p>

<p>The best bet for anyone is to add your voice of light to the darkness posted here. Nothing less is a viable option for you (the royal you) other than leaving. </p>

I just see that there is more to it than trying not to view the darkness. If you do not know the enemy and reveal what is hidden you do a great disservice to your compatriots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not a bad point, but, for me, I think part of the reason it&#39;s dark is because conspiracy DOES indeed exist and DOES indeed cover this world in a dark, dark force of negativity.  There is what you WANT the world to be to be (what <em>we</em> want the world to be - i.e. good, and where everyone&#39;s aware), and there is what it IS - which is to a great extent dark and secretive - controlled by secretive, elite, and often extremely negative forces.</p>

<p>Seems to me that the dark theme of this subreddit is tacitly acknowledging how this world that we in this sub are fighting against is - i.e. <em>dark</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you&#39;re right.  However I think the &quot;All Seeing Eye&quot; is a little redundant.  Yet, we see video after video asking why it&#39;s in public places, but then slap it right here.  </p>

<p>My issues with the current layout are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Propaganda-ish posters at the side bother me.  It&#39;d rather see us work on a better FAQ for newcomers from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </li>
<li>Either put a lot of thought into a layout, or none all.  The MIB theme seemed to be a step up from the pyramid to me, but not ideal. </li>
<li>Simplicity is key: It&#39;s better if a layout isn&#39;t noticed because it&#39;s subtle and not something worth making a self post about. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>In order to expose the darkness we must illuminate it with light. This involves bringing it from the shadows into the light where it can be properly exposed and vetted out. In this process do not feed the darkness with your energy. Recognize it for what it is and focus on the light. See the change that is occurring with all our brothers and sisters who are waking up and becoming more conscious of their being. It all starts off when we begin to question the system that has enslaved us for so long. This is part of the process of awakening. It&#39;s all happening right now in this moment. The momentum of change is bringing beautiful things. Just open yourself up to it and you shall receive this intuitive knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sentiment is sincere, but also naive. The problems of the world at large being addressed in this sub are akin to a necrotic or festering wound. You don&#39;t mildly or passively treat these symptoms. This is catastrophic level failure of systems. Its time for serious action. It may seem harsh to think about amputating your arm. After all, you&#39;re quite fond of it. You start to think you won&#39;t be able to live without it. The truth is if you don&#39;t cut it off, you will die. Understand, this mindset is the reason this sub takes a serious and somber tone. We have reconciled the amputation we will live on. </p>
