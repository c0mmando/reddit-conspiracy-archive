        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h2>If life were a movie, Obama would make this speech - we&#39;d all cheer,  all humanity would evolve and he&#39;d be considered one of the greatest men of all time.      </h2>

<p>&quot;I have failed the American people, and the people of the world who look to the United States and its president for leadership, direction and support.    The prior administration abused your trust and stained our reputation in global affairs with lies and manipulation to make us give away our rights and propel us into wars and acts of aggression that only served the greed of corporate interests.  You elected me because I ‘inspired’ you to believe things could be different, and you re-elected me on ‘hope’ that it was still possible.  </p>

<p>It hurts me to say that over the course of my presidency I have made no difference, and that things are worse than ever before.   There have been times when I  tried to take an action that I knew would benefit us , only to be blocked by other men with power and influence or put in a situation where I had to compromise too much to get too little.    Like you, I have been pushed and pulled, manipulated and controlled and what I have learned is that the president is not the most powerful man in the world.   </p>

<p>Feeling powerless to do what needs to be done is a terrible feeling.   The American people and the people of the world know this feeling well.   You have watched our financial systems crumble, while you work harder and harder for less and less.    You have lost faith in the media, whose ‘news’ is scripted and filtered.    You have seen sons and daughters go to wars that we have no reason being part of for reasons that cannot be justified.      You have watched your liberty taken as your words, location, voice, habits and connections have been spied on and stored away by secret people in secret locations.   You have watched the fall of democracy as the medium that carried your voice and your intent has been corrupted, twisted and bought by the highest bidder.    </p>

<p>We have been immobilized by fear, and confusion and I’m here to say, that it stops now.    Effective immediately, I’m taking back the power of the president and I call on each and every one of you to take back your power of democracy and protest.   </p>

<p>Effective immediately, I am recalling all troops from the Middle East nations.    America is no longer at war with any country on the planet.      I will work with UN leaders to determine what ‘peacekeeping’ presence is necessary to help support this transition and ensure these countries are able to function on their own.</p>

<p>Effective immediately, I am dismantling all systems used to track and spy on innocent citizens and putting in legislation that will give independent parties full access to validate and ensure these systems are removed and the data that has been collected is destroyed.   There are people who will say this will leave us vulnerable to terror attacks and to those people I say, maybe you are right.  But the cost we’ve been paying is too high.   Instead of treating everyone like a possible terrorist and creating our own police state, let’s embrace one another as equal members of the human race and see if leading relationships down a different path eradicates terrorism in a way that policing it never could.</p>

<p>Effective immediately I am entering legislation that will ensure that the internet stays open and free of monitoring and manipulation.    Crimes and inexcusable acts that hurt people will not be tolerated and law enforcement will be given the tools and training to ensure the law is followed.    I am also entering controls so that corporations no longer have the right to profit and steal your identity, your pictures, and your interests under the weak legal stipulation of an end user license agreement that you clicked ‘okay’ on.  This is wrong, and will no longer be tolerated.</p>

<p>Effectively immediately I am launching separate investigations into the attack of Sept 11, the Boston Marathon bombings, and the grounds in which we went to war in Iraq.    This will not be a long, drawn out dog and pony show behind closed doors to give the pretense of action.   I am giving the independent investigators 30 days to complete their investigation and unlimited access and the proceedings will be public.   I am also requiring that all witnesses be connected to lie detection machines to ensure honest testimony.     We will get to the bottom of the truth.</p>

<p>Effective immediately, I am declassifying all military and black ops projects and history.     Only the names will remain classified to protect the innocent, but those found guilty of illegal activity will be fully prosecuted.   We are now a transparent, open book.     This will bring pain, as the world will see some of the crimes against humanity that have been perpetrated under the veil of American interests but it’s a truth we need to face in order to move on, and be the nation and the race we want to be.    Moving forward, plausible deniability will not be part of this office.   The president will know everything that happens in its government, and I will be accountable for it.   </p>

<p>Effectively immediately we are taking back control of our monetary system.   I am putting together a full loan forgiveness program to clear all debt and start fresh.   Unless we change the system itself however, this would only be a short term solution.   For this reason, within 30 days I am ordering the closure of the Federal Reserve and the privatization of our money.</p>

<p>Effective immediately, lobby groups and private campaign contributions will be strictly forbidden and illegal.   A new system will be erected that give all candidates the means to communicate to voters and their constituents and the people access to question and communicate with their representatives.   The days of money buying politicians and policy is over. </p>

<p>Effectively immediately, all technology that is used to feed, provide shelter or warmth to life cannot be patented, nor can the means to obtain it be restricted by supply chain or policy.    Any patents that have been obtained through blackops are also public domain.   Monsanto and companies who have tried to control food supply through genetic engineering are under a full review.   I will make it my focus that we use technology to increase food supply, not limit it.   If my gardener has to work daily to keep weeds off the white house lawn, why couldn’t those strains of weeds be mixed with tomatoes and cucumbers so that they spread and grow as rapidly?   I imagine a future where corn, carrots and trees of apples and oranges are covering the earth and feeding all.   </p>

<p>We are facing a global population problem, but our solution isn’t in vaccinations that sterilize or epidemics that kill millions.   Our solution is in new energy solutions, clean water programs and abundant food options.      Any medical treatments that could lead to population control will not be tolerated.<br/>
I believe many of these solutions, along with the ability to expand off our planet and colonize other worlds already exists and is being restricted and controlled by corporate and compartmentalized government groups.     I am launching a full investigation into the UFO and alien phenomenon that millions of people on the planet believe has been covered up and controlled and bring these technologies into the open.</p>

<p>Our budgets will be public, and like any smart business they will be under scrutiny.   Effective immediately I am cutting the 52.6 billion dollars a year we spend on the CIA, the NSA and its sister organizations down to 2.1 billion.  The people and the money that has been displaced will go into the preformentioned investigations, truly altruistic and transparent projects, and military spend because until all nations follow suit we will still need to protect ourselves.     </p>

<p>People, these are not easy changes and they will generate chaos before they bring the peace they are intended for.    The people that brought us to these dire ends will stop at nothing to maintain their power over us.    You will be inundated with rumors, fear mongering, slander campaigns and anything else they can think of to keep us from supporting these changes.    Stay the course.   Get active.   Write letters.   If you are in a corporate, military or government position and you are aware of corruption or morally wrong behavior, blow the whistle!     I will do everything in my power to make our country and this world a better place, and I need you to do the same.    To ensure that these changes continue if something happens to me, I have created a new independent presidential oversight group who have authority over the president and who’s only objective is to ensure these actions are executed and to identify and remove all corruption from this office. </p>

<p>Today is a new day, and the start of a new way of life for us as we try to break free of the mistakes of our past and create a new way of living.    Thank you, and good night.&quot;- President Barrack Obama</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d settle for that being a <strong>start</strong>, but as an overall impact to rebuild his reputation? </p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>Not even close. </p>

<p>If punishment isn&#39;t apart of the apology, the apology is worthless. <strong>This</strong> is the exact games they play on us.</p>

<p>I find it absolutely pathetic to even mention Obama being considered a hero, despite any words that come out of his mouth.</p>

<p>A speech? Really? That&#39;s good enough to let go of all of the despicable things this man should be held accountable for? <strong>We really need a morality check.</strong></p>

<p>I propose this idea instead, it could happen! 
So Obama approaches the podium, and then his eyes would suddenly start flicker violently while foam starts coming out of his mouth. He then explodes in hysterical laughter and runs like crazy towards the back of the room and there he jumps up and starts pulling down the tapestry while shouting <strong>It&#39;s all a lie! It&#39;s all a lie!</strong> And behind the wall you can see all his special handlers, ET’s and a couple of monkeys and shit.

    <div class="md"><p>Except I believe JFK was already walking against the cliffs edge up into his presidency.</p>

<p>After 40 years this governmental system has strengthened their schemes. Making damn sure that another man like JFK doesn&#39;t ever reach that type of authorization. </p>

<p>Corruption has only gained traction since 1963- so making the comparison is a difficult thing to do, imo. </p>

<p>Basically my point is that the presidential chair is not a seat for someone that isn&#39;t in favor of fostering the agenda of money, control, &amp; power. This is 2013- not 1963. </p>

<p>You could change the face and name of Obama a thousand times, I will say the same thing. It&#39;s his position that attenuates ANY practicality of him &quot;changing&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to come off as pretentious either, history is on my side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d settle for that being a <strong>start</strong>, but as an overall impact to rebuild his reputation? </p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>Not even close. </p>

<p>If punishment isn&#39;t apart of the apology, the apology is worthless. <strong>This</strong> is the exact games they play on us.</p>

<p>I find it absolutely pathetic to even mention Obama being considered a hero, despite any words that come out of his mouth.</p>

<p>A speech? Really? That&#39;s good enough to let go of all of the despicable things this man should be held accountable for? <strong>We really need a morality check.</strong></p>
