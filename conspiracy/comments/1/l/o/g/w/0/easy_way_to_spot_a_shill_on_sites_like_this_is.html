I would tend to say something along the lines of, &quot;I can only tell you the truth and you have to judge if the information is good enough to change your mind.

<p>Hi, I&#39;m having trouble interpreting your lunacy here. Is this a reference to vaccination or perhaps abortion, or are you literally saying that when we&#39;re not on Reddit, people <em>who disagree with you</em> wander the streets looking for children to kill?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ANY WAY THE WIND BLOWS
Post should come from the apparent position of unconcern.
An effective strategy is deviating to a typically banal topic as more concerning or interesting.</p>

<p>ATTACK THE SOURCE
Undermine the credibility of the source either through misleading evidence or condescension.
This is especially effective for users who view comments first.</p>

<p>BASELESS INSULT
Post should be derogatory, while the actual approach can vary, with condescension being one of the most effective methods for reddit.
This is apparently ineffectual on the surface, but has a cumulative social effect of the feeling of being isolated.
This is an effective tactic for evoking apathy and hopelessness in dissenters over time.</p>

<p>BLAME DISTRIBUTION
Point out that absolute blame cannot be established for any one source.
This will create a perception of shared responsibility, thereby inhibiting specific criticism.
This is an excellent means of establishing apathy and hopelessness.</p>

<p>CLAIM VICTIMIZATION
Whether self or other, claiming the position of a victim in relation to dissent can play on emotions.
This is an effective tactic for deviating away from the original discussion.</p>

<p>COMMAND O&#39; THE CHAIN
Using any number of methods, pull users into chained replies that deviate from the original topic whenever possible.
This is highly effective for diverting readers from more relevant, informative posts.</p>

<p>CONFIDENT DENIAL
Respond by denying the user&#39;s claims by claiming they are incorrect without providing evidence to the contrary.
This can give some uninformed users the impression of authority on the topic, thereby contributing to apathy and hopelessness.</p>

<p>CONVENIENT CONFUSION
Post from the apparent perspective of someone confused or unable to connect the dots on the issue.
A great tactic for deriving additional language from a dissenter in order to exploit and discredit them.</p>

<p>DON&#39;T YOU WORRY ABOUT _____
Indicate a superior understanding of the topic being discussed from a place of confident unconcern.
It is preferable to choose a position that cannot be disproved by Joe Public, i.e. exclusive knowledge
Users will infer that the concerns are ill founded, thereby damaging credibility.</p>

<p>GENERALIZE AND MARGINALIZE OPINIONS
Play on existing perceptions of subreddits and reddit as a whole to marginalize dissent.
Some common examples include simply referring to: [1] <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>, [2] <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, [3] <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, &quot;the hive mind&quot;
Additionally, the post need not even exist in one of these subreddits for this approach to be used.</p>

<p>HOLOCAUST WINS
A well established approach to deflecting comparisons involving Nazis, Hitler, and the Holocaust.
Response should typically appear to be from a place of condescension or emotion.</p>

<p>ISN&#39;T GIFT WRAPPED
Attack the argument&#39;s presentation, typically as uncivil, aggressive, rude, etc.
Should angry dissent continue to present itself, utilize this reaction to further justify your point.
This is an effective tactic for increasing frustration and apathy.</p>

<p>LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT A.K.A. FALSE OPTION
Respond with a false alternative solution to the issues being addressed.</p>

<p>NOSTRADOWNVOTES
Predict behavior of &quot;The Hive Mind&quot; with certainty.</p>

<p>NOT THE SOURCE
An effective strategy for countering specific criticism.
Response should indicate that the criticism is not directed at the real root of the issue.
Never define the root of the issue.</p>

<p>OLD NEWS
A means of diminishing blame by distributing it over time, so as to lessen the contrast (and perception) of negativity.
Response should indicate that the issue being called into question has existed for an extended duration.
This is an effective means of establishing apathy and hopelessness.</p>

<p>OTHER COUNTRIES DO IT
A means of distributing blame amongst multiple parties, so as to lessen the contrast (and perception) of negativity.
Response should indicate that the issue being called into question occurs all over the world.
Pointing out duration can be especially useful when said issue has existed elsewhere prior.</p>

<p>PERPETUATE APATHY
Establish or support the idea that there is no potential solution to a problem, or that the chosen solution will not work (without establishing an alternative to take its place).
This should typically be done from the apparent perspective of someone with a realistic or skeptical worldview.</p>

<p>REPRESENTATIVE
Speak from the apparent perspective of the majority of users.
This is effective for garnering support from uncertain redditors willing to go with the apparent flow.</p>

<p>TECHNICALITY
State literal facts while completely avoiding the context.
If appropriately constructed, false context will be inferred by the uninformed, and the informed will be hesitant to argue with a technicality.</p>

<p>X IS WORSE
An effective means of sidetracking a discussion.
This is especially useful when the new topic addresses an issue that might be much more difficult to resolve or has no apparent resolution.
Additionally, this can overwhelm some users as they feel focusing on a single issue (when there are much larger ones) will accomplish little.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Myself. I came around to 9/11 slowly and on my own terms, in my own time. I&#39;ve seen enough to be convinced that the entire world was played and played hard.</p>

<p>&quot;Evidence&quot; is the whole enchilada! All tightly, perfectly wrapped up and ready for the table. What we were served never resembled &#39;evidence&#39; and people are pushing back from the table.</p>

<p>Massive tons of steel and concrete fell, fast &amp; hard on 9/11 (3 x&#39;s in one day!) and as a lifer in the construction business, I&#39;m unable to explain the lack of massive tons of anything but dust, &#39;anchor bones&#39; and a few possible &#39;ribs&#39;. </p>

<p>At least two of those Steel and Concrete buildings blew out into the waters and down through the canyon walls of New York City in an volcanic / Pyroclastic / explosive force. </p>

<p>In my opinion.</p>

<p>Can I prove it? No.</p>

<p>Am I qualified as an engineer, scientist, chemist? No.</p>

<p>Am I justified to question? Yes.</p>

<p>Am I ok to probe further, harder, deeper...</p>

<p>Evidently not.</p>

<p>The 9/11 footage, available, right now is enough.</p>

<p>You provide me one determined man, woman or beast of legal ease and I&#39;ll die like the slave whore I was born into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The intent of the person is always at the center of what they project. A person can make any statement but their intention, which can be hidden, determines what their goal is. </p>

<p>If one is open to the truth and seeks it than cooperation is natural. </p>

<p>If someone is a dick and does not show signs of cooperation as well as not <em>being willing to understand your point of view</em>, then they are not trying to come to conclusions. This is not to be confused with someone who disagrees with you and provides the <em>logical framework as to why they disagree</em>. By providing your reasons, you allow the other person to partake in discussion, weeding out any misunderstandings that may have taken place or provide an opportunity to prove their point further now knowing where you stand on the subject.</p>

<p>Understanding always takes both parties willing to <em>acknowledge</em> the others point of view in order to foster productivity, whether they agree or not.</p>

<p>It is clear if you view certain people&#39;s accounts on this site that they only insight fear mongering, hatred, disorder and arguments. Attacking people&#39;s character and ability to discern reality through their text imply deceit on the end of the person they are talking to.</p>

<p>These people may either be paid money to do this or full of anger, resentment, or simply misguided. </p>

<p>Whatever the reason, which is hard to determine since intent can and is hidden, they will always exhibit the same non-cooperative behavior. </p>

<p>This behavior of non-cooperation (Big boys are able to have conflicting ideas with others and be completely secure with who they are whilst disagreeing and being cooperative) is something which should be addressed whenever it can be. </p>

<p>Lastly, acknowledging that there are different intelligence levels is something I don&#39;t see taken into consideration by people who consider themselves to be &quot;smart&quot;. </p>

<p>A &quot;smart&quot; person shows patience for those whom language and conceptual critical thinking have been dulled. Reasons that range from countless environmental variables. There are many forces at work in our existence which are not due to the individual. Thus making a person feel responsible for their poor education is not only insulting but heavily demoralizing and embarrassing. We know that by not knowing something someone can still be effected by it. </p>

<p>Showing patience and understanding to someone who &quot;knows something is wrong with 9/11&quot; but is unable to express it properly or contextualize it does not make that person wrong or stupid nor does it refute the very real pain and unease that person experiences.</p>

<p>I see many &quot;shill&quot; or agenda driven people attack those individuals and proceed to brow beat them into submission. They are at a natural disadvantage because of their language being damaged. </p>

<p>No matter how well you speak, a bully is a bully and it should be obvious by now.</p>
