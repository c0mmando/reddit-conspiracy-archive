<p>An unjust law is no law at all. </p>

<p>Someone needs to fill this one in on how civil disobedience works. :) And also on the &quot;legality&quot; of income tax in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not you? :)</p>

<p>The short version is that there&#39;s no evidence of a law on the books that you must file and pay income tax. Because of this, you ALWAYS didn&#39;t owe taxes last year. You have the choice to protest this unjust action every year. Of your own recognizance (based on the illusion of fear created by the State) you CHOOSE to pay.</p>

<p>Remember this lesson in your dealings with our government. The game is to get you to agree to your enslavement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. You handled the tax bit well there. TY.</p>

<p>Civil disobedience is when you refuse to abide by an illegal or otherwise plainly unjust law. </p>

<p>The PTB will get mad an throw you in jail. But you get to go to court and make a huge debacle of the issue, hopefully making life easier for everyone who comes after because of the precedent you set with your court case.</p>

<p>Or if a bunch of people do it at once, it gets called a revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i spent months trying to understand it...before I said &quot;fuck it&quot; and bought some to try it out.</p>

<p>Basically through a bunch of p2p/distributed (think bittorrent) data and encryption, you can send &quot;money&quot; from one address to another. The client itself is no different than sending an email from one Bitcoin address to another. All transactions are distributed in the cloud in a public ledger called the &quot;blockchain&quot;. They are psuedo anonymous, but anonymity can be obtained by various methods.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s p2p, there is no central authority or server the government can shut down.</p>

<p>Bitcoins are generated by &quot;miners&quot; that basically solve these complex math problems at a regulated rate and discover new Bitcoins. The rate is controlled automatically resulting in a deflationary currency. They also get the transaction fee (about 5 cents no matter how much you send)...which gives the incentive to keep the blockchain going.</p>

<p>I have the knowledge of probably a 6 or 7 year old, so I might have missed some points.</p>

<p>If you want to try it out, use coinbase.com (the PayPal of Bitcoin), connect your bank account, fund it, and buy some coins (i recommend you disconnect your bank from coinbase after that). Then move it to your personal wallet on your computer (and backup your private key). I recommend the MultiBit client. Or you can go with coinbase&#39;s online wallet...but remember, there is nobody backing your shit up if its lost or stolen (no FDIC)...so you take your own risk using online wallets.</p>

<p>blockchain.info is another good online wallet that is well trusted. I keep about $20 here because they have an iPhone app.</p>

<p>There are exchanges like MtGox where you can trade BTC for other fiat currencies, like USD. These determine the exchange rate. It was at $127/BTC last I checked. You can also buy BTC here, but its more difficult to fund than Coinbase.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions let me know. Its quite liberating when you do transactions. I use them mostly for micro payments and tipping people online.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a merchant you can easily accept Bitcoin with BitPay -- they convert your Bitcoin to USD right away, so you don&#39;t have to ride the Bitcoin wave of price fluxuations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Negatron, blue leader. I have full control over my electronic wallet - especially the one I keep on an un-networked computer. And for everything else, there&#39;s encryption to protect the private keys. Yes, you can claim that one could get malware to record my unlock key - but I can move the goal post too by introducing a man with a gun who indicates you should hand over your wallet - or else.</p>

<p>In each of those cases, your money is gone with nobody to help you.</p>

<p>Fact of the matter is, bitcoins can be kept far more secure than physical wealth due to encryption, redundancy, and steganography.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the blockchain to be the bank&#39;s accounting ledger that tells you how much is in the accounts.</p>

<p>The private keys you store on your offline computer are like special pen you sign your checks with. Special in that the bank can verify with mathematical certainty it was you that signed the check and not forged by someone else.</p>

<p>The blockchain is a cryptographically and computationally secure record of transactions. Each transaction is a digitally signed check that gets recorded in that ledger. You can&#39;t sign a check without the private keys. If those keys are offline, then they are not susceptible to malware theft. If they are encrypted, they are not susceptible to any kind of theft. If they are duplicated and stored in multiple locations, they are not susceptible to destruction.</p>

<p>Basically, you create a transaction from a &quot;seedless&quot; wallet. This is a wallet that only has your bitcoin addresses so you know your balances. Then you transfer the unsigned &quot;check&quot; to the offline computer via QR codes and a web cam. On the offline computer, you sign the &quot;check&quot; with the private keys, and send the signed check back over the QRcode/webcam to the online computer that then broadcasts it to the network for integrity/validity checking and inclusion in the blockchain. Obviously, it is not yet trivial to sign transactions from an offline computer, but it will be in the near future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>False and the key is not superfluous. The keys come in pairs. One is a public key, the other is a private key. They are mathematically related so that if you use the private key to sign a message, the public key can be used to verify the signature that wraps the message. If the message is tampered with, the signature becomes invalid and trivially detectable. Basically, digital signatures are not forgeable and it is the foundation for what makes https/secure web browsing possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are lots of reasons to use bitcoin but it&#39;s not meant to be a replacement for anything. It has certain properties that makes it more beneficial in some cases, less beneficial in others.</p>

<h1>1, if you&#39;re a merchant, you&#39;ll love bitcoin because it is a payment system that is just as irreversible as cash.</h1>

<h1>2, if you&#39;re a merchant, it&#39;s cheaper because there are no fees to receive money - which result in lower operating costs, which can be shared with your customers through lower prices.</h1>

<h1>3, it eliminates identity theft because the spender never reveals his secret information to move money (unlike giving a merchant all your credit card and identity details so they can withdraw by your request). This also results in lower operating costs because you dont&#39; have to do PCI compliance.</h1>

<h1>4 bitcoin is far more secure because storage of your private keys is decentralized - there is no single place to attack (like a web server that stored your credit card and identity data).</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>Using Coinbase.com, its pretty much the same way you fund your paypal account. You link your bank account and indicate you want X number bitcoins. They will do an ACH transfer out of your bank to them, and give you bitcoins at the current exchange rate. The current exchange rate is about $120 USD per bitcoin. It may sound like a lot, but two things: you&#39;re getting $120 value in bitcoins; and two, bitcoin is a denomination like a dollar. And like a dollar has pennies, so does bitcoin. those &quot;pennies&quot; are called satoshi. there are 100 million satoshi per bitcoin. so one USD is literally buying you about 1,000,000 bitcoin &quot;pennies&quot; (satoshi). In that context, they are ridiculously cheap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My position on this is influenced by where I live (the bay area). One person owns a huge amount of the land in berkeley (second only to the university). There are lots of homeless people and gentrification is a serious problem. </p>

<p>To top it off, land ownership only came into being here through genocide, slavery, and theft. Land theft from the tribes is a problem throughout the united states, but it is particularly acute here as no treaty was ever signed and the land was &quot;cleared&quot; to be owned through a form of slavery (the encomienda system).</p>

<p>More generally, paying rent is a form of tribute (to lords!) When did we decide that you have to pay someone to live somewhere? How does this make sense when there are more empty homes than homeless people in this country?</p>

<p>The problem goes deeper - from the bank-police collaboration keeping people out of evicted homes to all the land that&#39;s being used for golf courses to the large amount of wasted space in houses that could be supporting more people than they are currently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.</p>

<p>When I tell people about this I always have to harp on the fact that I&#39;m down with State Taxes, just not Federal Income Taxes. I find myself repeating it a minimum of three times just to be absolutely sure the person can&#39;t possibly misunderstand.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve been thinking about the tax thing: The Federal Income Taxes are spent on IRS, [???] and payment of the National Debt in that order (this is according to the Grace Commission). If you think about it in those terms I think that the Federal Government programs &quot;being paid for by [us]&quot; is all accounting trickery. I think they&#39;re just sending out funds with zero regard for taxes. I think they&#39;re simply claimed by the Treasury with backing by [God knows who].</p>

<p>Think of it in these terms:</p>

<p>They know it&#39;s all a shell game.</p>

<p>Why bother with the shell game on their level?</p>

<p>I should look into it more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d think the Commander in Chief would learn a lesson from recent history. This is a quote from OBL in 2004.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If so, then let him explain to us why we don&#39;t strike for example - Sweden? And we know that freedom-haters don&#39;t possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 - may Allah have mercy on them.</p>

<p>No, we fight because we are free men who don&#39;t sleep under oppression. We want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our nation. So shall we lay waste to yours. </p>

<p>This attack would be worse for our nation&#39;s safety than leaving them alone to gas themselves. </p>

<p>He wants &quot;limited intervention&quot;. What does that mean? Will he kill only people in the Syrian government? Only Assad? What about a trial? Do we even know who authorized the gas attacks? It might not have been Assad himself.</p>

<p>&quot;No boots on the ground.&quot; I assume that means bombs and drones destroying Syrian indiscriminately.</p>

<p>Even if it was just the Syrian government using the chemical weapons, we have no obligation to intervene, and America and Israel are both guilty of using chemical weapons within the last ten years. Nothing is logical about this.</p>
