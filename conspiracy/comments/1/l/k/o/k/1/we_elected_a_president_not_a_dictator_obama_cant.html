        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let us forever commit to the flames the aforestated line of reasoning. The president does whatever he wants to do, up to and including pretending like he can&#39;t do whatever he wants to do so long as it is politically convenient for him to do so. If congress votes no on syria, the president has already said he will do whatever he wants to do, no matter what the American people or its representatives think, no matter what NATO and the UN think, no matter what the people of our closest allied nations think. And funds to pay for the president&#39;s adventure will evidently be magical produced, because last I checked we were broke.</p>

<p>So we are left with two conclusions - either we have a rogue president/dictator with no respect for the rule of law or the will of the people and he must be stopped at any cost, or the entire political theater is simply for show to deceive and manipulate the public and the president could in fact fulfill any promise he made to voters yet chooses not to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey you guyzzz...  I am really confused about you.  I have a question.</p>

<p>Did you read in the news that Obama has said he will only act against Syria if Congress authorizes that?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/world/middleeast/syria.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/world/middleeast/syria.html</a></p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t understand what you are accusing him of today.  Are you accusing him of only asking for a legal vote according to the Constitution on this one thing?  Because that might be sort of arguable, but what you wrote, when I read it, makes me think that you are saying something counterfactual about real-world events of the past 1-2 days.</p>
