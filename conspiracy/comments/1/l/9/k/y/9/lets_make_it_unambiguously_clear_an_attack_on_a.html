       There is no middle ground. The "coalition of the willing" in the Iraq war did not substitute the UN. The Iraq war was illegal, there is not "somewhat illegal", there is only legal and illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Syria gas attack, whether it was perpetrated by santa claus, the so called rebels or Assad must be dealt with under UN mandate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA is big, powerful, rich, but it has no legal authority to attack Syria at all. It wasn't attacked, the gas attack was horrible and immoral, but it wasn't a gas attack on the USA. There is simply zero justification for the USA, France or Britain to attack Syria based on an internal affair.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr; Any attack on Syria is illegal, it's a crime and the only reason the USA can do it is because they're stronger which is precisely why the rule of Law exists, so that the bigger guys can't abuse their power. If the USA attacks Syria without a UN mandate, it is repeating the crimes of the Iraq war. Simple as that, there is no middle ground. The UN was created to avoid exactly what happened in Iraq.

       There's a huge difference and if you don't know it you need to learn it because it WILL affect you personally. They aren't Christians. If you define "Jewish" as a religion they aren't Jews either. They are Luciferians and they are very serious about it.

       How many times do I have to say it? All this "Luciferian" crap is a holdover from the 80s Satanic Panic. It is black propaganda designed to shift a measure of focus away from the moral culpability of the Abrahamic religions. Anyone who holds power and is
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       a follower of a Left Hand Path gets smeared by the establishment sooner or later.

       This basically hits the nail on the head. When you hold all the cards (see U.S. Military) you get to do what you want and rationalize it after the fact. Doesn't make it right but it's the cold reality. The UN is a shell institution with no ability to enforce it's decisions, and the U.S. government doesn't take any foreign/institutional body seriously unless it has a credible threat of force behind it's statements.

       First I'd like to say I don't support any attacks on Syria, or any of the ongoing bullshit anywhere else in the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       But legal?  Since when did someone else get to decide whats legal for us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since when is "the law" what decides right and wrong?  Laws do not define morality.  I realize that the two have slowly become interchangeable in America, but that isn't how it should be, and it shouldn't be the basis for any moral arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why laws exist, I don't agree.  I think if we look back very far that we're more likely to find laws designed to keep the little people in line, rather than the ruling powers.  Laws exist to give the big guys "official" power; to make it seem "fair" that they dictate our actions.  In fact, I think there are plenty of laws that exist to give the big guys official excuses to abuse their power.

       Laws and resolutions have no power if there isn't anyone to enforce them.

       As far as the UN goes, its just more of the big guns doing what they want, what they've always done.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After WWII the UN was founded, precisely to avoid the use of big guns against small countries without its mandate. The 5 victors of WWII compose a council that must agree to military action anywhere.
       </p>

      <p>
       We (the big guns) decide that nobody can do anything unless we want them to...is exactly what happened before the UN just without the paperwork making it seem like the big guns are always the good guys.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's what Germany did before the UN existed.

      <p>
       Its what we do now, except we're the council so we say its OK.  Germany had big guns so it could do that.  It basically took all the other big guns in the world to stop them.  Now we have more (non-nuclear) big guns than basically the rest of the world combined.  It wouldn't go down the same way.

       I understand what you are saying, but I am not sure that it is true.  In fact, I believe that nothing that the UN says or does is binding.  The powers granted by the People to Congress and the Executive via the Constitution are not subject to UN authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       There might be an argument that whatever treaty the US ratified which granted us membership in the UN did it.  But I doubt that there is any provision that basically forbids military action without UN approval.

       You're correct, but you're not going to find any lawyers here in this reactionary hotbed.

       I agree that wars of aggression, outside of genocide conventions, violate international treaties and the Nuremberg principles (UN Charter, Section IV/13). The most important talking-point for this instance however is probably the Section 8 War Powers clause of the US Constitution, since it would unite the anti-war Left and Right.

       You are right that the UN is not a global authority, but the US government has signed multiple treaties together with other UN members in which they declare they will not start such wars without UN approval. Going to war means violating the terms of treaties they signed, hence it is illegal.

       The US uses the UN when it's convenient, like sighting how Saddam violated UN sanctions prompting invasion, and them declare them useless if they disagree.  The US simply acts like a spoiled child always thinking it should get its way.

       Actually it's not. Since 1973 the President only needs to inform Congress of his intention to attack 48 hours before doing so and must not extend the fighting over 60 days (except for a one time 30 day extension that can be taken without congress approval).

       You're right. A constitutional lawyer with an army of lawyers certainly doesn't know the law.  Which is why I rely on Reddit, for all my legal advice.  Specifically

       it's still not a declaration of war which i think farting_flowers was referring to.  regardless, since the US is part of the UN it is subject to international law making it illegal to strike.  i believe if the UN acknowledges (key word) that Syria did in fact use gas (WMD) on their own then i believe the UN is bound to action.  i'm rusty on international relations but i'm pretty sure that's how it works.  kind of like the same deal with Rwanda and the term "genocide".  no one wanted to call it that because no one wanted to get legally involved.

       sovereignty isn't relinquished just because of the UN or else no one would be part of it.  the US did ratify the UN charter though so in one way or another we agreed upon the terms of the UN.  the ICC on the other hand is something we never ratified and not subject to it.

       No "we the people" did not agree to be part of the UN and the govt doesn't have the ability to sign away anyone's rights, including right to sovereignty.  That would make the UN agreement unlawful and void in any American court.

       international law isn't applied to "we the people".  and we the people did ratify the UN charter.  so international law (treaties, air space, etc) does apply to the united states government. we also don't handle international law in american courts.

       That is seriously just not true. The UN created R2P which stands for right to protect after the whole Rwanda fuck up. R2P was the justification used by the UN to allow foreign intervention in Afghanistan. The reason the Iraq war was illegal was because it wasn't deemed to be considered an R2P case. Syria however, might be able to be considered a R2P case if it turns out that illegal chemicals were used agains civilians. I'm not saying I agree with this law or anything but OP is straight up wrong about the illegalities surrounding this issue. The main problem is that OP is trying to argue based on morality but confusing it with legality. Two very very different ways of looking at an issue.

       It has legal mandate to tell the U.S. where it can't go, much as it has legal mandate to tell Serbia to fuck off away from Kosovo. It just has no muscle beyond collective goodwill to enforce that or any other mandate.

       The UN has a 100% Legal Mandate to preserve peace, and will intervene against the US if required, this they seem so intend on making a bad situation worse tell me how well did it go for you the last two times you decided to Ignore a UN Mandate.

       I'm just curious when people's human rights are being violated by their own regime. or any other regime. is it wrong for the US to help them out in a time of need? Just like when the Jews were being brought to concentration camps was it wrong for us to intercede? I'm just trying to get a better grasp on the situation.

       I figured out what the attack on Syria is about, in part at least. This attack is designed to show that the US can attack Syria without significant reprisals from Syria or Russia or Iran. It's a test attack. If the US gets away with it, the door will be opened to more attacks of greater severity in the future.

       No, I'm sorry but that's not it. The West already knows it can do whatever it wants, and Russia is on our team; their resistance is cointelpro. Because Russia's central bank is owned by the same banking cartel that owns basically every nation's sovereignty, they cannot be expected to resist as promised, and their words are simply there to muddy the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that Syria has a non-privately owned central bank, placing its currency out of international banking cartel hands (for the moment). Because it's through control of national money supplies that the global elite control everyone, this places them at odds with global fascism and they therefore must be eliminated at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a cover story about an oil pipeline to Israel from Iraq, but energy control is just icing on the cake; it's all about the banks, as always.

       I respectfully beg to differ. Russia and China are the main allies
in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation which is their main
set of treaties which is a foundation to that defense block of permanent member nations. Study the SCO and you'll find that they designed
it not just as a trade block but a defense block. Any attack on signators within the SCO is an attack on all of them(permanent or not). 
I'm not negating the point you made concerning the financial/banking side of this issue but
Russian interests and U.S. interests are not in line in the Syrian proxy war 
with Iran.

       NP :-) Russia and China have more autonomy and power than many realize. Just because they don't meddle as much as the U.S. but yet the 
noose is getting tighter and Syria (then Iran) is one step in the take over 
plan and the SCO countries are no set of fools. They will be forced
into this corner and will eventually hit back.... Hard! sigh :-(

       This is a nice notion, and it is the way the world should work (maybe, I can see some situations wherein the UN should approve but they would not.)
      </p>
      <p>
       However, reality is that laws are completely meaningless unless you have a way to enforce them.  Enforce them, with force i.e. a military or police force.  The UN does not have this, so any laws they write carry about as much weight as a law that I write myself, and then declare that everyone should listen to me cause I said so.

       You base this upon a presumption that the US can beat a joint China/Russia force, or worse if the EU decides to throw in it's lot with the UN instead of NATO (On that note, i'm predicting the withdrawl of European countries from NATO in the next 30 years and the formation of a similar organisation which only covers the EU)

       They have legal force, but how do they transfer that into actual force? Do the other members of the security council invade the US, take it's leaders and put them on trial?
      </p>
      <p>
       Effectively the US doesn't have any reason whatsoever to care about what the UN says... I think this is the point he was trying to make.

       Not trolling. firstly.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The US Constitution doesn't say anything about the Euros, banks, whatever.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Constitution also doesnt mention cars, nuclear power plants or Jupiter. If were going to start listing the things the Constitution doent mention by name, we can be here all day. What the Constitution DOES say in article 6 is "anything in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding" (in relation to foreign treaties).
      </p>
      <p>
       im not saying treaties have no legal weight. An international treaty not to use a certain weapon during war, or for some sort of trade application? sure go ahead. But what i amm saying is the UN does NOT dictate what we do, especially when its in violation of our Constitution. The fact the UN charter had terms that went explicitly against this, our relation with the UN is entirely or partially unconstituional depending on how you want to look at it. And looking to the UN for approval for war is indeed unconstiuional
      </p>
      <p>
       Heres an extreme example, The UN has a treaty banning personal use of 50 caliber bullets in guns, and then the US signs this treaty and agrees to comply with the UN ban on 50 caliber bullets.Though the treaty is now "law" and has been signed, it violates our 2nd amendment right protected by Constitution, and is therefore null and void within our borders.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       My point is, we should not look towards the UN for the go-ahead or green light, or even their approval (though it would be nice to know other nations agree with our stance). this is a sovereign nation and its people dictate what it does, not some foreign treaty.

       The US et al. will probably argue that the use of chemical weapons invokes the right of humanitarian intervention and/or the responsibility to protect, two developing principles of international law that potentially permit the use of force without UNSC authorisiation.

       The US blasted into Iraq without UN approval, and before all the intelligence had been compiled (ie bullshit intel).  Another history making move that one was too.  The reason the US seems hell bent on doing it again, is because they were never made to face the war crimes from that, so why not?

       But the United States Is looked upon as the world police, everyone expects us to intervene, after all we were hailed as international heroes for the Iraq war. Military intervention in Syria promises to be short and linear, with a clear cut prospect for whose to mount the throne should the rebels overturn the Shia Assad.

       It doesn't make sense to not kill a killer because other killers might spring up to avenge the original killer. What else you supposed to do? Send the killer to counseling for 10 years and hope he doesn't do it again? Fuck that.

       Anti-Americanism today pisses me of the fuck off. People think the United States consists of a bunch of arrogant pricks, but how do they decide this? If we say anything patriotic, we're arrogant. If any citizen of any other country says something patriotic, it's totally fine, because the Americans are
       <em>
        obviously
       </em>
       just blind nationalists. The world is a massive circlejerk where popular opinion is in charge.

       I truly wish the US would pull all foreign aid out of the region and weapon supply's to Egypt and all other countries that are currently in a revolt to let them sort it on their own terms.  Why they stick their nose in places no one wants it. Yes its terrible what they are doing to the people but we are not team america to run around trying to solve everyone's problems.

       This is all about power and control of MIC and Saudi control of OPEC to counter Russian and Chinese oil ventures to control oil in the Middle east. Let's face it here. Assad is not dumb. He is not some poorly educated despot. He had a university education and was a certified Eye doctor. This man had nothing to gain by gassing his citizens. Especially with the rebel factions split among themselves. It's classic strategy to divide and conquer, and now he gasses to unify them, and bring in outside military help? Oh Please! Obama is a a whore at the helm of the Big oil and MIC.

       The UN and NATO are unanimous in their condemnation of chemical attacks from a dictatorship on its own people. Allowing such actions to stand not only sends the message that such actions can and will be ignored, but also deteriorates the potential for future political discussion with Syria. Taking action would actually encourage political talks by showing that these types of inhumane attacks will not go unpunished and could lead to the Assad regime looking to cooperate with the UN.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UN will find numerous legal rationales for taking action. Undoubtedly.

       What are the requisites to intervene in a country (lets say Syria) that is committing what amounts to war crimes against its own citizens and foreign fighters on its own soil, then? 
And what if war crimes are being committed by people fighting the Syrian government? 
As an as of yet uninvolved foreign country, do you stand by and watch innocent citizens get slaughtered by both factions?

       Under which jurisdiction the Iraq war was illegal? People say the US is a sovereign nation. Would that mean it's not subject to the laws of any higher political entity? Or what? Just trying to understand who has standing to say the US broke the law. And what laws did the US break?

      <p>
       WRONG. The UN is NOT part of this country and does NOT dictate what the people of this nation do. Iraq wasnt illegal because the UN shook their finger at us, it was illegal because it was not declared.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is CONGRESS that decides when this country goes to war, otherwise the war is illegal. Our constituion, if followed, can do more than any UN ever could. By declaring a war, the US will have a clear enemy and mission goal. We come in, we come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idea people are touting about looking for the UN for approval is joke. The UN has no authority or power. Theyre simply a voice of the international community. They have no leverage, or standing army to enforce their "decisions".

       I appreciate you trying to bring some awareness with your thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of this information is great  information, and I am willing to point out my ignorance on most of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my own understanding, congress doesn't have to decide to go to war anymore-  and overall isn't considered illegal without their approval when depending on the situation. Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't there an executive order made under Bush to establish an authorized power for the commander in chief to declare war?
      </p>
      <p>
       And just to fall back on your original post- it is very illegal, but that hasn't stopped us in the past. The US loves to esoterically initiate wars, which after doing, they have their controlled mainstream media reassure their citizens with lies to manipulate them into fostering the wars. Until the people learn from history, these illegal wars are going to continue to be inevitable. :/
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it sad enough to argue over a war being legal or not.

       Legal and constitutional are very different planes. The NSA spying was legal as well. Not sure what country you hail from, but in America, the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, not a foreign committees decision.

      <p>
       Why do people continue to confuse isolation with sovereignty? No, the congress is supposed to dictate what this country does in both notionally and internationally. they are supposed to be representation of the people that elected him/her and together they are the voice of the American people. Yes, congress may make treaties, but international laws do not trump our own, and any treaty signed that violates this simple fact is null and void. THATS in the constitution. the UN is simply the voice of other nations
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The law can dictate what you do. The US is breaking international law by going to another war without a UN mandate, attacking another country that hasn't attacked you.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What about our own domestic constituional laws? those are above any international law or treaty and we should be looking to those first. If were violating our own Constitution, we definitely are breaking international codes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, The UN can voice their opinions and concerns, Yes, the US can agree to international treaties. But to hold the belief the UN has some sort of authority and that we should look to them for approval is hilarious. Congress should always be first on the list

       Except is isn't, though. There's no law that prohibits what you're talking about.

       If you want to say it would be bad or that you wouldn't like it, go ahead. But saying it's illegal is simply false, and people who know that won't bother listening to you, because they know you don't know what you're talking about.

       If it's illegal, then you (or somebody else) should have no problem pointing to the law that says so.

       Which is not actually a law. It has no legal force and is supported by no lawful authority. So what else you got?

       Again, you're welcome to say you
       <em>

       it were illegal, or that you
       <em>

       there were a law that prohibited it. But there isn't, and saying that you think there is just makes people stop listening to you.

       No, I'm sorry but that's not it. The West already knows it can do whatever it wants, and Russia is on our team; their resistance is cointelpro. Because Russia's central bank is owned by the same banking cartel that owns basically every nation's sovereignty, they cannot be expected to resist as promised, and their words are simply there to muddy the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that Syria has a non-privately owned central bank, placing its currency out of international banking cartel hands (for the moment). Because it's through control of national money supplies that the global elite control everyone, this places them at odds with global fascism and they therefore must be eliminated at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a cover story about an oil pipeline to Israel from Iraq, but energy control is just icing on the cake; it's all about the banks, as always.

       This basically hits the nail on the head. When you hold all the cards (see U.S. Military) you get to do what you want and rationalize it after the fact. Doesn't make it right but it's the cold reality. The UN is a shell institution with no ability to enforce it's decisions, and the U.S. government doesn't take any foreign/institutional body seriously unless it has a credible threat of force behind it's statements.
