       No, you're missing my point. They're really driving points, like, "people are bullies or nefarious on the internet. Hackers are always waiting to fuck w innocent people and the almighty corporations/government. We do all this spying to protect you! Other countries do it too!"

       They're making the average citizen aware that all is monitored online, so the inevitable outcome is citizenry so aware of surveillance that they will be fearful of looking for information and sharing their opinions. Fuck, it's so blatant!

       Two or more grocery stores peddling the same goods should not mean they share the same opinion on them.

       You are mistaking news reporting for commentary.  The associated press never professed to an outlet for commentaries.  They merely report the news stories and thousands of associates pull from them.  News reporting was never intended to carry opinions... That is what commentary is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they, as a source, biased?  Very possibly.  That would be where the problem lies.  Not the fact that they represent a network for news distribution.

       That's why I believe that news reporters (networks/cable channels) should be held criminally accountable for their reporting.  If they print outright propaganda and lies, they should pay consequences for that.

       When the revolution hits, and we round up all the crooked regime supporters - corporate payrollers, wall street market manipulators, intentionally misleading news reporters - they should be made an example of.

       AP articles used to be read by local staff writers, who would expand their own research, but credit the AP. Since most small papers can't afford staff writers (let alone GOOD writers), the trend has become pay the AP and print the article verbatim.

       I troll no one, no where.  You obviously fail to understand trolling, as much as you fail to understand the AP wire.  You have no reserve in showing the community how fucking mindless you are...

       I did not disrupt any conversation.  Or steer the conversation in another disassociated direction with appalling shock and awe.  In fact, other level headed redditors and I engaged in meaningful conversation based on my proving your inane comment dead-stupid-wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I did was state fact and prove you blitheringly ignorant to the point where you just couldn't contain yourself and had to go for the "fuck you" like any poor sissified loser would.  Big man you are.

       You've directed the conversation to my stupidity, instead of the issue at hand. It WAS petty for me to say fuck you, but I suppose your arrogant attitude was baiting.

       Also, your Twinkie argument is invalid. Twinkies are a Hostess product, but were not uniform. They varied by local distribution, Southern twinkies were different from Northern twinkies, etc. They have now been conglomerated, like the AP...

       What's been bugging me lately is the high increase of EBS testing, both on TV and radio. They never play the "this is a test" speech, either. It's like scary beeping noise, then return to content without comment. It definitely affects my serenity!
