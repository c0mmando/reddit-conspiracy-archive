       Yes, from 1913. You didn't think they just thought of this last year did you ? The 20th Century was the most horrendous and murderous Century in world history. We are now finding out why.

       Genocide and mass violence have been around since the dawn of time, and the reasons behind it are FAR too complicated to pin solely on a brief philosophical movement that was dying even before the Nazis put the final nail in its coffin.

       True. But these folks were/are trying to pull this off in a somewhat more subtle fashion, so as not to alarm the public. Sort of like death by a thousand cuts. This way, assuming no one was the wiser, they wouldn't be blamed for the outcome and yet would reap the reward, in their eyes.

       The details of the mechanism of the scheme are complicated, yes. But the reasons for it are quite simple, and I should think, obvious.

       YOU TRULY believe that the Holocaust was ALL about one crazy german man hating jews so he was able to swiftly carry out this plot? No. There were many minds behind this, much money behind it, and much science behind it all. Hitler was mostly a tool, like Obama is a tool. Hitler was a smarter man than Obama, that's for sure. If you listen to his speeches, a lot of what he said makes a lot of sense too.

       The psychology behind the Holocaust is interesting and nothing's for sure, but it largely resulted from the combination of nationalism, xenophobia, and racism that are biologically ingrained in the most primal part of human nature. Germany was practically boiling over already (in no small part due to WWI), and Hitler's cult of personality turned the whole mess into a perfect storm.
      </p>

       At its core, Nazi Germany was a deadly cocktail of pride and power. Evil, yes. Sinister and calculated, hardly.

       Efficient? It was a clusterf**k. The Nazis squandered an enormous amount of forced labor with their "extermination through labor" (working prisoners to death) policy, they haphazardly shifted strategies every couple months, and they managed to incite robust and debilitating resistance movements in every country they occupied.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying the Jews secretly planned the torture and near-annihilation of their entire race? They orchestrated the oppressive anti-Judaism laws that made life hell for them in Germany even in the entire decade before the Holocaust? I'd like to see some citations of credible historical evidence for that, please. Because it doesn't make any sense.
      </p>

       It's a fairly small ethnic group, has been for centuries, and yet for centuries they've been the whipping boys for the entire world around them. It's f**king heartbreaking, and I'm not even Jewish.

       Have you even heard of operation paperclip? If you haven't we can't even have a logical discussion about the holocaust because you're clearly missing out on so many facts.

      <p>
       And more about how far back it goes.. Yes the Holocaust didn't start in the 1900's. Like I mentioned about your 1913 comment, it goes way further back.

       You make it sound like I'm happy tons of innocent people died. Are you crazy? I'm merely trying to show you history repeats itself. Things like conspiracies behind 9/11 would be clear as day if we stopped looking at history the way it was shoved down our throats by our teachers.

       The IBM article is mindblowingly irrelevant. It addresses precisely zero of the points I brought up. From a business ethics standpoint it's certainly questionable, but even Black never quite concludes that it was much more than a company cashing in on a lucrative sales contract with a dubious customer, and history is littered with incidents like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have indeed heard of Operation Paperclip. I actually wrote a paper in undergrad on the general topic of the heated US-USSR competition to acquire Germany's top scientists. I don't see how it's relevant to the freaking Holocaust, other than that we white-washed the occasional war crime in pursuit of post-war scientific prowess.
      </p>

       That last article is boilerplate Holocaust denial nonsense that has been debunked a billion times over, and it's not worth my time.

       How is the IBM article irrelevant when it clearly addresses your presumptions about the so called lack of efficiency of the Holocaust?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thomas Watson not only wanted to cash in, he wanted to make sure the Reich succeeded with his expertise. HE MADE IT AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE to process the Jewish people! The hollerith machines would NOT WORK without American involvement!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you read the article, which you won't because right now, speaking of HOLOCAUST DENIAL,  you're in your own denial phase. You'd see that it's not about holocaust denial, just denial of the official story.  The article cites numerous reports and has a lot of credible information, which makes your rejecting to read it force your credibility to become questionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust was also so important in the development of the independent Israel state.
      </p>
      <p>
       IBM was also big in the South American Apartheid, so you can see examples of the same type of efficiency.

       Annnnnddddd that's my cue to bow out. There is a subtle but critical difference between an "official story" (whose official story?) and the consensus opinion of essentially every credible historian in the field.

       The official story meaning the story we are taught in the history books like I've said earlier.. But yeah feel free to run away from learning some more.

       The official story never states any American involvement in anything except the efforts to end what was happening. End it after all the profits.

       ...to start with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionists were VERY complicit in acting with the Nazis in the "destruction of their own race."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionists found common cause with Hitler, Eichmann, and the Nazis and used anti-Semitism and Nazism as a means of achieving their end which was the establishment of a Jewish state.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fucking twisted as hell, but documented in history. Many Jews profited immensely from the "holocaust" and continue to profit to this very day.

       This is a more sensible explanation. The victims of the Holocaust were victimized by their own leaders, and, as you point out, used Hitler as a tool. Whic makes the Holocaust that much

       True. I would recommend that were anyone interested in further research on this "idea", to listen to "Alan Watt" (not to be confused with "Alan Watts", a totally different person), a Canadian researcher who has studied this "idea" for decades, in great detail.

       People underestimate the past, but the past is what has led us to our current state in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things don't develop overnight, or even in the course of 5-10 years, it takes tens of hundreds of years for a idea to become full bloom. The NSA didn't happen over night. Hell, even the federal reserve to get to its current state is this year, 100 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how things go over the heads of the youth, and students, and university kids. They don't need to be taught these policies and institutions that were developed years and years ago. But today they've transformed our modern world.

       My only point is that the assumption that no one can make a decades-long plan and stick to it is silly. These kinds of plans are rather common. Native America tribes thought you should think seven generations out. That's some foresight right there.

       1913 to 2013 is an eternity when it comes to rapidly-evolving sociology and scientific advances. Eugenics may have seemed logical in 1913, but we've made an enormous amount of scientific progress since then. It's hardly even comparable.

noun
1.
the science of improving a human population by controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics. Developed largely by Francis Galton as a method of improving the human race, it fell into disfavor only after the perversion of its doctrines by the Nazis.

       Russian troops being deployed on US soil, being seen in TN, Calif., Florida, to name a few. There are here under the guise to "help" and "assist" at " large scale events", "natural disasters". An ex-marine is stating there are here to do the job that our US military may not want to do: unarm and kill US citizens. He goes on to say they disarmed people in Katrina, kicked and busted down doors at the precise time of yelling "open up, US military" He said it was  like a free-for-all. He stated that during the day they looked for dead bodies, and during the night they conducted raids, " in the dark of the night" to solely disarm citizens.. Alot of videos and pictures that I have seen have since been removed... "video is no longer available". I fear that all this is true, that our government has colluded with foreign military, and they are now in training with the US military. Isnt this an act of treason? This is what keeps me up at night. Here is one alarming video that is out there, there are many, along with detailed military directives. Some scary shit:

       Are they preparing for the complete collapse of our financial structure, a natural disaster, or are we now so far up the asses of China there is nothing else to be done? The US is refusing to allow Germany inspection of their OWN gold ( they allowed finally for Germany to "see" 1 vault out of 9, the US deficit (China owns us) and the recent Nasdaq snafu (which I still dont buy because of other recent outtages). There you have it. I cant even sleep anymore.

       "They" are the same one's who gave us the Federal Reserve Bank System, The Federal Income Tax, The dumbed down School System and other such criminal schemes. They include, but are not limited to, JP Morgan, The Rothschild family and The Rockefeller family. These were/are the owners of the world, in the literal sense.

       Notice I used the phrase "but are not limited to". I did this for a reason. To list them all would be a considerable research undertaking that I did not have the time for at present.

       True. I would recommend that were anyone interested in further research on this "idea", to listen to "Alan Watt" (not to be confused with "Alan Watts", a totally different person), a Canadian researcher who has studied this "idea" for decades, in great detail.

       My only point is that the assumption that no one can make a decades-long plan and stick to it is silly. These kinds of plans are rather common. Native America tribes thought you should think seven generations out. That's some foresight right there.
