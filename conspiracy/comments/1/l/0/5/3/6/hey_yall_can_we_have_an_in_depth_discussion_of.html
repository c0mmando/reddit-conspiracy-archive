       I've been really intrigued lately by the variety of shill accounts. How to sort them out, how many exist, who are the major/minor funding agents?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Reddit has the potential to be a truly democratic news and information source. And thus be of true value to the people. So, r/conspiracy, please weigh in...because as far as I can tell, and quite ironically, this subreddit is often the best source for news and user comments.   Thanks!

       The trouble is most 'serious' posters on this subreddit label anyone who disagrees with them as shills.

      <p>
       Anyone who is skeptical of the extraordinary claims made, or anyone defending Jews, are automatically called out for being shills or similar.

       When I was new here, and was offended or sarcastic about discussions on Jews (which, honestly, you guys should say Zionists), Reptilians, Aliens, Satan etc, I was so bombarded with the
       <em>
        shill
       </em>
       accusation that I deleted my whole account.

       And you have to wonder what motive is behind that whether it's real racism or something else. Nobody is going to claim anti-semitism doesn't exist but what also exists are people using fake accounts, or indeed their own account utilising anti-semitism to smear the sub or the ideas here. When you get attacked, you're doing something right.

       Even though Zionism does not necessarily mean Jew in and of itself, Zionism
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       indeed actually
       <em>
        come
       </em>
       from Judaism.  Zionism is a militant, racist form of Judaic ideology that sprang from and
       <em>
        originated
       </em>
       from a particular Judaic interpretation, and the biggest most overwhelming percentage of Zionists actually
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       in fact Jews - "elite" Jews that can be as prejudiced to "non-elite" Jews as they can to "gentiles", but they are Jews none the less.  Those Zionists that are not Jewish are the exception - not the rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       Jews are Zionists, of course, but to not understand and acknowledge the direct connection between the two ideologies is not being very intelligent.

       Well, that is a problem for sure. The other problem being actual shills. As I mentioned in another comment, many (or maybe most) shill accounts aren't even used to comment, simply used to propagate beneficial comments and hide detrimental one through up and down voting. Thereby altering the perceived popular consensus.

       Because this is a very small internet forum that doesn't actually have any influence on the outside world?

      <p>
       If you guys were some sort of revolutionary force then maybe "shills" would seek you out and try to destroy your movement. But you're not. You're really not, believing anything else is delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the few issues this subreddit actually agrees on, you still do not do anything about but debate ad nauseum on about on an online forum.

       And no, don't reply to this with some "sounds a lot like something a shill would say..." comment, if you're trying to be funny it's not working, if you actually mean it then go get your head checked.

       Very possible, I could be underestimating the bored teenage element. But to me, those who act as obvious provocateurs are very unlikely to be shills. In my understanding of effective shilling a shill might say something more subtle...for example....if someone brings up government involvement during 9/11 in a large subreddit, they wouldn't act like a ass. They would simply say something like "oh boy, another tin foil hat wearer". The attempt being to discredit while at the same time completely side stepping the discussion. Then again, multiple accounts would be employed to upvote the tin foil hat statement and downvote the 9/11 comment thus giving a false popular opinion.

       I would have to disagree. Go look at
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       . Trolling and getting conspiracy advocates to say some stupid shit is literally their favorite past time. Take some time to talk with these guys (not over there, but when they come in here). I make an effort to always spark up conversations with them. Many are just misinformed, but others literally get off on trying to make us look stupid. Im not saying shills dont exist. They definitely do. And im not saying for certain that some of these guys arent shills. But to definitively say they are or arent is an unsupported conclusion. And i think its fairly evident, when you look at their post history and talk to them, that most are not shills. We can speculate all we want, but claiming someone is a definitively a shill, (which you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       doing when you say call them one, whether you realize it or not) especially when people havent even attempted to spark a inquiring conversation with them, is not valid.

       Until a year ago, I considered the use of "shill" to simply be a small-minded way to attack or dismiss someone that disagrees with you (usually used by the least rational of paranoids).  But it does appear that the government and corporations do pay people to enhance their social media image.  So they must exist to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, it seem hard to prove that someone is.  My own views, which lean to evidence over emotion and science over fear, would get me labelled as a shill (or troll) by many.

        Abstract
       </p>
       <p>
        One common trick to cheat people to believe fake products or a high-return low-risk investment scheme in the online discussion groups is to make use of sockpuppets (i.e., use different fake identities pretending to be different persons to praise or create the illusion of support for the product). A fundamental problem is how to identify these sockpuppets. In this paper, we propose two approaches to identify these puppet pairs that occur in the same forum as well as
cross forum.
        <strong>
         The evaluation based on millions of real posts in two popular discussion forums in Hong Kong shows that the methods are effective.

      <p>
       I pulled that from a series of whitepapers I read a few years back. I wont link them because I ran into a few questionable, possibly malicious, links associated with the forums used in the algo tests.
       <strong>
        Vigilance and diligence are synonymous.

       The article says that the US is planning to spread truthful information in languages other than English, such as Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Pashto, and on non-US-based social media sites. But that doesn't rule out the possibility of a secret spy program that does target U.S. citizens, even though it is "unlawful."

       I'm not too worried about them, a few years ago us 'conspiracy theorists' were a tiny minority and we would be called tinfoil paranoids by pretty much everyone. Now as people are starting to wake up (starting), the elites have to pay people to do it.

       Shills do certainly exist. Whether they are posting on reddit, there is some evidence but there is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming majority of people called shills in this sub are not shills. If before calling someone a shill you actually looked at their post history it would be pretty apparent that they are in fact trolls who get off on making us blow up on them–they look at us like religious zealots who believe things without evidence and are devoid of skepticism (and in many cases they arent wrong), so they like to see what stupid things they can get us to say and usually they get a few to fall for it. Other times, they are well meaning misinformed people. I have never, in the dozens of alleged shills whose post history ive looked through or whom ive conversed with, ever seen any conclusive proof that these people are in fact paid to do what they are doing. Thus calling someone a shill, unless you have their bank statement is not only an unfounded conclusion but it further perpetuates the belief that this community is incapable of critical thinking and that we have nothing worth saying. Next time you want to call someone a shill, ask yourself why are you really calling them a shill and is it really worth it? The only thing it does is inflate your ego and convince you that you are right and they are wrong. Nothing else. Its not going to convince them that they are wrong. Its not going to bring credibility to this community. Its not going to bring new people to this community. Its not going to do anything good. All is does is make
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       feel good. If thats all you want, then fine, but just know that youre only further digging this movement into hopelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats my take anyway.

      <p>
       If anyone would like to contest this opinion id be happy to reconsider my position.

       Don't pay any mind.  We outnumber and easily spot and call them out. This is not an echo chamber, however look to the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Are they a brand new account?  If so, here very suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Do they always strictly post in favor of one subject?  A history of just that subject (ex. adamwho for Monsanto)
      </p>
      <p>
       -Do they show up when keywords are mentioned?  GMO/Monsanto, 9/11, WTC, Israel/Mossad, etc.  If so, they are likely paid shills.

       What have I done to arouse suspicion? Well-sourced rebuttals that don't go along with the circlejerk/hivemind. Skepticism is encouraged here, unless it's skepticism of conspiracy theories.

       Excellent use of statistics. Coincidentally, people have a 0% success rate in labeling me a Birch tree. Ok, just teasing. So far it seems like the term shill has been used as a dismissive tool during disagreements. Do you folks who have been called shills believe there are shills on reddit, and if so, what are they up to?

       Sure theres shills.  But they're not here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       most of the time.  This is a sub for people so set in their beliefs that no amount of "proof" could ever persuade them because for most, the
       <strong>
        conspiracy
       </strong>
       is so deep that anything coming from the establishment...hell,
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       establishment, is just more shilling.  There isn't a single person past/present/future working for the government that could ever convince a diehard
       <a href="/r/conspirator">
        /r/conspirator
       </a>
       that, say, 9/11 wasn't a false flag.  The
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       acceptable opinions about the establishment are those claiming that things are not what they seem.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in the days following major events...I don't think its unreasonable to believe that there are some shills floating around when
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has an influx of new or irregular readers.

       I agree these shill accounts must focus on larger based subreddits with more "neutral audiences". But the more I think about it, someone with a little interest...or funding...and some basic computer skills could effectively fully disrupt a small sub...so it may be "worth it". And in some ways easier to control a strong fringe than work to slowly coerce a large neutral group.

       I think there probably are shills. But they're not the ones getting into debates on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . And they're not as numerous as they're made out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that shilling doesn't have to be political or conspiratorial in nature. Company PR and guerilla advertising are probably the most common if I had to guess.

       Company PR is certainly huge, but I would argue that business is political. Especially big business. Monsanto would be a prime example of political and economic crossover. Moreover, advertising in all its forms, has in my view, overrun our mental lives. Small example, how many world leaders can people name vs. how many companies.

       I was referring to the part about my ego and being picked on. Which you're 100% wrong about.

      <p>
       Anyway, if there's a reason people don't like me, it's not because I insult them or break the rules here. It's because I don't go along with easily debunkable conspiracies.

       I try to combat misinformation wherever I find it. I do also enjoy having discussions online about religion, politics, conspiracies, science, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm active in
       <a href="/r/debatereligion">
        /r/debatereligion
       </a>
       , but I can't exactly correct different opinions, although it's interesting learning about other viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , there are posts that are downright unfactual. This is where correcting misinformation and discussion intersect for me.

       I'm not saying the only facts are the ones part of the "official story," but facts are facts. Unless you're trying to redefine the word.

      <p>
       If a conspiracy theory actually has solid evidence, then it would be factual. But just on the basis of it
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being the official story does not make it factual like some people here believe.

       The problem I see with this is 1. it could easily manipulated and abused. 2. part of the way large shill operations work is with multiple alias users which could target comments or individuals to keep them from getting banned or get someone banned whom they would like to silence.

       No, we probably can't have a real discussion about it.  I always get labeled a shill, since I often don't agree with the prevailing opinions in this sub.  Of course, I am not a shill for anyone, and I love a good spirited discussion.  But, that's generally not possible, since if you don't toe the party line, so to speak, you are just downvoted and insulted, so as to stifle any discussion.  It really doesn't matter how sound the argument, or how much evidence backs your assertion.  If it's not pro-conspiracy, good-bye.

       Ok, so this is another aspect. False labeling. I think it is fair to say that some people, perhaps not the majority, support what are perceived as "shill positions" all on their own. Unfortunately, false labeling, in my opinion, further destabilizes the potential discussions. I try to be careful of who I accuse. But even doing so I still wonder....maybe this person really just loves fossil fuel companies??? Or Monsanto. Some people do and I don't want to exclude them from a useful discussion. That said, in my experience, those folks don't want to hear a damn thing and generally are just useless mouthpieces -paid or not. I also think effective shilling can be somewhat sophisticated. Taking a simple comment about...oh...class mobility or something pro-American dream...saying something unassuming like. "It's about hard work people, I grew up poor and started with nothing, and now I own my own business." And then, legions of shill accounts will simply upvote that comment anonymously. Thereby giving it the false endorsement of the masses. When in fact class mobility has been on the decline for decades. And the poor and middle class are becoming poorer.

       It's hard to tell, actually.  I can certainly understand, for instance, an atheist subreddit getting tired of religious folks coming in and just saying nothing more than "you're wrong and stupid and going to hell."  (Personally, I don't go to the religious subreddits, though, since I don't think there's anything do debate there.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But, on the other hand, no matter what I am discussing if it's a real, topical issue of the day, if people who think otherwise explain why they think otherwise, I usually enjoy the debate, even sometimes for no other reason that it challenges me to perhaps go do more digging.  Sometimes I learn something about myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       One quick example (which is not necessarily a conspiracy-related one) is that for years, I argued that taxes were necessarily complicated.  There is a lot there in the tax code, and while I am still convinced that
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       people want simplification because they're too lazy to grow up and simply do their taxes, which can be complicated (combined with some who are misled into thinking they will pay less tax with a simpler code); within the past year or so, I realized that this is not the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       reason.  There are valid reasons for wanting to simplify the tax code which have nothing to do with laziness or stupidity on the part of the taxpayers.  I would probably not have realized this without having many discussions on the topic.

       No, I don't

       taxes to be complicated, but life is not always simple.  And adult things, like taxes, are sometimes

       You would be incorrect in your assumptions about me.  More telling is that, again, I'm labeled "underage" (with the implication being I'm naive or stupid, I assume), merely for disagreeing on a certain topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, even more to the point, I even told you I had done that myself.  Thought ALL people who wanted taxes to be simple wanted that for what I consider the wrong reasons.  Then, through discussions, I realized there were other, valid, reasons, and I changed my opinions.  Seems you, on the other hand, are not interested in ever entertaining those discussions, simply because you're sure you're correct.

       No, of course we don't want a sub full of dumb nodding heads, but we also don't want to be immediately shot down when going outside of accepted mainstream-media presented 'facts' or histories.

       I met a shill on
       <a href="/r/socialism">
        /r/socialism
       </a>
       . You'd think a socialist, or a shill pretending to be a socialist, would accept 911. But he didn't. I knew then he was a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three kinds of people who don't accept 911 truth:
       <br/>
       1. People who just don't believe the "government", even Bush and Cheney, would do such a thing.
       <br/>
       2. People who haven't done the research so haven't encountered the truth.
       <br/>
       3. Shills and agents who know but who are being paid to talk down 911 truth whenever they encounter it. Because anyone who has done much reading at all, knows 911 was engineered.

       There's also people who think the supposed evidence doesn't quite line up with the theory. (e.g, me) I can't speak for others but I'm up in the air for now on the 911 "truth".
      </p>
      <p>
       FTR I consider myself heavily socialist leaning too. Economic and social theory really has nothing to do with which story of 911 one believes.

       I'd have to look again, I can't remember off the top of my head. I think much of it was more the plausibility issue and Occam's Razor. I'm a little hungover and tired so will try to get more detailed tomorrow.

       I'm fairly close to socialism on many points (UK-based), and I don't accept 9/11 truther theories because they fail to convince me.

       Well, that is a problem for sure. The other problem being actual shills. As I mentioned in another comment, many (or maybe most) shill accounts aren't even used to comment, simply used to propagate beneficial comments and hide detrimental one through up and down voting. Thereby altering the perceived popular consensus.

       I try to combat misinformation wherever I find it. I do also enjoy having discussions online about religion, politics, conspiracies, science, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm active in
       <a href="/r/debatereligion">
        /r/debatereligion
       </a>
       , but I can't exactly correct different opinions, although it's interesting learning about other viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , there are posts that are downright unfactual. This is where correcting misinformation and discussion intersect for me.
