        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No matter how much of the material shared on this subreddit you choose to believe, I assume the majority of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> believes that the Bush administration engaged in extensive lies, cover-ups, and manipulation with regards to the Iraq War and the &quot;War on Terror&quot;.</p>

<p>My question is why didn&#39;t they fake finding evidence of WMDs in Iraq after the US invaded? </p>

<p>For example, it seems like it would be incredibly easy to fabricate evidence of an Iraqi biological weapons program- just find a Winnebago in the desert, point to some test tubes, and say they tested positive for anthrax. Or hire some Arab dudes in lab coats to say they ran the Iraqi WMD program. Or point some clicking Geiger counters at some machinery and say it&#39;s radioactive.  There would be little cost, little risk, and immense political reward for the Bush administration. If they had created credible evidence of a WMD program in Iraq that could pose a legitimate threat to the US, many would consider Bush to be one of the greatest presidents rather than the worst.  Remember, this was also during a vulnerable time in Bush&#39;s presidency- he ended up barely winning the 2004 election.  Yet there was none of this, and cooking up this evidence would have been MUCH simpler than many of the other conspiracies found on this page. Foreign policy and Iraq were the main issues in the &#39;04 election, and had that happened Bush would have likely won in a landslide, rather than such a slim margin.</p>

<p>Of course no one here knows the answer for sure, but it is interesting to discuss the LACK of a conspiracy where one could do the job so well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story came apart pretty quickly. They tried to claim what they found was a mobile WMD lab, but it became clear pretty quick that it was just bs. Unfortunately I can&#39;t find it, but I remember a whole two pages in the New York Post at the time (Murdoch) being devoted to a full color spread and dissection of the mobile weapons labs that &quot;proved&quot; wmds were in Iraq!</p>

<p>I however did find a report by fox news hyping the trailers, and about the official british investigation into the trailers done a month later.</p>

<p>There&#39;s evidence of gas attack on civilians there, and to be honest I have no idea what to make of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, looking at some other comments, it seems that they tried. But  really It wouldn&#39;t be necessary to show proof. They only needed enough as was necessary to allow the invasion. This is obvious by the fact that that is exactly what happened and no one—Not the UN, not the US people— really batted an eye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;d be hard pressed to prove that &quot;100%&quot; assertion. More than a decade after the original invasion the US still has copious amounts of troops and bases in Iraq.</p>

<p>They had embedded reporters cheerleading the entire effort providing zero critical review of the evidence or the actual war.</p>

<p>Why did they need wmds? What would they have provided that they haven&#39;t already achieved? </p>

<p>They own the media and have an uncritical populace. They don&#39;t have to work near as hard as you seem to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting question. I think part of it is that they didn&#39;t have to, and the other part is that if they found them, they would have to explain it to an international community and it would be inspected.

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, it&#39;d be extremely easy to fake evidence that would pass muster by the international community (who weren&#39;t exactly an impediment for the actual invasion... I don&#39;t think the Bush administration cared about appeasing them).  Like I said, put some anthrax in a trailer in the Iraqi desert and tell people to test it to their heart&#39;s content!  </p>

<p>This would be a waaaay easier plan to carry out than, for example, Mossad doing 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very good question. A similar question I have been looking into recently was how did Watergate get exposed—I don&#39;t have all the answers but it&#39;s starting to get clearer. </p>

<p>Also, in reading your comments, it seems your question is &quot;If this got exposed how could the US have done 9/11&quot;, in which case I will try to provide some context as to why this is apples vs oranges. </p>

<p>I would first like to ask, wasn&#39;t &quot;Iraq never had WMD&#39;s&quot; a &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; for a fair amount of time? I could be wrong but if anyone who has more info could provide a little info on this that would be appreciated.</p>

<p>In regards to the war, I haven&#39;t done too much research (yet)—Only been around for about a year and there is so much geopolitical and conspiracy information to make sense of everything that it hasn&#39;t been a priority—so I can only offer speculation based on my understanding of similar events but:</p>

<p>It seems, to me any way, that Iraq wasn&#39;t exactly part of &#39;the plan&#39;. &#39;They&#39; (Intelligence Agencies, &#39;Shadow Government&#39; NGO&#39;s, etc) supported Saddam for a long while, as is common with these types of things—the CIA overthrows democratically elected leaders to install puppet dictators who will do their bidding. Unfortunately, the CIA is much better at overthrowing democracies than they are at overthrowing dictatorships (<a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/CIAtimeline.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/p/series-peoples-history-of-cia.html">2</a>). As has happened with many US-installed dictators, they get cocky and try to buck the system. I have yet to do much research on what exactly happened that caused the first Gulf War, but Saddam did this in <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/10/30/iraq.un.euro.reut/">late 2000</a> by trying to sell his countries oil in euros—a direct attack against US financial dominance over oil, and on the petrodollar system (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP7L8bw5QF4">1</a>, <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/06/understanding-petrodollar-means.html">2</a>). Same thing happened to Libya in when Gaddaffi started working towards a gold-backed dinar to replace the dollar for oils sales (<a href="http://rt.com/news/economy-oil-gold-libya/">1</a>). Thankfully we put a stop to that nonsense when we overthrow Gaddaffi in 2011. Same thing is happening right now with Iran. Iran, or more specifically, the strait of hormuz, is seemingly the centerpiece to all of this. Right now we are framing their best buddies, the Syrian government, with chemical weapons because (for reasons which I have yet to understand) we don&#39;t want to or cannot directly deal with Iran. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to understand that Iraq, Libya, Syria, Iran, all these countries, are very short term things. &#39;Covering tracks&#39; so to speak is not a black or white thing—you only need to fool the people long enough to get you in there, then you got that shit in the bag. There is no necessity for it to hold up 10 or even 5 years later. What&#39;s the public gonna do? Post a snide comment against the Bush administration on reddit?  They (the real string pullers not lolbush)  know the public doesn&#39;t really give a shit about anything because they [shadow government] helped to engineer it. And they, as was finally made big news in recent months, have everything you&#39;ve ever done on the internet at their finger tips so I assume gauging public opinion is not that difficult. the CIA has been wiretapping and tracking people for at least 50 years (to my knowledge, not to the extent that the NSA is though). </p>

<p>What&#39;s the UN gonna do? Wag their fist as the US in a meeting hall? Most of them are sympathetic to US interests, and when our military expenditures trump the sum of every other country in the world, I don&#39;t think any individual country who isn&#39;t would be dumb enough to start asking questions else they get a nice dose of freedom dropped on their heads. Of course, it seems, with Iraq at least, there was enough lack of control over the situation by the US, and a lack of necessity to put too much effort into the cover story, to result in the exposing that Iraq never had WMD&#39;s.</p>

<p>The Iraq war has more or less come to a close (Right?), or at least US troops are being withdrawn while private contractors are being put in. &quot;Iraq never had WMD&#39;s&quot; become official <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/panorama-iraq-fresh-wmd-claims">this year</a> (if there is a further back new sources, please correct me). The wars already over. What are people gonna do? All that can really happen is &quot;Oh, well we won&#39;t get fooled next time!&quot;. Iraq was inconsequential in the broad scale of things. You don&#39;t need someone to believe their whole lives that you conned them—only long enough for you to get what you wanted.</p>

<p>9/11, however, is much different. 9/11 issued in a whole  new era. 9/11 was the pretext for endless war, &#39;the war on terror&#39;, TSA, NSA, Patriot Act, NDAA, so on and so forth.  There was much more at stake with 9/11 , and there was much more control of the situation. 9/11 10, 20, even 50  years later ( I doubt the US will exist in 50 years, but regardless), turning out to be a lie would be <em>huge</em>. Iraq never having WMD&#39;s? Not so much. murdering your own people, on your own land is much different than lying about the reasons for a war. People are desentizied to this. We&#39;ve been at war for 214 of our 236 years as a country and we&#39;ve been coerced, manipulated, and lied to for most of them (and we generally know it)—We&#39;re used to that. It&#39;s depressing but it&#39;s true. However, the &#39;government&#39; killing it&#39;s own people, we&#39;re not used to that, and thus if it [9/11 as an &#39;inside job&#39;] was true, it&#39;s implications are much more concerning to most. And that on top of all the other things which have used and will continue to use 9/11 as a justification, makes 9/11 much more important to keep &#39;under the cloak&#39;, so to speak. </p>

<p>Another thing: 9/11, at least in the evidence I have reviewed thus far, was not something that involved standard government bureaus (Congress, Executive, Judiciary, etc). As I understand it, Bush didn&#39;t even know about it and was nothing more than complicit in the cover up. The Iraq war, was not a covert operation. It was in plain sight and, again I am not to well versed on the topic but, I assume it followed through standard bureaucratic channels for the most part (or at least, much more so than 9/11). </p>

<p>Sorry for rambling; I was putting together most of this in my head as a was writing it, but pretty much to sum it up: It seems evident to me that not only was there very little reason to facilitate a coverup for any longer than was necessary to initiate the war, but that it also fell in a much more difficult geopolitical context to actually allow for a cover up anyway—these guys are smart enough to avoid backing themselves into a corner—as opposed something like 9/11 (on our homefield, doing something most Americans can&#39;t even fathom).</p>

<p>Of course, this question isn&#39;t really isn&#39;t all that necessary if one can acknowledge that even a <em>few</em> of the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1korgs/the_official_megalist_of_911_suspicious/">too-numerous-to-count oddities of 9/11</a> have any validity. 9/11 is not as we are told. What the truth actually is we will never know unless we get a real independent investigation, but when armed with even the information which is more or less irrefutable, it&#39;s pretty clear that protocols which would have prevented these attacks were not followed; dozens, if not hundreds, of warning were ignored; and it&#39;s pretty hard to honestly argue that the US did not at least allow these attacks to happen. </p>

<p>hopefully even with my amateur understanding of all this I have done a fair job of shining some light, and some context on these questions. If anyone has any corrections, rebuttals, further information, or whatever else, I&#39;d be happy to dialogue as I am always looking to further my understanding. </p>

This was an infiltration of the democratic party, an entity already in the back pocket of the higher ups, so it I can&#39;t see any motive on their part—as far as I can tell, the top guy in Watergate was Nixon (pretty rare). I assumed that maybe, seeing as it didn&#39;t involve the CIA or implicate any member of the &#39;permanent government&#39;, that they were just a &#39;eh, you&#39;re on your own bud&#39; kind of thing. But then, in conversing with another poster here, he mentioned that this occurred at the height of Mockingbird, and that it was Washington Post and NYT (the 2 biggest mocking bird players at the time) who jumped on the story. Here&#39;s his exact response:</p>

<p>&quot;So I would argue that Watergate was a calculated political event in &#39;deep politics&#39;. The establishment lost use of their &#39;figurehead&#39; and benefited from feeding him to the wolves, essentially. It paved the way for Reagans election in 80, for HW Bush&#39;s appointment by ford to director of central intelligence in 76, it purged much of the liberal elements of the republican party (nixon and his posse were pretty liberal outside of his warmongering), it placated the populace who thought they were making a stand against the policies of the last decade.</p>

<p>&quot;This is interesting: When watergate broke, it was the height of operation mockingbird and the NYT and Washington Post jumped on the story like rabid dogs, both primary mockingbird institutions so there was definitely an agenda with that. One of the writers for WaPo was Carl Bernstein, who immediately after his famous watergate reporting left the WaPo and began investigating the CIAs relationship with the media, so clearly he realized something was up and wanted to learn more about it. He is one of the best resources for what we know about mockingbird today.&quot;</p>

<p>I have yet to, in my own research, verify much of this (except the parts about mockingbird, WaPo and NYT), but he has yet to steer me wrong so I am inclined to hold this as a place holder of the assumed situation until I get time to look into it further. </p>

<p>I&#39;m told Peter Scott Dale has some good work in this subject (I&#39;ve read one of his JFK essay and he <em>really</em> gets into the nitty gritty—honestly, a little too much so that it makes it hard to see the big picture) for those looking to further understand this information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Others have noted the problems with attempts to report &#39;finding&#39; WMD in Iraq after the war.</p>

<p>I would simply like to ask this-- &quot;Did nobody else watch or read the news in 2002!?&quot; The government explicitly said &quot;We are looking for an excuse to go to war with Iraq&quot; in late 2001 and continued saying it throughout 2002. In the summer of 2002, my friends and I started a pool on when the war would start. I bet on the first half of November, 2002 based on an analysis of troop movements that I had read. This was all <em>before</em> the WMD/inspectors kabuki show.</p>

<p>The WMD thing was <em>explicitly</em> and <em>transparently</em> an <strong>excuse</strong> to start the war. In the words that the Bush administration and mainstream media used in early-mid 2002, it was the <em>casus belli</em> that they needed. If you were too young at the time, it&#39;s easily forgiven, but I honestly cannot understand what the fuck happened to so many adults in the USA to get so distracted by the manufactured drama over WMD. I&#39;m simply baffled by the whole fucking thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB are internationalists pretending to be Americans who want create a one world government based upon the ideals of socialism/communism/fascism/feudalism/collectivism. They have their technical differences of course, but one thing they all have in common is a small group of unelected people deciding how you live your life. Western individualism, liberty, personal freedom and democracy are the anti-thesis of their vision and the last hope against their plans. TPTB are planning WWIII, primarily between the communist countries of Russia/China, and USA/England. </p>

<p>As such, TPTB want the world to begin to see the USA government as the villain, the aggressor, the invader, and the lying hypocrites that our politicians have become. TPTB want the world to side with the Eastern superpowers, and countries in South America and Africa going that way. And that&#39;s why TPTB wants everyone to know there were no WMDs in Iraq, just lies from a country that cannot be trusted, just like always, a pattern now leading to more (no) WMDs in Syria. Thanks for reading my crazy conspiracy!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They were thwarted in their attempt to do so by patriotic elements in the military/government.</p></li>
<li><p>They <em>wanted</em> make the US population complacent in accepting whatever reason/excuse the government delivers for starting a war no matter if they can prove it or not, no matter if it changes right in the middle of the war or not. They want to be able to go to war whenever they feel like it. They believe in the persuasive power of their media. This was basically a test to see if they could that. This basically creates a precedent.</p></li>

<p>...or rapid clean-up of all the weapon-stashes with &quot;Made in USA&quot; on them was more important than justifying the original claim.</p>

<p>I agree, there is a reason/decision not to &quot;find the WMDs&quot;.</p>
