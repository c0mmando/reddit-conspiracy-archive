    <div class="md"><p>Because chemtrails are not actually a thing.</p>

<p>How do I know this?</p>

<p>The main theory behind chemtrails is that a chemical with a barium compound is sprayed in order to dumb is down...</p>

<p>If this were true, x-ray machines should pick up on this. EVERY single doctor and Med student and x-ray technician would have to be bribed to shut them up. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675072766_German-V-2-rocket_launching-stand_vapor-trails_radar-screen">http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675072766_German-V-2-rocket_launching-stand_vapor-trails_radar-screen</a></p>

<p>Even in WW2, when the germans used V2 rockets to bomb London England there were trails in the sky. In 1942, global warming wasn&#39;t even an idea yet. Also Hitler wasn&#39;t trying to make people dumb, he loved the arian race, and would never gas them.</p>

<p>Jews on the other hand....</p>

<p>TLDR: chemtrails are horseshit</p>

<p>If you are trying to argue that the contrails should stay together because they are ice, what we should be seeing is absolutely massive pieces of hail falling from the sky whenever airplanes pass over during the right conditions.</p>

<p>Chemtrails are as real as santa.</p>

<pre><code>Yes, there are gifts under the christmas tree.
Yes, there are photographs of a man in a red suit.
yes, we celebrate christmas
and yes, there are people (albeit children) who believe in Santa...
</code></pre>

<h2>it doesn&#39;t make santa real.</h2>

<p>All of it is circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p><strong>[OFF-TOPIC]</strong></p>

<p>I do not believe in, and see no truth behind:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Lizard people&quot;</li>
<li>chemtrails</li>
<li>Illuminati</li>
<li>Hitler still being alive</li>
<li>Other theories that are not simple and add nothing of value and offer zero explanation </li>
</ul>

<p>I do have very strong doubts / believe</p>

<ul>
<li>911</li>
<li>boston bombing</li>
<li>elections being rigged</li>
<li>JFK assassination</li>
<li>banks controlling politicians.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also believe the government is a clusterfuck</p>

<ul>
<li>no one knows what is going on.</li>
<li>every department is hiding information from each other.</li>
<li>because of all the bureaucracy, its very hard to get something done.

<ul>
<li>democracy doesn&#39;t work. There are too many voices, all crying out what they want.</li>
<li>In the end, the loudest voice is money because...well everyone likes having more money.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>There are two kinds of people in the world.</p>

<ol>
<li>co-operators</li>
<li>parasites/thugs/people in it for themselves.</li>
</ol>

<p>The parasites needs the cooperator. The parasite makes sure the most successful cooperators stay successful. This makes the successful cooperator complacent, and the less successful have no power anyways. The system is now stable.</p>

<p>When deciding something:</p>

<ol>
<li>Common sense</li>
<li>Occam&#39;s Razor</li>
<li>trusted friends</li>
<li>majority is right</li>
</ol>

<p>are applied in the order they are stated.</p>

<p>The reason I do not believe  chemtrails are a thing:</p>

<ol>
<li>It hasn&#39;t affected me.</li>
<li>Other explanations are currently satisfactory.</li>
<li>There are no credible scientists reporting on it.</li>
<li>Contrails are real, and if I were to assume that chemtrails also exist, I would have a hard time distinguishing between the two.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope you see where I am coming from. I am not <em>stubbornly</em> being dismissive. If I am wrong about something, I am happy to change my point of view. (acknowledging past shows I am making progress. Only once we are aware of our mistakes do we have the power to change them.... etc, etc)</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most important question to ask yourself when evaluating something is &quot;cui bono&quot;, or &quot;who benefits?&quot;.  Follow the money.  That question is the reason I give little credibility to chemtrails. I agree with you that there are no lizards running the world.  However, sayings banks do not hold a tremendous amount of unwarranted influence over our politicians is silly. Laughable almost. Not to be a dick man, but holy shit.  </p>

<p>But if you look at what happened to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith-Mundt_Act">Smith-Mundt</a> act:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 amended the Smith–Mundt Act and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within U.S. borders and striking down a long-time ban on the dissemination of such material in the United States.[1][2][3]</p>

<p>It&#39;s just not on their radar.</p>

<p>Barium is used to help the military&#39;s communications and signaling beyond the horizon,  and is distributed along flight pathways everywhere the military goes,  a fact that was once clearly stated on  several military websites.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they still do say that because....terrorism. I&#39;m not going to go find out.</p>

<p>Aluminum, oxide is used to &#39;enhance the albedo of the earth&#39;, in other words to whiten the sky in order to  reflect sunlight.  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t work however because the  metal particles aren&#39;t aligned in any particular direction so instead of being a reflector of sunlight  they simply heat up in the sunlight rather than producing any cooling effect.</p>

<p>In both cases the military personnel that I had long discussions about this with circa 2003, in which I provided a long list of military cites   in the end   had to agree that I had my information straight but insisted  that those materials don&#39;t ever  come down. </p>

<p>If they do  come down aluminum oxide, if it migrates to  the human pituitary gland in suspected as a cause of Alzheimer disease. </p>

<p>Atmospheric Barium is suspected as a possible cause of extra cases of Multiple sclerosis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the chemicals that are being sprayed are not inherently dangerous unless you are an infant, elderly, or have pre-existing breathing problems.</p>

<p>The chemicals (by my own sampling) consist of a glycol-based carrier, aluminum, and small traces of barium.</p>

<p>Despite what people tell you I am a pilot (recreational), have been for 25+ years, and they simply did NOT exist until the early to mid-90&#39;s. They are NOT contrails as they form in environments that are completely un-conducive to contrail formation from jet engines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I grew up in the flight path of an international airport, my stepparents ran a rural municipal airport and I went to college by an Air Force base. I would say I have a good degree of experience with all types of aircraft. </p>

<p>Recently, (since Dec 2012) I noticed a sharp uptake in air traffic. Some are commercial airlines, on a flight path following the CT river north, which must be a new flight path? I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the power canal and nuclear plant (that is waaaay to close for comfort) company or perhaps Army Corp of Engineers, but there&#39;s been a sharp increase of helicopters, low flying directly along the water way. </p>

<p>What is MOST disturbing? This only happens on extremely overcast days is some form of military training coming from , I assume the AFB about 30 miles south. Above the cloud line, I&#39;ll hear some kind of HYPER fast and loud plane (drone maybe?), always moving South to North, directly in the direction of Vermont Yankee nuke plant. Then 30 seconds or so, 2 to 3 jets, following fast, but never as loud and vibrant as that first plane. </p>

<p>Has happened at least a dozen times, but always always always, on extremely overcast days and I never get a view. </p>

<p>I feel like the sound of the 9/11 planes decelerating before hitting the Towers is SO engrained in my psyche. I&#39;ve noticed these commercial planes make a very similar sound, but they should be ASENDING, due to the northern mountain ranges. The next two months are my absolute least favorite because both local law enforcement (looking for marijuana operations) and freaking leafpeepers fly like crazy, low and all day, from the local airport. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked locals , especially the drunks that drink on the porch all day, &quot;when did we start getting all this air traffic?&quot;, and it scares me how many are like, &quot;eh, haven&#39;t noticed...&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m counting the hours until I can GTFO of this county...</p>
