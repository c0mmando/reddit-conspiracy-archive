I&#39;m not going to give facts about who the person is for obvious reasons. Take these as you will, like everything posted on this subreddit. I AM NOT SAYING THESE THINGS ARE TRUE.</p>

<p>Apparently the entire civilian database is free for most people/officers to view, it&#39;s not some crazy shit Snowden and his coworkers had the privilege to access (though is probably known by most, again just confirming.) The entire thing is accessible, just ask anyone you know working in intelligence.</p>

<p>She says the NSA is &quot;kind of&quot; a distraction from the DIA and the NRO, and that SIPRNET is like &quot;Pandora&#39;s Box.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nro.gov/">http://www.nro.gov/</a>
<a href="http://www.dia.mil/">http://www.dia.mil/</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNet</a></p>

<p>There are eyes and ears everywhere, in everything you can imagine. She says what they&#39;re doing is incredibly sketchy. I try not to fear the worst but after this conversation I&#39;m pretty unsettled. I obviously didn&#39;t get any details, so I can&#39;t answer any specific questions. The conversation is still going.</p>

<p>Edit 1: The government has already created plans to crush any civil rebellion and is slowly turning local law enforcement into a paramilitary force. Basically a mixture of Brave New World and 1984.</p>

<p>Edit 2: They have cameras in the sky that capture every 2 feet in a pixel. Also, we don&#39;t want to know what &quot;EP-3&quot; is capable of.</p>

<p>Edit 3: Though this isn&#39;t too crazy, her base can pick up any signal, encrypted or not, within 200 miles of her base.</p>

<p>Final edit: There is no way to live off the grid anymore because of (edit 2) and their software that is able to accurately pick up whats going on in the live feed of the cameras. It&#39;s not Google Maps-type shit. It&#39;s a live feed.</p>

<p>Thanks for the upvotes, guys. Anyone with info to help me prove these facts would be greatly appreciated. All discussion is valued.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the information you relay is true as far as I am personally aware.</p>

<p>Ever since the Tampa Bay Superbowl, the Trapwire has been out in public view under one name or another.  If you do not know what Trapwire is, the main feature I refer to is the integration of all millions of camera sources.</p>

<p>When you buy a webcam for own security, you help secure the nation if you live in a Trapwire area.  Your webcam has been backdoored and the exploit is on the shelf at NSA.</p>

<p>The &quot;Sketchy Shit&quot;, in my opinion, is this.  They know everybody&#39;s dirty laundry.  That time you bit that chick when she was hitting you; they know.  All those hundreds of MP3s you pirated and made available?  Those drugs you took?  The whores?  They know.  And they can use this to put you in jail or put you to work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the economy is in a structural collapse.  Robots are replacing people faster than new jobs are being created.  So, the USG is snapping up petit &quot;criminals&quot; using their intelligence net.  Most of the criminals are then pressed into service labor as clandestine law enforcement.  I shit you not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the comment! All good stuff. But one thing, if a robot can take your job, it should. I believe we should attempt to move towards the singularity with any step we are capable of taking. I know it sucks with jobs and overpopulation, but in the name of progress I think sacrifices must be made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with your sentiment about Luddite thinking.</p>

<p>But the problem isn&#39;t that the robots are succeeding.  The problem is that there are no <em>real</em> jobs for Americans anymore, but the people can&#39;t eat cake and the USG knows that.  Because people no longer hold actual jobs, the USG needs some ways to inject cash into the economy.  So they make people into informants and operatives.  Then they pay these people in freshly printed hundreds.  They send them to various retail stores to buy things at no cost to them.  This is simply a way of injecting money into an economy where there are not enough legitimate ways for people to earn money.</p>

<p>Without the false economy this creates, we would be hit a lot harder by so much of our skilled labor base sitting at home idle.  As things stand, our labor base itself is being hit hard, but the overall economy appears to be running smoothly.</p>

<p>Addendum: there are a lot of other problems which led America to this.  In my opinion, one of the gravest mistakes of our modern time was bringing so many former Soviets here in the late 80&#39;s.  Our government even picked their brains for &quot;skills of government,&quot; as if our defeated Evil Empire rival would have some of those that we should want. </p>

<p>Since that time, when our nation was already troubled post-Kennedy and fresh out of Vietnam, the US has become some kind of weird replica of the Soviet empire, complete with various KGB bureaus.  One of them has &quot;Homeland&quot; in its name.  What the fuck?  Is that department supposed to protect the Sioux Indians, or what?  &quot;Homeland?&quot;</p>

We have a problem with the agriculture in this country. I&#39;m not saying everyone go out and pick berries instead of surf the net, I am saying that we have a lot of land, and a lot of starving people. Why aren&#39;t we planting food for everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever farmed?  Is hard work.  My PS3 is easier on my back.  </p>

<p>But you are correct that it would be great if we all farmed.</p>

<p>TBH, this summer we moved 500 miles inland to farm country so we could farm and write books.  We&#39;re planting clean food for us to subsist on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we need to regress. This is how the Transparent Society (David Brin) is beginning, with birth pains.  It will grow into a fine young new society, I hope.</p>

Snoden was free to walk around in the airport, and be seen?  GEEZ,  like the Russians would build an airport without a back area where people are taken whenever they are detained!   Even US airports constantly detain people and take them through closed door into back areas.   Those back areas are huge.   Most people don&#39;t stay there for long,  but why not,  a person could be held back there indefinitely if they wanted to.   This Paulstel thing is BS.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m gonna have to disagree with you. Most laws <em>don&#39;t</em> work. I might bring up the old saying of &quot;laws are made to be broken.&quot; Laws are largely preventative or punitive in nature and increasingly over this last century they have become both.</p>

<p>Even on a local level, laws are usually, unintentionally or not, directed <em>against</em> the common welfare <em>in the interest of</em> &quot;public safety&quot;. Citizens have been manipulated into shifting the burden of their safety from a private responsibilty to a public one. With the shift in responsibilty comes a corresponding shift in authority, empowering the fictional &quot;state&quot; (in reality, it&#39;s agents) at the expense of the citizen.</p>

<p>Living under the reign of a republic that touts both the highest domestic incarceration rate globally as well as arguably the most internationally active military, I cannot agree that our legal system does anything but ruin lives.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In response to your recommendation of studying militant revolutionaries- ...</p>

<p>It&#39;s about as pointless as sitting here and whining. With the impossibilities of clandestine telecommunications operations, and the ubiquity of federal anti-terrorism entrapment programs, I deduce it&#39;s near impossible to form a covert paramilitary organization in today&#39;s America.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my take though.</p>

<p>And what I think of as the &quot;vs. computer&quot; problem. When you play a videogame with emergent properties (unpredictable outcomes from the same inputs) that has the option to play against the computer it&#39;s very easy to beat the computer after you learn how the person who programed it was thinking (even if you can&#39;t use your imputs as fast as the computer can). Games like chess or Jeopardy! are also very complex, but have less of those emergent properties, which is why it&#39;s sometimes pretty hard for the very best players to beat the very best computers.</p>

<p>I think FiveSenses is getting at the computers are getting better at emergent stuff, which is concerning, but also sorta inevitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t forget. Watson didn&#39;t have internets but it did have over 4 tb of general information (that&#39;s 400 Wikipedias of text [399, give or take, counting all of wikipedia to date]) <em>in RAM</em>. And don&#39;t think that Watson was a lark; a <em>team</em> put it together. And btw, if you forget all the rest of this, remember it was <strong>people</strong>, a lot of very smart and talented people, working a long time, to put him (him, lol) together - for a very specific purpose.</p>

<p>Watson beat Ken and Brad not on &quot;being smarter&quot; but on the buzzer, on never getting mentally fatigued or psyched-out or whatever, and on being smart <em>enough</em>. It&#39;s important to note that the signal to tell the contestants that it&#39;s ok to buzz (turned on by a judge after Alex finishes reading the clue) is a wreath of christmas lights around the game board. Watson, having no eyes, actually got the same signal, electrically, several micro(?) seconds earlier than the human rods and cones did. </p>

<p>Of course the real genius of the system is Watson&#39;s other software, presumably in the other 12 TB of its RAM, that could suss out the &quot;clue&quot; portion of the answers comparable with a pretty smart human. </p>

<p>That is the emergent part I was talking about. Watching those episodes I could tell Watson missed a few really easy questions because Watson couldn&#39;t understand the context of human speech as well as any average, fluent American citizen, sans encyclopedias and critical thinking skills. I&#39;ve often wondered if it could do better in another language(?)</p>

<p>But kinda moot at this point. Watson was a well-designed platform for some fantastic programming. That&#39;s all. Try having this conversation with Watson two (or 18) point oh and see how far you get.</p>

<p>And re any tippy-top asymmetric encryption scheme vs. a quantum computer: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>if you were trying to save the human race from the rise of the machines (or anything equally important) you would have practical use for electronic one-time pads, still theoretically uncrackable (ie. completely random) </p></li>
<li><p>more useful: quantum computers will give us new ways to efficiently encrypt stuff to keep them from quantum computers. That is a simple intuitive leap that the computer itself could never arrive at (maybe?). Will the government keep quantum computers away from us plebs like machine guns or F-16s? That remains to be seen.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>PS: to answer my last question: no. It will still take a lot of people to program them bitches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know computers are not magic, but please do not underestimate what has already been built.  If you already know about even the ancient Texas Memory Systems&#39; entire product line, then, forgive me.  Otherwise, do realize that a sufficiently advanced technology will appear to you as if magic.  If you haven&#39;t seen the technology of today that appears to you as magic then count yourself as lacking, not having.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see the dangers with those systems, really, but I just mean they aren&#39;t perfect. False positives, environmental issues (the huge one for me is cooling [energy] that requires a huge physical plant with a considerable workforce), and my favorite: computers still don&#39;t have any desire or ambition to suppress the vote or invade a country. They&#39;re still tools (powerful tools that can facilitate powerful evils [like nukes, or a locked door]), but our enemies, if we have enemies, are still people.</p>

<p>But hey, I&#39;m completely open to whatever top secret thing we&#39;ll find out about in five years. </p>

<p>Still... people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what I know about that system stems from the false positives it produces, in fact.</p>

<p>But, yes, the way people employ these huge tools, which go way beyond Echelon, is the key to whether you and I live or die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not convincing at all.   So,  the MSM is controlled,  duh,  what&#39;s new?   That doesn&#39;t mean the name Assange,  Snoden,  Manning are never going to appear in the MSM, why not, they are not exactly celebrated as heros.   Snoden was free to walk around in the airport, and be seen?  GEEZ,  like the Russians would build an airport without a back area where people are taken whenever they are detained!   Even US airports constantly detain people and take them through closed door into back areas.   Those back areas are huge.   Most people don&#39;t stay there for long,  but why not,  a person could be held back there indefinitely if they wanted to.   This Paulstel thing is BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the comment! All good stuff. But one thing, if a robot can take your job, it should. I believe we should attempt to move towards the singularity with any step we are capable of taking. I know it sucks with jobs and overpopulation, but in the name of progress I think sacrifices must be made.</p>
