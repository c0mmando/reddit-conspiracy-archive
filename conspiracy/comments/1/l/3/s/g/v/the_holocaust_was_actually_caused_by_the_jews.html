       Again, it seems that you want to have a conversation with someone entirely different than myself, for you keep mentioning things that are in no way representative of what I've been saying.

       Apparently you wish to attempt communicating in wannabe obscure riddles instead of being more straight forward.  This is ultimately a failing on

       Let's step back a moment though, shall we? You posted a link to a video promoting some pretty blatantly anti-Semitic rhetoric. I pointed this out, and you called me "closed, scared, frightened, bigoted, and racist".
      </p>
      <p>
       "I know you are but what am I" is a response children use when someone insults them. I don't see how any reasonable person would thing that criticizing anti-Semitism is bigoted or racist. So it really just seems like you were just lashing back with the same accusations I made against you, even if it made no sense whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure you came to perceive that as an "obscure riddle", but whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       is holocaust denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow I doubt you're all that familiar with the topic of holocaust denial and revisionism. Blaming the Jews for the holocaust is a typical part of the denial movement (as a side note, accusing anti-racists of being "the real racists" is also a common tactic used by white supremacists and the like).
      </p>
      <p>
       Just Google "Jim Condit Jr", the guy being interviewed in your link. He's well known as being involved in the holocaust denial, anti-Semitism scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bOIluG1dgw">
        Here's a video
       </a>
       of him giving a talk where he claims that the idea that 6,000,000 jews were killed is "preposterous", that there were no gas chambers, where he calls Elie Wiesel a "liar, deceiver, blasphemer", and repeats all sorts of standard holocaust denier bullshit. He seems to promote all of the standard claims that holocaust deniers make, these are things that have been thoroughly refuted. I don't know what you think holocaust denial is, but it's not the claim that there were no concentration camps whatsoever. It's exactly the kind of nonsense this guy is spouting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Willfully promoting this hateful, ignorant garbage is not a noble act. I recommend doing some basic research on how flawed the holocaust denier claims are.

      <p>
       No I didn't.  You see, that's where the "lets step back shall we?" gets shown to be total, obvious b.s.  You're only stating it's "anti semitic" because, like almost everyone of your ilk, you simply have a knee jerk reaction against anything that is justifiably critical of Zionism.  Grow up.  That's not "stepping back".  That's using the exact same'ol M.O. that is used by those that, whether you even know it or not, you are representing to a tee here.

       Yeah.  And it's something you tried to pin on what I was saying that simply didn't apply or stick.  I said what I said, and what I said was valid.  Your mentioning the whole "I know you are but what am I" b.s. doesn't in any way apply.  That's just the simple truth.

      <p>
       Being a bigot toward ANY race is - by definition - racist.  Criticizing anti semitism isn't the same thing here, however.  There is absolutely nothing anti semitic about what I've done up to this point.  The fact that this is the basis of your ENTIRE argument really just shows how desperate you are to continue being an uncritical thinker hoping that others are just as uncritical and don't bother to realize that you've been employing a flimsy straw man fallacy this entire time (along with using ad hominems since "anti semite" has become such a catch phrase "bad word").

       I didn't bother to even entertain any wannabe attempt by you or anyone to try to be "cute" by making some sort of stupid "obscure riddle".  I'm a straight shooter.  Say what you have to say.  If you think you need to be cute or cheeky to say it, then obviously the information isn't important enough to stand on its own merit.

       I've stated already that there is a difference between the "common" Jews, and the racists, elitist Zionists Jews.  You are making a HORRIBLE, horrible mistake in damning your very own people by actually EQUATING the common Jews and the racists Zionist group that was responsible for killing the common Jews and the things I talked about in the OP.  What the fuck are you doing?  You're like...burning yourself at

       lol.  And this is supposed to show what exactly?  You're essentially saying that Condit shouldn't be payed attention to because some other butt hurt ADL types did the same thing to him that you're attempting to do to me.  Damn.  That's just really lol worthy.  Anyone who brings up the information that he brings up is going to get knee-jerk labeled an anti semite by your type, so really it doesn't actually mean much of anything that Condit was labeled as such because of the information he gave.

       Willfully attempting to twist and contort valid data is a cowardly, blatantly nefarious act.  That's very much not noble in any way.  I'm certainly not promoting hateful, ignorant garbage, and your attempting to twist the information as being that is what is blatantly cowardly and shameful.  For that, you should be horribly ashamed of yourself.  But that's the thing though, isn't it?  Your type actually DON'T feel any shame right?

Actually learning about the history of Zionism, jews in Europe, the holocaust from reliable, academic sources? Boooooring!

       It would seem that the Jewish Zionists have been working for World domination for about 100 years now. This is why all the nonsense about the Holocaust. The reason for the "Six Million" magic number (which is wrong, by the way) is because it is part of the indoctrination to further this world domination. Why else would the Jews imprison people (via Laws in Germany and Canada among other places) for challenging it ? Only a lie needs penalty of law to enforce it. The Jewish Zionists wanted the Jews to go to Palestine in order to occupy and conquer it. In 1948 that is just what happened. Palestine was invaded and then pronounced to be "Israel", which even today
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       has not finalized the border. Notice the mention of, among others, the name Rothschild. This is the family that is behind all of this, even today. They brought about the Federal Reserve Bank in order to control the US. The US is being
       <em>
        suckered
       </em>
       into being the enforcement arm of the Jewish Zionists.

       I know your post to be true--but you may want to put the reason for the "6 million" nonsense into perspective. Do you have that link that shows how that "magic number" was used literally about 50 times before WWII ever
       <em>
        happened?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       My long-dead grandpop, a "holocaust survivor," was very vocal in the fact (according to him) that there were NO gas chambers (where he was at least). He always told me that the number of dead didn't exceed 200,000 as Hitler badly needed the Jews for labor purposes. He was angry--he said that when WWII was happening that the Jews in other countries "didn't want us" and now there is a lot of evidence to back that up (read Chaim Weitzmann for one). If you read up on it you'll see that Zionists, American and otherwise, worked hand-in-glove with the Nazis all throughout the war. They profited IMMENSELY on the backs of their own people.

       His quote--"for totally destroying the Jewish race there sure are a lot of us, aren't there?" (1985-ish).

       Yes, I do. What follows is an article printed in "The American Hebrew" dated October, 31, 1919. Also included are scans of the actual newspaper itself. This has a reference to a Jewish Holocaust well before World War II.

       I think that its important that people realize that the "six million" number exists for a number of reasons--foremost among them being fulfilling biblical prophecy--and is in no way fixed in reality. Nearly every Jew that I've ever met confirms this. Hell, growing up my favorite rabbi (also my grandpop's best friend) said that the number was, in his opinion, a farce.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that my grandfather was pretty correct. Germany's records show, I believe, somewhere in the neighborhood of 200,000 killed...which is a terrible, horrible crime. It certainly reflects reality more than the propagandized number.

        Protocols Decision Washed Out
Press and Radio Silent on Appeal Finding
       </p>
       <p>
        Great publicity was given throughout the world in 1935 to a decision in the Swiss Courts that the documents known as "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion" were a forgery; that the [jewish] judge had described the contents as "ridiculous nonsense"; and that the Protocols had been condemned as an offence against public morals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even in remote New Zealand numerous newspapers at that time published long articles on what they termed an "Historic Forgery"; and addresses were similarly given over the radio system proclaiming loudly that the Protocols had been shown to be baseless.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are now at the end of February, 1938, but the writer can recall nothing in the daily papers, and he has heard nothing over the radio system, telling him that the Protocols verdict given on May 14, 1935, was reversed by the Berne Court of Appeal on November 1 last.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the decision went one way it was news fit for all the world to hear: a subject for special articles and radio broadcasts. When it went the other way it ceased to be news at all.

       The Protocols were a hoax by the Tsar's secret police. This is such a widely known fact that it's actually pretty impressive that you're still ignorant of it. They were originally published in a newspaper owned by a right-wing Russian nationalist. You have to be pretty gullible to think they're real. If a right-wing European newspaper published an alleged set of diabolical plans by a global Muslim conspiracy, anyone who just believed them would be a complete idiot. Same goes for this. Nobody with even the most basic critical thinking skills can possibly believe a hoax that obvious.

       Let us not forget the 1939 massacre of Germans in the Polish Danzig corridor. 58,000 dead Germans, killed by Polish Bolshevik Jews, in the most brutal ways imaginable.

       This was the

       very important information, i was always struck by why the usa seems to be following the nazi facism model (bushes, operation paperclip, cia roots etc etc) and yet, also, is so very obviously controlled by zionists. i had been pursuing that line of inquiry for a while when i came across this video which filled in some of the few remaining holes i had in the ww2 jigsaw...

       Couldn't stop listening to it actually.  The implications are immense.

       Ha.  Yep.  I imagined it would get that kind of reaction.  I thought it was important enough to repost again as well.

       I'm currently listening to/looking at/going through Jim Condit's
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ5MeQnmLo0">
        The Final Solution to Adolf Hitler
       </a>
       presentation, and it's pretty full of very interesting
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       very
       <em>
        documented
       </em>
       information.  Compelling to say the least.
