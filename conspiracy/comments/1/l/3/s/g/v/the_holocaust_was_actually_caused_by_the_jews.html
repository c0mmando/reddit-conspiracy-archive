<p>Your above response in no way whatsoever made it apparent that you are &quot;opposed to holocaust denial&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, it seems that you want to have a conversation with someone entirely different than myself, for you keep mentioning things that are in no way representative of what I&#39;ve been saying.</p>

<p>Apparently you wish to attempt communicating in wannabe obscure riddles instead of being more straight forward.  This is ultimately a failing on <em>your</em> part, and no one else&#39;s.</p>

<p>It seems that you will continue to misinterpret and misunderstand things in order to fit whatever it is that you wish to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s step back a moment though, shall we? You posted a link to a video promoting some pretty blatantly anti-Semitic rhetoric. I pointed this out, and you called me &quot;closed, scared, frightened, bigoted, and racist&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;I know you are but what am I&quot; is a response children use when someone insults them. I don&#39;t see how any reasonable person would thing that criticizing anti-Semitism is bigoted or racist. So it really just seems like you were just lashing back with the same accusations I made against you, even if it made no sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure you came to perceive that as an &quot;obscure riddle&quot;, but whatever.</p>

<p>Anyways...</p>

<p>Yes, it <em>definitely</em> is holocaust denial. </p>

<p>Somehow I doubt you&#39;re all that familiar with the topic of holocaust denial and revisionism. Blaming the Jews for the holocaust is a typical part of the denial movement (as a side note, accusing anti-racists of being &quot;the real racists&quot; is also a common tactic used by white supremacists and the like). </p>

<p>Just Google &quot;Jim Condit Jr&quot;, the guy being interviewed in your link. He&#39;s well known as being involved in the holocaust denial, anti-Semitism scene.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bOIluG1dgw">Here&#39;s a video</a> of him giving a talk where he claims that the idea that 6,000,000 jews were killed is &quot;preposterous&quot;, that there were no gas chambers, where he calls Elie Wiesel a &quot;liar, deceiver, blasphemer&quot;, and repeats all sorts of standard holocaust denier bullshit. He seems to promote all of the standard claims that holocaust deniers make, these are things that have been thoroughly refuted. I don&#39;t know what you think holocaust denial is, but it&#39;s not the claim that there were no concentration camps whatsoever. It&#39;s exactly the kind of nonsense this guy is spouting. </p>

<p>Willfully promoting this hateful, ignorant garbage is not a noble act. I recommend doing some basic research on how flawed the holocaust denier claims are. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Holocaust_denial">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Holocaust_denial</a></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You posted a link to a video promoting some pretty blatantly anti-Semitic rhetoric.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I didn&#39;t.  You see, that&#39;s where the &quot;lets step back shall we?&quot; gets shown to be total, obvious b.s.  You&#39;re only stating it&#39;s &quot;anti semitic&quot; because, like almost everyone of your ilk, you simply have a knee jerk reaction against anything that is justifiably critical of Zionism.  Grow up.  That&#39;s not &quot;stepping back&quot;.  That&#39;s using the exact same&#39;ol M.O. that is used by those that, whether you even know it or not, you are representing to a tee here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I pointed this out, and you called me &quot;closed, scared, frightened, bigoted, and racist&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you, in fact, DIDN&#39;T point it out.  You pointed out nothing but what I just mentioned above here.  Nothing else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I know you are but what am I&quot; is a response children use when someone insults them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  And it&#39;s something you tried to pin on what I was saying that simply didn&#39;t apply or stick.  I said what I said, and what I said was valid.  Your mentioning the whole &quot;I know you are but what am I&quot; b.s. doesn&#39;t in any way apply.  That&#39;s just the simple truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t see how any reasonable person would thing [sic] that criticizing anti-Semitism is bigoted or racist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being a bigot toward ANY race is - by definition - racist.  Criticizing anti semitism isn&#39;t the same thing here, however.  There is absolutely nothing anti semitic about what I&#39;ve done up to this point.  The fact that this is the basis of your ENTIRE argument really just shows how desperate you are to continue being an uncritical thinker hoping that others are just as uncritical and don&#39;t bother to realize that you&#39;ve been employing a flimsy straw man fallacy this entire time (along with using ad hominems since &quot;anti semite&quot; has become such a catch phrase &quot;bad word&quot;).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So it really just seems like you were just lashing back with the same accusations I made against you, even if it made no sense whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, incorrect.  We&#39;ve been talking about pretty different things thus far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure you came to perceive that as an &quot;obscure riddle&quot;, but whatever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t bother to even entertain any wannabe attempt by you or anyone to try to be &quot;cute&quot; by making some sort of stupid &quot;obscure riddle&quot;.  I&#39;m a straight shooter.  Say what you have to say.  If you think you need to be cute or cheeky to say it, then obviously the information isn&#39;t important enough to stand on its own merit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, it definitely is holocaust denial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  No it&#39;s definitely NOT.  But okay.  Meh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Somehow I doubt you&#39;re all that familiar with the topic of holocaust denial and revisionism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, again, as you&#39;ve continued to show all throughout this useless conversation, you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blaming the Jews for the holocaust is a typical part of the denial movement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I presented is all about facts and information and data.  The information EXISTS.  If you want to call that information &quot;blaming the Jews themselves for the holocaust&quot;, then whatever.  If that&#39;s how you want to see it, then so be it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve stated already that there is a difference between the &quot;common&quot; Jews, and the racists, elitist Zionists Jews.  You are making a HORRIBLE, horrible mistake in damning your very own people by actually EQUATING the common Jews and the racists Zionist group that was responsible for killing the common Jews and the things I talked about in the OP.  What the fuck are you doing?  You&#39;re like...burning yourself at <em>your own</em> stake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as a side note, accusing anti-racists of being &quot;the real racists&quot; is also a common tactic used by white supremacists and the like</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re even attempting to do with this statement because I don&#39;t even know who you&#39;re referring to as being the &quot;anti racists&quot; here.  Anyway.  Moving on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just Google &quot;Jim Condit Jr&quot;, the guy being interviewed in your link. He&#39;s well known as being involved in the holocaust denial, anti-Semitism scene.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  And this is supposed to show what exactly?  You&#39;re essentially saying that Condit shouldn&#39;t be payed attention to because some other butt hurt ADL types did the same thing to him that you&#39;re attempting to do to me.  Damn.  That&#39;s just really lol worthy.  Anyone who brings up the information that he brings up is going to get knee-jerk labeled an anti semite by your type, so really it doesn&#39;t actually mean much of anything that Condit was labeled as such because of the information he gave.  The information is still very much valid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s a video of him giving a talk where he claims that the idea that 6,000,000 jews were killed is &quot;preposterous&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  Wiow.  It actually IS preposterous.  The <em>Zionist Jews THEMSELVES</em> admitted that the 6 million number was greatly exaggerated.  Jeez.  Facepalm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that there were no gas chambers, where he calls Elie Wiesel a &quot;liar, deceiver, blasphemer&quot;, and repeats all sorts of standard holocaust denier bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not quite &quot;bullshit&quot; when one realizes that there is a lot more evidence showing that he was right than your type would care to admit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He seems to promote all of the standard claims that holocaust deniers make</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If what he&#39;s mentioned are the &quot;standard claims that holocaust deniers make&quot;...then I guess the standard claims are pretty valid.  Who knew, eh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>these are things that have been thoroughly refuted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they haven&#39;t actually.  Not even a little bit.  They&#39;ve been poo pooed on by ADL types - yes.  Of course.  If anything, they&#39;ve actually been <em>validated</em>, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know what you think holocaust denial is, but it&#39;s not the claim that there were no concentration camps whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it&#39;s not.  There WERE concentration camps.  Condit himself thoroughly acknowledges that in the videos that have already been linked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s exactly the kind of nonsense this guy is spouting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You obviously didn&#39;t actually look at any of the videos themselves, because you would otherwise know that you are at this point AGREEING with the very information Condit himself has already given - going in the face of everything you&#39;ve stated up to this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Willfully promoting this hateful, ignorant garbage is not a noble act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Willfully attempting to twist and contort valid data is a cowardly, blatantly nefarious act.  That&#39;s very much not noble in any way.  I&#39;m certainly not promoting hateful, ignorant garbage, and your attempting to twist the information as being that is what is blatantly cowardly and shameful.  For that, you should be horribly ashamed of yourself.  But that&#39;s the thing though, isn&#39;t it?  Your type actually DON&#39;T feel any shame right?  You&#39;re in the business of being able to lie straight through your teeth with a smile on your face and not think twice about the fact that you&#39;re being deceitful, evil, and lying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recommend doing some basic research on how flawed the holocaust denier claims are.</p>

<p>I recommend growing a spine of truthfulness and honor in your life because you don&#39;t seem to have one at all.</p>

<p>lol. Wiow. It actually IS preposterous. The Zionist Jews THEMSELVES admitted that the 6 million number was greatly exaggerated. Jeez. Facepalm.</p>

<p>What, did the club of official Zionist Jews come out and present a press release? Why the hell wouldn&#39;t you cite a source for this claim? Is it printed in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion II: Electric Jew-ga-loo? Or did you just read about it on some conspiracy website, and assume there&#39;s no reason they&#39;d possibly print something incorrect or out of context?</p>

<p>You should really educate yourself on why certain evidence is credible. The death toll is based on the most credible census data we have, not on what &quot;zionists&quot; say.</p>

<p>Is there any <em>good</em> evidence? David Icke has numerous books filled with &quot;evidence&quot; that the world leaders are all shapeshifting reptilian aliens, that doesn&#39;t mean any of it is any good.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand what I&#39;m saying. It&#39;s that Condit, in the video I posted, is repeating the common, thoroughly debunked claims that holocaust deniers have been spewing for decades.</p>

<p>You&#39;re again demonstrating how black and white the conspiracy nuts tend to see the world. They can&#39;t even comprehend the idea that someone might disagree with them about something, they have to turn them into some evil, conspiring liar in order to wrap their heads around them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you believe the things you&#39;re promoting here, I just seriously doubt you&#39;ve done any actual research. To you, research means sitting through long youtube videos where people tell you things that match your conceptions about the world. Actually learning about the history of Zionism, jews in Europe, the holocaust from reliable, academic sources? Boooooring! That doesn&#39;t give you anything to foster your sense of righteous indignation.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, you&#39;re totally railing against the evil Zionist boogeymen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just a stupid statement.  What you&#39;re trying to do is trying to make it seem like I&#39;m some &quot;anti Jew&quot; type.  Sorry.  That won&#39;t work.  I&#39;m anti racist manipulator.  Is every Jew such?  I would say no.  It would seem most Zionists are, however - especially the ones in question here.  So yeah.  I am indeed railing against Zionists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are plenty of people out there who agree that Israel&#39;s behaviour has been atrocious on many different levels without buying into crazy theories about Jewish leaders secretly controlling the world and fabricating the holocaust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See what you keep doing there?  You keep using ad hominem adjectives to try to convince yourself that what&#39;s being discussed is not valid.  That&#39;s, again, a sign of great, great mental deficiency.  Regardless - and yet ANOTHER logical fail on your part regarding this above-made statement - it simply doesn&#39;t matter if others haven&#39;t taken the extra step of finding out exactly <em>why</em> the evil in Israel (and the world) has been perpetuated and by who.  It doesn&#39;t keep the evidence showing that it was perpetuated by Zionists from being any more valid.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Being a bigot toward ANY race is - by definition - racist. Criticizing anti semitism isn&#39;t the same thing here, however.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, yeah... what&#39;s your point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point is that you don&#39;t even realize that anti semitism hasn&#39;t occurred and isn&#39;t even the issue here.  You would, of course, LIKE it to be the issue - and you&#39;re trying as hard as you can to make it such - because then you can pull out your little &quot;anti semite!&quot; card out, but it simply doesn&#39;t stick and isn&#39;t working.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the hell do you think holocaust denial is? Do you even think it actually exists? Are you a holocaust-denial-denier?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although holocaust denial does exists, what exists even MORE is holocaust exaggeration.  It&#39;s a tug of war, and I&#39;d say that the holocaust exaggerators are <em>definitely</em> winning - especially with an army of puppets like you running about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ah, so you only hate a silly caricature of powerful Jews, therefore you&#39;re in no way a bigot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you do is so obviously transparent that it&#39;s pitiful that you try to pass it off as anything but.  You downplay and minimize the real issues of zionist manipulation while exaggerating issues that aren&#39;t even being denied.  It&#39;s almost as humorous as it is pitiful really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did I say I was Jewish?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>...Couldn&#39;t quite get through any more of what you bla bla blahed about.  I&#39;ll go ahead and let you have the last word since I know that&#39;s what your type pats itself on the back and lets itself feel good about.  It&#39;s what your type thrive off of.  It&#39;s pitiful, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>Oh well.  It&#39;s okay.  There are children playing games on this tiny planet.  I&#39;ll let them keep playing them.</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would seem that the Jewish Zionists have been working for World domination for about 100 years now. This is why all the nonsense about the Holocaust. The reason for the &quot;Six Million&quot; magic number (which is wrong, by the way) is because it is part of the indoctrination to further this world domination. Why else would the Jews imprison people (via Laws in Germany and Canada among other places) for challenging it ? Only a lie needs penalty of law to enforce it. The Jewish Zionists wanted the Jews to go to Palestine in order to occupy and conquer it. In 1948 that is just what happened. Palestine was invaded and then pronounced to be &quot;Israel&quot;, which even today <em>still</em> has not finalized the border. Notice the mention of, among others, the name Rothschild. This is the family that is behind all of this, even today. They brought about the Federal Reserve Bank in order to control the US. The US is being <em>suckered</em> into being the enforcement arm of the Jewish Zionists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know your post to be true--but you may want to put the reason for the &quot;6 million&quot; nonsense into perspective. Do you have that link that shows how that &quot;magic number&quot; was used literally about 50 times before WWII ever <em>happened?</em></p>

<p>My long-dead grandpop, a &quot;holocaust survivor,&quot; was very vocal in the fact (according to him) that there were NO gas chambers (where he was at least). He always told me that the number of dead didn&#39;t exceed 200,000 as Hitler badly needed the Jews for labor purposes. He was angry--he said that when WWII was happening that the Jews in other countries &quot;didn&#39;t want us&quot; and now there is a lot of evidence to back that up (read Chaim Weitzmann for one). If you read up on it you&#39;ll see that Zionists, American and otherwise, worked hand-in-glove with the Nazis all throughout the war. They profited IMMENSELY on the backs of their own people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I think that its important that people realize that the &quot;six million&quot; number exists for a number of reasons--foremost among them being fulfilling biblical prophecy--and is in no way fixed in reality. Nearly every Jew that I&#39;ve ever met confirms this. Hell, growing up my favorite rabbi (also my grandpop&#39;s best friend) said that the number was, in his opinion, a farce.</p>

<p>I think that my grandfather was pretty correct. Germany&#39;s records show, I believe, somewhere in the neighborhood of 200,000 killed...which is a terrible, horrible crime. It certainly reflects reality more than the propagandized number.</p>

<p>Protocols Decision Washed Out
Press and Radio Silent on Appeal Finding</p>

<p>Great publicity was given throughout the world in 1935 to a decision in the Swiss Courts that the documents known as &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot; were a forgery; that the [jewish] judge had described the contents as &quot;ridiculous nonsense&quot;; and that the Protocols had been condemned as an offence against public morals.</p>

<p>Even in remote New Zealand numerous newspapers at that time published long articles on what they termed an &quot;Historic Forgery&quot;; and addresses were similarly given over the radio system proclaiming loudly that the Protocols had been shown to be baseless.</p>

<p>We are now at the end of February, 1938, but the writer can recall nothing in the daily papers, and he has heard nothing over the radio system, telling him that the Protocols verdict given on May 14, 1935, was reversed by the Berne Court of Appeal on November 1 last.</p>

<p>When the decision went one way it was news fit for all the world to hear: a subject for special articles and radio broadcasts. When it went the other way it ceased to be news at all.</p>

<p>The Protocols were a hoax by the Tsar&#39;s secret police. This is such a widely known fact that it&#39;s actually pretty impressive that you&#39;re still ignorant of it. They were originally published in a newspaper owned by a right-wing Russian nationalist. You have to be pretty gullible to think they&#39;re real. If a right-wing European newspaper published an alleged set of diabolical plans by a global Muslim conspiracy, anyone who just believed them would be a complete idiot. Same goes for this. Nobody with even the most basic critical thinking skills can possibly believe a hoax that obvious.</p>
