       The subscriber numbers for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       look impressive, at 177,764, yet the number of people voting and commenting on articles is pitiful by comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's amusing to contemplate the idea that a malevolent state has set up reddit as a way to channel the vital energies of a disaffected minority away from any effective action in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say that the true numbers of people reading
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is 17,776, or even 1,777 ... how would anyone know, based upon the people voting, posting and commenting here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any external evidence that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is having any effect on the real world whatsoever?

       It's a known fact that the government has a hand in reddit. I'm only on my mobile but I recall see multiple time here that the most reddit addicted city on the planet is a Air Force base in Florida. I highly doubt a Air Force base has a higher view count than any city without a specific purpose.

       Based on the number of subscribers and by that rule, we'd expect to see 17,000 people adding content to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , which is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, we'd expect to see more, becuase the number of subscribers is reputedly a fraction of the number of unregistered viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what you say is true, then your rule is more like a 99.99-00.01 rule, which seems a bit extreme to me.

       Don't be fooled by the number subscribed meaning that's how many actual individuals there are either. One of the subscribers here on this sub admitted once to owning around
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1fh0ge/bilderberg_has_press_thrown_out_of_hotel/caahyrv">
        70 separate sock-puppet accounts

       that were "mysteriously shadow-banned" all at once.

       "the 1% rule or the 90–9–1 principle (sometimes also presented as 89:10:1 ratio)[1] is a rule of thumb pertaining to participation in an internet community. According to this principle, 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content. Specifically, this rule applies to collaborative websites such as YouTube or Wikipedia. The 1% rule refers to forums, in which everyone must be a content creator. In this context, only 1% of the users of a forum actively create new posts and the other 99% of the participants only lurk."

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       achieves about 100 comments per hour, and many of these comments would be from the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be fair to say that from this number, the total number of participants is likely to be ~1,000 people in a time period of a week or so.
      </p>

       That would indicate that the total readership would be close to 100,000.

       Reddit used to have such things, but they were used for nefarious purposes, such as for finding top top submitters and voting them into oblivion.

       Yes, but how many people created accounts then ditched them and created new ones or left the site? There are tons of variables.  What if a majority of that mass only frequent this subreddit during elections, times of scandals or international incidents. I for one used to visit daily then stopped viewing for about two years. I came back because this is one of the very limited places where I can find news that hasn't been either ignored/censored by the MSM, or completely spun to fit the agenda of tptb.

       Are you a frequent user of every single sub you're subbed to? I'm subbed to about 60 different subreddits, but I only regularly view about 10 of them, and vote/comment in fewer.

       It is a tool to manipulate your beliefs and perception.  Peer pressure is the most powerful tool to control what you think and believe to be the truth. There are submissions and comments placed here by special interest that attack free thought. Terms like conspiritards and tin foil hats are their tools to intimidate and manipulate. Polls and statistics are cherry picked to keep everyone on the same page. Back up and look at the big picture. Where is all of this coming from and where is it all going? Who benefits and who will suffer? Why would a person say what they are saying; to what end? If you were the government, what would be the ideal tool to control what people say, believe and think? I think this is it.

       Yet when you have seen these terms on reddit for years, it becomes pretty obvious what is going on.

       There's so much bullshit on reddit that it helps hone those filters.

       I for one lurk a lot. I comment every once in a while but mostly I don't deem it necessary. 
To make you feel a bit more comfortable, I use bacon reader and conspiracy is my home page. Best subreddit.

       I can follow you in your theory, if it was only for the persona management software these agencies seem to have.

       Yeah, I don't ever comment on this subreddit because I usually don't feel knowledgable enough on the subject matter to make a point worthy of posting.

       But for some reason I seem to trust this place more than I do the mainstream media right now, so I'm subscribed.

       All if the above, lol. Reddit is way more effective than Alex Jones or the news on those populations who view those sources as controlled opposition.

       And then there is the heavy hand of the moderators an Eglin Air Force base.
