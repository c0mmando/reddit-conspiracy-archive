        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They just had a &quot;town hall&quot; type discussion group with a studio audience that were given the opportunity to ask questions. The whole thing heavily reinforced the fact that a majority of the public is against Syrian intervention, and plenty of time was given to many great reasons why we shouldn&#39;t go to war. One woman in the audience asked what gave the U.S the right after using napalm and white phosphorous ourselves in Iraq. There was a Syrian couple that supported Assad, and a few other people who agreed we shouldn&#39;t be getting involved with their civil war regardless of our &quot;red line&quot; policy. I was pleasantly surprised by it all.</p>

<p>It appears that a decent amount of House representatives are actually <em>listening</em> to their constituents (everyone is talking about how 99% of the calls they receive are anti-war). I&#39;m actually beginning to think the public has a chance of beating the military-industrial complex here, as they did recently in British Parliament. Am I being overly optimistic? You guys still think this is a virtual certainty at this point?</p>

<p>Of course, as I type this, McCain is on with Anderson Cooper talking about why we <em>should</em> get involved...</p>

I speak with &quot;regular&quot; people all the time many of whom are flag waving apple pie and baseball types and they&#39;re unanimous in their utter contempt not only for the Syria issue, but for the bottom feeding propaganda purveyors that call themselves &quot;news&quot; </p>

<p>I really think they overplayed their hand here. Obama needs to retreat and go lame duck while we shift the narrative back to the shitfucking NSA wiping their ass with the constitution and the bill of rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure the false flag theory of the nuke in SC, or <a href="http://www.thesleuthjournal.com/fema-preparing-major-event-region-iii/#">an Influenza H7N9 outbreak in region III</a> are credible. </p>

<p>My personal concern is a series of cyber attacks in the late fall / early winter that will shut down commerce and be the smoke screen for economic collapse.  &quot;They&quot; blame the attacks on Syrian Electronic Army and away we go to war.</p>
