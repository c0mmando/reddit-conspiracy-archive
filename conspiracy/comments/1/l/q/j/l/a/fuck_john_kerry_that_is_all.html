       I don't have anywhere else to post this, and it is something I find myself increasingly unable to contain:
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck that war-mongering, cock-sucking, lying piece of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether he is using the images of murdered children to drum up an emotion response to support more murder,
      </p>
      <p>
       or making claims of some incredible evidence that of course can not be revealed to anyone other than him,
      </p>
      <p>
       or blatantly twisting words like some Orwellian oligarch, claiming that "The President isn't asking to go to war, he's asking to preform an operation,"
      </p>
      <p>
       or putting on his port of false reluctance, telling us that no one WANTS to go to war, but we HAVE to,
      </p>
      <p>
       Or hell, when he straight-up tells us that the point of getting involved is to protect Israel, and that the sentiments of the American People just doesn't matter in this circumstance,
      </p>
      <p>
       I get this gut-wrenching, sickening feeling of rage that such a cowardly, conniving, EVIL sack of shit is allowed to spew his vitriol over mass media and not be called out for being the zionist lap-dog he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is entirely obvious that he should be impeached, having proven that he does not have the ability to perform his sworn function of Secretary of Defense when the totality of his energy is expended on trying to convince the American people to adopt an OFFENSIVE strategy that we unambiguously do not support.
      </p>
      <p>
       THANK GOD for Rand Paul.  (Seriously, thank God.  Without Dr. Paul, there would be NO ONE actually standing up for the peaceful.)
      </p>
      <p>
       PS
Fuck John McCain.

       Wait, I thought Libya was the "kinetic action" while 9/11 was
       <strong>
        The Worst Day Since Pearl Habor!!! NEVER FORGET!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Iraq was "nation building" while Afghanistan was the "nation building lite".
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything in the 90's was a "humanitarian action" though while I started my service then I could never figure out how high speed 5.56mm rounds and Tomahawk missiles were "humanitarian".
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 80's we had "proxy warfare" since Americans were notably shy about military actions after the 1970's series of "combating the spread of Communism" and the preceding "police actions" before it.

       Yeah, I'd like to know his rubric for this "not war." Is he thinking "it won't be a war because they can't hurt us from there"? It was kind of amazing to see an argument of (paraphrased) "we're not asking to go to war. We agree, war would be bad. But I'm sure you all agree we need to use our military to punish him, right?"

       Don't forget - Congress ok'd the evidence last time to go to Iraq. They cannot be relied on to make the right decision on this matter, of all matters. John Kerry is another shady guy put into a position to say yes to this and no to that. It's illogical to put any amount of trust into pathological liars and people who often display corruptive streaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really gets me though is how people are willing to look at this and base their decision
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       in the context of this specific conflict. The US has a long (and admitted) past of lying to go to war and using falsified evidence to make the case. The people aren't buying it this time by in large but that doesn't matter anyway.

       I wouldn't sweat it. Communication is the transmission of ideas. If the idea is transmitted then the communication is successful. Since the idea was transmitted I count it as a successful communication. The rest, in my mind, is detail work. The idea is what's important.

       I think it's hilarious that Hilary (the next democratic nominee) stepped down right before this shit happens. They knew what was needed from the SoS in order to start the next war and they knew that it would make that person unelectable. And they couldn't give up Hilary because without pandering to the nation's infatuation with the first (insert non white male adjective) president there is no way a Democrat will follow Obama. At least that's how I'm gonna call it.

        General Wesley Clark: Wars Were Planned - Seven Countries In Five Years
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, "Sir, you've got to come in and talk to me a second." I said, "Well, you're too busy." He said, "No, no." He says, "We've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq." This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, "We're going to war with Iraq? Why?" He said, "I don't know." He said, "I guess they don't know what else to do." So I said, "Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?" He said, "No, no." He says, "There's nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq." He said, "I guess it's like we don't know what to do about terrorists, but we've got a good military and we can take down governments." And he said, "I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail."
      </p>
      <p>
       So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, "Are we still going to war with Iraq?" And he said, "Oh, it's worse than that." He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, "I just got this down from upstairs" -- meaning the Secretary of Defense's office -- "today." And he said, "This is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran." I said, "Is it classified?" He said, "Yes, sir." I said, "Well, don't show it to me." And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, "You remember that?" He said, "Sir, I didn't show you that memo! I didn't show it to you!"

       So I am to trust him based on his military service and rank? I've read some about him, he seems like a reasonable person, but I can't just pick and choose who in the military I place full, unconditional trust in, especially when they are making such seemingly unlikely claims. Also, he basically said "they plan to go to war with some of the most unstable countries on earth, most of which we have had past conflict with". Besides that, its been over twice as long as the supposed timeframe given.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there are some pretty convincing coincidence here. No, I'm not saying outright that this is absolutely not true. But for me, I need some actual evidence before I am able to believe this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the link though, it was an interesting read and I will be sure to look deeper into it myself.

       I hear you and I have my reservations as well, but those reservations become smaller and smaller as the years go on. Why would he lie about it? (I'm sure there are plenty of good reasons, however I can't think of any that make more sense than his desire to tell the world)

       Why would he lie? Its his personal goal to make $40 million dollars, maybe he wanted to be able to get some people to notice him, some fame, to sell a book or something? Maybe he wanted to be seen as a very honest person to help with his long time goal of becoming president, or maybe he is still very, very loyal to the military industrial complex and he said these things to get conspiracy theorists riled up about yet another false theory, which would help distract them from the things the government is doing that actually have evidence to back it up. Or maybe he's just fucking crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe he is telling the truth. I don't know, but there are a lot of things that are more "likely" than this being true. And, are you saying you always believe the most likely version of events? Because of so,

       Believing and exploring are totally different and to be honest I think a lot of conspiracies make more sense than the official story. What I think is more likely is entirely relative to me, so this is the perfect place for me. You understand that you just created 4 different conspiracies, right (one of which is based on an episode of south park). The difference between you and me is that you are pulling facts out of your ass to discredit a man that has no history of dishonesty and I have been carefully applying his statements to the actions of our government since he presented this information. I didn't say he was right I simply said that he has been right so far.

       I didn't "create four conspiracies". I simply gave examples of what could be going on here that have just as much evidence as what this man claims (none). Yes, the government does shady shit every day, probably worse than planning 7 wars in advance, but I am not going to believe any conspiracy theories without evidence.

       You didn't ask whether you were to trust him, you asked how credible he was.  Given that he actually was a higher up in the Pentagon for a period of time, then yes it makes him a credible source because he would be more capable of being 'in the know'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could he be lying?  There's a 50/50 chance that what anyone says is a lie.  Though, his background lends more credence to his claims, as opposed to the average, anonymous reddit poster.

       Like I said, coincidence. And its easy to name off a few very, very unstable countries in the order in which a
       <em>
        very experienced military leader
       </em>
       might think they will become aggressive. Why did he wait so long to come out with this, and why hasn't he made a much larger push to make it publicly known? This would be absolutely groundbreaking if true.

       Predict - say or estimate that (a specified thing) will happen in the future or will be a consequence of something. 
The - denoting one or more people or things already mentioned or assumed to be common knowledge. 
Future - the time or a period of time following the moment of speaking or writing; time regarded as still to come.

       The burden of proof is on you (and him) to provide the evidence for your claims, not me for rejecting those claims. I don't
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that they are guesses, only that
       <em>
        there is no evidence whatsoever to substantiate what he is saying,
       </em>
       which leads me to conclude that it is more likely to be an educated guess
       <em>
        made by someone who had intricate knowledge of the regions and the levels of stability and trends happening within those regions

       , than it is to be true.

       Again. Just one more time. The only thing I have stated with one hundred percent certainty is that this not one of this man claim's have been proven wrong while several have been proven right. This leads me to lean towards the idea that he is telling the truth. I believe I said (maybe not to you) that I was extremely skeptical when I first heard this but over the years may of my reservations have subsided as he continues to be right. I posted this to reddit several days ago
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1lol7h/its_starting_to_get_hard_to_say_this_guy_is_wrong/">

       . Note the title. Believe what you want I have only ever shared my assumptions and corrected your incorrect statements. But your argument is almost Identical to that of creationist. You don't care about the fact that evidence contrary to your beliefs are are piling up, only that there is no definitive proof. Also just for educational purposes if you call a man I lair (definitively) you too assume the burden of proof. And while my evidence is some what weak it does support my claim (regardless of the extent to which it does so). You are making assumptions based on nothing but your personal world views. If I said that the rolling stones were going to do a reunion tour and then told you the order of the cities they would play in and later that year everything I said came to fruition, Would you then assume I was guessing or that I was given information from someone involved in the scheduling process. I think there is a right answer to this question.

       And what future did he accurately predict exactly? Iraq, then
       <del>
        Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Somalia

       and
       <del>
        Sudan

       . We've only been to war with 1 of these 7 countries, 8 years past his timeline. Libya wasn't a war, a no fly zone and air support does not a war make. So he's one for 7, 8 years overdue and you're still touting him around like some kind of messiah. I think you may need to check the definition of "predicted" because you need to actually be right to have a successful prediction. Even if you want to count Libya on a technicality hes still 2 for 7 and still 8 years late. That's a total failure as far as predictions go.

       Libya wasn't a war and Syria hasn't happened yet. It doesn't matter anyways its 8 year's and at a minimum 4 countries off so it's a failed prediction regardless of how you want to twist it.

       You're right Libya was not a war. We simply dismantled there government through subterfuge and set them back about 150 years in terms of policy and technology. Furthermore, if you can't see the writing on the wall when it comes to Syria you aren't paying attention. Obama is all but saying the decision is made to use limited attacks on Assad regime targets. If this guy is in fact unstable enough to gas his on citizens I don't think he will think twice about retaliating. Obama is not going to start a war with Syria he is going to force the to declare war on us. In terms of predicting the future I'd say he has done a pretty good job.

       Lol way to move the goal post. They don't follow a timeline because there is no timeline to follow. You're seriously trying to prop up some bullshit story a retired general who was losing his relevance spouted out in an interview with absolutely zero evidence aside from his word. The government isn't some all powerful omnipresent god. It's a system made up of men and women who tend to be so incompetent they can't even do basic math at times. How would Syria even retaliate against us? You do realize our military would crush the Syrian army correct? Just because Assad is whacked enough to gas his own citizens doesn't mean he has the balls to stand up to a real army. I mean come on you're comparing slaughtering civilians to retaliating against the most well equipped military on the planet. When cowards and bullies are confronted by someone larger they tend to back down or get beat down.

       Nobody's trying to convince you of anything. But god forbid we actually stand up to a murderous regime that likes to kill their own citizens including women and children. And I'm not just talking about the sarin alone. Those fuckers have been shelling and strafing residential areas for over a year. They need someone with equal or greater firepower to put their dick in the dirt instead of letting them get away with heinous acts, especially intentionally killing their own child citizens. They are doing this shit intentionally to try and goad a response out of us, and they're pushing too far and we're going to push back lest we be backed into a corner.

       That's for sure, and it seems like 10 years ago we would have never seen commentary like this unless we had politically minded friends, and even so it could take weeks for the idea to spread without the media (the war would have already started by then).  This post has already been seen by at least 600 people in 6 hours (perhaps more like 6000 people based on typical votes/views ratios).

       Yeah, pretty much. We need a "Western Spring", placards and slogans on saturday and then returning to work on monday is safe and innefective, and basically there is a reason that is the accepted way you "protest", come out, have your voice, yes yes we hear you ok we will listen and perhaps try to change, the minute your attention drops again they pull the same shit again.

       And then in ten years or so it will come out in an "official", "reputable" source exactly what we are all saying now.  And no one will care because hey, that war happened ten years ago, and anyway we have a new war now to worry about, which is three wars down the line from Syria, and this one is actually really about justice, unlike the last twenty or thirty wars.

       Rand Paul is as pro-Israel as his peers, don't forget that

        <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/347151/rand-paul-and-israel">
         If there’s any doubt that Rand Paul isn’t his father’s son on the issue of Israel, that trip and his posture afterwards should have ended it. He returned to the U.S. to tell Breitbart News, “Absolutely we stand with Israel. What I think we should do is announce to the world — and I think it is pretty well known — that any attack on Israel will be treated as an attack on the United States.”

       Of what variety, in your opinion? It seems to me that the safest bet for following through on things would be the person who disregards the establishment and calls out anyone and everyone overstepping their bounds. I don't know how exactly a politician can demonstrate integrity short of doing it, so we'll be keeping a close eye on him.

       I honestly used to like the guy.  Heard him talk to a room full of soldiers.  He didn't kiss ass or talk in circles.  When soldiers asked Stupid Soldier Questions, he gave them a blunt answer.  Looked him in the eye and shook his hand.  I felt like he was one of the good guys.

       I don't know what to think now.  It definitely makes me think that once you hit the upper levels of the executive branch, you lose your fucking mind.

       I know that there are a bunch of comments here, but hopefully someone sees this, John Jerry protested the American involvement in the Vietnam war after serving there. How this guy can be at the forefront of this campaign to attack another country just goes to show how full of shit he is.

       As your Canadian neighbor, I hope the good people of the USA stand and scream long and hard until the powers that be can't possibly ignore it any more.  Sadly, most people I know believe that the majority of US citizens have still not woken up to the blatant corruption in your government.  (ours is just as bad btw)

       This Syria shit is once again proving that Democrat or Republican, they are all the same.   It's necessary and warranted when their party is in power, and the opposite when it's the other party.  We just need to stay out of this civil war.  I'm sick of hearing McCain talk about the 'rebels' (AQ) as if they would be any better at running Syria.

       Last night I was told that my 4 year old would have to spend an hour each way on the bus to school  because federal budget cuts (sequestration) had reduced the school from 5 buses down to 4.  Also the school year would be a week shorter.  All I could think is, "but they want to go to war in Syria.  What will that cost?"  And also "Fuck John Kerry"

       It makes me wonder if he ever looks at himself in the mirror and is actually aware of how full of shit he is. I have to think he has lied to himself enough he believes the company line he's spewing, but I really just wonder if he has ever had that moment of clarity where he realizes just how much of a caricature of a human being he's become.

       I want to tell John McCain he has to raise his hand before speaking. I respect the man as a Veteran and POW, but that man should shut the fuck up and retire. Maybe he and Lindsay Graham can go camping together.

       This is exactly my thoughts on John McCain. That old, hypocritical, war mongering sack of yesterdays dog shit. What really got me is how up in fucking arms he is/was over Benghazi.  I mean you just a few years ago endorsed a false war with made up evidence (Iraq W.M.D.'s) and when questioned about it after the fact you basically say "shit happened" then Benghazi happens and everyday you are sitting there in your waste of space with you stupidity demanding that Obama tell everyone exactly what happened. You can't have it both ways. I feel like this Syrian situation is fucking Iraq all over again. The false flag (9.11, now this chemical weapon attack), the twisted way the media is trying to drum up "support" and suppressing any of the real information.  I would like to think we as a people won't fall for it again, but everyday it seems more and more like resistance is futile.

       you know Rand Paul has said he was misinterpreted by the media about filibustering military action, right?

       I don't have much faith in referencing how evil or bad people are, until  there are facts and figures to fully back it up. This doesn't just go for JK, but also for Rand  Paul, too.

       I have heard arguments from both sides. Mostly against attacking Syria. I personally don't see the merit in striking them because it does nothing for America, only Israel. I can't say however that I am right because I don't have all of the information and I'm literally no expert on this. It seems however that it depends on whether you believe Assad was clearly winning the war. Some people don't think he is, even though that's popular opinion. I think everyone is sick of the atrocities carried out by any state. I would advise to be wary of anyone in govt even Rand Paul. Remember Obama said what we wanted to hear too until he got in the seat.

       So...it took you this long to realize that John Kerry is an unprincipled, opportunistic scumbag?  In any case, welcome to the club.  Better late than never.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a conservative, and I despise Kerry for entirely different reasons than you obviously do.  But it says something that both people of the Left and of the the Right can instinctively loathe him.

       Was ranting today about this; that I didn't have high expectations about this guy, but that while my expectations were not high, he can't possibly be as stupid as he comes off. I don't know anyone as stupid and disingenuous as he came off yesterday and today, and I know a few stupid, disingenuous people. And these guys can't actually think we're as stupid as he and Hegel and Dempsey appear to think we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brought me to - is someone holding our feet to the fire with another 9/11-type threat? If we don't do what they want now, we're going to get hit by some kind of badness some country tries to play off as Syrian terrorism? And that kind of badness will finally get the American people's heart into the World War Threeing. The thinking may be that if the US gets strikes in before this happens, maybe there's a chance the US can control it. Wish they'd tell us the damned truth, though. I can't help but think that if this
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a part of the backstory, blowing it open would take some of the sting out. Treating the American people like IQ level 10 isn't going to build a united front.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the Congressmen today asked Hegel, "What do I tell my constituents about why we're doing this? They're all against it!" and Hegel said, "9/11" -- which sounds stupid, right? But it's possible that this was the most honest moment of the last two days of testimony.

       I would say yes.  Watch for it.  If Congress does not approve the attack on Syria, then we could have a false flag-type repeat of 9/11, Boston, who knows -- probably a chemical attack.  They clearly want to go after Syria, and a direct attack on the US allows the Presedent to go to war without Congressional approval.  Without a direct threat, people are skeptical, but an attack on the US would bring everyone onside.  So far, even having the "Arabs" promise to pay for this fiasco has not motivated Americans to want to go after Assad.

       Kerry made the comment to Paul during the session about the 2-3 Vietnam vets in attendance that "knew what war was" and "what it takes" I about lost it.. Kerry denounced the war in Vietnam and even threw his medals over the fence of the white house. I guess things change when you get put on the payroll. Douche.

       Totally correct.  People still vilifying the right (or the left) need to recognize that in the upper echelons of both parties they are playing the same game and serving the same interests (e.g. banks, MIC, Bilderbergers, etc.)  The routine pitting of Dems against Repulicans is all for show.  One qualifier -- Romney may not have been part of this cabal, as he was independently wealthy and did not need to be bought -- also, Republicans didn't really like him.  Two good things in my books.

       The democrats are trying to steal monetary support from the Mic and AIPAC that normally goes to the republicans by becoming the new sheriff in town.  He has become just another tool for the oligarchs and I am left totally unsurprised.  On a brighter note, I now feel less bad that Bush won in '04 over this turd.

       Yes it is sickening how money corrupts people.  I have not given up that idea that this country can be a shining city more than it is.  It is up to we the people to not give DC a second to crawl back under their rocks with the ticks and leaches on K St.  We are their bosses, not the other way around.

       Awhile back he came to watch the super bowl at my girlfriend's neighbor's place in NH and had a few cars with him which took up the entire street and her driveway, blocking multiple people from getting across the road.  Couldn't expect the police or a tow truck to want to do anything because it was him.  So yeah, fuck him.

       God dammit, man.  This is why the fuck WE AS A PEOPLE need to do this shit ON OUR OWN.  We're talking about "representatives" representing us.  Why?  Why the fuck are we leaving for others tasks that we really and honestly should be doing FOR OURSELVES?

       Okay, just so I know. What the fuck would you do then? I am not approving of the shady ways people go about getting the approval to go to war or what the hell ever. But what is the alternative? The UN will not do shit because 1. Syria is a part of the UN I believe. 2. Russia and China are basically bullying other UN countries to not get involved. So tell me mister smart man. What the fuck would you do if Syria's military/government/whatever the fuck was using gases and whatever the hell else they are using against it's own country? Would you stand by and let this happen? Because if so then that IS giving any other evil ass country a green light to go ahead and do the same damn thing.

      <p>
       So you can go ahead and say fuck John Kerry all you want too. But how about instead of saying fuck John Kerry, you spend YOUR fucking time coming up with a solution.

       IMHO Your rant lost any worth with "zionist lap-dog." Cursing and swearing -- fine, you're upset, I get it and I agree with a lot of what you said. But anything that could be interpreted as racist/derogatory or intended to be so should be avoided. It's incredibly invalidating.

       Serious question, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that guy is flying off the handle on an internet forum, who knows what he might do in the real world. Threatening the Universe is not something to say lightly or to take lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, if the NSA, CIA, ICE, DEA, ATF, FBI, DOD, DHS, and SWAT haven't already kicked in his door, then I want to know why my tax dollars are being wasted for all these MRAPS, ammunition, black helicopters, secret prisons, and extra training they've been doing. What's the point if people can still run their mouth and make generalized threats on the internet? I don't see anyone waving a Free Speech Zone Permit, do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't feel safe. What if this guy sees this comment, then looks through my post history and discovers my name and posts cyberbullying on my facebook or twitter?? What if he sends pizza I didn't order, or wastes all of my toner ink?? I don't have time for that. There should be consequences for every minute thing you do or letter you type.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like if there's going to be so many trolls on the internet shooting up schools and listening to Marilyn Manson and Tupac while hating on jews and Jesus, then there needs to be more Guantanamo Bays and militarized police to deal with the terror they are causing, and we need them now. If only there were a curfew for everyone with enforced data rations, that way people would more wisely choose what they have to say.

       And then in ten years or so it will come out in an "official", "reputable" source exactly what we are all saying now.  And no one will care because hey, that war happened ten years ago, and anyway we have a new war now to worry about, which is three wars down the line from Syria, and this one is actually really about justice, unlike the last twenty or thirty wars.

       You're right Libya was not a war. We simply dismantled there government through subterfuge and set them back about 150 years in terms of policy and technology. Furthermore, if you can't see the writing on the wall when it comes to Syria you aren't paying attention. Obama is all but saying the decision is made to use limited attacks on Assad regime targets. If this guy is in fact unstable enough to gas his on citizens I don't think he will think twice about retaliating. Obama is not going to start a war with Syria he is going to force the to declare war on us. In terms of predicting the future I'd say he has done a pretty good job.
