    <div class="md"><p>Habeas Corpus is one of the foundational principles of our democracy and I&#39;ve never understood why there hasn&#39;t been more uproar from people / the media about the fact that the government has essentially thrown that principle out the window since we began holding people at Guantanamo Bay with no charges and no trials. I assume most people justified it in their minds with the idea that &quot;their just terrorist, so it&#39;s ok&quot;. But it&#39;s really the just like  Martin Niem√∂ller said in his famous poem.</p>

<pre><code>First they came for the communists,
and I didn&#39;t speak out because I wasn&#39;t a communist.

Then they came for the socialists,
and I didn&#39;t speak out because I wasn&#39;t a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I didn&#39;t speak out because I wasn&#39;t a trade unionist.

Then they came for me,
and there was no one left to speak for me.
</code></pre>

<p>Well, before long, they&#39;ll come for anyone they want to shut up or just find aggravating.</p>

The gist of what I said is that the US can now detain American citizens on American soil, indefinitely, without trial, on suspicion of &quot;terror&quot;, a nebulous term which can ultimately be construed as anything the government doesn&#39;t like.</p>

<p>The government in the US is of the people, by the people, and for the people. What that fundamentally means is what <a href="/u/I_do_not_consent">/u/I_do_not_consent</a> referred to - that citizens are subjects of the government, but persons are above the governement - we created it to to be of us and work for us, not to rule us.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;America&quot; began as an experiment with the Colonies becoming independent of Britain.  Britain was ruled by a Queen; a single source of power that was influence by special interests in the Royal Court.</p>

<p>At the beginning, there was a collection of great minds that formed our political system.  Skipping a few hundred years this system has been warped, abused, and re-shaped by special interests to the detriment of society.  The US is now controlled by a single source which maintains the country in a constant state of war.  This allows easier control of the populace.</p>

<p>We went from a system of being controlled by a single source of power, shifted to a brief period of democracy, then reverted back to a single source of power controlled by special interests.</p>
