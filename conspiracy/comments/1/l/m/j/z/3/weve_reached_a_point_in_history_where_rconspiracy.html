    <div class="md"><p>Yes...once upon a time I took what was said on the MSM at face value.  I believed George Bush when he said that the Gulf War was for the benefit of the Kuwaiti people.  I believed CNN when they told me that 9/11 was perpetrated by 19 Arabs with box cutters.  I believed Regan when he told me that the contras were fighting in the interests of freedom and democracy.  I believed my own mother when she told me that JFK was killed by a lone nut.  Then I stopped watching TV, started reading and slowly but painfully I came to see that most of the worldview that had been constructed for me by the media during my formative years was complete horse shit.</p>

<p>Some people believe a cruise missile zig-zagged its course, striking light poles and fire trucks along the way before exploding into the Pentagon. And then a team of black ops scattered airplane parts all over the place to give the illusion it was an airliner. </p>

<p>Some people post a picture of a senator having dinner with a leader of a country in an attempt to convince people that our government is in on a plot to kill civilians of another country.</p>

<p>Some people are not convinced that 20 children were brutally murdered in their elementary school because they never got to see the bodies.  </p>

<p>Because 1) there&#39;s copious amounts of evidence that thermite and nano-thermite were involved and 2) the idea that 2 jets can bring down 3 steel framed sky scrapers is patently insane.  Further, the buildings exploded, they did not collapse.</p>

<p>Pointing out fallacies doesn&#39;t mean somebody is one of &quot;them&quot;, though somebody who pointed out fallacies may be one of &quot;them&quot;.</p>

<p>Though I&#39;d say it&#39;s best not to assume that somebody who pointed a fallacy is one of &quot;them&quot;.</p>

<p>Yes. Yes really.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re splitting hairs here. You&#39;re referring to another matter entirely; the idea that anyone who disagrees with me <em>must</em> be one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t that how most atheists came to their beliefs? It was for me, at least. I could be considered a liberal because of my stance on many issues, but I really don&#39;t call myself one because other things I disagree with. For example, I don&#39;t see GMO food in particular as a threat, I just see a bunch of hype because people don&#39;t like having their food tampered with. I do disagree with the system (Monsanto produce having kill switch genes to prevent more than one generation of produce, for example. Or gene patents), but I think the concept has uses. But if someone were to give me solid evidence that GMO is actually a threat, I would consider it and likely change my stance. Beliefs can be altered, opinions can be changed.</p>

<p>Totally agree. The interesting thing is that republicans always think I&#39;m a democrat and democrats always think I&#39;m a republican. I think this points to a systemic problem where people are taught to conform to a label. Trying to search for differing viewpoints often counteracts this and makes it harder to label you. </p>

<p>Also, much of Bush &amp; Cheney&#39;s families financial interests were tied into military suppliers and contractors. A nearly 10 year war means 10 years of government contracts and resupplies. Between access to these resources (<a href="http://rt.com/business/production-china-rare-metals-402/">of which China owns over 97% of the world&#39;s supply</a>) and the business brought to their own investments, the war in Afghanistan was a no-brainer.</p>

<p>The pipeline is a lesser reason, and isn&#39;t even fully likely to ever come to fruition. It&#39;s just a public pill to swallow, IMO... The rare earth metals and the military contracts are the bigger cause and reward.</p>

<p>Because to capture a weak signal you need a highly directional antenna pointed at the thing transmitting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you think it was very easy to determine if the signal was coming from space?</p>

<p>If the craft is on a trajectory to the moon at a couple thousand km/s, the frequency of any signal it transmits will be doppler shifted to a slightly longer wavelength (lower frequency), and on a return trajectory it will be shifted slightly up. </p>

<p>Antenna direction + doppler shift + orbital mechanics + math = a whole lot of information about where the craft is going.</p>

<p>SIGINT orgs specialize in this sort of thing, and the Russians certainly spent a lot of money on their programs, as evidenced by the beautiful rusting hulks of antennas crazy people climb in youtube videos.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/apollo.html">Not at all unknown</a>. It&#39;s also not technically a satellite once it leaves Earth orbit.</p>

<p>You receive the radio signal with a &quot;radio reciever&quot; and can measure doppler shift from the known (or previously observed) transmit frequency using a &quot;frequency counter&quot;. If you&#39;re fancy, like a Russian SIGINT network, you have a globe-spanning array of &quot;tracking antennas&quot;.

<p>Just to clarify, it is literally rocket science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I&#39;m talking about only uses the physics of radio waves. Doesn&#39;t have anything to do with rockets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why couldn&#39;t the signal bounce off already existing satellites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, there just weren&#39;t that many satellites.</p>

<p>Second, a reflected signal will appear to be originating from the point it&#39;s reflecting off of (this is how radar works). Space agencies have tracked satellite launches since Sputnik; getting something into orbit is very very hard to do without being detected.   </p>

<p>Third, a reflected signal will encode information about the object it&#39;s reflecting off of. At the very least if the reflector is moving at a constant orbital velocity, there won&#39;t be the same doppler shift as from an object moving towards the moon and changing velocity. Phase of the reflected signal will also be affected in a way that doesn&#39;t match a real lunar craft, and would have to be corrected for.</p>

<p>Fourth, you&#39;d need a network of reflectors and ground stations seamlessly handing off the signal from reflector to reflector, because the Earth is rotating and one ground station won&#39;t cut it. Multiple ground stations transmitting means it&#39;s a whole lot more likely an uplink signal will be detected.</p>

<p>Fifth, all your transmitters need to be very stable both in frequency and phase, and need to be synchronized to each other to an accuracy of a few nanoseconds - across the entire world, and accounting for relativistic effects. This was exceedingly nontrivial in 1969.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What equipment was being used by the Russians? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Standard equipment found in any university RF lab. Receivers, frequency counters, steerable antennas. Nothing at all exotic, although I&#39;m sure the SIGINT folks had that too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What flaws are there to be exploited? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not many, that&#39;s why it&#39;s more or less impossible to fake a Moon mission short of sending the whole thing unmanned (probably possible, but also exceedingly nontrivial in 1969). </p>

<p>There are just so many ways for independent parties (like the Russians, who would have <em>loved</em> to discredit a US Moon mission) to verify that it was doing what it said it was doing, the idea of faking it is silly. It&#39;s much more than just building a set and filming some guys in space suits bouncing on wire rigs while bleeping out signals from a satellite in Earth orbit.</p>

<p>Edit: We also did this <em>several times</em>; as with any lie or con, the more you do it the more likely someone will catch you.</p>

<p>You are talking about getting a signal from a rocket right? And tracking said rocket yes? It&#39;s literally rocket science.</p>

<p>But anyway, first, &quot;not that many satellites does not mean no satellites so what&#39;s your point? Either answer the question or say nothing.</p>

<p>Second, who&#39;s saying anything about getting something into orbit without being detected? Wtf are you talking about? You&#39;re jut making my point for me.</p>

<p>Thirdly, what exactly do you think they would be basing that on? All the other manned moon missions? There was a lot to account for as a lot that can be explained away. Radar is not exact even today. It&#39;s not like it is in the movies, ask anyone in the military.</p>

<p>Fourthly, not necessarily. There were in fact relaying messages back and forth from the ground so any signal detection can come from either point. Do you have a source staying exactly what point the Russians were tapping? Didnt think so.</p>

<p>Fifthly,  this is in no way relevent. A wall of meaningless text does not make your point more valid. </p>

<p>Sixth, you still have not answered the question. <strong>What equipment was being used?</strong>. I did not ask for a general vague answer. If scientist is recording their experiment in a journal, they do not say &quot;standard lab equipment&quot;. Be specific or gtfo.</p>

<p>And lastly, how can you possibly know that since you don&#39;t know the answer to the previous question? You are just talking out of your ass.</p>

<p>No. Not at all. Not in a million fucking years. Not in 65 million fucking years.</p>

<p>Is it clear yet?</p>

<p>&#39;Rocket Science&#39;, or more properly &#39;Astronautics&#39;, is the science of getting shit into space while making sure it has enough gas and doesn&#39;t blow up. [I dumbed that down a lot.]</p>

<p>Putting a radio transmitter on a rocket does not magically make it switch disciplines from electromagnetics to astronautics. It still looks like a radio and quacks like a radio. Its signals still obey all the physics that apply to radio, and I can still derive a whole lot of information about the movement of the rocket based on the signals from the radio attached to it.</p>

<p>You are not qualified to discuss this in a rational manner if you are incapable of making this simple distinction. </p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li><p>Doesn&#39;t disprove the moon landing. Nixon could be as bent as a roundabout, but that bears no evidence to whether the moon landing occurred. </p></li>
<li><p>You need to elaborate. Sure, the US was in a space race with the USSR, so the US needed to conquer the USSR... But i&#39;m not sure what else to make of this point. </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m Australian, your abbreviations are foreign to me. I get it, what a shitty response to not know what abbreviation you&#39;re referring to, but this is Reddit and we&#39;re all faggots anyway. What&#39;s MIC? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.abbreviations.com/MIC">I tried looking up every possible thing I could about that</a>, but alas, I failed. </p></li>
<li><p>This does not disprove the moon landing. It proves the importance of the moon landing, but fails to disprove it. </p></li>
<li><p>If US gullibility were a concern, then this would surely be combated by the US&#39;s enemy, the USSR. You&#39;d think that the USSR would pounce on the opportunity to show that the US never went to the moon... </p>

<p>What you don&#39;t seem to realise is that when the yanks sent the shuttle to the moon, the USSR were monitoring the shuttle&#39;s progress. If they found that the shuttle didn&#39;t visit the moon, they would&#39;ve blown a load and spoofed all over the world with that revelation, immediately disproving the yanks ever went to the moon. Thus landing a proverbial nuclear uppercut to the world against the US.  </p></li>
<li><p>Again, this doesn&#39;t prove whether or not the US went to the moon. It simply doesn&#39;t. I hate short comments, but that&#39;s all there is to it. What&#39;s to say they really went to the moon to provide a credible distraction? - Either way, they went to the moon. </p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;re so vague I slapped a fly. Okay, you provided no proof of this - But hey, so what? Lets say the NASA employed the most racist of motherfuckers... How does this disprove the moon landing? </p></li>

<p>By the way, I asked for five or fewer, you provided seven. </p>

<p>as to the video&#39;s explanation. I know something he doesn&#39;t; how long the military holds onto technology before they admit to it. his facts are not really facts just information the military released. information is controlled by those in power. They don&#39;t have your best interest at heart. they have theirs. everything is bull shit. you are making naive assumptions as to the veracity of information you get. </p>

<p>we are cattle to be corralled by the magicians to the king. that&#39;s how they treat us. all of us, especially those that think they are in on lie.

<p>I dunno I think that the MSM is trying to leverage the US into a bogus corporate war of aggression through lies and subterfuge at the behest of the small Wall Street clique that controls it is about as actual a conspiracy as you can get.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902–1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.&quot; ~ Smedley Butler in &quot;War is a Racket&quot;</p>

<p>My contention is that nothing has changed...and certainly the evidence of the recent past supports that.  The war in Iraq was allegedly to deal with WMDs...but we learned later that there never were any and the whole thing was just to secure profits for banks and contracts for Haliburton.  Does anyone on their right mind really think the US wants to invade Syria for the benefit of the Syrian people?</p>

The simple fact is that these fringe stories can also have truth in them, and they can also not have truth in them. It is completely dependent on which &quot;fringe story&quot; you hear.

    <div class="md"><p>They went after the pedos that use TOR by attacking their web host, a commercial endeavour (&quot;hidden service&quot;) that hosted dozens of sites. They inserted malicious Javascript into the pages hosted on those servers that allowed the attackers to insert a malware payload into the end users&#39; computers. Source: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/">ArsTechnica</a>.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s sorta beside the point. Anyone can use TOR to set up their own .onion by running their own web server and providing &quot;hidden services&quot; on the network. The advantage TOR currently has is that it encrypts all traffic and only exposes the end node, not the originator, and takes a completely random path through the network, even when accessing the same content multiple times.</p>

<p>The person likely had security holes. For someone merely trying to spread information you can have a pretty bulletproof setup if you don&#39;t allow your webserver to run scripts of any kind, just to serve html.</p>

<p>The sites that were taken down were probably hacked from the inside out, e.g. fbi bought hosting from guy then broke into rest of server.. most likely explanation. </p>

<p>And sadly this is the area to get a balanced view of what really is going on... dont get me wrong, I really enjoy this sub-reddit but it should not <em>really</em> be the place to get a different or competing view of the news... but there really is nowhere else...</p>

<p>Of course this just proves perhaps there are huge conspiracies out there that really, truly are happening.</p>

<p>On the bright side, years ago nobody believed my whacked out views on the banking cabal, surveillance and government control. Now its just kind of taken as a fact around the coffee table. </p>

Who cares about down votes the virus we are is spreading and soon the host, whom I believe have begun to feel the effects can only try but the system is getting sicker and that is a good thing. But that&#39;s my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sentiments exactly. I have turned a few people on to this place recently as a news source. I had to tell them it wasn&#39;t all tinfoil hats and such but that it was more or less discussing news that US mainstream media refuses to cover because the hand is so far up the puppets ass the fingers are showing. (i just used that euphemism now, not to the people) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>End of the day r/conspiracy is what you all want it to be. The moderators do not encourage one way or the other what gets up-voted or which subjects the forum takes an <strong>active</strong> interest in. We all have our favorites, many of you know mine. </p>

<p>r/conspiracy is doing well for a number of reasons, but quality of content and less sensationalism/crazy post titles and suspect news sources has helped a lot, so this is what we want to encourage. There is a long way to go. </p>

<p>Fringe conspiracy should be welcomed and encouraged here, providing content is of a good quality, that&#39;s where the community has to play it&#39;s part. It is to our own detriment if, in my opinion, we choose to ignore or ridicule topics like UFOs, OOPART&#39;s, forbidden archaeology and so on without investigating them. This is what we want the community to be about.   </p>

<p>Conspiracy has never solely been about big government and abuse of power. There exists a wider spectrum of knowledge that needs exploring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>cannot aggree more with OP. It might be a subjective view that the news are more and more rigged to fit to the majoritarian paradigm or zeitgeist. This might be a bit vaguely verbalized since the true motive for biased or rigged information are always hazy. In my personal believe what is there more to a conspiracy than a few conspiring against the many with a benefit for the few to the cost of the many. In our times there is no need to make up elaborate conspiracy theories just turn on the news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what you really are (or should be) about is discussing ideas that threaten the top of the social hierarchy. This stuff about chemtrails and moon landing hoaxes is nonsense.  Start applying ideas from zoology, ecology, sociobiology, and other natural sciences to america today.</p>

<p>How does the relationship between the media, the rich, the govt, academia, the entertainment industry and politics relate to what books in sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, and zoology discuss?</p>

<p>That is what you should be focusing on.</p>

<p>American society, american politics, american media, american govt, all as part of a natural ecosystem. Where do the elite fit into that ecosystem; where do american workers fit into that ecosystem; where do immigrants fit into that ecosystem? The media? Academia? </p>

<p>How do the concepts of multiculturalism, feminism, nativism, populism, etc fit into the ideas discussed in the books on sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, and zoology?</p>

<p>Forget moon landings, chemtrails, illuminati and other nonsense. Grow up. Be an adult. The top of the social hierarchy--are they with us or are they predators, parasites? How is this explained in those books I mentioned above?</p>

<li>i&#39;m ambivalent about your product- but don&#39;t think its terrible. <em>no up or down action by default</em></li>

<p>Just to clarify, it is literally rocket science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I&#39;m talking about only uses the physics of radio waves. Doesn&#39;t have anything to do with rockets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why couldn&#39;t the signal bounce off already existing satellites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, there just weren&#39;t that many satellites.</p>

<p>Second, a reflected signal will appear to be originating from the point it&#39;s reflecting off of (this is how radar works). Space agencies have tracked satellite launches since Sputnik; getting something into orbit is very very hard to do without being detected.   </p>

<p>Third, a reflected signal will encode information about the object it&#39;s reflecting off of. At the very least if the reflector is moving at a constant orbital velocity, there won&#39;t be the same doppler shift as from an object moving towards the moon and changing velocity. Phase of the reflected signal will also be affected in a way that doesn&#39;t match a real lunar craft, and would have to be corrected for.</p>

<p>Fourth, you&#39;d need a network of reflectors and ground stations seamlessly handing off the signal from reflector to reflector, because the Earth is rotating and one ground station won&#39;t cut it. Multiple ground stations transmitting means it&#39;s a whole lot more likely an uplink signal will be detected.</p>

<p>Fifth, all your transmitters need to be very stable both in frequency and phase, and need to be synchronized to each other to an accuracy of a few nanoseconds - across the entire world, and accounting for relativistic effects. This was exceedingly nontrivial in 1969.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What equipment was being used by the Russians? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Standard equipment found in any university RF lab. Receivers, frequency counters, steerable antennas. Nothing at all exotic, although I&#39;m sure the SIGINT folks had that too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What flaws are there to be exploited? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not many, that&#39;s why it&#39;s more or less impossible to fake a Moon mission short of sending the whole thing unmanned (probably possible, but also exceedingly nontrivial in 1969). </p>

<p>There are just so many ways for independent parties (like the Russians, who would have <em>loved</em> to discredit a US Moon mission) to verify that it was doing what it said it was doing, the idea of faking it is silly. It&#39;s much more than just building a set and filming some guys in space suits bouncing on wire rigs while bleeping out signals from a satellite in Earth orbit.</p>

<p>Edit: We also did this <em>several times</em>; as with any lie or con, the more you do it the more likely someone will catch you.</p>
