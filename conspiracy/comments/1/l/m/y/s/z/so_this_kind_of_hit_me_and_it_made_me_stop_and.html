        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I forget what the political term is called. It&#39;s basically creating a major issue in one place to distract from something else that has happened somewhere else. </p>

<p>So this whole NSA thing breaks wide open... Snowden and all that. Everyone has turned a critical eye on the government calling for investigations ect.... </p>

<p>Now suddenly Syria has launched a Chemical attack killing nearly 1500 civilians including 400 children ( or close to 1/3 the number dead ). Now America is looking to take strong military action to punish the would be villains. </p>

<p>Now correct me if I am wrong but.. the results from the U.N. investigations teams is not back yet and there is no other evidence supporting the fact this WAS a chemical weapon attack. Nor has then been documented proof proving that 1500 people died including 400 children. As a matter of fact the only documented proof out there say that 500 people died. </p>

<p>No one is supporting the U.S. in this strike.. not even Britain. America&#39;s biggest ally in pretty much any strike it has made. Yet the U.S. Continues to push as hard as it can to strike at Syria. </p>

<p>Something Similar happened in G.W.&#39;s term around a bad time didn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>Again not sure I&#39;m the first one to think this.. but the numbers don&#39;t add up here and it just seems REALLY convenient to me that this happens RIGHT at the perfect time to distract from the NSA scandal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe Snowden is a disinformation agent of sorts; I say this because he really hasn&#39;t released much of anything that wasn&#39;t previously known. And most of WikiLeaks is also disinformation. Okay, so Snowden told us some of the code-names for things, but even those <a href="http://www.barthworks.com/technical/nsaafter911.htm">were already known</a>, and we know these were just the tip of the iceberg. Everyone in intelligence circles has knowledge of this stuff, and it&#39;s not even classified. How is Snowden a &quot;traitor&quot; if the information he &quot;leaked&quot; was previously public? The NSA crap is a distraction from all of the military&#39;s other domestic intelligence programs, in my opinion. And Syria? Syria IS THE DISTRACTION, not the other way around. Meanwhile our rights are being stripped, we are being spoon-fed propaganda from every side, we are being divided, and thus conquered. We are no longer a united states, we never have been a democracy, and we are not free. It&#39;s all an illusion. It&#39;s all a big psyop. How do you think it affects your subconscious if you believe everything you do is monitored, recorded, and analyzed? FALL IN LINE CITIZEN! Fuck that noise... People need to rise up. America is not a democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all a distraction, IMO, from keeping people from rising up together to take over as a unified global citizenry. Most of these conflicts are wholly due to proxy wars and corporations trying to retain power, not due to the people themselves. We have all been puppeteer-ed around for long enough. People want peace. Our nature is to preserve life, not to destroy it. The powers that be are the only ones keeping this farce alive, and thus dividing and controlling the world&#39;s population. Hey, this is the conspiracy sub-reddit after all, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I took civics in elementary school too, and it was a bunch of brainwashing nationalist patriotic bullshit.</p>

<p>Democracy is a <strong>type</strong> of government, not a <strong>form</strong> of government. There&#39;s a distinct difference; form is a subset of type.</p>

<p>The United States was <em>founded</em> as a <strong>constitutional republic</strong>. 
The United States currently <em>appears</em> to be a <strong>representative republic</strong>.</p>

<p>The United States is only a democracy in that we <em>supposedly</em> have free elections, though we all know those are rigged, whether it&#39;s vote tampering, unequal distribution of speech and money, gerrymandering, unjust voting laws, etc...</p>

<p>In reality, currently, the United States is a financial oligarchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose it&#39;s possible, but my thought would be that we know that Iran is not dumb enough to provoke conflict over another country that doesn&#39;t affect them all that much and which they would have no ability to defend. So I doubt that is our ultimate goal.</p>

<p>Plus since Israel is super eager for an attack on Iran I kind of feel that if we really wanted to we would use their nuclear program as an excuse and conduct joint strikes with Israel. Your theory is possible but I consider it unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever there&#39;s something consistently in the news that embarrasses the government, people point to some other event receiving media coverage and claim it&#39;s a manufactured story designed to distract attention from the story that makes the government look bad. My friend put the same theory outlined in this post to me, with the Syrian attack replaced by the Trayvon Martin case. The world is a big place, a place in which more than one thing happens at once. When the government is being embarrassed by something, other things will keep happening because of the world&#39;s aforementioned bigness, not because the government is causing them to happen to distract from its misdeeds. This is the worst kind of conspiracy theory - it draws connections where there are none and imagines a calculating conspiracy to explain normal events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the &#39;real&#39; conspiracy is that cases like that of George Zimmerman happen <strong>all the time.</strong>   But the media only seems to play this sensationalist crap when convenient.  There are dozens of stories in every market, every year, that hit the media for a flash and disappear.  Some land, some don&#39;t.  Those that land are now locked and loaded, as needed, whether for pure profit/ratings motives or as a method of caving to political pressure.  </p>

<p>I personally think that the conspiracy angle is overplayed.  Big corps are motivated by one thing, encompassing all else: profit, or fear of lost wealth.  Anything that strikes a nerve, they will play out for as long as possible.  Cable news is an elaborate reality show.
But I also believe that they cave to political pressure and under-report certain things while over-playing others.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a distraction.  This is a planned step in the path to Persia.</p>

<p>I think the Democrats for the most part would like to topple these regimes using only covert support of rebel groups (interestingly enough, there is a talking point right now that they are not looking for regime change- but that&#39;s BS).  The military industrial complex/ Neocons want to use american missiles because they make A LOT of money when we start launching tomahawks.  If you ever want to know what the MIC is trying to do, just listen to McCain on any issue.</p>

<p>The next thing to watch out for is rebellion in Lebanon.  Of course Lebanon is a parliamentary system made up of Christian, Sunni and Shiite leadership, but Hezbollah will be the target there because they work closely with Iran.  So watch the west back the same Sunni rebels as they move towards Beirut.</p>

<p>The real shitshow is going to be Iran.  That&#39;s what scares me as an American citizen.  For all that I believe AQ is bs and not an actual threat in the US, I believe that there ARE actual Iranian cells in the US that could cause big problems.  And since they actually do have capability, that also opens us up to the threat of false flag to convince the citizens of the need for &quot;boots on the ground&quot;- both in Iran AND the US. At that point, it doesn&#39;t really matter who the terrorists are because it&#39;s the same horrible outcome for civilians on both sides.  In addition to the fact that any war with Iran is going to cut off significant resources to China and India- and while some American companies will be making cash hand over foot, it&#39;s going to hit the average american in the wallet.</p>

<p>This is also when we&#39;ll see the real effects of cyber warfare.  Russia and China will also be involved, though perhaps covertly.</p>

<p>Everyone knows this is a 100 year old strategy to control Eurasia.  The superpowers have been preparing for this, and Iran knows they are stuck directly in the middle.  It&#39;s not going to be a fun time for anyone who isn&#39;t a bank or a defense contractor.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>there is no other evidence supporting the fact this WAS a chemical weapon attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please remember that NATO countries all have satellites and AWACS monitoring all communications in Syria.  Nothing gets broadcast there without NATO intercept.  Just because the public hasn&#39;t seen the evidence doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist or is erroneous - we (meaning the People) don&#39;t know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet the U.S. continues to push as hard as it can to strike at Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, no.  There is a huge push AGAINST intervention coming from the public as well as a large group of government officials.  The Bush administration&#39;s foreign policy debacles are not taken lightly, even by many of the idiots who marched in lockstep with the decision to invade Iraq.  And that&#39;s saying something.  The American consciousness is changing.</p>

<p>As to your contention that our government sits on intel and then makes revelations in order to deflect the public&#39;s attention from scandal or dissidence?  Or even manufactures media events to further this end?</p>

<p>Welcome to the Matrix, kid.</p>

<p>I think this surprising lack of support and belief is because of the lies spread to justify striking Iraq, then finding out about the NSA. It all seemed to wake up America to see that not everything is as the government or news says. Good, because now we&#39;re all thinking logically and using common sense again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The implications of Snowden have far less consequence than the retaliation that we will likely face after a strike in Syria. The strike itself, while deplorable and lacks a stated goal, will like garnish an attack on Isreal after which will tie the US into a global conflict. Potentially millions could die. This bullshit is not about the NSA, that is just bad press at worst, this is about the continuation of a failed foreign policy that is ripping America apart at the seems. What is unacceptable is that the blueprint for this kind of behavior is no longer secret, the gig is up, yet they will still try and push this upon us and the people of Syria. This will be it, the final straw that will bridge the divide and unite the citizens in an organized effort to rid our great country of these weasels. </p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that we&#39;re essentially running into this one alone- if the UN calls us getting busted for getting involved behind the scenes... think of how bad that makes us look. </p>

<p>Germany, Russia and the UK are in agreement that the United States has overstepped our boundaries with our worldwide real-time surveillance tactics.</p>

<p>Think of how easy it would be to pin the entire thing on a Nobel-prize winning President and allow the Middle East to call for sanctions against us. Does it now make a little more sense why we&#39;re over-preparing for a domestic event?</p>
