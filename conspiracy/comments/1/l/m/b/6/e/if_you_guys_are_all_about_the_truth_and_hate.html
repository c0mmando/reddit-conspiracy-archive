<p>Edit: The other things I wrote in the thread, for those opening it now.</p>

<p>To further ellaborate: I thought you guys didn&#39;t like people being sheep. Elites controlling the masses. Yet you don&#39;t seem to have a problem with religion.</p>

<p>More elaboration: Maybe your tolerance on religious belief is based on the fact that religion is simultaneously a conspiracy AND a conspiracy theory? It&#39;s brilliant, when you think about it. It&#39;s a conspiracy theory, in that it is really nothing more than the history channel dude saying &quot;ALIENS!&quot;. It just says &quot;Yahweh!&quot; or &quot;Jesus!&quot; or &quot;Allah!&quot; or &quot;Etc!&quot; instead. It speculates on the unkown. It&#39;s a conspiracy for obvious reasons. It&#39;s creating a mythology as a basis to enforce rules and with them control the masses. It&#39;s no different that what you claim are conspiracies. You claim that governments and corporations create a narrative (using such tools as the now popular &quot;FALSE FLAG!&quot;) in order to get people to be passive and do what they want. Isn&#39;t this exactly the same thing religion has been doing for thousands of years? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But astrology is pseudo-science with no application in the real world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  That&#39;s what TPTB have indoctrinated most plebs into believing is the case, but nothing could actually be further from the truth.</p>

<p>The following explanation can be a rather abstract and complicated thing to understand, but try:  Astrology is a discipline that plots the effects that both the strong and the weak essential forces of gravity and electricity have upon the human mind, heart, and body to the equivalent extent that astronomy plots the effects those same forces have upon celestial bodies.  Those essential forces effect and influence the human body and physiology - especially in utero - just as much as they effect celestial bodies in the universe.  If one has a sufficient understanding of the manner that those forces effect celestial bodies (through the study of, say, astronomy), one can successfully understand, track, and even predict the movement, effect, and characteristics that many different types of objects and bodies in the cosmos will have.  Same applies to humans.</p>

<p>When one is still in utero, the physiological and sympathetic systems, etc are not only <em>very</em> malleable, but are also very much in dependent tune with the mother&#39;s systems.  The moment the individual is born to the outside world, however, the systems - limbic, sympathetic, nervous, etc - are immediately effected by the particular effect that the electrogravitic forces are having upon <em>that</em> specific space and time and are &quot;stamped&quot; with that spacial temporal signature.  In other words, the type of personality your identity manifests is greatly dependent upon the effect the electrogravitic forces have upon the forming of your systems - which itself is greatly influenced by the geographical location you were born in as well as the date and time that you were born.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Electricity and gravity are ubiquitous, universal forces, and effect all physical objects.</p></li>
<li><p>One&#39;s systems while in utero are in malleable accord with the mother&#39;s, but upon birth are immediately influenced by and begin to congeal in accord with the effect that those universal forces have upon the individual&#39;s systems in that space and time.</p></li>
<li><p>One&#39;s personality is greatly dependent upon the effect one&#39;s systems (chemical, physiological, etc) have upon them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Gravity has already been shown to vary and waver - if slightly - depending upon where on the planet one is.  Same goes for electricity believe it or not.  The effect that either of these forces have upon particular bodies (celestial or human) at their most critical moments of malleability (i.e. at their birth) depends upon where those bodies are located geographically as well as <em>when</em> that moment of congealing occurs (i.e. when they&#39;re &quot;born&quot;).</p>

<p>Mind you, this is all science and logic  being used and spoken about here.  It might be a little bit difficult to follow or wrap your head around initially, but it&#39;s really all just nuts and bolts logic and physical science.</p>

<p>Now, depending upon how these universal forces effect you, your physiology, your body chemistry, your mind, and, hence, your personality and emotional make up will also be effected as well.  I don&#39;t know <em>who</em> did it or <em>how</em> they did it, but <em>somebody</em> plotted out how these effects happen and how they effect certain individuals depending upon when they were born and where, etc.</p>

<p>That&#39;s called astrology.</p>

<p>Now, there are MAAAANY individuals who don&#39;t really know how to actually APPLY the understandings that I outlined above.  I myself don&#39;t pretend to be one who can.  Just as there are amateur astronomers verses pros, quack doctors verses serious physicians, etc, etc, there are some astronomers that study and know what they&#39;re talking about, and a lot, of course, that can justifiably be called &quot;quack jobs&quot;.  Unfortunately, TPTB make it a point to highlight and bring to the front of the public knowledge and awareness mostly the quack jobs, so the public ends up associating and equating &quot;astrology&quot; only with the &quot;quack jobs&quot;.  Nothing could be further from that actual truth, however, and the REAL ptb actually know this.  Astrology is one of <em>the</em> most widely used disciplines in esoteric power circles.  There&#39;s a <em>reason</em> for it, and it&#39;s <em>not</em> because astrology is pure malarkey.  It&#39;s real, and it works...You just have to know exactly how to use it and what&#39;s going on - which most of us don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Technically - and in short (so as not to be any more long-winded) - the answer is &quot;no&quot;.  This is because once you have a sufficient understanding of what exactly religious and spiritual belief actually is (two terms that are <em>not</em> necessarily synonymous and should not always be equated with each other, by the way), then you will also begin to understand that the terms are usually (if not always) tied with both what we do and what we do <em>not</em> understand.  Independent of religion, spirituality when looked upon in the universal sense, is, again, very much ubiquitous and part of universal laws, physical, and moral truths, etc.  It seems it will be existent to at least <em>some</em> extent in whatever discipline one works with.</p>

<p>Realize that the supernatural realm is largely (but not entirely) <em>about</em> feelings and intuitions as it stands, so your saying that it&#39;s more &quot;this&quot; than &quot;that&quot; is a bit awkward when the &quot;this&quot; <em>is</em> actually the &quot;that&quot; and includes it (i.e., and again, a large part of the supernatural <em>is</em> largely about feelings and intuitions).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you start by stating that basically Science is wrong and The powers that be manipulated me into not believing astrology, I&#39;m sorry, but I refuse to argue on those principles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  Where did you get that from?  &quot;Science is wrong&quot;??  Where are you getting that from?  I said nothing of the like.  Not only that, but it would actually be VERY uncritical and unintelligent for you or anyone to outright reject something and refuse to investigate or take a look at something <em>in principle</em>.  Part of effectively finding the truth in something is to &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot;, and refusing to even LOOK at certain things often leads to pretty incorrect and mistaken understandings.</p>

<p>Regardless, however, I - as I already stated - didn&#39;t say &quot;science is wrong&quot;.  That&#39;s actually quite preposterous for anyone to have come to that interpretation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re talking logic and reason here, not speculation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  Right now, you&#39;re talking and dealing with speculation and not a very good ability to actually <em>apply</em> reason.  No disrespect, but you&#39;re simply not thinking very properly or logically, so the science and rationality that you&#39;re using is not being applied very correctly or effectively.</p>

<p>This is in great part what&#39;s wrong with many individuals that rely too exclusively on that remedial, superficial, very limited version of science that is for the most part practiced in today&#39;s day and age.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Science as it is generally practiced on this planet and as it is indeed controlled by TPTB shouldn&#39;t be looked upon with all <em>that</em> much credence here.  The <em>theory</em> behind the effective use and practice of science is indeed pretty sound.  Unfortunately, however, there are very influential powers on this planet that keep science from being practiced in as sound a manner as it could and should be.  If it <em>were</em> allowed to be practiced in the manner that it could be, it would actually look a lot more like magic than most would believe possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to talk more about the spiritual thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  Shoot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So it IS feelings and intuition?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, <em>part</em> of it definitely is.  Spirituality isn&#39;t <em>solely</em> feelings and intuition, however.  I mean there is a great extent of spirituality that also involves thought processing, and where there is thought processing, there is also the use of logic and reasoning - so there is definitely also that as well.  Matter of fact, there is <em>at least</em> just as much logic and reasoning used in the spiritual realm as there is in this physical realm we live in here.  Thing is, however, that in the spiritual realm there is <em>also</em> the use of feelings and intuition to an extent that is much, <em>much</em> greater than it is ever used here on this plane, so it seems comparatively speaking that reason is not really used much at all there because - even though it actually <em>is</em> used at least as much there as it is here - there is <em>also</em> the use of feelings and intuition there to such a greater extent than it&#39;s used here in this dimension that it kind of pales the predominance of logic and reasoning in a manner that isn&#39;t the case in this dimension.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why call it spiritual, then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  That&#39;s a pretty good question.  Part of the reason for that is because while there is indeed the use of feelings and intuition in that realm, there is actually <em>more</em> than just those two things used there.  There is certainly an &quot;otherwordly&quot; reality there that cannot be purely defined by the words &quot;feelings and intuition&quot; alone.  Those words are, perhaps, necessary, but not sufficient to describe the spiritual realm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but spiritual has more of a supernatural connotation, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you go, sir.  You just said a very similar thing to what I said - and without having to use as many words either.  Well-done.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s certainly a <em>lot</em> more than what I explained alone.  That much is certainly true, for I know very, very little.  However, the understanding that I do have of the spiritual realm comes from not only my own personal experiences, but from an ongoing level of investigation I&#39;ve done of various studies that have been undertaken by minds much greater than mine on the subject.</p>

<p>Have you ever been to Pluto?  No?  How do you know it exists then?  How do you know it&#39;s real?  It&#39;s because a lot of evidence exists in favor of the idea that it indeed real.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive &quot;either/or&quot; scenarios.  <em>Both</em> can most definitely be the case.  That being said, however, I&#39;m not referring to a spiritual universe that runs parallel to this one.  I&#39;m referring to a spiritual reality that <em>includes</em> the very reality we&#39;re experiencing now.  It pervades existence and is indeed greatly responsible for it.  It&#39;s not something that runs beside and &quot;parallel&quot; to what we are experiencing now.  It <em>is</em> what we are experiencing now - in part anyway.  This realm is a necessary but not a sufficient aspect to encompass and describe the spiritual realm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I believe I mentioned before, Dr. Ian Stevenson, Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross, and Dr. Raymond Moody, and (to add one more) Dr. Eben Alexander all present a great deal of fascinating evidence pointing toward the reality of what most call &quot;otherworldly&quot; existence.  A word of warning, however:  Do not make the mistake of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  I&#39;m not saying that &quot;everything that <em>every</em> investigator of paranormal phenomenon has ever said is 100% true.&quot;  There is, of course, not only a <em>lot</em> of very uncharted territory -  and with fledgling steps come faltered and mistaken conclusions - but even the most minimal fraction of information presented which contains truth entirely undermines any supposition of a purely mechanistic universe.  As such, a holistic approach to almost everything in life is recommended.</p>

<p>And why is that? Please explain how it is &quot;not very credible&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is that different from christians cherry picking the parts of the bible they like?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if Christians did cherry pick only the parts of the bible they like, if the data is valid and correct, then the data is valid and correct whether cherry picked or not. If the data isn&#39;t correct, then it doesn&#39;t matter whether they cherry picked it or not either.  It is important to be critical of everything - including and especially the bible. That level of critical adherence must also be able to sift the wheat from the chaff, however, and know how to understand what elements of a theory are not valid and should be discarded, as well as - and perhaps more importantly - what elements of a theory are valid and should be kept. This goes for philosophy, scientific theories, and yes, the bible.  All this is to say that one needs to make sure and not cut off their nose to spite their face when regarding certain data.</p>

<p>Anecdotal evidence must be assessed critically and intelligently.  As already mentioned, anecdotal evidence is a significant hallmark of many court proceedings and often spells the difference between freedom or indefinite incarceration for many individuals.  As such, the source of a topic is important to consider.  A PhD physicist explaining the ins and outs of a particular galaxy you would do quite well to listen to intently.  Such information can justifiably be considered to be a bit more than merely &quot;anecdotal&quot;.</p>

<p>A 45 year old shmuck down the street with an eight grade education talking about what exactly made him &quot;conscious while under anesthesia&quot; during their stay at the hospital is one thing.  A highly accomplished neurosurgeon with an extensive knowledge of the inner workings of the brain and what specific neuronal pathways are responsible for consciousness explaining the same thing is quite a bit of a different animal altogether.  Anyone failing to understand that distinction is being willfully ignorant and are themselves cherry picking the portions of a story that fit their preconceived ideas.</p>

<p>Not saying <em>you&#39;re</em> necessarily doing this one way or the other, btw.</p>

<p>Christians DO cherry pick. Your concept of if data is valid then data is valid doesn&#39;t apply in this cause, because to see The Bible as the word of God raises certain criteria such as 1) Everything in there is to be followed 2) Everything happened 3) There can be no contradictions. </p>

<p>I know the distinction and while a person&#39;s status can give them more credibility, it doesn&#39;t make their claims unfallible or unvulnerable to the mighty bullets of evidence and logic. Emotion and knowledge can get mixed up, as you know. </p>

<p>So then ultimately you&#39;re choosing one person&#39;s anecdotal stories over another person&#39;s anecdotal stories.  Which one are you choosing to go with, and why?  If your mind is predisposed toward thinking &quot;No way&quot; and you get even a slight touch of confirmation toward that, then you might be wont toward gravitating immediately to that and simply committing to that perspective exclusively - ignoring other information that could possibly be right and contradict your initial commitment.</p>

<p>One should be careful with that, as - again - there is not enough in any one person&#39;s anecdotal tale to discredit <em>another</em> person&#39;s &quot;anecdotal tale&quot; - especially if one individual in particular speaks from a point of verifiable knowledge not possessed by most people on a particular topic at hand.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Okay.  I never said they didn&#39;t though.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course it applies.  If part of what is in there is 2+2 is 4, then that means that at least PART of what is in there is correct.  If I say I have a blue shirt on and a million dollars in my pocket, but I&#39;m really broke, does that mean that I don&#39;t still have a blue shirt on?</p>

<p>Again, people need to be careful with ignoring obviously valid information because they might be so emotionally committed to discarding a particular point of view.</p>

<p>Matter of fact, they USUALLY do...and, unbeknownst to many, that is often a <em>good</em> thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, it&#39;s very unlikely that there even is a God. There&#39;s no evidence whatsoever that there is one. There is a whole lot of evidence that scripture such as the Bible was men made. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not choosing one over the other as if the two were equal. One was a lucid person, the other was a guy in a coma. There are other stories of this type of phenomenon, they have been studied and explained (near death experiences). So it becomes very likely that Eben was indeed wrong. Also, the doctors and hospital stuff probably know more about what happen in the physical world at the time than the comatose dude, be he a super smart doctor or not, right? And their statements provide a reasonable explanation for his experience. I don&#39;t know why you insist on believing the option that requires most assumptions to be true. I choose the one who requires less. </p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t apply if we were talking about the bible. You just gave the same example and didn&#39;t care at all for the fact that the bible is special in that regard. If you won&#39;t follow the rule that shellfish is sinful, you can&#39;t find homosexuality sinful either, unless you come up with a very good explanation for why one is to follow and the other isn&#39;t, where both are written as word of God. </p>

<p>Oh, and I don&#39;t want to go back to find it cause I&#39;m sleepy but on the other thread you said something about how thoughts produce emotions when verbalized? Well, congratulations.

</blockquote>

<p>lol.  It&#39;s actually impossible that there <em>isn&#39;t</em>.  Do you even know what God is?  Define it.  If you look at it as some white dude with a beard sitting on a cloud looking down upon tiny Earth and focusing upon whether the humans on it are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, then yeah.  You&#39;re right.  It&#39;s very unlikely that there even is a god.  THAT dude certainly isn&#39;t God.  I&#39;ll tell you that right now.</p>

<p>The whole Christian bible indoctrination bullshit is little more than a handbook for brainwashing slaves.  That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>But <em>so what?</em>  What does <em>that</em> have to do with the REAL God?  What does that (little book) have to do with universality?  What does that have to do with the perspective on Eternity that, for example, the East has?  If you understand that God is an eternal, pervading, ubiquitous force that includes but is by NOOO means whatsoever limited to humanity/human perspective, then you <em>begin</em> to understand what God is really about.  God is science.  God is match.  God is church.  God is hate.  God is love.  God is death and murder.  God is benevolence and giving.  God is everything.  All of that and more...and nothing.</p>

<p>Yeah.  You first have to understand what God is about - or <em>begin</em> to anyway - before you can begin to think about whether God exists or not.</p>

<p>God <em>does</em> exist, but God&#39;s existence is quite a bit different than most of us have any idea about; quite a bit different than any human bible explains to the little humans on this shitty little planet called Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no evidence whatsoever that there is one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My man, there&#39;s nothing <strong>BUT</strong> evidence - it&#39;s just not anything that the stupid humans here understand or realize/understand is evidence.  YOU are evidence that God exists and is real.  Hell, you are <em>proof</em> of it. lol.  Same w/me and everything else.  Again, like I said already, you have to first begin to understand and define what God even <em>is</em> before you can get a proper handled on whether It exists or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a whole lot of evidence that scripture such as the Bible was men made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See?  There you go.  I hadn&#39;t even read your third sentence and I already understood that you were/are looking at God in the absolute most <em>remedial</em> manner that it can be looked at.</p>

<p>Understand that God is more than what you think It is.  Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s &quot;The World As Will And Representation&quot; (Volumes one and two) is not a horrible book for helping you wrap your mind around the idea that God and existence is much, MUCH bigger than we can ever imagine.  It&#39;s not an easy read, but it helps if you can get through it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not choosing one over the other as if the two were equal. One was a lucid person, the other was a guy in a coma. There are other stories of this type of phenomenon, they have been studied and explained (near death experiences). So it becomes very likely that Eben was indeed wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, all you have to do is study the relevant research that has been done on the subject - which you have not.  If you have someone who was undergoing surgery and when they came out of the surgery they told everyone that they were conscious and looking down upon the operation and then they described the conversations that were going on not only during the surgery itself while they were unconscious, but were also aware of what was happening down the hall in ANOTHER area of the hospital that they were no where even near...and they were CORRECT about everything that took place there as well, then there are two possibilities:  Either the entire medical staff is lying and playing some sort of elaborate hoax upon the publisher of the information, or the case is TRUE AND FACTUAL.  Enough cases exists similar to this example to pretty heavily refute any idea that it was anything other than an individual who was having a valid out of body experience.  Once one establishes this fact, then one can no longer say that consciousness is limited to the physical organism.  Once you establish that consciousness is not limited to the physical organism, then you have to admit that a purely mechanistic interpretation of existence simply cannot be the case.  It&#39;s a pretty easy assessment if you understand it in this manner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the doctors and hospital stuff probably know more about what happen in the physical world at the time than the comatose dude</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would think, right? and yet there have been reported cases where an unconscious patient describes activity going on OUTSIDE the operating table that even the operating physicians themselves were not in any way aware of but which was confirmed later by the the outside medical staff.  How can this possibly be explained by ANYTHING other than consciousness existing <em>outside</em> of the physical body?  Seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, it doesn&#39;t apply if we were talking about the bible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be better for our communication here if you were to quote the specific passage that you&#39;re responding to here.  Otherwise I have no real idea what you&#39;re reffering to.  Like the statement above here...I don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re referring to when you say &quot;No, it doesn&#39;t apply if we were talking about the bible.&quot;  WHAT doesn&#39;t apply?</p>

<p>There is a &quot;&gt;&quot; symbol right above the period (&quot;.&quot;) symbol on your keyboard.  If you want to quote something I said, then simply begin the sentence with the &quot;&gt;&quot; symbol and it will put the little blue line in front of the sentence, letting me know that you&#39;re quoting me.  Like, for example, I can say &quot;Hello everyone&quot;, and if you want to quote that in the manner I just described, then you put the &quot;&gt;&quot; symbol in front of the words &quot;Hello everyone&quot; and you get this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See?  Simple.  :)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t really know how to respond to this because I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re really referring to because we&#39;ve written so much that these sentences of yours above are just coming out of no where to me.  I can only say that I personally DON&#39;T find homosexuality in itself &quot;sinful&quot;...I don&#39;t know exactly what this does one way or the other to the subject you&#39;re referring to, however...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>on the other thread you said something about how thoughts produce emotions when verbalized? Well, congratulations. That&#39;s pretty obvious. It still doesn&#39;t change that knowledge is independent of emotions. Emotions don&#39;t make a statement true or false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, you have to define WHAT KIND OF KNOWLEDGE you&#39;re referring to.  If you&#39;re referring to knowledge in the abstract sense that exists independent of human understanding, then OF COURSE it exists independent of emotions.  It exists independent of <em>human</em> emotions anyway.  That&#39;s certainly for sure.  If you&#39;re referring to HUMAN knowledge, however - i.e. knowledge as it is contained inside the human mind - then it actually CAN be altered and influenced by emotions.  That&#39;s a simple fact.  Again, you have to be more clear as to what specific kind of knowledge you&#39;re referring to before anything you said can be looked upon or understood as being true or false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was enjoying this conversation but we are hitting a road block and I&#39;m getting frustrated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No worries.  We can stop whenever you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just hit me with walls and walls of text and you are doing exactly the same things you said about rationalists with no actual substance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  I thought I was actually providing you with examples and references - not all of which you&#39;ve really investigated with much of any critical understanding.  That&#39;s okay though.  I don&#39;t pretend to know the &quot;whole story of existence&quot; or even a little bit of it.  I only try to investigate and keep an open mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You want to believe those things, believe those things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I stay away from belief as much as possible.  Belief is that which those without any valid evidence blindly cling to.  I try not to cling to any one thing or the other.  You might be wrong, you might be right.  I might be wrong, I might be right.  I&#39;m sure the truth is somewhere in between.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not being coherent in your criteria, You just want to believe the supernatural exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny because this is a good description of what I&#39;m feeling <em>you&#39;re</em> doing...but okay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just take any anedoctal evidence of the supernatural as truth and the opposing ones as false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s what you feel is happening, then (again) okay.  Perhaps you might be better fit believing what it is you believe somewhere else.  No worries.</p>

<p>Either way, all the best on your journeys toward better understanding.  I hope you find whatever it is you&#39;re looking for.</p>

<p>Peace,</p>

<p>Open to the idea that I might be wrong in thinking that it is erred to believe there is NOTHING but a physica, mechanistic model of the universe?  Yes.  You are correct.

<p>I <em>am</em>.  I might be just an idea that a brain in a petri dish is having and not a real flesh and blood body - yes.

Maybe your tolerance on religious belief is based on the fact that religion is simultaneously a conspiracy AND a conspiracy theory?
It&#39;s brilliant, when you think about it.
It&#39;s a conspiracy theory, in that it is really nothing more than the history channel dude saying &quot;ALIENS!&quot;. It just says &quot;Yahweh!&quot; or &quot;Jesus!&quot; or &quot;Allah!&quot; or &quot;Etc!&quot; instead. It speculates on the unkown. 
It&#39;s a conspiracy for obvious reasons. It&#39;s creating a mythology as a basis to enforce rules and with them control the masses. It&#39;s no different that what you claim are conspiracies. You claim that governments and corporations create a narrative (using such tools as the now popular &quot;FALSE FLAG!&quot;) in order to get people to be passive and do what they want.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s different when you&#39;ve had a personal encounter with the divine. I think the existence of metaphysical reality is irrefutable, so accepting philosophical and spiritual schools of thought that attempt to describe that reality is paramount to its understanding.</p>

<p>Now, a hierarchal system whereby one has to communicate with the divine through an organizational medium, such as church, temple, or synagogue is just plain unnecessary. Not to say that one cannot have an encounter with the divine at church, nor that such encounters are uncommon: ritualized social events such as church, festivals, and ceremonies are certainly capable of triggering divine encounters.</p>

<p>But, sitting alone on a mountain can trigger a divine encounter. A car crash can cause such an encounter. An orgasm. I think you get the idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion can be and to a great extent <em>is</em> used as a tool for manipulation and to dumb down the masses.  It is not <em>only</em> that, however, and one would be just as erred in thinking that it is only that as they would be in thinking that it is not that <em>at all</em>.  Not much of what you&#39;ve talked about here, for example, applies to the core tenets of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>.</p>

<p>Religion essentially is a pair of training wheels for the spiritually immature - which the majority of humanity is.  However, once your identity and your understanding grow sufficiently, you can discard the training wheels altogether and find that which transcends religions, transcends science, transcends philosophy and enter into areas that are beyond all the little petty things we bicker about here.</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;m not speaking for anyone other than myself, but I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; in spirituality.  I&#39;ve experienced and know/understand the reality of its existence.  There&#39;s a big difference there.  Belief is what the ignorant rely upon when they do not have direct, first hand, personal experience of a thing.  As the Buddha said, don&#39;t believe in anything until you have experienced it directly for yourself and it agrees with your reason.  Regardless of anyone else&#39;s experiences, I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; in spirituality.  I know and understand that it exists because of my own personal experiences and through the use of my own logic and reason.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How can you say that when you don&#39;t even know what the world actually is in the first place or what it&#39;s constructed of?  That&#39;s a form of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance">argumentum ignorantiam</a>.</p>

<p>And your opinion is, frankly, incorrect.  Some people here might be looking at things this way.  All definitely are not, however.  Hell, your very statement is strangely paradoxical, as you apply a universal negation to a situation that necessarily <em>includes</em> you yourself in it as well - i.e. you say &quot;you guys&quot;, referring presumably to &quot;everyone&quot; in this subreddit...when you yourself are in this subreddit.  What&#39;s the difference between you and anyone else here?</p>

<p>Either way, I would say, again, that not everyone in the least looks at things in this manner - here or anywhere else actually.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But...It seems to me that you don&#39;t even know what skepticism is, because you haven&#39;t actually been <em>applying</em> true and honest skepticism in the proper way that it should be applied in the first place.  How can you throw out the name of something, claim to apply it to yourself, but demonstrate an inability to actually successfully do such a thing?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course that&#39;s the first step toward finding the solution, but the problem is that you seem to assume that you actually KNOW what that &quot;first step&quot; is, when you most definitely don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t mean this in a mean way, because I most definitely don&#39;t know what that first step is either, and I&#39;m not sure too many people know what that &quot;first step&quot; is...So, if you don&#39;t know exactly what the first step is, how can you purport to have any understanding of what comes afterward - whether it be science, or logic, or spirituality, or religion, or skepticism, or whatever else?</p>

<p>If that is the standard by which you assess whether you are part of this sub or not, then I think a LOT of the people who are &quot;part of this sub&quot; (including myself) would actually NOT be part of this sub, because I think a lot of us actually take exception with a decent deal of the posts here.  I personally think that&#39;s part of the very nature of this sub and, in general, of &quot;conspiracy&quot; (a word that&#39;s been purposefully stigmatized by TPTB, by the way).  Within all the craziness, however, there is information here that might be difficult to find in any other sub on this website.  That alone seems to make it worthy...thus far anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>tell me in short what is wrong about my version on skepticism and how you see it yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very well, my good man.  I think skepticism as it is defined by today&#39;s culture is very dangerous because 1) it seems to espouse more of a sentiment toward a more physically-based, more rudimentary version of science; a version that has been shown over and over again to be significantly faulty and <em>not</em> to be trusted too much.  Also 2) this common type of &quot;modern skepticism&quot; tends to reject those realities which exist in realms that cannot be immediately grasped by the five physical senses.  This is a deeply dangerous and disturbing thing which often ends up keeping the truth of various striking phenomena from being investigated more thoroughly because some become predisposed toward rejecting offhand things they assume &quot;cannot possibly be valid&quot; when, in fact, they actually <em>are</em> valid.</p>

<p>Take, as but one example of <em>many</em>, reincarnation.  The West has all but summarily rejected the reality of the phenomenon - so much so that it is scarcely if ever given any serious thought or consideration in academic circles.  However, the fact of the matter is that various academic professionals have conducted extensive research into the phenomena with very telling results in favor of its reality.  Dr Ian Stevenson, Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross.  These are but three names that come up off the top of my head that have done great work in the area with impressive results.</p>

<p>Yet the plague of faulty and uncritical skepticism that has spread over much of the academic community - that has subsequently infected a good portion of the rest of the public (themselves even <em>less</em> critically minded than the academics) - has made it an &quot;in&quot; and fashionable thing to call oneself a &quot;skeptic&quot;.  These types of individuals illustrate it by doing little more than summarily rejecting anything that the prevailing, superficial notions of the day deem it popular to reject.</p>

<p>This is not skepticism.  It is buffoonery - uncritical, unthinking simpleton-ism.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying <em>you</em> are doing this, mind you.  I&#39;m not.  I <em>am</em> saying, however, that you should be very wary of this common pitfall when fancying yourself a &quot;skeptic&quot;.  Many people in today&#39;s day and age who call themselves such are often anything but.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If possible, I&#39;d also like to know more about your personal experiences with spirituality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That reality which exists independent of and beyond the third dimensional can be looked upon as being spiritual - as having a spiritual element existing within it.  As a matter of fact, for those who define spirit as being an all-pervasive force permeating all reality, one can even say that <em>every</em> moment is a spiritual one.  Since I don&#39;t think that this is what you mean or are referring to, I wouldn&#39;t imagine that this type of classification would suffice for you.  I would imagine that you are looking at the &quot;spiritual&quot; as being defined more as &quot;a phenomenon that cannot be explained or defined by normal, conventional means tied to this physical, third dimension&quot;.  Even using this much more limited type of classification, I have had various experiences that would fall into this category - not the least of which involve a varying series of exceedingly unlikely moments involving great fortuity that took place during the making of a feature film I helmed a few years ago.  I&#39;ll spare the gory details (as, if you hadn&#39;t noticed, I can be a bit long-winded), but one can justifiably say that the project itself was <em>not</em> completed through the efforts of the individuals involved in the project alone <em>or</em> through blind or conventional &quot;luck&quot;.  There were other factors involved the absence of which would have made the project&#39;s completion impossible.</p>

<p>I also had experiences when younger that have been described by others as &quot;ET contact experiences&quot;.  I myself wouldn&#39;t go as far as to personally call them &quot;spiritual&quot; in the common sense of the word, but they certainly involved otherworldly experiences - so they qualified in that sense.</p>

<p>I never bought reincarnation, but I will make a note and will read about those studies you mentioned with an open mind.</p>

<p>Skepticism</p>

<p>I understand. Let me just say, I didn&#39;t find the word one day and decided &quot;I&#39;m gonna be a skeptic and call my self one&quot;. I think the term that better applies to me is probably &quot;rationalist&quot;? The thing is, since a very young age I have always detected flaws in logic, in people&#39;s reasoning and have been very (logically) critical of things in general. Now, I do find some truth when you say that sometimes skeptics aren&#39;t really that skeptical. I think you&#39;re talking about predisposition to trust specific sources, like, in my case, the consensus of the scientific community at large. I am by no means what some here would call a sheep, though. I am very critical of mainstream culture and the media, I just don&#39;t think the reasons behind its shittiness are the same as some of the so-called &quot;conspiracy theory community&quot;, or whatever. But I digress, about trusting specific sources, I think we get there based on logical reasoning and not just because of the apparent status of trust worthiness of said institutions. Call it a tool or crutches. I do accept that it can&#39;t be argued that is not 100% skepticism.</p>

<p>You seem nice too! I don&#39;t take it to heart because honestly I am like that too a big deal of the time. I decided to leave that element out when starting this specific discussion and it has proven productive. Like you, I also abandon my roughness when I find receptiveness for intelligent conversation on the other side.</p>

<p>Talking now about your spiritual experiences, this raises an interesting question for me. Let me start by saying that I too have thought I was experiencing supernatural phenomena. My parents in particular told me a lot of personal stories about weird shit that happened to them and their families growing up. I was also religious so that helped. The thing is, I came to understand the logical reasons behind all those things I thought were supernatural. Some were caused by my anxiety problems, just to give an example. </p>

<p>What I&#39;d like to ask is if, just like my bias towards a merely physical reality and physical based evidence, isn&#39;t there a possibility that you have the same bias towards metaphysical things? My main point is, just like I might not be 100% skeptical when it comes to for example accepting the scientific consensus, maybe you are not being as critical as you normally are when analysing those spiritual experiences either?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not something to buy or not buy into.  It&#39;s a phenomenon to - like almost any other phenomenon - study critically and come to a conclusion and an understanding regarding its validity one way or the other based upon the evidence that exists for or against it.  Based on the various extensive studies that have been done on the phenomenon, I find that it would simply be foolhardy (if not farcical) for any critically-minded individual to conclude that the phenomenon is not in fact real.</p>

<p>Anyone who has looked into the studies would very likely come to a similar conclusion.  Most (if not all) that reject the phenomenon offhand simply haven&#39;t investigated the research that exists.</p>

<p>Not taking anything away from your reasons, but I think this is also the case for many that call themselves such.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the term that better applies to me is probably &quot;rationalist&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems to sound so awfully similar to &quot;one who <em>rationalizes</em>&quot; which, as you may know, is <em>not</em> a good thing, for &quot;to rationalize&quot; generally means to cavort about an issue of contention through the use of complicated logic in an attempt to avoid facing the likelihood that one is thoroughly mistaken in their impression upon the subject at hand.  I&#39;m sure this is not what you mean, but...I guess perhaps instead of &quot;rationalist&quot;, the words &quot;critical-thinker&quot; might be a better fit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing is, since a very young age I have always detected flaws in logic, in people&#39;s reasoning and have been very (logically) critical of things in general.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a bad thing, but as the great, Indian Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore wrote:</p>

<p><em>A mind all-logic is like a knife all-blade:  It cuts the hand that uses it.</em></p>

<p>That is to say, it is good to use logic, but it is also important to value and respect that aspect of reality that exists greatly independent of logic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do find some truth when you say that sometimes skeptics aren&#39;t really that skeptical. I think you&#39;re talking about predisposition to trust specific sources, like, in my case, the consensus of the scientific community at large.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very correct, and it is a very good thing that you understand the difficulty in trusting any group that might be too divorced from personal critical investigation.  Trusting a group is even worse when you find out that, for example, a group such as &quot;the scientific establishment&quot; as it generally practices the discipline in this day and age and on this planet, is a summarily broken one.  It is a discipline that - noble as it is - has come under the wheel of and been all but trampled by a locomotive that has shown itself to be <em>much</em> more powerful (in the short term anyway) than science:  Money.  Moneyed interest have made sure and kept not only a great level of scientific discovery from taking place, but have greatly atrophied even that cornerstone of basic scientific inquiry from taking place.  This (scientific inquiry) is the very lifeblood and hallmark of successful research in the scientific field to begin with, and to prevent the flowering of it is to rob the discipline of its worth and vitality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am by no means what some here would call a sheep, though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems we&#39;re <em>all</em> sheep to one extent or another.  I guess it just depends upon where in the spectrum one falls.  Some of us are less sheep and more critical in our thinking, feeling, and acting.  Some of us not as much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very critical of mainstream culture and the media, I just don&#39;t think the reasons behind its shittiness are the same as some of the so-called &quot;conspiracy theory community&quot;, or whatever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a big community though - and getting bigger by the day - and it is filled with both crazy, uncritical buffoons, and extremely intelligent, well-studied individuals.  That some in the community will be incorrect in their assessments or conclusions should come as no surprise and should not ultimately be seen as any more of a criticism against this group in particular than it should be seen as a criticism of any other group amongst whose members one can find critical and uncritical thinkers alike.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I digress, about trusting specific sources, I think we get there based on logical reasoning and not just because of the apparent status of trust worthiness of said institutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logic and reason is at least <em>part</em> of it.  Intuitive understanding, however - especially the kind that can get verified - is, although not quite as easy to come by, of extreme importance as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Call it a tool or crutches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be &quot;either-or&quot; depending upon how one uses it.  If used correctly, it can be seen as that former - a tool.  If use incorrectly, it becomes more the latter - a crutch.  As a crutch, it is little more than a weak prop for one who cannot adequately stand on their own.</p>

<p>It is much easier said than done, but it is always better to stand on one&#39;s own <em>first</em> through the use of what people like Immanuel Kant and Arthur Schopenhauer referred to as intuitive, first hand, <em>experiential</em> knowledge, and <em>then</em> work by using logic and reason to further gain access to a better understanding of the world without <em>and</em> within.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My parents in particular told me a lot of personal stories about weird shit that happened to them and their families growing up. I was also religious so that helped. The thing is, I came to understand the logical reasons behind all those things I thought were supernatural. Some were caused by my anxiety problems, just to give an example. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending upon what the experiences in particular that you refer to were, the anxiety problems that you mention may either have been the cause of the phenomena in question (in which case your feeling that it was not &quot;supernatural&quot; might be valid) or your anxiety might have been the <em>effect</em> - making the reason and source behind the phenomena a bit more complicated to pinpoint and not as easily relegated to a conventional explanation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just like my bias towards a merely physical reality and physical based evidence, isn&#39;t there a possibility that you have the same bias towards metaphysical things?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a fair question, but while it can be said that the physical does not also include the metaphysical, the metaphysical itself actually <em>has</em> to also include the physical <em>of necessity</em>.  The metaphysical actually couldn&#39;t exist <em>without</em> the existence of the physical also.  The predominance that I give the metaphysical does not make the mistake of discarding or precluding the existence and reality of the third dimensional, physical world that we live and breath in as well.  While I know there is much, <em>much</em> that I do not know about the existence of the metaphysical, I do know that it - of necessity, some would say - nonetheless <em>does</em> exist all the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My main point is, just like I might not be 100% skeptical when it comes to for example accepting the scientific consensus, maybe you are not being as critical as you normally are when analysing those spiritual experiences either?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is very, very fair to question.  I would say that there have been occasions when I have been incorrect in my understanding of certain phenomena.  I try not to have any desire toward one type of perspective or another.  In other words, if everything is physical and the evidence bears that out, then okay.  That&#39;s where my focus will go.  My personal experiences, however, as well as my inquiries into the research that others have done, do not lead me to gravitate toward a purely physical, third dimensional accounting of exactly what is happening in this world and in this universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your answer to my question about bias was very, very smart. I smiled. About the Metaphysical having to include the physical. It is a great argument. But, I think it discounts the possibility that the Metaphysical doesn&#39;t exist at all.</p>

<p>I mean, there might be studies that say so, but there are also studies that say it doesn&#39;t. What makes you trust one side more than the other (Besides personal experiences)?</p>

<p>Now, going back to the top, your answer about my rationalism, I thought it fit perfectly with your description of what a rationalist is. You gave a complicated, very well thought out answer. You do that to all of my questions. Aren&#39;t you in a way being also a rationalist? Despite your cautionary attitude towards relying too heavily on logic and reason, aren&#39;t those the cornerstones of your discourse, even when that discourse is telling me why logic and reason aren&#39;t the be all, end all?</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t understand when people tell me about the dangers of logic and rationality. Obviously, one shouldn&#39;t be tied to it. I have both a pragmatist and a creative, dreamy personality. I don&#39;t let one side kill the other. I agree that in theory being strictly rational can make you stern, strict and even uptight, but when I say rationalist I&#39;m talking merely about the process of getting to conclusions or deciding a course of action. Fair or not, dismissing rationalism always sounds to me like a cop out. Like, if your believe something outside of the realm of reason, you&#39;ll discredit reason. </p>

<p>Still, like I said before, you seem to use reason even to reach the conclusion that there is more than reason. If you use purely intuitive argumentation and non-logical argumentation, like &quot;I just feel that the metaphysical exists, so I might be right&quot;, that doesn&#39;t satisfy yourself as a reason for believing it, does it? So you need reason to prove there&#39;s more than reason, which is an interesting idea.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Think about it this way:  If the metaphysical doesn&#39;t exist at all, then you would simply have to find SOME way to account for the verifiable metaphysical phenomena that <em>does</em> indeed exist and that has been shown and documented to occur.  Heck, just off the top of my head, take Edgar Cayce as but one of many valid examples.  How does a purely mechanistic, <em>non</em>metaphysical model of existence account for the fact that he correctly diagnosed and cured <em>hundreds</em> of people&#39;s ailments often at a point when no conventional medical diagnosis was ever able to help them, and he did all this from a remote location far away from the patient (often in another state) <em>without</em> even knowing who the individual in question even was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, there might be studies that say so, but there are also studies that say it doesn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that&#39;s not how science works.  If someone alleges a universal theory of &quot;something&quot;, then there literally cannot be <em>any</em> exception to the rule that the theory puts forth.  Even <em>one</em> exception renders the theory&#39;s claim upon universality null and void.  If I say &quot;<em>all</em> penguins are only black and white&quot;, and even <em>one</em> penguin with even a <em>speck</em> of any other color aside from black and white were found, then my statement is simply incorrect.</p>

<p>Similarly, a purely mechanistic, <em>non</em> metaphysical model of the universe absolutely HAS to be universal in its explanation, and if even <em>one</em> counterexample is found to exist in the entire universe, then that theory can no longer be considered universal and all-encompassing.</p>

<p>All this is to say that there is definitely a mechanistic element in existence, but there is also a demonstrably metaphysical element at play as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What makes you trust one side more than the other </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t say I &quot;trust&quot; any side.  Trust is a type of belief that you put on a thing without having a sufficient amount of valid data to account for that belief.  If I don&#39;t have enough data to place a valid assessment upon a thing, I tend to simply withhold judgement on it.  In the case of the existence of metaphysical existence, it&#39;s not trust.  It&#39;s simply an understanding that it <em>does</em> indeed exist based upon critical assessment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Besides personal experiences)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, personal experience is, I would say, one of the best barometers for being able to gauge the existence or reality of a thing.  I know it&#39;s most certainly not the <em>only</em> barometer, but there&#39;s a reason why many say that &quot;there&#39;s nothing like experiencing something first hand for yourself to know whether the thing in question is valid or not.&quot;  There are other standards besides personal experience, but I&#39;m not sure that personal experience isn&#39;t, in fact, the first/base/foundational standard upon which all others rest and without which no others could stand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You gave a complicated, very well thought out answer. You do that to all of my questions. Aren&#39;t you in a way being also a rationalist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a very valid question, as I <em>can</em> indeed be very long winded in my responses and that in itself can lend itself toward the appearance of the very type of &quot;over-verboseness&quot; that I mentioned as being one of the hallmarks of rationalism.  Where I think the distinction lies is in the fact that rationalism tends to use that over-verboseness to obfuscate and confuse the fact that the individual being over-verbose DOESN&#39;T actually have a valid leg to stand on in their argument.  In other words, the individual in question is just using fancy shmancy words to try to confuse the other person into simply giving up the conversation before it is found out that the individual doing all the talking doesn&#39;t in reality know or understand what they&#39;re actually talking about! lol</p>

<p>Although I, again, <em>can</em> be long winded, I do not feel that I am all too confused in my discussing of this topic.  There is much I have to learn - yes - but I also feel that my understanding of the reality of the metaphysical is <em>not</em> delusional or ill-founded.  It is based on much study and personal investigation, and I try not to talk confidently about subjects that I have little understanding in.</p>

<p>In this manner, I would personally say that I am <em>not</em> &quot;rationalizing&quot; my way through an affirmation of the existence of the metaphysical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite your cautionary attitude towards relying too heavily on logic and reason, aren&#39;t those the cornerstones of your discourse, even when that discourse is telling me why logic and reason aren&#39;t the be all, end all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This made me smile.  Very good.  :)  I think it is important for anyone to guard against making sure and not being poisoned by the very medicine they&#39;re using to cure their ignorance.  I can only say that I certainly <em>try</em> to use logic as best as I can, but I must acknowledge that there are other areas where my travel toward Truth has been better served through the use of another vehicle <em>other</em> than pure logic itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally don&#39;t understand when people tell me about the dangers of logic and rationality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking somewhat of a page from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot_Allegory">Plato</a> and <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15012.htm">stanzas 3-11 of The Upanishads</a>, it can be said that the individual can be described as a chariot, the mind and intellect as the charioteer, and one&#39;s emotions as the horses.</p>

<p>If you use logic too much or independent of its stronger, more powerful brethren emotion (the horses), then you stand the risk of becoming a steer-less charioteer; a charioteer with no horses at the helm at all.  Intelligent as you might be, your chariot (i.e. you yourself) will never really move forward, for it will not be driven by the power of proper emotional action.  Therefore, it is important to use logic, but not depend upon it so much that it prevents you from moving forward in a balanced emotional manner as well.  If one works too exclusively with logic only, then that entire realm of reality available predominately (if not exclusively) to the emotions alone will be lost to the individual.  This would create a very imbalanced human being.</p>

<p>You need all three working properly in order for the chariot to move well.  Logic is wonderful and important, but, as you correctly mentioned, should be used IN TANDEM with one&#39;s other decision-making faculties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, like I said before, you seem to use reason even to reach the conclusion that there is more than reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paradoxes are strange things in that way. ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you use purely intuitive argumentation and non-logical argumentation, like &quot;I just feel that the metaphysical exists, so I might be right&quot;, that doesn&#39;t satisfy yourself as a reason for believing it, does it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely not.  This is most definitely correct.  A personality all-logic is like a charioteer with no horses.  They will be vestigial and impotent - scarcely if ever moving or acting upon what they know.  Conversely, however, a personality all-emotion is like a chariot filled with likely unruly horses yet with no charioteer at the helm to discipline and steer them.  The self in this case will likely run wild and amuck and surely crash into certain-destruction before too long.  Again, <em>both</em> things are rather important.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you need reason to prove there&#39;s more than reason, which is an interesting idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Very well said.  Reason is part of what allows us to make sense of the fact that there is more than just reason in the world.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t find Cayce to be credible at all. This is my point. You say that one exception breaks universalism, but you take those accounts like Cayce&#39;s as the truths that break the law when in actually those have been subject to a lot of criticism, which you discredit. </p>

<p>I tell you one says X, the other says Y, you say, the X was proven. Well, the Y doesn&#39;t believe that, and that&#39;s the point.</p>

<p>On Cayce&#39;s story in particular, some things stand out. Atlantis. The wrong prediction that the USA would find a Death Ray used in Atlantis. Red herrings, I say. </p>

<p>Eben Alexander&#39;s story is also nothing more than a common claim of a near death experienced, which was quickly brought into question by additional information about his medical condition. Plus, just the basic countours of his story, his &quot;stay in heaven&quot; per say, make no sense at all. Why wouldn&#39;t his sister tell him she was his sister? That would certainly be more proof if he had woken up and said &quot;Wow, I have a sister&quot;. I get the sister wasn&#39;t trying to help him sell people on the story. Still. You meet the brother you never met, you say something. Dude was allucinating.</p>

<p>I understand the whole Chariots thing and kudos to Plato, I mean, without him we wouldn&#39;t have sexless infatuations, right? lol. Just a joke, I&#39;m no discrediting Plato in any way. The thing is, Emotions have nothing to do with knowledge. We had earlier established that facts had no morality, neither do they have feelings or emotions. That&#39;s in us, that&#39;s human. It doesn&#39;t bring us knowledge. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll quote your rationalism talk: 
&quot;Where I think the distinction lies is in the fact that rationalism tends to use that over-verboseness to obfuscate and confuse the fact that the individual being over-verbose DOESN&#39;T actually have a valid leg to stand on in their argument.

<p>This doesn&#39;t necessary imply malicious intention as in, the individual isn&#39;t necessarily trying to deceive the other. He might be sincere, but he is being over-verbose in trying to make sense of his own point and get it across - Which doesn&#39;t mean he is right either. What I mean is that I was reading that, and I thought it could describe yourself and your arguments here. No disrespect, I&#39;m thorougly enjoying this discussion and being open minded about it, but there are flaws, which I point to in the above paragraphs.</p>

<p>Oh, I forgot to talk about personal experience. No, that&#39;s not a good measure for knowledge. People I think sometimes confuse &quot;think for yourself&quot; with &quot;decided for yourself what&#39;s true&quot;. Truth decides it self. It doesn&#39;t mean you know if it&#39;s true or not. But our perception is flawed. I don&#39;t know how old you are. I&#39;m 27. I&#39;m guessing you aren&#39;t older than say, 35? We&#39;ve both been on this planet not really that long. We were born with no knowledge and with time we constructed our notions. The assessment of personal experience needs some kind of outside validation, because we are not at all times aware of the possible explanations for everything. We don&#39;t possess all data needed to analyse our own experience with exactitude. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re in Alabama and I&#39;m in Kentucky and you get a little piece of paper with nothing but a birth date and a location on it and you go into a state of deep concentration and explain not only that I have an ailment that no other doctor has been able to find, but you also prescribe an antidote that - although it sounds <em>extremely</em> unorthodox (&quot;take chicken feet and molasses&quot;, for example - something NO doctor would ever prescribe as a remedy) - and I take this &quot;medicine&quot; and I&#39;m cured, then what does that say?</p>

<p>What does that say?  What about that is &quot;discrediting&quot; exactly?</p>

<p>Now, if this happened only ONCE in your life, then somehow, someone who is sufficiently obstinate can allege that this was &quot;Blind luck.  Nothing more.&quot;  What if it happened thousands of times though?  Can&#39;t say it&#39;s blind luck.  Then what?</p>

<p>Again, <em>what</em> does that say?  What exactly about Edgar Cayce&#39;s situation do you find &quot;not credible&quot;.  It&#39;s not enough to simply say such a thing.  One has to have a sound argument for the allegation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I tell you one says X, the other says Y, you say, the X was proven. Well, the Y doesn&#39;t believe that, and that&#39;s the point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah but the Y doesn&#39;t actually have a sound, logical argument, and X <em>does</em>.  Saying &quot;It&#39;s all b.s.&quot; is simply not enough. - especially when you&#39;re faced with the wealth of verifiable documentation regarding the phenomenon in question.  Again, saying, &quot;Nope.  Still don&#39;t believe it.&quot; is simply not enough.  That&#39;s simply not critical or intelligent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Cayce&#39;s story in particular, some things stand out. Atlantis. The wrong prediction that the USA would find a Death Ray used in Atlantis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that a Death Ray <em>wasn&#39;t</em> found in Atlantis?  And you know this exactly how? because the MSM didn&#39;t announce it for all to know about?  I&#39;m not sure this is a good barometer to judge such a thing - especially considering the insane pension TPTB have for outright lying to the masses at <em>every</em> possible turn.  I&#39;m not saying a Death Ray <em>was</em> found.  I don&#39;t know one way or the other.  However, I&#39;m not certain that the barometer you&#39;re using is sound enough to allege that the prediction <em>was</em> indeed false.  Just saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Red herrings, I say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of whether Death Rays were or were not found in Atlantis, I don&#39;t see how Cayce&#39;s mentioning it qualifies as a red herring fallacy.  A red herring fallacy for what?  What was it designed to distract from?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eben Alexander&#39;s story is also nothing more than a common claim of a near death experienced</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?  A &quot;common&quot; claim?  You call it that after I thoroughly explained how exactly it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> &quot;common&quot; at all that this individual in particular had this experience and you still say it&#39;s a &quot;common&quot; claim?  That&#39;s like my trying to make the argument that Usain Bolt <em>isn&#39;t</em> the fastest human on the planet by throwing about the word &quot;common&quot; in relation to his running.</p>

<p>&quot;Meh.  He&#39;s just a common runner.  That&#39;s all.  Nothing to see here, folks.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What additional information?  Please bring it to the fore so that I can understand it as well.  Who said it and when/where?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plus, just the basic countours of his story, his &quot;stay in heaven&quot; per say, make no sense at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?  Why not?  Again, please explain how they &quot;make no sense at all&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why wouldn&#39;t his sister tell him she was his sister?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this the litmus test by which you assess the validity of what he says?  Really?  Come on, my brother.  You have to come up with better than that.  That&#39;s simply not any sort of qualification for why a phenomenon &quot;couldn&#39;t possibly have happened&quot; - <em>especially</em> when one accounts for being in a different state of consciousness during the phenomenon in question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would certainly be more proof if he had woken up and said &quot;Wow, I have a sister&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um...he <em>did</em> actually.  You just kind of validated his claim for him right there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You meet the brother you never met, you say something. Dude was allucinating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word is Hallucinating with an &quot;h&quot;, my man.  How could he have been hallucinating when he didn&#39;t even know he HAD a sister that looked like that in the first place?  Hallucinating the correct image of something that you did not previously have any awareness of is NOT what a hallucination is.  That&#39;s not a hallucination.  That&#39;s a vision at the very least - something far different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>kudos to Plato, I mean, without him we wouldn&#39;t have sexless infatuations, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naw, man.  Paraplatonic relationships existed LOOOONG before Plato.  Go back to India way before him, and such a relationship between spiritual students and their disciples was quite common actually.  It&#39;s super common even today in India.  The West is an infant barely crawling out of the womb of intelligence compared to the East.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just a joke, I&#39;m no discrediting Plato in any way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No worries.  I don&#39;t have much for or against him.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing is, Emotions have nothing to do with knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is summarily incorrect, as they are both connected and influence one another.  I&#39;m quiet surprised that you don&#39;t know this since it is you that claim to value the physical sciences as much as you say you do.  There are studies that have been done showing that the verbalizing and intellectualizing of certain thoughts cause the experiencing of emotions that wouldn&#39;t otherwise have occurred had the thought <em>not</em> been verbalized/intellectualized in the first place.</p>

<p>There is <em>definitely</em> a very real link between knowledge and emotions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We had earlier established that facts had no morality, neither do they have feelings or emotions. That&#39;s in us, that&#39;s human. It doesn&#39;t bring us knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, but facts are not the same thing as knowledge, my man.  Facts are independent of the observer.  They just are.  A tree exists whether there&#39;s a human eye aware of its existence or not.  The knowledge of a tree that has particular significance in the life of a certain individual, however, might cause a great welling up of emotion in that person.  The knowledge of that same tree might elicit a completely different emotion in another person.</p>

<p>That being said, I personally don&#39;t remember when/where we established that facts have no morality...But I&#39;ll take your word that we said that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I mean is that I was reading that, and I thought it could describe yourself and your arguments here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that this is what you or anyone could think.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No disrespect taken.  I&#39;m enjoying the discussion as well.</p>

<p>I actually <em>didn&#39;t</em> notice the flaws you pointed out above, as I noticed that your contentions themselves had flaws, which I also pointed out.  I guess a few things have to get ironed out in what you said before they are really and truly &quot;flaws&quot; that you pointed out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our perception is flawed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most certainly.  At the end of the day, one must even question Descartes supposed axiom &quot;Cogito ergo sum.&quot;  Personal experience alone should not suffice for what is and is not real.  However - as I stated earlier - it is the foundation upon which all other experiences we have are based, for we cannot have <em>any</em> experiences in this physical realm without first apprehending reality through the senses we posses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know how old you are. I&#39;m 27. I&#39;m guessing you aren&#39;t older than say, 35?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m 40.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve both been on this planet not really that long. We were born with no knowledge and with time we constructed our notions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a great deal of study showing that this is actually pretty much wholly incorrect.  We are born with not only <em>much</em> knowledge, but - even more so - with many heavily preconceived emotional patterns existing in us from long before we were born in this particular body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The assessment of personal experience needs some kind of outside validation, because we are not at all times aware of the possible explanations for everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems fair enough.</p>

<p>Most certainly not.  Agreed.</p>

<p>You talk about the Cayce&#39;s accounts as if you were SURE they actually happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  I talk about what was documented in the Cayce accounts by various individuals in the same manner that you or anyone else talks about what was documented in <em>other</em> accounts and studies by other individuals.  What&#39;s the difference?  People have just been told and indoctrinated to accept one type of account (&quot;conventional&quot; ones explained to them by people in lab coats looked upon as &quot;authorities&quot;) more easily than they accept any other type of account.  Again, what&#39;s the difference?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how do you know that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think about all the things in your/our life that we walk around and take for granted, at the end of the day, it really seems like a <em>lot</em> of what we regard and assume is true - regardless of <em>who</em> has been the source we refer to in deriving that information - is really based upon <em>blind belief</em>.  And why is that?  Well, it&#39;s for various reasons, not the least of which is the fact that we are not generally optimally educated to know about the things that some of those whose information we trust as true are.  There is indeed some information that we can check and recheck on our own, but are all of us equipped with electron scanning microscopes in our living rooms or have a $1M budget to research certain types of projects?  No.  Of course not.  Therefore, what we tend to do is read other publications that we&#39;ve accepted as &quot;trusted sources&quot; on certain matters.  The moment you get to <em>that</em> level of inquiry, however, you relinquish your hold upon more verifiable data.  Eventually, it seems that this hold <em>is</em> indeed relinquished sooner or later - be that in the disciplines of the hard sciences, the &quot;alternative sciences&quot; as they are called, social media, or even (heck, <em>especially</em>) politics.</p>

<p>All this is to say that when you really stop to think about it, the <em>majority</em> of our world and how we regard it is, unfortunately, based upon blind belief.  Often the difference between what belief we happen to regard as true and which one we happen to regard as false is based upon what the prevailing forces forging this society manipulate us into gravitating toward - into <em>believing</em> is true.  That is a dangerous, dangerous thing, for we end up crawling along our lives often blindly abiding by a set of beliefs that we trust as &quot;fact&quot; when these things are in reality little more than what we have been indoctrinated to believe is the case with no more justification for its truth than any other type of falsehood.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you might think that I focus too much on information that is too nebulous and gossamer to effectively verify.  It seems to me that you are stuck in an extremely limited, physical, mechanistic interpretation of the world around you.</p>

<p>The truth, I imagine, includes both perspectives and is not limited by either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, they didn&#39;t find no Death Rays. &quot;The Government Lies&quot; can&#39;t be a justification for everything that we don&#39;t know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not really a very good, very logical argument in favor of the claim that you previously made - especially when one takes into account the almost unimaginable extent to which the government <em>has</em> in fact been verifiably shown to regularly (if not almost constantly) lie to the public.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hallucination is &quot;Alucinação&quot; in Portuguese, my native language, so I guess I mixed the two.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No worries.  My native language is Spanish - one that is <em>very</em> similar to yours.  :)</p>

<p>The link you provided is 1) published by Esquire - a mainstream media magazine <em>not</em> renowned for its ability to spew much more than the standard, cookie cutter rhetoric and myths regarding the prevailing perspectives of the time.  The fact that you use <em>this</em> as your source for what to believe is valid or not on this issue does NOT bode well for any real, critical analysis.  I&#39;m not sure, for example, that I would give the article any more credence or weight than I would give <a href="http://www.btci.org/bioethics/2012/videos2012/vid3.html">this</a> interview with the doctor himself.</p>

<p>...and no worries on the red herring mistake.  Your willingness to admit that you were erred is an indication that you are also willing to be a much sharper truth seeker than the average individual.  This is a good thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be too sure if Jainism applies to your statement or even definition of religion in general because Jainism is generally a very all-inclusive philosophy that does not focus too much on any one particular deity or anthropomorphic being as much as it concentrates on &quot;God&quot; as an abstract, all-encompassing energy that &quot;Is&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Isn&#39;t this exactly the same thing religion has been doing for thousands of years?&quot;</p>

<p>No it is not. I suggest you separate religious &quot;institutions&quot; from the spiritual teachings that those institutions profess to be the experts on. The religious institutions are ALL guilty of the sins of man and should never be trusted but the spirituality behind these religions need to be re-discovered, as the truth behind them has been covered up and misinterpreted for centuries. Islam aside, the spirituality behind ALL main religions, are based on spiritual truth or facts, but the institutions themselves have corrupted it. I am not professing any specific religion here but I do want to say that for the NWO to flourish, it must have an atheistic population that believes in nothing but the material world. And if we here at r/conspiracy are interested in living in freedom, we cannot be intolerant to those who have a spiritual beliefs. But this is a serious issue because the dis-belief and dis-regard for the spiritual world is the reason behind world chaos today and further searching for ONLY material and physical solutions to the this world chaos will lead us nowhere!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not ATHEISM that is to blame, like the Catholic church is to blame for various spiritual dogmas or outright spiritual lies, but the beliefs that arises around atheism...specifically the outright disregard for the spiritual world. </p>

<p>There is a little something called &quot;spiritual science&quot; in this world and it has been entirely ignored by the &quot;common&quot; man, but I assure you, it is not ignored by the elite! Let me emphasize that...the DARK POWERS that control the world&#39;s finances are aware of the existence of the spiritual world and they DO NOT WANT YOU TO BE AWARE OF IT! The whole purpose behind the movie ZEITGEIST was to instill this lie into the souls of the conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>So called &quot;satanism&quot; or &quot;illuminati satanic rituals&quot;  are actually perverted uses of this &quot;spiritual science&quot; which is in fact called &quot;black magic&quot;. It does exist and it does not contradict any physical science findings, but adds to them. Advertising is in effect a branch of black magic, albeit a weak one (but still effective) and the elite use it all the time.</p>

<p>I am not here to spread any dogma or religious belief but I will tell you that the insistence of their only being a physical material world and that the spiritual world is made up fantasy, is a recipe for chaos and disaster. The spiritual world is fed up with not being believed in, and even the &quot;religious&quot; people that you mention are only paying a weak lip service to their faith and they are no further ahead than a pure materialist.</p>

<p>I am not recommending that everyone abandon their beliefs (atheistic ones or spiritual ones) and embrace spirituality willy nilly but to do so with full consciousness, awareness, and an open mind...one should look deeply into their lives and their thought processes and explore EVERYTHING that ALL religions have to offer. The belief in FAITH and AUTHORITY are to be replaced by CONSCIOUSNESS. But to achieve a state of mind of pure freedom is not easy. I digress.</p>

<p>And one final thing, technocracy is the inevitable outcome of a purely materialistic outlook and will lead directly to a type science based fascism which America is poised to enact.</p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that a spiritual realm or methaphysical world exists. Plus your theory contradicts itself easily. The elite uses religion to control the masses, they do spread the belief in the supernatural, not the opposite. Governments mostly protect religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say atheists are immoral I am saying that physical science IS immoral (amoral really) without bringing something other than physical science into it. Atheists often bring a lot of human warmth into themselves but I am afraid that it is not the science that is bringing the morality, but the human being and his or her cultural upbringing and link to the spiritual world.</p>

<p>Marketing and Advertising, as you describe it, is the basis for magic as magic is the ability to achieve something with out direct contact. You use your CREATIVITY, which springs from your IMAGINATION and INSPIRATION, to coerce a human being&#39;s mindset to the one of your choosing. That is basic magic. Black Magic would be to use it for selfish purposes, like Walmart&#39;s never ending striving for profits. (wishing for a never ending flow of gold is a little bit greedy isn&#39;t it?)</p>

<p>The elite do not use religion to control the masses. The engage in the religious institution&#39;s rhetoric to co-opt it&#39;s audience to make them believe that they believe in the same things  as you. </p>

<p>Why would that be a problem? You see, Science doesn&#39;t need to bring morality. Facts aren&#39;t moral. You can call it spiritual world, I can call it human nature, but the fact is that people ARE mostly moral. Science doesn&#39;t need to provide morality, it seeks to provide knowledge. Fundies often complain about the ruthlessness of evolution. Nature in itself is not moral. What if morality isn&#39;t Godly or spiritual, but just human?</p>

<p>Greed isn&#39;t a good thing, capitalism is lethal, but what does that have to do with magic? Creativity, imagination and inspiration happen in the brain. Why would they be magic? You&#39;re just calling physical processes magic. </p>

<p>You seem to just put together the worst humanity as to offer (greed, deceit, selfishness) and call it dark arts. Those are just bad things. What makes them dark arts? If I&#39;m mean to someone, is that black magic? Or was I just a bad person?</p>

<p>Realize that the supernatural realm is largely (but not entirely) <em>about</em> feelings and intuitions as it stands, so your saying that it&#39;s more &quot;this&quot; than &quot;that&quot; is a bit awkward when the &quot;this&quot; <em>is</em> actually the &quot;that&quot; and includes it (i.e., and again, a large part of the supernatural <em>is</em> largely about feelings and intuitions).</p>

<p>What?  Where did you get that from?  &quot;Science is wrong&quot;??  Where are you getting that from?  I said nothing of the like.  Not only that, but it would actually be VERY uncritical and unintelligent for you or anyone to outright reject something and refuse to investigate or take a look at something <em>in principle</em>.  Part of effectively finding the truth in something is to &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot;, and refusing to even LOOK at certain things often leads to pretty incorrect and mistaken understandings.</p>

<p>Regardless, however, I - as I already stated - didn&#39;t say &quot;science is wrong&quot;.  That&#39;s actually quite preposterous for anyone to have come to that interpretation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re talking logic and reason here, not speculation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  Right now, you&#39;re talking and dealing with speculation and not a very good ability to actually <em>apply</em> reason.  No disrespect, but you&#39;re simply not thinking very properly or logically, so the science and rationality that you&#39;re using is not being applied very correctly or effectively.</p>

<p>This is in great part what&#39;s wrong with many individuals that rely too exclusively on that remedial, superficial, very limited version of science that is for the most part practiced in today&#39;s day and age.</p>

<p>I never bought reincarnation, but I will make a note and will read about those studies you mentioned with an open mind.</p>

<p>Skepticism</p>

<p>I understand. Let me just say, I didn&#39;t find the word one day and decided &quot;I&#39;m gonna be a skeptic and call my self one&quot;. I think the term that better applies to me is probably &quot;rationalist&quot;? The thing is, since a very young age I have always detected flaws in logic, in people&#39;s reasoning and have been very (logically) critical of things in general. Now, I do find some truth when you say that sometimes skeptics aren&#39;t really that skeptical. I think you&#39;re talking about predisposition to trust specific sources, like, in my case, the consensus of the scientific community at large. I am by no means what some here would call a sheep, though. I am very critical of mainstream culture and the media, I just don&#39;t think the reasons behind its shittiness are the same as some of the so-called &quot;conspiracy theory community&quot;, or whatever. But I digress, about trusting specific sources, I think we get there based on logical reasoning and not just because of the apparent status of trust worthiness of said institutions. Call it a tool or crutches. I do accept that it can&#39;t be argued that is not 100% skepticism.</p>

<p>You seem nice too! I don&#39;t take it to heart because honestly I am like that too a big deal of the time. I decided to leave that element out when starting this specific discussion and it has proven productive. Like you, I also abandon my roughness when I find receptiveness for intelligent conversation on the other side.</p>

<p>Talking now about your spiritual experiences, this raises an interesting question for me. Let me start by saying that I too have thought I was experiencing supernatural phenomena. My parents in particular told me a lot of personal stories about weird shit that happened to them and their families growing up. I was also religious so that helped. The thing is, I came to understand the logical reasons behind all those things I thought were supernatural. Some were caused by my anxiety problems, just to give an example. </p>

<p>What I&#39;d like to ask is if, just like my bias towards a merely physical reality and physical based evidence, isn&#39;t there a possibility that you have the same bias towards metaphysical things? My main point is, just like I might not be 100% skeptical when it comes to for example accepting the scientific consensus, maybe you are not being as critical as you normally are when analysing those spiritual experiences either?</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s certainly a <em>lot</em> more than what I explained alone.  That much is certainly true, for I know very, very little.  However, the understanding that I do have of the spiritual realm comes from not only my own personal experiences, but from an ongoing level of investigation I&#39;ve done of various studies that have been undertaken by minds much greater than mine on the subject.</p>

<p>Have you ever been to Pluto?  No?  How do you know it exists then?  How do you know it&#39;s real?  It&#39;s because a lot of evidence exists in favor of the idea that it indeed real.</p>

<p>2) When speaking about a otherwordly reality, do you mean just a &quot;spiritual universe&quot; that runs parallel and can at times intersect (randomly or by human action) with ours or do you also believe in life after death?</p>

<p>Well, these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive &quot;either/or&quot; scenarios.  <em>Both</em> can most definitely be the case.  That being said, however, I&#39;m not referring to a spiritual universe that runs parallel to this one.  I&#39;m referring to a spiritual reality that <em>includes</em> the very reality we&#39;re experiencing now.  It pervades existence and is indeed greatly responsible for it.  It&#39;s not something that runs beside and &quot;parallel&quot; to what we are experiencing now.  It <em>is</em> what we are experiencing now - in part anyway.  This realm is a necessary but not a sufficient aspect to encompass and describe the spiritual realm.</p>
