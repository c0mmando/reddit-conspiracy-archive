    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely correct and I&#39;m just here to add onto your point</p>

<p>America&#39;s population today is too large to cast each person&#39;s individual vote. The time is would take to cast everyone&#39;s vote would be too long, especially in the event of a serious threat. Not to mention the potential of error when handling that mass amount of votes. </p>

<p>Like the person above me stated, we vote on people who we believe will represent us with the best interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not a bad idea. The term &quot;app&quot; just sounds so unimpressive, but sincerely, why do we need centralized representative government when we can quickly and efficiently represent ourselves? If you do not wish to be politically active, that is your choice, but as a member of the society you are allocated one vote that you may delegate it to another. We could easily have a <em>de</em>-centralized representative government with thousands of representatives that are much, much more representative of the people. The internet and cheap enough computers can provide an instantaneous communication to every citizen whenever it is needed. Nearly 100% voting turnout, too.</p>

<p>I recognize security is an issue, both online and offline with this method of government. But, in my mind anyway, it seems like a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Yeah, let&#39;s let Bubba of Bumfuck, Alabama have a say in declaring war. Having a national vote-on-war day makes perfect sense, why aren&#39;t you running the country?</p>

<p>Congress is hardly an amazing group of do gooders, but at least they&#39;re privy to intelligence info and <em>possibly</em> have some education on the issue.</p>

<p>We voted for them, and if they want to keep their jobs, they have to do things so that we vote for them again. Do you understand how our government works? It&#39;s definitely not a perfect system, maybe it&#39;s a shitty system, but no smart person would argue for an open vote on something like war...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure all of us know the consequences of a wrong choice in declaring war. </p>

<p>Thing is, these 535 people were elected by the people to represent their voices in our government. Therefore, they technically are our voices that we entrusted to be in office. They may be corrupt, selfish, dumb, ignorant, childish, but they&#39;re still our representatives. Besides, in the country of the blind, the one eyed-man (or men in this case) are king.</p>

<p>What kind of public voting is wanted? How would it be structured? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though I agree that you think the American public should vote on certain occasions like Syria as it&#39;s offensive, and not a defensive initiative. However it is because of some archaic methods of system why it&#39;s not left to the Public. </p>

<p>We established a constitution where as an elected official must represent his constituents in Congress. Those constituents no matter what party they elect must abide by the reps decision. This comes with agreement as that area such as a state. Was admitted to the Union through agreement has to abide by such regulations.</p>

<p>Secondly- the fact is in times of what is considered national interest and safety of the republic. A faster method of going to a defensive attack is set by the War Powers Act to allow the President immediate response, but has to get approval from congress in 90 days. Yes, the president does not even have to get a declaration of war from Congress. As fucked as that seems. It&#39;s upheld by the Supreme Court as legal.</p>

<p>Example a nuclear ICBM strike has occurred, and the President does not have time to call Congress for approval to strike back.</p>

<p>Third - like in Pearl Harbor attack. Congress met the very next day to declare war. Doing through public voting would cost valuable time to prevent further attacks, and such voting would have delayed the ability for Pacific operations to go on the offense against the Japanese such as Midway which was a turning point. General voting just flat out take to long. There would be debates etc... That&#39;s why you are supposed to vote in a good representative. Not two party clones that take bribes from lobbyists Lords of war like the political whores they are.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you hear the White House spiel about Syria not only using chemicals as inhumane but also a threat to national security. That argument of national security in the best interest of the USA allows Obama to do what he wants without Congress approval.</p>

<p>Did that help?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is everything you can do about it. Regime changes are brought about by the populace uniting as one and fighting to their very last breath for it. Sadly first world countries are so under the thumb of fear and confusion (and comfort that they are not willing to lose) that this is very unlikely to happen. It CAN be done but we are all so indoctrinated and sedated that we aren&#39;t prepared to risk our own comfort and lives for it. 
EDIT: it will take a world war to scare us back in to a true perspective of freedom</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware of all of the geopolitical happenings of the world? Are you educated enough to make a sound decision on the future of our country? While I don&#39;t agree with nation building, regime change, unnecessary wars and the like, I do not even remotely believe that we would be better off leaving decisions like that to the populace. </p>

<p>Think of after 9/11 and the emotions of the country. Propaganda would be that much more effective. We elect our representatives on the basis that they represent our general views and will use their experience and intelligence to make rational decisions for the betterment of their constituency. If they don&#39;t, they don&#39;t get reelected. </p>

<p>Think of all of the things that require Top Secret clearance to know about? We don&#39;t know and will never know 99% of the intelligence gathered by the government that goes into making decisions like going to war. You can form your own opinion on how you feel about that. </p>

<p>How informed is the average citizen on current affairs? How many people could you go ask &quot;Describe to me how you feel about the current situation in Syria.&quot;? Very, very few even know something is going on and even fewer have thought enough about it to have an opinion. And you wonder why these people aren&#39;t deciding my fate as an Air Force Officer?</p>

<p>People much smarter than all of us put the current system in place. If it were used as it was intended, it would work. It&#39;s unfortunate that people don&#39;t realize how serious disobeying The Constitution and Bill of Rights is.  </p>
