    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ll do the strikes and make sure the rebels are given intel on weak positions and battle groups of the SAA. This is not about chemical weapons. That was the excuse to weaken the SAA by taking out the runways, taking out ammo dumps and taking out defensive missiles and batteries.</p>

<p>I think this was done because they miscalculated Assad&#39;s army and resilience to their state sponsored terror groups and now they need to take out key assets to pave the way for regime change which is absolutely illegal, even with a UN mandate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As happened with libya, Russia and China were &#39;&#39;fooled&#39;&#39; in a way to authorizing UNSC force. I expect whatever &quot;limited&quot; or &quot;surgical&quot; strikes to do more than whatever they say they will. As for another false flag, do you think they&#39;ll do another one or is the aug 21 the one they&#39;ll settle with?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ll do the strike and then assess the damage to his assets and provide intel to where they rebels should target weaknesses. If it goes wrong again, they can pull another false flag for round 2. Watch what happens after the first strike very closely and you will see the change in attitude if it doesn&#39;t go right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t obvious but as the details come then it started to look like a set up. They keep repeating what they&#39;ve said over and over and narrowing the debate. We already have seen the horrible videos of people in difficulties and dying but that&#39;s not an indication of who actually did it and neither is anything else they&#39;ve offered.</p>

<p>Remember, everyone being critical or skeptical of this attack is a product of the Iraq war, it&#39;s nobodies fault but certain elements of the Bush Administration and past US false flag attacks in other wars. This is again another revelation for people that don&#39;t call themselves conspiracy theorists because you can put the information out when people are willing to look at it. That&#39;s a good thing for everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to me it was obvious right away before any details came out. All I needed to know was that 1)whats the point of a chemical attack in a war that you&#39;re not losing, and 2)3 days after UN inspectors arrived. Also, how do you defend against people calling you or saying the stuff you say is &#39;&#39;conspiracy theory&#39;&#39; stuff? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why I don&#39;t jump to a conclusion anymore is because it puts conspiracy theorists in bad light. You can just wait a few days, collect up some information and go from there. I did immediately think it was bizarre but going all out immediately just makes people scoff at the idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What kind of training with the Army?  If he is just out of Basic Military Training, then they will be pumping them up to fight a battle.  If he is leaving a technical training school, then they will do the same to get people prepared to fight.  Based on the speech I just saw from the President, I think there is a very strong possibility this will happen.  I am due to the leave the Middle East soon and I just might move my flight to the left so I can get out of here sooner.  Obama said he could make the use of military force effective in one day, one week, or one month. I think that is writing on the wall...  despite what I think, what my family thinks and what the American people think.  So far, on average, 8 out of 10 folks I&#39;ve spoken with (military included) do not want this war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those few don&#39;t necessarily want a war, they believe that Assad&#39;s regime committed the offense of using chemical warfare on his citizens.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what makes this whole thing crazy. You have hardly anyone in support of military intervention, and the media is still blatantly ignoring it as well as avoiding the fact that we have yet to be shown any evidence that Assad was behind the attacks, which to me is a very big deal. If they can&#39;t let the people of the world see this evidence, then they lose all legitimacy and credibility. We actually have more evidence that the rebels and Saudis were responsible. I find it eerie how such a large group of people can put up such an obvious front, even when people all around the world are calling bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a very big deal; ditto that!  Due to the bullshit that was rammed down everyone&#39;s throat back in 2003, this US gubbment does not have the credibility to just say, &quot;read the reports of the unclassified intelligence and formulate your own opinion,&quot; -- I believe Biden recently said something along those paraphrased lines.  </p>
