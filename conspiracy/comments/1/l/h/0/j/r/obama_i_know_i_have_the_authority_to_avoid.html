       Obama showing his tyrannical personality in his speech. The Government gave themselves that authority, in direct violation of the constitution.
This is some disgusting war-mongering. The people don't want this, yet Obama and his office will not listen to reason. Most people currently believe that Assad had nothing to do with that chemical attack, but Obama continues to claim that our evidence isn't legitimate by denying it's existence (which is some bullshit). He's the one spreading lies, he couldn't present proof of Assad's guilt. Why can't he present this evidence; what hard ould come from making it public? There's is no national security threat, I think they just don't have anything concrete.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every other nation decided to stay away from this attack, we're allowing something incredibly stupid to occur. I just hope that when the assault begins, it doesn't end in horrible bloodshed.

       America isn't a true democracy anymore. The President, and his office, aren't there to represent the people. Instead, they represent Banks, Corporations, the Wealthy, and powerful private interests. It's no longer their job to represent us; we can only gain representation by getting out there to persuade the public with our message.

       Congress isn't back from recess until September 9th. Who wants to bet that there'll be some new development in the Syria situation before then that "forces action"?  I reaaaally doubt they're going to wait that long.

       tyrannical personality, haha. he totally DOES have the authority to legally avoid congressional debate if operations last less than 60 days; he's referring to the war powers resolution of 1973. the funny part is that HE'S NOT EVEN GOING TO INVOKE IT. HE TOTALLY COULD, BUT HE'S NOT. this is getting a congressional vote, so... what the fuck is the problem here?

       he was going to bypass congress to start a war that wasn't in self-defense. A direct violation of the constitution. The only reason he is going through Congress is because he received over a hundred letters by senators (Not Senators, but Representatives I believe. Look it up.), angry that they've been bypassed.

       BankerShanker is right....a first year law student can tell you that the WPR of 1973 does not give the President the right to strike Syria. Congressional approval is required unless a specific statute authorizes the President to act OR a national emergency is created by an attack upon the US, it's territories or armed forces.  Syria has violated no statute (nor international law) and they certainly have not attacked the US.....as to the number of letters received, BS clearly states above that Representatives are included in his 100+ letter total, not just Senators, on the plus side it's good to see that a few of these posters at least know we have 100 senators. That's a good start.
