    <div class="md"><p>No, although some Jewish activists made this claim, this is not true. </p>

<p>Icke has been more or less constant in his descriptions of the lizard people. He describes how people might be <em>possessed</em> by outer dimenson entities and can look lizard like. He makes the case that these outer dimensional entities often target certain bloodlines of the elite. According to Icke these bloodlines do come from various backgrounds, most aren&#39;t Jewish. </p>

<p>Here is a video in which Icke gives his explanation:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAGTJErVNBU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAGTJErVNBU</a></p>

<p><em>David Icke, The Lizards and The Jews</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2ypYcZ7qfw">full documentary 48:55</a> is a documentary which is both entertaining and quite illuminating. It shows what Icke believes and how he is attacked by activists for the things he says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They Live is an early John Carpenter film in which a construction worker uncovers the reality that signals are being broadcast to brainwash the population of Earth into not noticing otherworldy entities that make up the societal elite.</p>

<p>He finds a pair of sunglasses that let him see through the disguises these elites wear and also allow him to see past the bunk on television and advertisements. Basically, the elite are these ugly reptilian humanoids, and all the advertisements and televisions broadcast simple messages of &quot;obey&quot;  and &quot;consume.&quot;</p>

<p>Ayahuasca is amazing from what I&#39;ve heard, I&#39;ve been priveleged enough to meet two people who&#39;d participated in ceremonies in South America. I&#39;m currently reading <em>DMT The Spirit Molecule</em> by Rick Strassman, M.D. </p>

<p>I could elaborate on DMT if you&#39;d like. Pretty fascinating stuff, and it&#39;s over so quick. &quot;Illumination&quot; is a word that comes to mind. &quot;Enlightenment.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True enough. A racist could still tell me what day of the week it is. </p>

<p>I think it boils down to beliefs vs truth. I&#39;d like to think that someone that is truly enlightened wouldn&#39;t be so remedial as to be trapped by thoughts of racism, bigotry, hatred, etc. All stupid, ignorant, simplistic human emotions. </p>

<p>So, if someone seems to hold the ultimate truth and knowledge, yet says it has to do with hating a group of people based on race, religion, ethnicity, gender, etc. I just don&#39;t believe it to truly be the ultimate truth. I could say &quot;I&#39;ve learned the secret to life and it&#39;s to hate all Samoans!&quot; I could be preaching loving one another and treating others with kindness, everybody, except Samoans. It doesn&#39;t make my &quot;love one another&quot; any less true, but if I&#39;m subjected to hate someone else, how can I say I&#39;m more enlightened than the rest of us?</p>

<p>I just think having that big of a flaw ends up throwing stains on the rest of your truth. That&#39;s all. </p>

<p>The irony here is admitting that you do NOT fully understand the universe, yet arbitrarily disregarding any input from a source based on an opinion they have, rather than a fact they present. </p>

<p>Beyond that, you really DON&#39;T understand the universe.  What if race or religious alignment did have some component in the way reality unfolds? </p>

<p>If that race or religion DID want to subvert detection, it would be wise to train the populace to instinctively and without second thought dismiss the opinion, as well as any facts that accompany.  As well as reviling the one who dare utter such contemptuous speech. </p>

I&#39;m not hoping for someone to hand me anything, I&#39;m simply open to everyone&#39;s thoughts and ideas, then using what works for me and discarding what doesn&#39;t. That seems like a good strategy, at least for me it is.</p>

<p>And even if somehow, the people behind the world&#39;s problems <em>could</em> be categorized by one race and/or religion, to hate and denigrate EVERYONE of that race/religion would be completely idiotic and asinine. Their race/religion doesn&#39;t make them do terrible things, they are terrible people who just so happen to be part of that race/religion.

<p>That is some doubleplusgood duckspeak there, citizen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to hate and denigrate EVERYONE of that race/religion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Settle down.  Just because someone say a gang of Norwegians knocked over a liquor store doesn&#39;t mean that all Norwegians knocked over a liquor store.</p>

<p>I am simply hoping to open your mind.  You are combative towards people who dare dislike a group (or subgroup, if you will) of people based on shared traits, one of which happens to be race.</p>

<p>That itself may not be entirely poor judgement, but to allow that feeling that you have (that race is their sole complaint) to taint the information they present (that certain groups are performing great evil) is tremendous folly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love everyone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Including those who mean you harm?</p>

<p>Please understand that this is a <em>learned</em> behaviour.  You have been taught to love everyone (or think you do).  What value is it to love those that mean you harm?  Perhaps divine mandate could convince you to accept or understand those who mean you harm, but to love?</p>

<p>I do wish to continue this conversation, so let me know If I am off-putting.</p>

<p>I simply believe that your adversity to racism (while not bad in and of itself) is a symptom of extensive conditioning which could cloud your judgement of events unfolding around you.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t buy that the sinking of the Titanic was a conspiracy to off people opposed to the Federal Reserve Act if for no other reason than it seems like a lot of effort to go through when there was no real guarantee that the people they wanted to kill would be killed (they were but they could have easily been among the saved).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty of very similar experiences when people take DMT of strange reptilian figures but that could be shared psychology. Still, I&#39;ve read a lot of people who have taken it and never knew what to expect and explained the same sort of themes that other people experience.</p>
