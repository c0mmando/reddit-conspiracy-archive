    <div class="md"><p>Fuck that.  Calling representatives or petitioning is NOT &quot;doing what we can.&quot;  That&#39;s some weak bullshit is what that is.  If we REALLY want to do something about this, we need to come together and FILL THE STREETS, etc.  Physically protest.  Demonstrate IN PERSON.</p>

<p>Anything else is lip service for a weak minded citizenry trying to save face so everyone can then give themselves a collective pat on the back and say &quot;Well, we tried.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, that&#39;s bullshit.  Don&#39;t kid yourself as to what it is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say I&#39;m personally better than you or anyone else, by the way.  I&#39;m not doing enough <em>either</em>.  I&#39;m not getting up and marching on the streets by myself or anything.  I have marched in various protests, but it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve organized any &quot;Anti Syrian War&quot; campaign or whatever, so, again, I&#39;m not calling YOU out any more than I&#39;m calling out ALL of us - myself included.</p>

<p>This.</p>

<p>Full.  Scale.  Mother fucking.  Protest.</p>

<p>Everyone, as you said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or no one will turn their heads toward us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  Look what happened to Occupy Wall Street.  That was a great movement that got co-opted and destroyed <em>real</em> fucking fast by TPTB moles.  I marched and was in it, but still not enough people came together en mass to really make real change happen.</p>

<p>Pretty much EVERYONE (as you said) needs to come together and move forward <em>together</em>.  That&#39;s the key.  Together...and that&#39;s also part of what makes it so difficult.  TPTB have indoctrinated us into NOT being together so that we&#39;re not generally smart enough to stage mass, <em>mass</em> protests against them.  They knew what they were doing when brainwashing us with this doctrine of &quot;uniqueness!&quot; and &quot;separation!&quot;.  &quot;Stand <em>out</em> from the crowd!  Yeh!&quot;</p>

<p>And we went on along with it like good sheep.  Most of us very much <em>still</em> go along with it, having no idea that this is the very thing that is keeping us from putting aside all our petty differences, coming together en mass, and marching against tptb so that we can have a better world for ourselves and each other...</p>

<p>Yeah.  You&#39;re right.  That&#39;s why so many of us HAVEN&#39;T taken to the street...It&#39;s because we think we&#39;re alone.  We don&#39;t have solidarity.  There&#39;s safety in numbers.  If we think we&#39;re alone though, we get cold feet and stay home.</p>

<p>Yes.  This is what I think regularly enough.</p>

<p>Then I also think that I&#39;ll be looked upon as just another crazy kook for walking alone with a sign, and I end up staying home... :/</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m in Los Angeles and we had one of the biggest, sustained demonstrations in the nation - spread out over quite a while actually.</p>

<p>And then it just trickled and died...and everything went back to being the same it seemed.</p>

<p>Hell, just today, I passed by the site of Michael Hastings&#39; murder.  This is how it <a href="http://parklabreanewsbeverlypress.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MIchaelHastings.gif"><em>used</em></a> to <a href="http://www.laobserved.com/manage/assets_c/2013/07/michael-hastings-memorial-jg-thumb-480x360-21346.jpg">look like</a>.  <a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1376540.1371644390!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/usa-journalist-carcrash.jpg">This</a> is how it looked like today (minus the flowers) - i.e. <em>empty</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like the shit never even happened...and TPTB are laughing all the way to another war in Syria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was there for a good while...It&#39;s gone now though - like the &quot;after&quot; picture I sent without the bouquet of flowers.  There&#39;s pretty much nothing there now but the slightly chewed up base of the tree where his car slammed into.  It&#39;s like it never happened.  Thousands of people pass that site every day and I imagine a good portion of them have no idea that this is where something like that happened.</p>

<p>To be fair, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s the case for a LOT of places all over the Earth though, you know?  I actually think about that often - wondering what significant events occurred in and around areas that I pass or drive or walk by that at the time I pass them seem like nothing but innocuous locations.</p>

<p>I digress though...</p>

wondering what significant events occurred in and around areas that I pass&gt; 
somebody should be there to let it be known that happened there. im disappointed someone who lives near there hasnt put up a sign. everyday it should be done, find 30 people and have them do it once a month each.  </p>

The ongoing state of emergency (since 9/11) suspends the constitution, institutes the shadow government and really does allow the President to do pretty much what he wants, especially with all the executive orders signed by Bush and Obama.  In legalese this is an incredible important point - We are in and have been in for a long time, a state of emergency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You thought the US House of Representatives was full of &quot;goveners.&quot;</p>

<p>My major complaint against conspiracy theorists is that, generally, that have a tenuous grasp of civics, at best. You are the quintessential example of that. Before you go reading about how the government is full of conspiracies, maybe you should go read about how the government actually works. Spoiler alert: the president isn&#39;t a dictator and there isn&#39;t a secret cabal of Jews running everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man... you mad bro? Ive always kept up on most world events but have never been taught the exact way that government works. I understand the three branches and checks and balances. What I dont understand as much as I should is how each branch works in certain situations. This is a place to REALLY understand what is going on in the world, and it makes sense to me. If it doesnt to you then you dont have to believe it. But since this page has sparked my interest I have went out of my way to read many articles on how government works and BECOME more informed.

    <div class="md"><p>No. This is absolutely NOT the place to REALLY understand what is going on. I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re not getting about this: before you wander into a world of ulterior motives and clandestine shadowy groups controlling the country, you actually need to understand how the country is supposed to work. I&#39;m not even making the contention that everything on here is wrong, I&#39;m saying that to be able to talk about it, you need to understand what you&#39;re saying. To understand and debate the influence Israel has on American politics, you need to understand the lobbying system, otherwise you&#39;re talking out your ass. To understand and debate the pros and cons of the Obama administration, you need to understand that powers that are reserved to the executive branch, and more importantly, the ones that aren&#39;t. This place WILL NOT teach you about how the government works in an objective, academic sense, it will try to convince you that it&#39;s a shadowy behemoth filled with secret agents watching over ever aspect of your life,and that&#39;s it. Have all the conspiracy theory arguments you want, believe whatever you want, I truly don&#39;t give a fuck, but at least do it in the context of understanding how the government is organized. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>I AM mad that you misconstrued my argument, that me criticizing your STAGGERING ignorance was me &quot;getting on you for trying to learn.&quot; You know that&#39;s a falsehood, you&#39;re just a shitty debater. Don&#39;t think so? Why don&#39;t you keep asking me &quot;You mad bro?&quot; until you figure it out.</p>

<p>Oh, and btw, don&#39;t tell me about how you understand the three branches of government. You don&#39;t. Governors are in the executive branch at the state level. The House of Representatives is the congressional branch of the federal level.</p>

<p>I&#39;m &quot;hating&quot; because you&#39;re ignorant as fuck, and worse, you&#39;re intent on only making yourself more ignorant because you&#39;re too ignorant to realize you&#39;re doing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay you don&#39;t understand me. Let me put nice big spaces for you.</p>

<p>I am not learning about government from this subreddit. I am learning about government BECAUSE of this subreddit. SEE THE DIFFERENCE?</p>

<p>You see... This subreddit sparked my interest. Which is a good thing. You on the other hand have come here not to see another side, but to bash. I make this assumption because from what you have stated in previous posts you obviously haven&#39;t read much of them if any of them. Thats willful ignorance. You don&#39;t have to believe them. Just to understand what angle they are taking.</p>

<p>I know I am ignorant in the matters of the government for the most part, but thats not a bad thing if you realize it! When it gets you into trouble is when you become a bully criticizing a group of people you really know nothing about. Thats when ignorance becomes bad. </p>

<p>Agreed.  Look what happened to Occupy Wall Street.  That was a great movement that got co-opted and destroyed <em>real</em> fucking fast by TPTB moles.  I marched and was in it, but still not enough people came together en mass to really make real change happen.</p>

<p>Pretty much EVERYONE (as you said) needs to come together and move forward <em>together</em>.  That&#39;s the key.  Together...and that&#39;s also part of what makes it so difficult.  TPTB have indoctrinated us into NOT being together so that we&#39;re not generally smart enough to stage mass, <em>mass</em> protests against them.  They knew what they were doing when brainwashing us with this doctrine of &quot;uniqueness!&quot; and &quot;separation!&quot;.  &quot;Stand <em>out</em> from the crowd!  Yeh!&quot;</p>

<p>And we went on along with it like good sheep.  Most of us very much <em>still</em> go along with it, having no idea that this is the very thing that is keeping us from putting aside all our petty differences, coming together en mass, and marching against tptb so that we can have a better world for ourselves and each other...</p>
