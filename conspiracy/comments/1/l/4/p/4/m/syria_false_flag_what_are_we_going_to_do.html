    <div class="md"><p>That is what I try to do at all times but they will just print as much money as needed to compensate.  I think then the system will accelerate its collapse.  They are already resorting to creating uncollateralized debt (raw money printing) since there is even now a budget deficit beyond what the world will lend us.  I say withdraw tax revenue and let that next stage of collapse gap widen until the system destroys itself.  Then the people who were preparing in x,y,z ways will be suddenly empowered and in relatively better positions than the inept people with little vision.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t value Americans two states over more than Syrians so I&#39;m not all that invested into the continent.  People over here speak my native English tongue and that is quaint and relaxing for me in a way, but beyond that I really don&#39;t feel much of a bond.  People here don&#39;t think like I do and it is my opinion that I am highly undervalued here in a similar way to how a knockout Ukrainian babe who speaks three languages is highly undervalued over there.</p>

<p>For me being here is dicey as hell.  As I&#39;ve posted earlier in length one of my old school best friends was taken down on a super BS child molestation charge by CPS.  From the horror stories that I&#39;ve seen in this country and talking with numerous exiles abroad it is difficult if not impossible for me to decide to create a family here.  So if having a family is off of the table then what is the point?  The system is bad as hell and if I remain here for a long time then I could be taken down at any moment and that makes the back of my next hurt from the tension.  My brain knows that this shit is unstable as fuck and that causes me unnecessary stress.</p>

<p>Want to know how to make a positive change?  Get yourself an Osprey Farpoint 70.  That appears to be the best backpack in its class.  I like the color blue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...but...if you live in America...then you <em>do</em> expend money on it.  The taxes we pay and the things we buy - gas, etc - tend to go toward feeding this machine we live in.</p>

<p>And the machine we live in, as it turns out, is unfortunately pretty evil.  It goes around and stomps and bullies around other countries, kills people, etc.</p>

<p>And we feed it with our moneys.</p>

<p>For the record, I very much actually AGREE with your sentiment, but the reality is that there&#39;s a LOT we&#39;re going to need to do as a citizenry in order to put a dent in this machine.</p>

<p>Oh most definitely not.  Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Agreed.  I also think that <em>many</em> others should be encouraged to do this as well.  We should be encouraged to help each other <em>independent</em> of a system that is stealing from us.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is truly awesome.  I guess what I&#39;m also referring to, however, is the fact that so long as we cooperate and buy from corporations that <em>themselves</em> feed the war machine (as many corporations do - from those that sell food to those that sell shoes and clothes, etc), then we ourselves are also supporting what those corporations support.</p>

<p>It is obviously EXTREMELY difficult to cut ties altogether, and it seems to me that you&#39;re doing more than the average person in this respect - so that&#39;s definitely commended - but yeah.  We support what those we buy from support also.</p>

<p>This is the most inconvenient nugget of truth. The globalist interdependencies make this problem pervasive.</p>

<p>Check out some of the ideas in <a href="/r/permaculture">/r/permaculture</a>, <a href="/r/surplusengineering">/r/surplusengineering</a>, and engage and support 3d printing and open source money and software! This is huge!</p>

<p>Getting out of the currency is the most powerful way to disown the system and break the chains of the petrodollar and debt-based currency/scam.</p>

<p>Fuck that, nighthawk!  We can&#39;t just back down <em>that</em> fucking easily!  I mean I understand that the odds would be/are staked up against any <em>one</em> of us individually or any small group of us, but - difficult as it would be to do - if a LOT of us got together, or if <em>all</em> of us got together, we COULD bring tptb down to their knees.  We absolutely could.</p>

<p>If we all grew a pair and got together, then even the police state would have a hard time because they would start having to arrest their own FAMILY MEMBERS that are protesting.  Once that happens (and it would happen soon) the tides would start to change.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not necessarily saying we should all protest THIS SECOND, but I <em>am</em> saying that it&#39;s <em>NOT</em> a foregone conclusion that we would have or stand &quot;no&quot; chance if we ALL got together like we could and moved forward as one people/one family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not trying to promote defeatism, not at all. I wise warrior will pick his battles, and learn to fight when victory is on his side. Right now, with this Syria bullshit going down, things have taken turn toward the worst. It might be that when the war really gets going in a few days that the home front will get volatile, directly because of the war. Also, since this false flag was ripped apart so quickly and easily, the folks who do these things will become embolden  to try it again, only bigger and more horrific. Also the 50th anniversary of JFK&#39;s killing and the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve are soon approaching. These two dates will give the false flag folks that much more reason (if you think in terms of a psychopath) to lay a real big heavy on the public...say an American city getting seriously nuked, to be blamed in Iran.</p>

<p>This is, of course, correct.  We are beginning to run out of choices though, no?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And I wonder if they won&#39;t somehow try something closer to home here in the states so as to try and scare that constituency that is as of the moment questioning whether or not the US involvement in Syria isn&#39;t the result of a false flag perpetuated directly or indirectly by the US.</p>

<p>Nothing like fear to get the masses to stfu and start being on the side of their oppressors, eh?</p>

<p>Yes. The trick is patience. The US Government, and the economy, are showing serious signs of weakness. When the stress points becomes breaking points and both systems appear to be about to break, that is the time to seriously organize to be able to step in and take advantage of the enemies weakness. </p>

<p>Okay.  That might be the time to step in, but NOW is the time to at least fortify our resolve and prepare ourselves mentally for when it <em>is</em> time to actually step in and begin to act.  It seems a preparation and focus is needed now that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> interest itself too much if at all in the idea that there is nothing we can do, for there indeed <em>is</em> a lot we can do - psychologically/mentally if nothing else.</p>

<p>We should just be prepared and <em>not</em> think that there is &quot;nothing we can do&quot;.  The time will come, as you said, and we might miss that opportunity when it does comes if we weaken our minds now in thinking that there is little if anything that can be done.</p>

<p>And part of the very reason OPs like these come up is <em>because</em> that system is so decrepit, defunct, and broken.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our government isn&#39;t going to readily dissolve or adapt, until all existing options are attempted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, I personally suggest the &quot;citizens getting together and protesting en mass&quot; option.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assemble, petition, recall. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government laughs at that shit, my man.  Petitions do <em>nothing</em> but spin the wheels of the stupid masses, and so long as we continue bouncing our heads against that wall thinking it&#39;ll work, we will continue to be worthy of that name that so many on here get all up in arms over being called:  Sheeple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what exactly you&#39;re referring to since you weren&#39;t at all specific here, but - since I have to interpret what you might be meaning - I&#39;ll say that petitioning is NOT assembling at all.  The &quot;protesting en mass&quot; version of assembling in no way resembles the &quot;petitioning&quot; version of it.</p>
