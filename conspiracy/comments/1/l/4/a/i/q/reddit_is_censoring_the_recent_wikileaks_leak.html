       seems they censor this website more and more each day. The leak was about Stratfor consulting with Alexis to 'bring in social media dollars' and Stratfor wanted to 'capitalize on a relationship
with Reddit.' scary stuff since this website generates so much traffic now a days.

       I have never been a consultant for Stratfor. I have never worked for Stratfor -- they invited me to their office during SXSW (in 2011, before the wikileaks revelations when I just knew them as a really good news wire service), I got a tour and they asked me for a quote to consult, so I gave it to them, but it went nowhere. We hadn't talked since.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time I thought they did great work reporting on the Caucasus (I was living in Armenia at the time) and after the wikileaks revelation I ended my subscription.

       That's not an unreasonable rate for top line consultants. Also, sometimes you throw a price out there knowing full and well it won't be accepted.

       First rule of consulting is to never tell a client "No" just think of the number you will work for. This allows the client to say No thanks and you part ways with out burning a bridge or making the client angry.

       I don't know if wikileaks is trying to protect ohanian but I also don't think it's an accident they broke the story.

       Having the second half come from him is the limited hang out. Wikileaks may have wanted it to come from him so he could appear transparent.

       It's a balancing act. If they threw him under the bus reddit's management might change.

       If they have servers in the US then it's against the law to post classified information on those servers (correct me if I'm wrong, that's my understanding). I use an app to access Reddit so they probably have some kind of server system feeding it to my Verizon phone. Can't blame them for keeping compliant with federal law and their TOS.

       Well, that sounds like a question for the mods, but I expect they think that is covered by other subreddits and they want a place that isn't full of Miley Cyrus, Zimmerman, or whatever new distraction is coming out of our media.

       It's totally up to the mods of that subreddit. I'd guess it's because it's not 'world news' but you have to ask them. I had nothing to do with it.

       I would also be very curious regarding this question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would this guy meet with Stratfor at
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       ? Just a friendly chat with the CIA's civilian arms' President? "Oh, I happened to be Austin for a concert and you'll never guess who I ran into! A few multi-millionaire ex-CIA assets who invited me to spend the day and have lunch! It was totally awesome!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep, happens to me all of the time. Totally legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, gotta go. Have a lunch date with Dick Cheney and GW Bush.

       I met the founder + his wife in the green room of BloombergNews after an interview I did and we hit it off talking about Armenia (where I'd lived for the last few months) and they invited me to their offices the next time I was in Austin.

       You know what?? I shouldn't--but I believe you.

      <p>
       The emails seem to show that you DID do some consultation of some sort with them (unpaid, "lemme give you some advice" consultation)--but hey, you were there and I was not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you ARE indeed being so transparent leads me to conclude that I was being rather an asshole to you and for that I am very sorry.

       No suckers here...that's why I questioned his recall of events.

       Correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       He addressed me personally and I am inclined to believe him. As I told him he was there and I was not...and not knowing the guy I'm not about to dismiss him as a liar out-of-hand. It could have happened the way that he said even though the emails seem to imply differently (the wife was like "now we have an 'in' with an influential social media site!")
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless I find out different I'm gonna shut up and let his explanation stand. You can take ANYTHING in an email out-of-context. Seems like a decent guy and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

       You aren't protecting anything anyhow, reddit has been going the way of digg for a few years already. The only thing preventing your ultimate demise is a lack of a replacement and even that is only a matter of time. At least try and bow out with some dignity.

       Really? Because it's quite obvious that there are many political interests at play on your site, it's also quite obvious that "I have never been a consultant paid or unpaid for Stratfor" is a carefully worded response probably given by a handler in case of such a situation. I'm sure you fell to the power of greed just as much as so many before you. I'm sure this site is no longer directed by the public.

       Reddit has been a tool for corporate and political interests, massively, for the past year, and to a lesser degree the 2 before that. Your site is a propaganda machine and censoring has become commonplace lately. Give it up Alex.

       I can perhaps offer some insight since he is probably too busy to make a statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each subreddit operates by its own rules. 'Censorship' is typically post removal for violation of community guidelines. Ninety-nine times out of 100, when I go and look at a post that was supposedly censored, it turned out to be against that particular community guidelines (even small things like editorializing titles or submitting content from a certain source, whatever). It's actually a good thing that all content doesn't fly on every single subreddit or reddit would be entirely homogeneous. We need individual community enforcement so that each subreddit will have unique content (otherwise, why even have subreddits?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the term propaganda assumes there is an overarching body that dictates the content that is or is not allowed on reddit and that's frankly not true. The only content not allowed on reddit is illegal content- such as child porn. Even a lot of illegal stuff is allowed on reddit-
       <a href="/r/trees">
        /r/trees
       </a>
       for example. The admins are non-interventionists by and large- usually only getting involved when there is doxxing or illegal content. The rest of the content removals are either due to the rules of automod, community guidelines, or incompetent moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to consider myself someone who 'watches the watchmen.' I've been a mod of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/movies">
        /r/movies
       </a>
       and a lot of other subs- and I check up on mod logs. I do the same thing in this sub. Anyways, hopefully that was insightful for you.

       To reiterate, how difficult would it be for a group/groups to infiltrate Reddit and influence what opinions are "popular", to position people as mods in certain subreddits? If we know said groups already control almost all major media, then I want to know what exactly is stopping them from diving right into Reddit without anyone knowing either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is, nothing is stopping them, it's happening now and has been for some time. Reddit is no longer for the people, by the people, but increasingly controlled by the same groups that control everything else.

       "Street cred" being what, massive amounts of karma points that can be easily manufactured by bots on any account? The very structure of Reddit itself makes it ludicrously easy to influence what gets to the top and what doesnt. Even if it isn't bots, how difficult would it be with unlimited resources to organize a large team of people commenting and writing x opinion and upvoting x opinion and downvoting y?
      </p>
      <p>
       You people are acting like this is such a difficult proposition, while forgetting that the whole website is basically anonymous and we have no access to who is voting for what, etc. It would be so remarkably easy to control this website in so many ways and have nobody the wiser.

       But none of this is difficult to do anonymously. Really. Even if it was beyond anonymously, none of this is difficult considering we're speaking about agencies who have specialized in worldwide POLITICAL infiltration, coups, etc. for decades. Reddit is nothing but cake for them, should they want to do the same thing here.

       So I should believe you, an anonymous mod, about the status of anonymous mods? This is the problem here. We're all anonymous. There's no way of knowing who the mods really are, if they have motives, etc. There's also no way of us knowing whether certain opinions are bot-voted up, and others down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm merely pointing out as you said the possibility, combined with what what cannot be denied a desirable asset for "certain organizations" we'll continue to say (Influencing opinion on Reddit), and their propensity for obtaining control of comparable assets in the past, such as major news outlets, and proposing that it's inevitable that attempts have been/will be made by the same groups, and perhaps successful attempts already in certain popular subs.

       I think that reddit is small potatoes for these interests. They already own the mass media and the mass media is consumed by the dumbest most gullible segment of the population. Reddit as a community is full of a large number (I wish it were larger) of critical thinkers who have really sensitive bullshit detectors. And the system here is complicated to get into. It takes years. And the dividends would be small. So again, while I think it's a possibility, I don't think it's worth the effort in the long run- nor have I observed it happening as you describe.

       The problem is that Reddit IS as you said, full of critical thinkers with sensitive bullshit detectors. That's why it is a problem for any of the organizations I've mentioned. They would have good reason to attempt to influence what is read on this website, because they can then influence these strongwilled outspoken people to spread the word to their friends, like Redditors do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is certainly a target. Sopa indeed, if it was not a psy-op, targeted it directly, but was ultimately eliminated. Well, if they know they can't take it by force, you better damn well believe they are trying to covertly as we speak. I'm not accusing you of anything either, just making a point. In all honesty the moderation teams are not the biggest issue, it's the absolute ease of vote-rigging and upvoting/downvoting certain posts if necessary. I think we can all agree there are vast amounts of programmers that could come up with untraceable methods of vote-rigging given unlimited resources and time. And I think we can all agree on the persuasiveness on public opinion that said vote-rigging would have. Then logically it can be assumed that these things are happening right now.

       I mainly lurk reddit to observe all of what I'm describing occur in front of us. Twitter is just popular opinion, which is first influenced by things LIKE reddit and the news. People are reposting on their twitter what they see first here, which is why focusing on how they control media sources and ensuring transparency as you said, is more important. And again, absolutely no reason why twitter couldn't be compromised just the same.

       Okay, so I present the same problems: How difficult would it be for an organization to botvote certain comments or posts up, and others down within? Who selects the mods and mod teams? How is the topic of this very thread not world news, it came from wikileaks and is related to a website that is used worldwide, yet was removed from world news. And was gaining a lot of steam. That's a choice on the mods part based on his/their own opinion, not the "rules". This information is being deleted all over the site and I doubt it will see the frontpage.

Ergo, what is to stop them from stopping the first issue, vote rigging? Who's to say they don't allow it completely if it suits the opinion they are pushing?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Because those mods subjectively decided what fits within the guidelines or doesn't. It's the same for every subreddit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I guess we have to go back to the same question: Who the fuck, are the mods, and who selected them? Why does their "subjectivity" as you've put it in thread removal lean in one direction so often?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It may not be frontpage worthy. Or maybe it will hit the front page here because it's a conspiracy. Have you considered that maybe THIS is the best subreddit for the content? If that's the case, then the subreddit system worked exactly as designed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, I don't think THIS is the best subreddit, I think if the majority of the Reddit community heard about this news, they would want answers. Unfortunately, most threads on the subject are being deleted. Except in "Conspiracy", a word which is stigmatized now to, frankly, lunacy and tin foil hats. So yes, I suppose for certain organizations, and for Ohanian, this is THE BEST subreddit for it to be frontpaged in.

       I know that's how it works, and that's my point. We have absolutely no way of really knowing who the mods are, why they censor what they do. We have no way of knowing whether certain opinions are upvoted to top comment by some organization of people, sop[histicated bot networks, etc., and it's totally reasonable to assume that with unlimited resources those would not be difficult things to accomplish.

       Reddit is far too popular not to be manipulated at this point. It is unquestionable that it's manipulated all the time now. And further, all other sources of truth have been infiltrated and are manipulated now. It's common sense that Reddit was/is on the chopping block.

       It has a long history of being manipulated. Reddit is a microcosm of the whole internet. There are always going to be interests, manipulators, scammers. There's no way to stop it. You can only do your part to fight it using the tools that you have. In my experience, reddit is a whole lot better about dealing with these kinds of things that other sites. No site will ever get it perfect. But I agree, there could be some better measures in place. I recommend going to

       The point is, it's inevitably a losing battle if the tools you have are owned by the people you're fighting against. Reddit is becoming a losing battle, and as I said, give it a few years and most everyone on this sub who are here for the right reasons will be recognizing this too.

       Frankly, unlike the traditional media, I feel the biggest problem in reddit is reddit culture itself. Folks in r/politics actively punish any post they disagree with and this is what limits the scope of the discussion.

       No, BOTS in r/politics actively punish or praise posts that certain organizations agree/disagree with. Bots on this website in general, control what people seen and what opinions "should" and "should not" be popular. Why does Alexis allow this? Why doesn't Alexis do something about the draconian moderation and censorship? Because he's in on this whole shebang too. He has to know about it all, how could he not? Why have there not been site-wide notifications about the vote rigging and bad moderation? Why don't they clean house?

       Why not openly admit to the world that this website that you are deeply involved with, is obviously a tool of the government/big business? It's so blatantly obvious to anyone with common sense. I don't care if you got involved for different reasons. You know now that there are ulterior motives and organizations at work on this website, and you keep that a secret from people. Tell them the truth.

       This is the problem with conspiracy addicts. I follow conspiracies to get leads on alternative news, but those that are deep into the culture become way too skeptical of any explanation that doesn't predict the fall of society at the hands of an unseen cabal.

       He doesn't have "handlers." He gave you an explanation and you dismiss it away. If you don't believe him, look into more, but you can't just assume that no one is honest or good except paranoid people on the forums.

       Because, um, there is an unseen cabal. It gets into all media eventually. For the most part, it's ruined music, it's ruined TV, it's ruined film, it's ruined major news, why exactly would it not seek to ruin Reddit as well? Reddit has been a huge nuisance when it comes to exposing lies for years now. It's too dangerous to be left unchecked, and unmoderated by the same damn "cabal" that moderates everything else we're fed.

       The world is not so simple and there are ordinary people right along with the cabalists. One of them is the guy that responded to you and gave you a pretty reasonable explanation for his interaction w/ Stratfor.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, that is also an example of what I'm talking about. I agree w/ u that the INTEL community (the cabalists) are likely targeting anything they can, including Reddit, BUT stuff like the leaked e-mail you were able to read, right off of Reddit are examples of the messy crap that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cabalists are humans just like me and you (unless you think they are satanic, reptilian illuminists) and susceptible to the same foibles. (See: Wikileaks, Snowden, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I was criticizing you for is thinking that their plans are so perfect and flawless that even some internet programmer has a "handler" and that any innocuous explanation is actually a twist in the grand CO-INTEL PRO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is stranger than fiction and sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. In fact, the idea that the cabalists have perfect control is likely part of CO-INTEL PRO; they don't want you to know that they are just intelligent primates like the rest of us with families and childhoods and have just as little control over reality as the rest of us.

       Why should anyone believe that the people who have had inside knowledge and power and wealth for generations upon generations "have as little control over reality as us"? They have been controlling reality, for fucking centuries. They certainly do have control at this point. It's breaking down because of people like you and me, who are piecing all of this together. But we need to start calling a cigar a cigar, as you said, and Reddit is a loaded cigar at this point. I guarantee you in a year or three we'll be looking back on it and shaking our heads when it's beyond denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are bloodlines that have had access to technology and secrets I'm sure we can't even fathom, for as long as they've been in control. There is no goddamn reason they can't entirely control reality. There is no reason whatsoever that they can't control Reddit like they control everything else.

       It's absurd to believe that this website could ever have been free forever.

       During last year's election, saying anything negative about Obama was an instant -20 karma. The site was full of bots and/or shills and it's impossible for the administration of reddit not to have been aware of it. So the bots/shills' presence was allowed by the administration, or even worse...

       Or the site is full of young liberals who generally have a positive/neutral view of Obama with an extremely negative view of Romney.  Regardless, there were plenty of highly upvoted comments criticizing Obama during the last election (most of them were full of bullshit but what comment on reddit isn't...)

       Of course it's allowed. Any form of public media/news will inevitably be compromised given a large enough userbase in this day and age. Reddit is a joke, I pay no heed to any social commentary on it because i'm sure the vast majority of top comments are planted and the legitimate ones are bot downvoted into oblivion. Think of how easy it is for them. This website is another cog in the machine for them. Alex is full of shit, he must know exactly what this site is.

       I'm commenting on how Reddit has entirely been compromised by political and big business organizations, and how it's used primarily to control public opinion like the major news outlets are when serious topics are discussed. Thank you for disregarding the main point of my comment like Alexis did, shill. "End of story."
      </p>
      <p>
       Censorship is well in effect here now, and Reddit is supposedly against it, so since Alexis should be against it as well, why doesn't he comment on the fact that it happens regularly here?

       Oh really, so, who designates the moderation of all the frontpage subs then? You are just dancing around the issue here, which is that many popular subs have been compromised, many rising stories get censored, and the mods/mod teams have likely been designated, selected to run them with an agenda in place. It doesn't matter if I "make my own, because the mass majority of people will be viewing certain subreddits that are right in front of them, and those are the ones which are being used to sway opinion.

       You're again intentionally dodging my question. Who decides the moderators for each of the frontpage subs? How exactly did these specific people become moderators?
      </p>
      <p>
       The default page also has a ton of political/world news stories. When stories and comments show a particular company or political organization or powerful person in a negative light, it's obvious they would want to change public opinion in any way possible in such situations, including hiring teams of people to comment and reply to each other as if anonymous people are conversing. Keep trying shillyboy.

       No, money determines the flow of information, just like it does everywhere else in the world. Reddit is not mysteriously immune to corruption throughout the mod/admin team, nor vote rigging. If entire countries are not immune to either, then why would an anonymous forum be? I've watched it progressively get worse over the years, as have many others. Carry on preaching bullshit though.

       Your question is fundamentally flawed.

       No one decides the moderators of frontpage subs.  Moderators are chosen by the founder of a subreddit, popular subreddits become frontpage subs.

       So let's take a look at the moderators of
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       .  Two of their accounts are 4 years old, while the rest are at least 5 years old (up to over 7 years).  Are you saying that somebody created and heavily used those accounts for years so that they could control what is allowed on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       ?  Are you saying that these people have been bought off or otherwise forced to censor stories?  Are you saying that these people have agendas of their own that they are trying to propagate?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know better than to ask this, but do you have any evidence of this?  If not, head over to
       <a href="/r/ModerationLog">
        /r/ModerationLog
       </a>
       .  With enough diligence you should be able to prove your assertion by looking at what stories have been censored and what stories haven't.  If there is an agenda being pushed, it should be pretty clear if you look at what stories have been removed.

       The co-founder of Reddit getting a lot of upvotes on Reddit is like Bill Gate's winning Microsoft's Humanitarian of the Year award.

      <p>
       The fact that he was having meetings with Stratfor, quoted them a price for his services, and now presents a few emails suggesting he didn't take the job... probably won't completely settle matter in the minds of everyone.

       All you need to do is ask yourself why is reddit, one of the most powerful content engines of the internet, free to use and basically ad-free. It is still an invaluable communication tool for us and I am not trying to say we should jump ship en masse, but you gotta know your tools. Reddit is a devil's bargain, much like Facebook. Maybe more so because of the perceived anonymity, which is not real anonymity in any way FYI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is free, and the more free something appears, the less it is.

       This is a normal part of the lifecycle of pop media instruments. Something is made that does something good/helpful/useful for normal people. This thing becomes popular. This thing is exploited to manipulate normal people into parting with their valuables, be it information or currency.

       It's free for the same reason sites like Twitter are free: they have no real idea on how to make money off it, but they know enough about gaming investors into putting tons of money into it because they have lots of users. Then ads and demographics info as usual.

       I wish it were that simple, but I don't really think it is. Without getting all needlessly tinfoilhatty, there are probably click through arrangements and derivative profit sharing that reddit gets money from. But, like facebook, the real value is the user information. And as far as that goes, reddit is printing money. I don't mean like where you live and who you are, I mean like what you are and what you like to do, where you spend your time and what interests you. That is the real reddit gold.

       Yep, the one thing we won't be able to say if there is ever a butcher's bill on all this stuff is that they didn't tell us what they were doing. You might have to connect a couple dots, but the degree to which we compromised ourselves is all pretty much hiding in plain sight.

       There are people better qualified to explain but I will toss a few things out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few reasons reddit is not actually anonymous. For one, to post you need to make an account. To remove posting restrictions it is often expedient to link an email account to your reddit account. Even better, they give you a "trophy" if you link your email.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we all know how to make a BS email account. How good are you at managing yours? Over the course of your travels have you ever used your BS email account to make a transaction somewhere else that more explicitly links to your actual identity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so let's say your BS email usage habits are bulletproof. Then we have your connection. When you hop on reddit your IP is logged...somewhere. By reddit and your ISP, and handled and passed by every relay in between. Every packet your computer sends includes your IP in the header somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to your userpage and check out all the things you have ever voted on. Every...single...thing you ever voted on is stored on their database. Not to mention your post history. Not only do they know what you like to talk about, they know you really thought that baby kitten being raped by a flying purple dinosaur was pretty cool too. And right next to those votes is the IP address from which those votes originated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, we got VPNs too. Did you set up your VPN on your phone? Did you ever hop on at the library or a friend's house? Did you check your facebook at the same time?  If you have an always on VPN you are probably a fraction of a % of reddit users. And some of those keep logs too.How hard is it to follow the breadcrumb trail back to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not hard. This post is not even remotely thorough or detailed. It is just a general overview. If you have a technical understanding of how all the different systems work together it just gets much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not anonymous, you aren't even close. You are actually the opposite, mindlessly compiling a database of everything that is you and handing it to the world for free.

       Yes of course but you need a WARRANT to get it. When you don't have SSL turned on, anyone monitoring trunks/fibers can grab it all without any court order.

       That's funny. The NSA has shown that they don't need warrants to view anything. There is no technical limitation in place to prevent them from indiscriminate tracking of anyone and everyone. Besides, the FISA court is a rubber stamp committee that depends on the honesty of the NSA in their submissions for warrants, and said warrants are generally broader than the Titanic.

       You don't understand how system administrators work, do you? You have no idea how much power a sysadmin has over any computers he works on, do you? He didn't need anything special to access that shit once he was root on those computers. Position is irrelevant at that point, as is security clearance. I sincerely doubt the NSA was putting in special encryption safeguards for this data since it's the government we're talking about. Encryption for networking, sure, but not at the lowest details.

       Nonsense!!! They need warrants for everything except when they snoop on fiber trunks and even then they can't snoop on Americans if they're 51% sure they're Americans. Do some reading of Snоwdеn reports.

       It's gotten to the point where if you have an opinion and don't want to have it possibly become scrutinized by various intelligence agencies, you have to either talk about it in a room with no electronics, or just keep it to yourself. That's the saddest part of it all. Self-censorship and "The Chilling Effect"

       I'm not surprised at all that a co-founder of Reddit was meeting with ardent Zionists. As I said in another post Reddit is merely a tool to push the Zionists' agenda. Our little "group" here is probably the largest collection of people who don't buy "the cabal's" version of "current events" and "history." At least I like to
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       that it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if he got the chance to ask George "Israel first" Freidman how much they are paying Agent Jones per year to collect IP addresses from his sites? Now
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       would be an interesting wikileak.

       Yeah I edited while you were replying, I saw that. Just makes no earthly sense if there was legit aistoturfing from the AF they would do it from a base. Esp not when they could stick 20 guys in a Time Warner office in Columbus or Houston.

       You guys realize Elgin is the largest base in the United States, right?

      <p>
       They do survival training, EOD training, flight training (there's a road that gets shut down when jets take off over it), special ops training, general training, weapons testing (I lived in ft Walton when they tested the MOAB), the base extends into the gulf and they do communications work.

       They offer commercial worldwide geopolitical news and intelligence from their own contact sources independent from AP and Reuters and condensed into non-fluffed articles. Not necessarily more accurate, just a lot less 'entertainment' filler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their rates start at about 3-400 bucks per month. Not something Joe Sixpack will use, but a drop in the bucket for a corp or gov department head looking to generate or confirm leads.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is they're looking for sources. Possibly gen y "hacker" subculture 
informants but the place is also a potential goldmine of statistics and trends data just due to the size of the community. Reddit also represents a potential power bloc based on what happens when enough people are on the same page.

       It's free for the same reason sites like Twitter are free: they have no real idea on how to make money off it, but they know enough about gaming investors into putting tons of money into it because they have lots of users. Then ads and demographics info as usual.

       I would also be very curious regarding this question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would this guy meet with Stratfor at
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       ? Just a friendly chat with the CIA's civilian arms' President? "Oh, I happened to be Austin for a concert and you'll never guess who I ran into! A few multi-millionaire ex-CIA assets who invited me to spend the day and have lunch! It was totally awesome!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep, happens to me all of the time. Totally legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, gotta go. Have a lunch date with Dick Cheney and GW Bush.

       It's totally up to the mods of that subreddit. I'd guess it's because it's not 'world news' but you have to ask them. I had nothing to do with it.
