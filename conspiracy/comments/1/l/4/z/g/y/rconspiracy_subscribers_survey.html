       I don't see why going on a conspiracy theory site is something to be ashamed or scared of... there are millions of us who question the official line... I want them to know... I'm not going to hide away in a corner just because I think differently to how they tell me to think.

       Uhh, people, you realize that EVERY TIME you post to Reddit you are leaving behind data that can be "mined"--correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years back I met a guy who actually DID work for a company much like the one described in the oft-reposted composition about being a paid shill for Israel. He didn't work in a shithole...on the contrary, he worked in a gorgeous office outside of SF and ran very complex, very EXPENSIVE software that allowed one person to take on a huge number of online "personas." The software would "remember" each persona and it went a step further--it would, much like Microsoft Word's spelling/grammar check, inform you if you were writing something that was "out of character" by using different-colored "underlines" and text formatting. It would also automatically compile (across websites) what you wrote and could detect contradictions that were within the particular "persona" that you were currently using. Bear in mind this was 2009 and he told me that said software was already a few years old. I can only imagine how powerful this program has gotten now that basically unlimited cloud storage/bandwidth are the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I've been an xNIX sysadmin my entire life and was utterly FLOORED by what this program could do. Unlike people who do not share my skillset I realized the
       <em>
        immense
       </em>
       amount of computational horsepower it took to run a DB of this complexity and size--let alone one that allowed hundreds of people to use it at once and cross-compile information. The kicker was when he showed me all of the different reporting features...one report format was so utterly brilliant that it could tell you EVERYTHING about a particular user by studying their comments across years of posts on different sites. It could even "guess," with 97% accuracy, the author of a particular post by analyzing the word usage, punctuation, grammar, and use of different word modifiers! This information could then be used to grab a "real" name, which then linked to public record databases. Some things it knew about me? My real name, the last four addresses I've used, the type of car I drove, where I worked, who I've dated, my computer/OS of choice, my SSN, and my sexual orientation. These were just the first few things in a list that was 80+ lines long. It even knew about court cases that I was involved in 20+ years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why am I telling you this? Well, I've been waiting to bring something like this up so that I
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       tell you about it for one. This is NOT fictitious software--it actually worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is this...come on people. This innocuous poll will tell the people who ARE (right now) gathering information about you nothing at all new. OP has a long posting history and while I may not agree with all of his/her opinions I know that they're not a troll.

       If you've used the Internet for over a year and actually contributed anything at all the damage is already done--regardless of encryption, VPN, virtualization, etc, etc. Trust me.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: "They" already know all that they need to know about you and this poll tells "them" nothing new.

       Name the program. The reason I ask is because I'm not entirely sure I believe you. Your argument is persuasive, and I'm not denying people can be traced via their Internet trail, but you are over-stating things. A person
       <strong>
        can
       </strong>
       be traced by a forum post, but only if the ISP &amp; Website give up that person's data, and assuming that that person has taken zero measures to obfuscate his or her identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be saying all counter measures taken to hide a persons real identity are useless. This is clearly not the case.

       No, this is not what I'm saying. What I am saying is that UNLESS your Internet time consists of ALWAYS obfuscating your identity then you are probably "tagged" by a system such as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The program did not have a name--not one that was relayed to me anyhow. It was an acronym, all caps, ran under some type of xNIX. I believe that it was semi-proprietary as this "firm" was a branch of another firm that you HAVE heard about recently (not Booz though).
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish that I could be more specific but I saw it for 10 minutes and was NOT encouraged to ask questions. It does exist though and I was told that it was modular and used Oracle somewhere in the back end. The report generator was semi (if not totally) proprietary though. I want to say it was called Sage but only about 50% sure of that. It was a while ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you Google this type of thing you will see similar programs. I'm sure that somebody in this SR can help with a name...if one exists. I'm pretty sure that I've read about this type of program on this SR at one time or another also.

       It was something like

       What is the purpose of this survey?  The questions are terrible and the list of potential AMA candidates is horrid.  The moderators of this subreddit need to constantly be scrutinized in their decisions in my opinion.  Especially after the direction Reddit has been taking lately and the new Wikileaks concerning one of the founders and Stratfor.  Long live transparency and peace.  This survey seems dumb judging from the questions.

       None really.  The AMA one was interesting but your conglomeration of mainstream established conspiracy theory personalities and figures left out the more interesting and more credible whistle blowers and researchers in my opinion.  How about an AMA with Senator Mark Dayton who resigned under shady circumstances after criticizing the 9/11 Commission report.  Or Max Cleland who actually resigned from the commission.  Or Kevin Ryan who blew the whistle and
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Another-Nineteen-Investigating-Legitimate-Suspects/dp/1489507833">
        wrote a new book
       </a>
       detailed exactly who had the motive and could have pulled off the intricate crimes of 9/11, and he is doing publicity.  Cynthia McKinney served in the House and questioned Rumsfeld and Myers directly.  Richard Gage founded and leads an organization of soon to be over 2,000 whistle blowing architects and engineers.  etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This group reads like a who's who of Alex Jones guest list: Alex Jones
David Icke
Mark Dice
G. Edward Griffn
Syrian Girl(Youtube)
Charlie Veitch
Gerald Celente
Max Keiser
Ben Swann
      </p>
      <p>
       They are all media personalities, not an actual list of credible elected officials, whistle blowers, or great researchers.  Bill Still would make a good AMA as well, and has a new movie out.  Ellen Brown as well is known to do interviews and publicity. Luke Rudkowski would be interesting for people who enjoy his story of being an upstart independent journalist.  Lawrence Wilkerson served at the highest levels of gov't and said he'd testify that the whole Bush Admin knew and knows that the people being force fed in Gitmo are innocent.  You list is scant at best and the other questions are banal drivel in my opinion, and I don't see how the collection of that information is beneficial to the subreddit, but would be interested in how you think you can use this information to benefit the subreddit.

       This is not data mining lol. Your data has already been mined. Anyyyywayyyy
Ok why are you doing this? To see what everyone is into? Why? Are you going to start tailoring the sub? What is the true purpose?
Edit : I participated in your survey.

       Obvious data mining observed at the end of survey.  That aside,  not filling out the days mining non optional "advert"  at the end,  does my work still get counted?  Or is itnulldue to the fact I'm not entering in my email and stuff?

       To which end? To profile the personality, age and sex of the average user? So we can be fed with propaganda that suits our views? So the Pentagon can infer what is the type of the population they should be wary of?
       <strong>
        People, don't do this survey
       </strong>
       , datamining and profiling is a tremendously powerful tool that has been used to maintain people in check by corporations and government for at least 40 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you complete this survey, you will be hinting government and advertisers how they should act.

       Yea, people are going nuts here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it can be attributed to a few reasons; primarily that this community has a propensity to be overly inductive (I say this in the most loving way possible) haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, people have a special attachment to this place as one of the last bastion's of "anonymity and freedom" on reddit; so I think most of what you're seeing is general distrust at reddit inc being taken out on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, you could waltz into
       <a href="/r/soccer">
        /r/soccer
       </a>
       and do this (in fact those guys loved something like this) and you'd be fine; it's really the userbase and the current political climate that's driving this response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you're not too downtrodden over this, you guys do great work here (stopping trolls while preserving speech rights is a perilous task) and I give you my 100% seal of approval.

By knowing what kind of user frequents this sub, they can make some inference on the general population, even assigning a probability of one individual in the real world to be a "potential insurgent".

       How good you are at abstraction? If they can make you buy stuff you don't need, they are basically controlling you. They hardly need to restrict it to make you buy stuff you don't need. They can use it to make you go to some desert and shoot people so they can profit from that. They can use it to make you think anything that goes against what they want you to believe is right should be removed.

       You live inside a society. It doesn't matter whether you are controlled or not, you still feel the effects of that. By giving away information to them you are just giving them munition to further the police state.

       is an free subreddit on a free site called reddit. Many subreddits have surveys for various (usually stupid) reasons. This is an OPTIONAL survey. Also, the NSA does not datamine like this. They already have a profile of conspiracy theorists as young adult males, and pretty much every extremist position is within that category. If the NSA wants you, they have XKeyscore. Duping you into answering some questions is not how the worlds most advanced intelligence apparatus operates.

       Have you ever heard of Sibel Edmonds?  Or anyone outside of the typical Alex Jones level sphere or amateur level of conspiracies?  I think you need better discernment or a deeper level of research or investigative journalism than what you have presented here.

       Don't be too paranoid people it's only a short survey. English may have been a bit naive by deleting and re-posting this post but it was only because the original had no introduction. 
End of the day this is not a heavy questionnaire, he thought it would offer an insight into the community, nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand why a lot of you are skeptical about something like this but it is hardly intrusive. EnglshMunichFan is a good guy and he was interested in the statistics of the crowd here is all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of the survey has bombed and that means the community has spoken - as it should be. Just don't be too harsh on him for trying something different.

       If we are gonna do this, truly for the reason to find out what people do and don't want on this sub, than I for one think we should have the community vote on the types questions and answers to all the questions.

       this is complete b.s.  A) you know the problems.  you have been here a long time, and have heard the list of complaints repeatedly  b) there probably isn't much you can do to address the problems short of making the sub private or bringing a ban hammer on ignorant people (which is subjective).  c) What we want more of, what exactly does that mean?  Besides gaming, how does one control what the 'public' posts to the site?  this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and if it is conspiracy it is welcome.  What more is there?

       Now those seem to be great questions.  I understand the need for demographics in particular cases, but in this case what purpose does it serve?  You could never validate the data set, so really why even ask?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree some of the posts seem a little out of hand, and if you want to improve the sub, then the questions should reflect that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey, don't let failure stop you.  If this is what you really want to do, rehash the survey, drop the demographics, and I'm certain you will get a ton of responses with minimal bitching.

       Personally with 9/11, there is so much information, the wiki is a good idea, but we have a sub on that.  I would like to see a sub or wiki on whistle blowers and their information.

       My only issue with the survey was the AMA question. In my opinion there should be an other or a none option because I had to pick someone I didn't really have an opinion or know about just to answer the question.

       Have you ever heard of Sibel Edmonds?  Or anyone outside of the typical Alex Jones level sphere or amateur level of conspiracies?  I think you need better discernment or a deeper level of research or investigative journalism than what you have presented here.

       The point he was making is that most of those "hundreds" that took the survey already could have easily just BS'ed all the answers.
