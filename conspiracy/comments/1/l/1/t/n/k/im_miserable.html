        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I cried today. Not because of anything in particular, but for everyone on this planet.
I live in the Netherlands, my life is piss easy, I can not complain about anything whatsoever.
Yet I feel miserable, miserable about all the crazy evil shit that is going on, and has been going on for a long time so it seems.</p>

<p>I feel guilty, guilty because I want to help but I don&#39;t know how. </p>

<p>&lt;rant&gt;
With all the shit going on these last couple of weeks I fear for ww3. And it makes me sad.
I&#39;m am in no fucking way prepared for what&#39;s going to happen. I have not even the slightest clue if it even matters at this point.
 I want this world to be a better place. I just don&#39;t see how this is possible. </p>

<p>The worst thing is, 99% of the world is corrupt, but 80% of that corruption is well documented. How did this happen?
&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

<p>My heart lies with the world. I don&#39;t see myself as a Dutch citizen. I am a citizen of the planet earth. Human(s) first. Everything else is trivial.</p>

<p>Borders don&#39;t exist. Money doesn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>What are we gonna do to take our rights back?</p>

<p>Edit: thanks for all the responses. When I started using reddit on my phone I set conspiracy as my default reddit and it seems I made a good choice. Thanks for all the support, love and tips. I will not forget this. </p>

<p>Big love and peace to all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stay strong. Don&#39;t feel guilty about not having ridiculous struggles. It isn&#39;t your fault for getting dealt a nice hand in life. I&#39;m proud of you for simply being aware of the problems other people are having. Most people just avert their attention.</p>

<p>What can you do to help? Educate yourself, educate others. Promote critical thinking, open debate and avoid logical fallacies and falling into wedge issues. <strong>Talk to people.</strong> Don&#39;t try to change anyone&#39;s beliefs, just present a more compelling argument. (imo its impossible for anyone to change some other individual&#39;s beliefs as they must do that for themselves)</p>

<p>This &quot;coming feeling of ill&quot; seems to be a growing trend lately. Personally, I think some of this stuff is the opening acts of WW3. As an American I&#39;m fairly concerned with the recent scope of domestic intelligence. I don&#39;t subscribe to much &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; but the logical progression of that kind of surveillance is Police State. Geopolitical movements seem to lean towards major superpowers maneuvering to control remaining energy assets. The US government moves closer to textbook fascism with each new bill. Poverty, a stark lack of education (often expressed in pure fucking ignorance), ridiculously expensive healthcare often not sought for fear of crushing debt, decaying cities, wealth that continues to centralize... I could go on but I feel I&#39;m being depressing... </p>

<p>Back to what we are going to do; Nothing. Nothing can be done, save perhaps doing whatever one can to accelerate the coming &quot;thing&quot;. It&#39;s just too far gone. This system will continue to pile straw until the camel&#39;s back finally breaks. Shit will continue to leak out of the same rotting barrel until everyone finally gets sick enough. </p>

<p>Personally I think that &quot;approaching bad feeling&quot; people are having lately is part of it. Critical mass is probably pretty close.</p>

<p>Wise words. Do your best to spread these ideas far and wide so when the economic collapse comes, we the citizens of earth can be a true catalyst for change and restructuring. </p>

<p>I feel the same way, before I bounced from my parents place they were asking me, where do you want to be in 10 years, you&#39;re gonna need a lot more 0s in your bank account to support a wife and kids. Thats what its about to society, 0s in a bank account.</p>

<p>Instead, do something exciting. Go backpacking around the world, spread your ideas wherever you go</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is this website: helpx.net I&#39;m looking into it. It gives the opportunity to search a community somewhere in the world that needs help in any shape or form. They&#39;ll provide food and a place to sleep and you&#39;ll do some work for them.
One of the options is a Buddhist monastery for example. </p>

<p>I&#39;d really like to see more of the world. The way I see it I now can only engage situations with a western viewpoint. I can only see the western truth. As a human you need to travel to learn the truth from every corner from the earth. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell you how much I wish there were more people who believed this. Sometimes I look around at how the people behave and feel abnormal or weird for not &quot;belonging&quot; to a race or country. Am I the one who is wrong for seeing everyone as equals? As humans? Am I wrong for not treating people differently because they don&#39;t share the culture or have the color of skin that I was born with? </p>

<p>Am I the one who is wrong for seeing how money is just a tool used to control the masses and doesn&#39;t itself have any value than what we give it? Am I wrong for wanting to inform people about the things that are going wrong with the world? Am I wrong for not turning a blind eye to everything?</p>

<p>it wouldn&#39;t be hard to fabricate a global constitution for the people, and it wouldn&#39;t be hard to utilize each nations respective tools of production and resources to make that happen. To ensure a quality of life far beyond that which has been reached by all from any society.</p>

<p>it&#39;s just a matter of distribution, and destroying the propaganda and barriers of the past. never has there been a global society, we must break that cycle, us the laymen. we must not allow multi national business interests control how a global society unfolds.

<p>This comment isn&#39;t necessarily directed towards you, but I guess I needed to espouse these ideas, like OP. I just wanna know why we should do anything if it&#39;s all ultimately futile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greeting from America OP.</p>

<p>Please try not to be depressed. It really IS a scary situation that we&#39;re in but the most that we can do right now is inform those that <em>want</em> to listen and live our lives. You live in a beautiful country that is NOT facing what America is going to go through so be thankful for that! Us American citizens...well, we took far too long to wake up. People are awakened now but things are too far gone...and I&#39;m not doing SHIT about it because, simply, here they imprison you for ANY and nearly EVERY reason. If I&#39;m going to die or go through tough times it&#39;s NOT gonna be behind bars.</p>

<p>Enjoy what you have and live life! You will come out on the &quot;other end&quot; of whatever happens. Life is just a grand illusion anyhow.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Dictators survive by keeping their citizens demoralized.  Walk through a shopping mall -- everything is set up to depress you simply because you don&#39;t have the worthless, expensive shit they are advertising.</p>

<p>But you have more wonderful things available to you than at any time in history, and your brain works better than any addled GMO shill or Paris Hilton.</p>

<p>Show people how wonderful life is, and they will treasure it more.  And when we value our lives, we will all start to move.</p>

<p>Please explain how a video game has helped you realize that we are close to a nuclear war rather than simply reinforcing your pre-existing worldview.  </p>

<p>Ok. Buckle up because it&#39;s a really interesting tale....</p>

<p><strong><em>IT DIDN&#39;T!</em></strong> I&#39;m sorry that I like the fallout game series (VATS is an awesome game feature). I&#39;m sorry that I wanted to get the xbox achievements for these games. I&#39;m sorry you ever posted on this thread.</p>

<p>How did I come to the conclusion that their would be a nuclear exchange then? Oh lets see. Russia said &quot;Protecting Monsanto could lead to war&quot;, America wanting the hell out of Snowden, America having the stupid government it has might try to drone him, attacking a now Russian civilian could very well lead to a war. Syria, Russia saying if America got involved in Syria it could lead to war.</p>

<p>America and Russia has signed a Nuclear proliferation treaty, America got rid of a few but Russia got rid of fewer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been there. I flat out broke down in front of my dad telling him about how food prices might skyrocket in the next 10 years and the side effects that would have.</p>

<p>I compared it to how Oppenheimer must have felt when he said &quot;I am become death, the destroyer of worlds&quot;. </p>

<p>I view this moment as my kind of &quot;baptism by fire&quot;. It&#39;s when I decided to change my thinking on the matter. None of us are going to start some great revolution by ourselves. It would be doomed to fail. Accept that you cannot change the world by yourself. You more than likely can&#39;t change a lot of people&#39;s minds. Every great leader was propped up by hundreds of little people, so it is hubris to think that we can enact change on the same scale. Even if one of us became some kind of great leader, it would be the wrong way to change things.</p>

<p>Just seek to change one person&#39;s mind. Just one. Don&#39;t bombard them with theories, but give them questions to ask. Use the Socratic Method. Then, if you changed just one person, that person will likely seek to change someone else. Then move on to trying to change another person.</p>

<p>I hate to make the comparison, as it would be a justification of everything Homeland Security does to paint us as dangerous, but our ideas spread best in much the same way as the ideals of Jihadists. I am not saying to act as them, with violence and blind rage, but look at how their views spread exponentially. It doesn&#39;t spread from some great leader, it is their neighbors, their family, their friends.</p>

<p>That is why there are so many &quot;shills&quot;. I wouldn&#39;t quite call them shills, because they are more than likely state operators with persona management software. Their fear isn&#39;t any one individual rising up and taking the reins. Individuals can be discredited, ridiculed, bought, and assassinated. It is the groundswell that they fear, and that is already happening. </p>

<p>So just talk. Talk to one person. It is the most powerful act you can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UK here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been feeling a lot like this lately too. I often feel like humanity is past the point of no return. As a species, we&#39;ve lost sight of the important things. Things have become too messed up that we can&#39;t ever go back to a world where knowledge, compassion and a sense of community are paramount. Money controls everything now and that terrifies and disgusts me.</p>

<p>I feel like almost everyone I meet in everyday life seems very zoned out and oblivious to what is actually happening. We live in an age of mind numbing reality tv, designer brands, status, greed, corruption and a general sense of ignorance. </p>

<p>I could genuinely go on about this for hours. But it&#39;s really comforting to know there are other people out there who see the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally not alone there OP. I&#39;m just your average American Hoosier and I feel the exact same way. I&#39;m a human, and I care most of all about humanity. It worries me too, where this world is headed, because we humans are extremely professional at killing one another. We&#39;re masterminds. We&#39;re masterminds of nature and harnessing good power for medical understanding, scientific study, technological breakthrough...</p>

<p>But we&#39;re also masterminds of destruction. War. We have men on this planet whose sole job is to figure out how best to destroy other humans. It&#39;s really odd, from a biological standpoint. We are so hellbent on killing off our own kind, to put it generally.</p>

<p>All we can do now though is just wait and see. There&#39;s no real reason to prepare for a disaster or war by stocking up on food and whatnot. </p>

<p>The way I see it is: Even IF I survive through whatever shit hits the fan, you can bet your ass the elite who put us through it succeeded with their plan, and will continue to thrive. I think starving would be better than living to endure that pain, let alone physical hardships. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve really put ourselves into a pickle. Either we come to our senses or we&#39;re just fucked straight up man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ive been where your at for several years now.... reading into things, researching everyday,  having shit click in front of you as you watch television and how the human mind is being degraded, peoples health deteriorating. listening to podcast after podcast how egypt, libya, and syria, yemen, and al qada will terrorize the continent, to hear people talk about the food not being the same qualit and see the fruit at the grocery store and to know its imported from china. everything around you in some sort of way, will slowly kill you...</p>

<p>i screamed to my parents, who own a DME company, about the coming changes in the medical field, restrictions are more demanding, the audits will be more frequent, and the amount you can actually distribute to patients will be cut, so bigger companies can get your business when they are all bankrupt.. to get out of cash....to see it all fall out before your eyes....its overwhelming..and it got the point where i didn&#39;t  enjoy anything anymore. not when im eating, with my friends, or working at my piss easy job also..sitting comfortably on a lawn chair watching the world burn.....its time to stop watching, and reject everything that makes you sit and standby. interject the info in conversations, get back out to nature, find out what actually makes you feel human, find your center, exhaust your physical body to explore the full depth of your mind, so that way when the ignorant cunts, the dull minded docile servants engage you, or someone tries to enslave you and your fellow neighbors, you&#39;ll be poise and confident to get up and stop sitting and standing by...interject that devine intellect that makes us want to obtain our full sovereign selfs, and help people realize this life is for the fucking taking, and its ending up in the wrong peoples hands, any way you can, through music, art, congregation. using your influence of power, even though you cant get the point across to everyone in the world, or see. you can project your ideas into action and let that stand for itself, and people who think and feel how we do, will see you, and stand with you. just being yourself, and showing others how to be themselves will cause a resistance to all of this.</p>

<p>when you learn gmo you learn organics. 
when you learn malnutrition symptoms, you learn alternative health other than a DR&#39;s prescription.
when you learn that you have rights, and your not getting them, you teach yourself how to assert them. 
Teaching yourself and teaching others in itself, will cause this system to weaken and fall. and you do see spits and spats around the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes we tend to feel isolated because not too many people know what everyone in this sub does, or even have to audacity to put themselves through it, because it takes a lot to feel this way, but we cant cut the beautiful earth short. people are better and smarter than that, and just because we see so little in our lives doesnt mean its actually that way....there are tons of people who feel like you do...and thats a damn good thing. because there is a large mass of people who are getting pissed off from feeling guilty, pissed off from crying out, not being able to understand the stupidity and lack of respect for this life..pissed from not being able to smile honestly even around family, to see trails of chemicals every morning on your way to work. pissed that kids all around the world are being killed and not a whimper is said..because we know what we know, we have a moral high ground to step on, and you just gotta stand on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh. People complain alot around here. Especially about the weather. People are a lot to themselves and the typical mindset applies here as well; If it doesn&#39;t concern me I don&#39;t care. 
We probably are one of the last countries that is gonna fall. With our royalty creating bilderberger group and all.</p>

<p>The reasons for ww3 are blatantly on the news right now. I&#39;ll summarize:</p>

<p>• america said the use of chemical weapons by middle eastern countries would be the last straw.</p>

<p>• chemical attack by &#39;syrian gov&#39;t&#39; on Syrian civilians.</p>

<p>• in 2006 leaked UK documents show a plan to attack Syria with chemical weapons and. BLame it on Assad.</p>

<p>• this gives america the so called &#39;right&#39; to go and attack Syria</p>

<p>•syria has a bond with Iran that States if one of them gets attacked they will both retaliate. </p>

<p>• Russia stands behind Iran/Syria and China stands behind Russia</p>

<p>• the un will back up america without a doubt.</p>

<p>• boom ww3</p>

Also.sorry for not.providing links but I&#39;m on my phone right now. Easy to find stuff tho.</p>

<p>There are positive signs out there if you look for them. Western &quot;news&quot; is now openly mocked and recognized for the propaganda that it is.

But then again i also feel like the misery you are expeirence is due to lack of knowing what to do. You said you life is piss easy. Maybe its time to challenge what you are capable of. You lack the experience of everyday struggle and that is why you dont know what to do. You &quot;THINK&quot; you have it easy. When in reality it isnt. The only thing i can see to help is to help yourself first. Build skills, learn to survive with little commodities. Meditate. Write down how you feel. Its all about preparing for that DAY. Emotionality, mentally and physically. Until then i wish you good luck!....oh and dont forget to bring your Soul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way my friend, a month or two ago I found myself crying on the way home from work, for no reason in particular, just about the world and the way things were going. So I bought another gun. Not sure about about Dutch gun laws but it helped me. Whenever I get the opportunity I donate anything I can spare (except for anything to &quot;support the troops&quot;). I let the guy with one item go ahead of me at the grocery store. Occasionally I &quot;pay it forward&quot; in the Starbucks drive thru.  I want to be a police officer, a good one, not one that beats and cheats and harasses the public but I want to make a difference.

<p>Also good documentaries that are heavy but uplifting at the end put me in a better, more hopeful place. Ones that come to mind are Zeitgeist 2 and 3, Thrive, and Kymatica.</p>

Zeitgeist was the one that dragged me in to this whole mess but I&#39;ve come to learn that its not as truthful as they pretend to be. Zeitgeist 3 however was very good.

    <div class="md"><p>I found this on a comment in FB, and I hope it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>&quot;I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, not the GOVERNMENT of the United States. THERE IS A FUCKING DIFFERENCE, AND A HUGE ONE!
Article III says that I &quot;have an obligation to honor treaties to which the United States is a signatory as the supreme law of the land.&quot; The US is a signer on the Geneva Conventions, which state clearly that every soldier has an obligation to EXPOSE war crimes that they witness or be FOREVER held accountable for them. Bradley Manning did EXACTLY what every soldier is required - by law - to do. BY LAW, not MEN! DO NOT BE RULED BY MEN! BE RULED BY LAWS!
Of course he&#39;s being punished for it, since the people responsible for the crimes he witnessed are in charge of the system that convicted him. But that doesn&#39;t mean HUMAN justice still cannot be served, and soldiers everywhere are preparing to take down this evil regime.  I guarantee it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first comment was purely for my own amusement, it had no artistic or literary merit. Incase you are pondering my artistic and creative skills, lets just say that my art has given me a six figure income, two holidays homes and my own print house. I&#39;m not going to tell you who I am for I like to remain anonymous online. Sorry for bragging there, artist&#39;s are sensitive people. </p>

<p>Anyways to the argument, you are no more right than I am. Opinions are rarely changed through reddit comments. So lets cease to communicate.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not only miserable, you are a fool. If you don&#39;t stand up for your own people, you will have no people, and you will have nothing. If you see yourself as &quot;a citizen of the planet earth&quot; you fucking well better be a billionaire, because if you&#39;re anything less, the other races, ethnicities and religions on this planet will eventually destroy you, your children, and everything you&#39;ve built.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? No Lol. How did you get to this? I never said life was better 1000 years ago. I know this is the best time to live up till now. Especially as a Caucasian European man. Can&#39;t get better than that!</p>

<p>Least chance to die to a predator. Least chance to die of sickness. Least chance to get killed by another man. </p>

<p>Yes life is relatively good. It is not optimal though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, I&#39;ve been trolled.  The whole time I thought I was engaging in relevant discourse but now it&#39;s clear that you&#39;re just here to make conspiracy theorists look like idiots.  Fucking shills everywhere, can&#39;t believe I wasted my time on you ... there is visible corruption everywhere around us and here you are speculating about America drone attacking Russia because of Snowden which will then lead to nuclear war.  Keep your blinders on, the people in power prey on ignoramuses like yourself distracting them with the shiny idea of global apocalypse while they steal from your back pocket.  I hope you&#39;re at least getting paid by the word for your work on this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is refreshing to have people to talk to. </p>

<p>I have one friend in real life that I can talk to about this, but I am not so sure he actually believes it. I&#39;ve had debates about it at school, to the point that I actually just got up and left the lecture.</p>

<p>It is nice to have a community of people who you can talk to about this. Sure we may not agree on <em>everything</em>, but that is ok.</p>
