<p>This order is <em>not</em> limited to forced employment. It authorizes forced, unpaid <em>labor</em> during &quot;peacetime&quot; (Sec 102) and &quot;non-emergency situations,&quot; (Sec 201) without Congressional approval, and cannot be construed as unconstitutional by the courts (Sec 804). </p>

<p>It also authorizes the executive branch to unilaterally guarantee loans and contracts, to regulate market prices, and to compel research and development by the private sector. Remember, this is during peacetime and non-emergency situations. Forced, unpaid labor during peacetime <em>is</em> slavery. How else would you define it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you quote the part where it &quot;expressly authorizes forced, unpaid labor?&quot;</p>

<p>You say Section 804 but I read that and it&#39;s nothing like what you said.</p>

<p>Sec. 804.  General Provisions.  </p>

<p>(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>

<p>(b)  <strong>This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law</strong> and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>

<p>(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, no. Section 804 is where the Order is immunized against judicial review by saying that the document cannot be &quot;construed&quot; to inhibit the Director of OMB (since construing is specifically the bailiwick of the courts and means to interpret the law, which is part of the system of checks and balances). </p>

<p>The part where it says they can force unpaid labor is in 103 (c), and several other places. But of course they don&#39;t say it in those words. Instead they use legalese that carries the same meaning. What they say is that the appointed departments and agencies (all of whom are employees of the executive branch, so are under the president&#39;s authority) may &quot;take actions necessary&quot; to ensure labor. So, why does that mean they can use force? </p>

<p>Well, the executive branch is charged with the power of law enforcement. They can&#39;t take legislative action, and they can&#39;t take judicial action. They can only take military action. And militaries act with force. Simple as that. So they can use force to compel labor. It does not say they have to compensate people for it, and since this is an extension of the Defense Production Act, you&#39;ll understand that they have no intention to compensate people for the labor because it&#39;s considered a citizen&#39;s duty (under threat of execution) to work or fight for his or her country in war time, and now - because of the amendments in this Order - they consider it a citizen&#39;s duty during peacetime and non-emergency situations as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It says the executive branch can &quot;take actions necessary&quot; to ensure the availability of labor during peacetime and non-emergency situations. When the executive branch &quot;takes actions necessary,&quot; that can obviously include military action, otherwise known as &quot;force.&quot; You have to read between the lines a bit, Necro. You&#39;re allowing them to fool you with legalese. You sound smarter than that. </p>

<p>Also, stop using your alternate accoutns to upvote every one of your comments, and downvote every one of OPs. It&#39;s too obvious. Most people don&#39;t read through every comment in a thread that has gotten this lengthy. They get bored after a while. So if this were real people upvoting and downvoting, it wouldn&#39;t be almost the same number of upvotes and the same number of downvotes on every comment. It&#39;d be more upvotes and downvotes near the top comments, with a decreasing return the further you get down the page. You&#39;re giving yourself away too easily.

<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/ndrp.asp">http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/ndrp.asp</a></p>

<p>&quot;the Executive Order itself is nothing more than a restatement of policy that has been in place in decades and grants no authority to the President or the Cabinet that they don&#39;t already have under existing law. The Defense Production Act has been in effect since the Truman Administration, and authorizes the President to direct private business to allocate resources to national defense as needed in time of national emergency.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DPA has been around for a while, that&#39;s true, but having these powers during national emergencies, as you mentioned, versus having them during &quot;peacetime&quot; and &quot;non-emergency&quot; situations, is vast and merrits serious concern. The peacetime and non-emergency terms are new to <em>this</em> version of the DPA, and constitute a major amendment. </p>

<p>This incarnation of the legislation is also the first time that it has been made immune to judicial review, and to the check of Congressional approval. Those are very significant changes, as those are the most important checks of each of those respective branches - the power to declare unconstitutionality, and the power to declare war.</p>

<p>And there is a third significant amendment which manifests as a delegation of powers, normally reserves for only the President. Each of the various directors and agencies appointed therein are given authority to make executive decisions that only the President has previously been able to make, without further approval. A decentralization of Presidential authority is pretty huge in itself. Perhaps as significant as the cecession from checks and balances. It means that we now have a bunch of mini-Presidents, each in charge of a portion of Presidential authority. And those are not elected positions; they are appointed, which bypasses The People&#39;s ability to grant approval for their use. Another major check. </p>

<p>So, from that perspective, the 3 most important checks on Presidential power have been overruled by this document: Congress&#39;s power to declare war, the Judiciary&#39;s power to declare unconstitutionality, and The People&#39;s power to choose who holds the powers of the Commander in Chief. Far more than a simple re-statement of previous powers. </p>

<p>I already have explained it. Employment is a contract, and you have to be willing to be employed. How much compensation you receive has nothing to do with whether it is voluntary or involuntary. As I said before, slavery is involuntary. It doesn&#39;t get more simple than that.</p>

<p>Do you have proof that the government is literally forcing people to work for them against their will?</p>

<p>Also, where in the EO (or any other law) does it say that people may be employed against their will? And wouldn&#39;t such a law directly contradict the 13th amendment to the constitution? </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness">The full text of 13603 on Whitehouse.gov</a></p>

<p>This Executive Order is quite troubling, but perhaps not primarily for the reasons I&#39;m seeing discussed here. Two aspects of it are especially disconcerting to me: </p>

<p>One is that, although prior incarnations of this Order - in the form of the Defense Production Act - did already grant many of these powers, they did so in times of war or national emergency only, which means they required Congressional approval - a vital aspect of checks and balances. This latest version bypasses that check by extending the powers to &quot;peacetime&quot; (Sec 102 and 103(b)) and &quot;non-emergency situations&quot; (Sec 201(b)). </p>

<p>Another vital check is flouted in Section 804, where it says &quot;<em>Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>This seems relatively harmless unless you know the legal definition of the word &quot;construe.&quot; It&#39;s meaning is very specific. Only the courts can <em>construe</em>; it means to interpret the law (possibly the most important power of the courts). So what this section is saying is that the courts cannot interpret this order in any way that inhibits the guy who decides how money is spent in the Executive branch. If the Director of OMB decides that money can be allocated to the forcible seizure of labor and goods during peacetime, the courts cannot interpret this as an unconstitutional action, because that would inhibit his decision. </p>

<p>The flouting of the two most important checks and balances is tantamount to a cecession of the Executive branch from the other two branches of US government, and I find that troubling indeed.
Moreover, the Executive branch has already demonstrated a willingness to flout those powers, when it <a href="http://www.csiafoundation.com/11499-ndaa-on-trial-obama-refuses-to-abide-with-ban-against-indefinite-detention-of-americans">refused to abide a federal injunction</a> on the NDAAs indefinite detention clause, and further refused a Congressional inquiry about whether anyone had already been detained under its authority. So this is not an idle possibility of cecession; it is demonstrably in occurence. </p>
