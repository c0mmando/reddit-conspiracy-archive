<p>I can&#39;t stand those manipulating propaganda. They don&#39;t even discuss, that there shouldn&#39;t be an intervention if the chemical weapons were used by the &#39;rebels&#39;. </p>

<p>The logic is just: Chemicals were used. We have to attack Syria. Unisono.</p>

<p>Damn... We know that the US has an agenda to strike in Syria. But it infuriates me so much, that they aren&#39;t even trying anymore to convince the population that they are doing it &#39;to free the people&#39;. </p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>It&#39;s informative to see how hard the sayanim on reddit are actively denying that country was in any way involved or will benefit from an attack.  That very intensity of activity betrays who&#39;s to blame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think of it as if it&#39;s a thousand years from now and someone studies these last few decades with a very unbiased mind with alot more facts than we have now. When I do the bigger picture is obvious, but not what people describe. More like a fractal of war. Ever repeating our own nature.</p>

<p>We haven&#39;t evolved intellectually from 200K years ago so why the thought that were SMARTER today? Because we&#39;re not and will always wage war. Like bees pollinate flowers humans destroy. I&#39;m 24 and can&#39;t believe I&#39;m seeing the same lies today on Syria but you have to wake up and realize yes it&#39;s going down.</p>

<p>(insert nation name here) invasion speech: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WejYdT3Lof8&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WejYdT3Lof8&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a></p>

<p>Anyway, just read some history to figure out why your country is behaving this way. Germany is NATO so it&#39;ll be along for the crusade when the walls begin to fall. To convenient not too, and even better if they get to be part of a treaty. Think territory and resources, or even just debt which will be called war repreations.</p>

<p>Germany should be well familiar with those. It was only 2011 you finished paying for WWI. Do they even teach that today? I&#39;m genuinely interested.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Neo Colonialism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was in school, they pretty much taught us everything related to the WWII throughout high school.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the Germany today is a different Germany than at times of WWII. I really can&#39;t distinguish if the Germans today are genuinely naive in the matters of foreign policy or if they understand that there is an American driven agenda for those international conflicts and they just decide to stay on the side who wins instead on the side who&#39;s right.</p>

<p>Nonetheless. Your point that the human race is just as underdeveloped as it has always been is very valid. I often feel that society has become a parody of itself, when they claim their achievements in terms of civilization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more than Assad doesn&#39;t have a motive. </p>

<p>The implication is that we Americans, (and now Germans apparently) are expected to buy into the tired old whore of a stereotype that Assad is a crazy dictator and doesn&#39;t HAVE TO make sense or have motive outside of being a crazy dictator. </p>

<p>But no leader INVITES UN inspectors and then launches a chemical attack on the day they arrive. It&#39;s so brazenly a false flag, that it shows just how stupid the elite expect us to be. Or that they have so much faith in their plan, that they no longer believe they are required to plausibly lie to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No we really don’t.</p>

<p>If America had a reason or a desire to intervene they would have already.</p>

<p>It is not in America’s interest to attack Assad, they do not benefit from it. </p>

<p>In fact the way the conflict is looking now it would be better for the US for Assad to remain in power rather than he be overthrown and a power vacuum ensue, leading to many more years of conflict and death which would probably leak over borders in to America’s allies territory.</p>

<p>Do the rebels control any chem. Weapons sites? No, not currently. Do they control launch platforms or other weapons which can fire or deploy chem. Weapons? No, not currently. </p>

<p>Assad has already used chem. Weapons and gotten away with it, this is simply the best documented case. He uses them because he believes he can get away with it because as it has shown through its actions, the West DOES NOT want to get involved in another quagmire of a sectarian conflict like Iraq or Afghanistan which stays their hand in any possible responses. </p>

<p>EDIT: Feel free to downvote, but if you do so without replying to my comment clearly you cannot argue against my point, implying that my argument is valid and the downvote is simply made out of some subjective dislike of my opinion. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty big assumption man. You&#39;re basically saying that you have the same intelligence on the situation as the people who would actually be involved in it do. It&#39;s a poor line of reasoning for us to think that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a sweeping statement and of course I do not have all the information, however, a nation ALWAYS acts in it’s own interest. It is a fundamental rule of international politics. Sadly America and the West are less concerned with human rights abuses from chemical weapons than with how the outcome of the conflict will affect the power balance in the Middle East. </p>

<p>If you look through what Syria observers have been saying many believe this is far from the first time Assad has used chemical weapons, he will continue to use them as he is of the belief no one in the International community will stop him.</p>

<p>My point is that the OP believes America has an agenda set out to intervene in Syria. If this is so then why have they not already done so? Obama said chemical weapon use was a red line for intervention, so why have they not moved already? I am sure the Pentagon has many plans or ideas about how the US could intervene.</p>

<p>If we perform a cost/benefit analysis of the situation (which is what every interested nation will be doing) I would argue the benefit of American intervention is not worth the cost.</p>

<p>What would America gain from intervention? I would argue very little to nothing and offer that in support of my original comment. </p>
