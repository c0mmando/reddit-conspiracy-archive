<p><a href="http://i4.minus.com/ibnvbY1xjJ1fPD.png">Proof of censored feedback here</a>.</p>

<p>Update 1: They are now using the spam filter to &quot;shadow-delete comments&quot;-<a href="http://minus.com/mNeGbgDpn8Z6J">http://minus.com/mNeGbgDpn8Z6J</a>. These comments, instead of rendering as deleted, simply do not appear. Original source for that comment string is <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1le830/fri_rpoliticaldiscussion_cross_post_thread/cbygbf6?context=7">here</a></p>

<p>Update 2: <a href="http://i4.minus.com/iboh0evAHWOpGA.png">They are now nuking all criticism.</a> It&#39;s all over boys, they&#39;re gonna be allowed to v4 the place; on to snapzu we go I guess.</p>

<p>Udate 3: Another example of shadowdelete being used is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1le830/fri_rpoliticaldiscussion_cross_post_thread/cbyhcje">here</a>. </p>

<p>That string renders like <a href="http://i5.minus.com/iT4cRoDRRSeAa.png">this</a> on my screen. </p>

<p>It&#39;s now really fucking clear why mods wanted to be able to add comments to the spam filter. I&#39;m reporting this bullshit to some of the investors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a reflection of the pervasive influence afforded to monied faction in the American Political culture; this community of certain mods simply inculcates that condition and it seems only the power of public discourse will stop them.

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like they deleted an unhelpful and unproductive comment in order to try to foster better discussion. That&#39;s not &quot;feedback&quot; that they&#39;re &quot;censoring&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, that is not a general feedback thread. It is a discussion thread. As someone else in that thread pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we don&#39;t need is repetitive multiple repeating posts from one person across thread after thread. This thread is not about feedback, which by the way, we have gotten from you, and I thank you for it. This thread is a guided discussion.</p>

<p>So, no. We&#39;re not trying to silence your feedback because we disagree with it. We&#39;re silencing it :here:, :in this thread:, because we have had more than enough from you elsewhere from all the times you&#39;ve posted it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you can&#39;t say they&#39;re censoring feedback when right there in the picture you posted there is actual, constructive, relevant feedback from someone else that is still there two hours later. (Why did they delete yours and not his? Because yours was not constructive or particularly relevant.)</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a thread you don&#39;t like, then reddit already has a built-in system for expressing that: downvote and move on.</p>

<p>Mods have said upvote/downvotes will not be taken as community feedback on stickies. They even went so far as to say that feedback through comments is all that mattered. That they attack and censor me for my feedback is more likely indicative of their nefarious intent regarding the implementation of these stickies than it is an earnest attempt to foster discussion.</p>
