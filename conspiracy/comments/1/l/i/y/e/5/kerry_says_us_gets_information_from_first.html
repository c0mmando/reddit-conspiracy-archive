        Activist Razan Zaitouneh, who runs the Violations Documentation Center in Syria, tells FP that her team sped to the Damascus suburb of Zamalka immediately after a chemical weapons attack was reported there on Aug. 21.
        <em>
         The media staff of Zamalka's local coordination committee, which is responsible for filming videos in the area and uploading them to the world, also sped to the scene. According to Zaitouneh, all but one of them paid with their lives.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        "The chemical attacks, on the first day of the massacre, claimed the lives of many media activists in Zamalka coordination because they inhaled the chemical toxic gases," Murad Abu Bilal, the sole survivor, told Zaitouneh in an interview uploaded to -- what else -- YouTube[...]
       </p>
       <p>
        The videos quickly removed any doubt for U.S. intelligence analysts that chemical weapons were used in the Aug. 21 attack.

       So, those responsible for documentation of war crimes walked into a warzone with no protective gear whatsoever, and survived just long enough to film footage and deliver it, and then all but one person, drops dead? It's very convenient...and it makes no sense.

       Of course. I should have clarified my point, that
       <a href="http://www.vdc-sy.info/index.php/en/">
        the Violations Documentation Center in Syria
       </a>
       is an established organization created for this specific purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand a group of people rushing to the scene amidst the chaos of war and not putting on protective gear. It doesn't make sense, however, that an organization whose
       <em>
        sole purpose it is to document these violations
       </em>
       would not have at least some protective gear, especially considering that they are receiving financial support from somewhere "overseas". Take a wild guess who that could be.
      </p>
      <p>
       "[T]hey went out to shoot and collect information about the chemical attack, but none of them came back." This quote from the leader also leaves questions to be answered, mostly - how did he retrieve all of their footage? He lost his entire crew, but none of their footage?
      </p>
      <p>
       "The local activists who filmed these videos, then, have accomplished what years of hectoring from the official Syrian opposition have been unable to do -- bring the world to the brink of military intervention against Bashar al-Assad's regime."
      </p>
      <p>
       These "activists" have brought us to the brink of WWIII and we will never know a thing about them. They served the same role as a spy or informant, and now they have all been disappeared.

      <p>
       In a whirlwind of unprovable accusations and political rhetoric - this statement is just more useless speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having "some protective gear" isn't going to do much against an airborne dispersal of Sarin.  You're either suited up all the way - or you're pretty much fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And AGAIN, exposure doesn't mean instant death in all cases - therefore the idea that these people either delivered their "evidence" in person, or passed it on to persons who were unexposed is obviously plausible.  It doesn't require magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I have no idea if these people even existed, let alone entered the Level A or Level B Red Zone and were poisoned.  That's why I'm not making wild accusations about them based on supposition and suspicion.  Like they were "disappeared."

       Your argument:
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       = talkin' shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I reading that correctly?
      </p>
      <p>
       My expectations for most of Reddit are fairly low -
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       being a notable exception.  What I would love to see in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is for people to drop this insane attitude that engaging in conspiracy discussion is an exercise in broad speculation without any evidence.  It's the reason so much shite gets written on this sub - and it is responsible for the reputation this sub deserves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not personal - this is merely me wanting people to stop talking shit and to start backing up their speculations with reasonable attempts to be logical, accurate, and methodical in their reasoning.  The goal, IMO, is not to muddy the discussion, but to clarify it.  In that spirit, I called out some of your statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       draws all kinds of persons.  Maybe I'm just the asshole who cares about accuracy and real information.  I'm cool with that.  And I certainly don't begrudge anyone their concerns about the motives and actions of the U.S. government.  Peace to you as well, sir.

       They're just looking to get things started as soon as possible. First they said they don't need the UN, then Obama said he doesn't need congress. None of it matters - there will be a strike on Assad's military assets so the rebels can overrun the government.

       Notice the fast blink (&gt; 2 per second at times) during key segments of his meet the press interview?
      </p>
      <p>
       He was lying during his release of the ricin info and much of the interview. Whatever he wasn't telling us, it seriously stessed him out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Towards the middle/end, his blink rate went normal (he naturally blinks a little more due to his eye condition) so not everything was a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most was. Don't listen to whatever state says.

       They are spies. They can't say it out loud because it would be an act of war. You can't legally have your spies in another country you know, spying and what not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other country has to come out and say it and if they do come out and say than that gives room for others to think they are running and a weak and incompetent campaign not to mention the solid snake exclamation point over the head of other spies that might still be in said country.
