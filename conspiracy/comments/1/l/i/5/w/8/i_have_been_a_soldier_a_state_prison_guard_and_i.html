       I hear of these people being treated poorly by police, and i look at what our government is doing and i am disgusted.  I used to think that maybe if I jump on their side I could possibly change it for the good even if only in my area.  Now I am realizing that it is to late.  The  trap has been set and the only thing that can change it now is a complete restart ( revolution ).  I love my country I served it for over a decade in the military.  I love the people of this country no matter what color or religion.  I never want to see harm come to them, but that is what the people that are supossed to guard us are doing... hurting the people.  I can not be a part of that so i called the processing station and my state police recruiter and said i am going to discontinue my entrance into the state police.  He was shocked.  He said to me "why? after all the testing and all the interviews why now.  You tested off the charts on both the oral and written exam, you have a squeaky clean backround and perfect finances, why are you throwing all away?"  I responded I can not give myself to a cause that I have stopped beleiving in and the obvious wrongs that this department is willing to enforce.  I was never taking this job for the money I was looking for a job i want to do and this is not it... so i respectfully decline youroffer of employment.  the next thing he siad scared the shit out of me.  He responded "So, I guess we will have another constitutional enthusiast to deal with in a few months. I said really? what does that mean? he said all you assholes that think you can still have the rights of our forefathers are in for a rude awakening and it is gonna happen soon.  I said ok so what is gonna happen soon, he said that the state police along with dozens of other enforcement organizations have been prepared for a radical change in the coming months that will once and for all get rid of the nonsupporters of the current administration, I said thanks by the way this was all recorded and he said fuck you and hung up the phone.  Now what to do?

       OP, you are a stand-up American.  You are also a real human.  You did a great thing.  If everyone did the same, there would be no enforcement wing of the NWO's cynical agenda.  That's all the military and police are at this point: remember the Mafia and their soldiers?  The fat cats always sit way at the back in the shadows while their thugs carry out their crimes.  The fact that there are people bragging about not being one of those saps that believes in Constitutional rights...f***ing Fascists.

I am still tring but gave up for the night ill get bvack to it tomorrow.  trust me if i can get it to work this is the first place i am putting it.

       haha...ok. it just sounded rather suspicious. Your digital recorder decides to go caput...taking the "proof" with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you get the file off the recorder? Mount it as a harddrive and copy the file then send it to one of us.

       i tried, it is the kind that you push a little button and a USB drive pops out and you plug the recorder itself into the computer, the problem is the computer says it can not upload data because the device is uncompatible and that i need to reformat it but I need to link it to the computer to do it so you see my catch 22, i am going to bestbuy tomorrow to the guys that sold me this shit they are both brand new devices and should work

       I'd like to also suggest RIP (Recovery is Possible) which is a "live" Slackware Linux distro that is built to recover files.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I'm betting that you don't want to learn Linux just to get your files off the recorder...

       If all else fails, though, it will work.

       Even if it sounds awful, still do it and upload it for us. A low quality recording is better than nothing. If you can fix it later and reupload a higher quality, great, if not at least we have something to work with. Someone around here might even be able to fix up the low quality version with some software.

       that is what a lot of people are implying, yet I served for a long time and i am very active in local politics and i have not seen anything concrete about the coming end with exemption of a couple police budgets that were to high for things like armored vehicles and the DHS hording ammo and riot gear.  but that does not mean i am not preparing me and mine for survival.

       It's coming. Gun laws and exploitation of tragedies to push the agenda. UN Small Arms treaty to bypass the Constitution.

       Remember, the only way to protest is self-sufficiency, which they are cracking down on. Disarmament comes next, can't have the people armed during martial law. Anyone who thinks I'm blowing smoke, look at what happened during Katrina.

       play it back into a voice memo recorder on your phone. then email that to your computer. editing from there will be simple. and if the digital recorder has a headphone jack that's rca and the  phone does as well, you might even be able to play the message directly into your smart phone and record it.

       I made a comment about America being asleep and needing to educated themselves like we once were in a patriotic subreddit  and received more flak about being a commie than ever.  I was promoting America being smart and got shot down.  WTF America?
