    <div class="md"><p>You are looking at this to superficially. The amount of work that would need to be done at WTC 1, 2, and 7 to demolish them would have been impossible to keep secret, that is a fact. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of explosive charges, not to mention the beam weakening that is necessary in a controlled demolition, on thousands of support beams without being noticed is impossible. </p>

<p>Again, you are oversimplifying things. It was not a regular run of the mill &quot;office fire&quot; that you ignorantly claim. And you very conveniently left out the fact that WTC 7 received heavy structural damage form the collapse of WTC 1. This structural damage on top of fires burning for hours on end with no response from the firefighters is enough to bring down a building. For a building to collapse the fires do not need to completely melt the support beams, just weaken them. Once the penthouse collapsed, the entire building was standing on two already fire weakened support beams and collapsed. </p>

<p>If you want to believe that a team of hundreds of people rigged the WTC with hundreds of thousands of pounds of explosives unnoticed, then go for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion and through the research I have done on the subject, the official story is full of holes, from the collapse of building 7, to the fact that the world&#39;s most secure air space was defeated 4 times in one day, supposedly by a bunch of arabs who could barely fly a single engine Cessna.  Also the fact that a good number of the 19 hijackers have turned up very much alive in the years after 9/11.  Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth have disputed the NIST report and are calling for a new, independent investigation of 9/11 and I support that too.  The government, on the other hand, is just fine with their fabrication of lies which is the underfunded, set up to fail, 9/11 commission report.

<p>from the collapse of building 7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly about the official story of WTC7 collapsed has holes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the world&#39;s most secure air space was defeated 4 times in one day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time of the hijackings, there were only 6 jets available to intercept the planes on the entire East Coast. Its not very easy to get planes up in the air in a short amount of time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what you mean by defeated but that&#39;s just what I&#39;ve found.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>supposedly by a bunch of arabs who could barely fly a single engine Cessna</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going with that but the fact is that it is not hard to learn to fly a plane, not to mention all the hijackers had to do was steer the plane. It can also be argued that it is easier to fly a large commercial plane compared to a smaller Cessna due to the amount of technology on the plane. At end of it all, all planes are very similar in how they are flown and directed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also the fact that a good number of the 19 hijackers have turned up very much alive in the years after 9/11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No hijackers were found after the attacks because they died when they flew into the towers. If you&#39;re referring to the report that shows other people with the same name then you&#39;re argument is basically that no one else in the area could have the same name. Not a very strong argument in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth have disputed the NIST report and are calling for a new, independent investigation of 9/11 and I support that too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re talking about a small group of around 2,000 members that is going against the official story and the rest of the hundreds of thousands if not millions of architects, physicists, and engineers that agree with the official story. A very small minority.</p>

<p>Call me what you want but in our time science and empirical evidence is held at a higher regard than the assumptions and speculation you are bringing forward. Unless you or someone else can prove any of you&#39;re points, or even support them with reliable evidence, it is all just pure speculation and assumption.</p>

<p>There were, at last count, two million people in the U.S. whose job title is &quot;engineer.&quot; This does not include people who have degrees in engineering who work in other fields. Just to give some perspective. So basically, 2000 or so out of two million signed off on the ae911truth version.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, don&#39;t leave out why there were no jets around to scramble.  It was because they were all tied up, running drills about planes being flown into buildings.  Nice coincidence there, don&#39;t you think?   Also, WTC7 was not hit by a plane, but it still collapsed, even at free fall speed for a period of time.  This is impossible according to the laws of physics.  The Commission report won&#39;t even touch it.  Danny Jowenko was a demolition expert and when he was shown footage of WTC7, he was certain that is was a controlled demolition.  Not so coincidentally, he was killed in an auto accident 3 days after his interview on the subject.</p>

<p>A building does not need to be hit by a plane to collapse. WTC 7 was hit by falling debris from the collapse of WTC 1 and suffered significant structural damage visible in photographs. The fires did not help at all. Just to make it clear, the support beams do not need to completely melt for the building to lose structural integrity, all it needs is some type of heat source that expands the metal support beams and the structure loses almost all its integrity. The entire building did not fall at free fall speed. If anything fell at free fall speed it would be the portion around the penthouse that collapsed a whole 8-10 seconds before the rest of the building. Not to mention the non symmetrical collapse of WTC 7 which brings me to your next point. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If this really was a controlled demolition, I have no clue how an expert in the field would be able to tell seeing how sloppy the job was done. Since when are different parts of a large building demolished at different times? Doesn&#39;t make sense. Not to mention the fact that there were no recorded or measured explosions directly related to the collapse. </p>

<p>On your point of his death, that is a logical fallacy. Post hoc ergo propter hoc. Just because A occurred, then B occurred, it does not mean A caused B.</p>

<p>Maybe this&#39;ll interest you, or at the least antagonize you.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking magic here. We&#39;re talking concrete, material, objective speculation and investigative work. </p>

<p>The official narrative is so suspect it isn&#39;t even funny. It&#39;s only &quot;official&quot; in that the people pushing it are working out of offices. It&#39;s entirely a narrative and a poorly constructed one at that.</p>

<p>Why was the nations airspace defences shut down on 9/11?</p>

<p>What was al-quaeda&#39;s motivation for the attack?</p>

<p>How did these jihadists manage to fly commercial airliners when they couldn&#39;t operate a single engine airplane?</p>

<p>Why did bbc report WTC7 falling before it did?</p>

<p>How did every news station know al-quaeda was responsible within an hour of the attacks, when we didn&#39;t even suspect al-quaeda was planning such an attack?</p>

<p>Why did WTC7 fall?</p>

<p>How did the hijacker&#39;s passport excape the carnage that brought down a skyscraper unscathed?</p>

<p>Why did we immediately use 9/11 as a pretext for a war against countries unassociated with the attacks?</p>

<p>Where was flight 93 headed and where was the wreckage?</p>

<p>Why was the turbine engine recovered from the Pentagon smaller than the engine found in a 757?</p>

<p>Who profited (greatly) from the attacks?</p>

<p>Reason dictates that either the official narrative is a fabrication or a miracle. C&#39;mon, put you&#39;re thinking cap on and show us you&#39;re not grounded in fantasy.</p>

<p>Swallowed the narrative? Only reason I even agree somewhat with the official narrative is due to the fact that everything is explained in scientific terms and is scientific fact. Independent study is important, which is something I think you completely missed. Your ideas are not original and have been used by conspiracy theorists to &quot;prove&quot; a government coverup which makes me believe you are simply a follower.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Occam&#39;s razor. It was planted. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not touting evidence, I&#39;m merely asking questions which rouse suspicion that the &quot;official&quot; narrative is a fabrication.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say that nothing in that fabricated narrative is scientific. I am going tosay that there isn&#39;t a consensus as to the validity of the science used to prove the narrative post-hoc.  </p>

<p>Science didn&#39;t knock down the building. People did. Science doesn&#39;t do things. People do.</p>

<p>Your entire side of this dialogue between you and I consists of repeating the word science, then accusing me of dogmatism and shilling. </p>

<p>There is nothing scientific or rational about your trust in the MSM and the government. </p>

<p>Besides I don&#39;t need to discredit the gvt. They do a fine job of it themselves. (See Kerry using images of murdered Iraqis as a pretext for invading Syria.)</p>

<p>Do you even live on this planet? JFK? Gulf of Tonkin? Operation Northwoods? WMD&#39;s in Iraq? ? ? ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does any of that have to do with anything we&#39;re talking about? If I didn&#39;t know any better, it would seem like you&#39;re trying to change the subject.</p>

<p>I never said the building was knocked down by science. Thats an idiotic statement. I&#39;m saying the collapse of the building can be proven to have fallen due to structural damage and fires. </p>

<p>So, according to you, the only possible logical explanation to why the passport survived the crash is that someone planted it? <strong>Things have survived a plane crash that shouldn&#39;t have, it does not prove a government conspiracy.</strong> In fact, there have been many instances where things like credit cards, photographs, letters, wallets, money, etc have survived a high speed plane crash i.e. Flight 93.</p>

<p>An example that would help me explain is the Columbia disaster. Even though it exploded at 40 miles above sea level, small worms and debris survived. There&#39;s no explanation on how it happened but it did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The building obviously collapsed. The scientific debate revolves around whether jet fuel and the impact of an airliner is enough to fell a tower, and whether or not other accelerants and explosives were used.</p>

<p>Flight 93 is a pretty bunk example of things surviving high speed plane crashes, especially considering the fact that we&#39;re discussing the 9/11 narrative.</p>

<p>The Columbia disaster is a poor example, considering the fact that it&#39;s an entirely different set of circumstances.</p>

<p>Back on track (funny how now I&#39;m accusing you of derailing our discussion train), you seem steadfastly convinced that jet airliners are capable of felling towers. I&#39;m not sure that there are any examples of this being the case aside from WTC1 and WTC2.</p>

<p>You also are steadfastly convinced that falling debris and office fires are cabable of felling a building. Another thing that I&#39;m uncertain there are examples of outside of WTC7.</p>

<p>There are numerous examples of buildings surviving impacts by airplanes as well as surviving office fires. In fact, buildings are especially designed to suffer both kinds of damage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll leave it as simple as this. A building hit with a large passenger plane at a high rate of speed in addition to large uncontrolled fires can cause a building to collapse. </p>

<p>As for WTC 7, the building had structural damage caused by falling debris from WTC 1. This with the uncontrolled fires caused the building to collapse. </p>

<p>All in all, it is possible for a building to collapse due to fires and structural damage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you are being consistent. Since WTC 7 succumbed to office fires and falling debris, would an airliner really be necessary to push over WTC 1? Couldn&#39;t you just launch some debris at freefall speeds and torch the building?</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t any instances of towers being felled by airliners outside the official 9/11 narrative. And there aren&#39;t any instances of towers being felled by debris and fire either.</p>

<p>There are numerous instances of towers being felled by controlled demolition, and numerous professionals staking their reputation on the fact that WTC&#39;s 1, 2 and 7 were brought down this very way.</p>

<p>The debate largely seems to revolve around whether or not jet fuel accelerated office fires can weaken steel beams to the point of collapsing under the weight of the above floors. I can&#39;t say. It seems plausible, but only just.</p>

<p>But I find the point moot. Much more fascinating is the argument that debris and office fires could bring down WTC 7.  That claim just seems outright absurd. There couldn&#39;t&#39;ve been much jet fuel accelerating the fires in WTC 7. And I&#39;ve yet to see a video that shows WTC 1 dropping structurally damaging amounts of debris on WTC 7.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s a flurry of suspicious activities surrounding the owners of the airlines, the owner of the building, the security companies in charge of both, the military, the media, the terrorists, the hijackers, the deaths of people investigating the matter... etc.</p>

<p>Anything is possible. What we should discuss is the probability. And from my perspective as an internet savvy pre-teen,  the probability of 9/11 being planned and executed by a handful of angry, disillusioned CIA patsies is about as low as the probability that Oswald was the sole shooter in Dallas that sunny Autumn day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why was the nations airspace defences shut down on 9/11?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t, as evidenced by the fact that they had any jets to send up at all, no matter how few or slow they were.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What was al-quaeda&#39;s motivation for the attack?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Advancing their ideologies? Disliking Western/US influence in their culture? Being absolutely insane? Something else? A combination of those? Why does it matter to your argument?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did these jihadists manage to fly commercial airliners when they couldn&#39;t operate a single engine airplane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/flight_school_dropouts.html">They weren&#39;t actually terrible pilots by the end of it.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did bbc report WTC7 falling before it did?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/pull.htm">Miscommunication. Something along the lines of &quot;fear of collapse&quot; becoming &quot;has collapsed&quot; in the rush to get the story out.</a> (ctrl-f &quot;BBC&quot; on that for the part I&#39;m referring to)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did every news station know al-quaeda was responsible within an hour of the attacks, when we didn&#39;t even suspect al-quaeda was planning such an attack?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know the answer to that, but it&#39;s a good question. (Was it really only an hour?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did WTC7 fall?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Damage from WTC1 falling starting uncontrolled fires, leading to a weakening of the support system and an eventual chain reaction of failures causing it to collapse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did the hijacker&#39;s passport excape the carnage that brought down a skyscraper unscathed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dumb luck. <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/passport_recovered.html">Read this.</a> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/E4sfy7N.jpg">There was actually a lot of debris that made it out just fine.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did we immediately use 9/11 as a pretext for a war against countries unassociated with the attacks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who knows. But don&#39;t you think that if it was <em>really</em> an inside job to get us to go to war, they could have at least gotten hijackers from the countries they planned on attacking? Or at the very least, couldn&#39;t they have lied and <em>said</em> that&#39;s where they were from? As it stands, that point alone only suggests that it was, at worst, exploited as a sort of &quot;happy accident&quot; to get us to war (perhaps hoping that the public wouldn&#39;t really care about details like that), rather than an intentionally engineered plot for that purpose.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/conspiracy/q0265.shtml">It wasn&#39;t.</a> Well, obviously the <em>parts</em> that were found were smaller than a <em>whole</em> engine, but not any smaller than the parts should have been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was clarifying my position.</p>

<p>You <em>were</em> indirectly citing the 9/11 Commission Report. Don&#39;t you read the links you send people?</p>

<p>As for the literary praise the 9/11 Commission Report has recieved, I guess since they knew so many people would want to read it they threw in the extra effort to write it well. Alternatively, I suspect that they wrote the supposedly objective report persuasively. I have zero evidence for that last claim, btw.</p>

<p>I just think it&#39;s silly to assume that the US Gov wasn&#39;t involved in the planning, execution and subsequent coverup of the 9/11 attacks. Historically speaking, Al Qaeda was created by the CIA. It originally referred to their database of insurgents, insurrectionists, spies, money-launderers, arms-smugglers that they used to <strong>destabilize and destroy sovereign countries.</strong></p>

<p>The US has a rich history of destabilizing sovereign countries abroad as well as at home. Look what LBJ and Bush Sr. did to JFK. These guys are <em>repeat offenders.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe that all this discussion about how the twin towers and WTC 7 fell serves only to drive a wedge between people who would otherwise work together.</p>

<p>In the end what matters isn&#39;t <em>how</em> the buildings fell- terrorists, explosives or thermite- but what the government did after the buildings fell. Right after 9/11 the government rushed off to strip liberties from the citizens with the Patriot Act and setting up the TSA and the DHS, which do absolutely nothing to protect us and end up just taking away our freedoms. If what actually happened was terrorists flying planes into buildings, or explosive, or thermite, or whatever- none of this truly matters in the end, as the result is the same.</p>

<p>I look at the evidence and draw one conclusion, while other people will look at the same evidence and come to a completely different conclusion. We can choose to either argue until we&#39;re both blue in the face about how we&#39;re right and the other person is wrong or we can take that time and energy and spend it educating people about the ways that their liberties have been eroded since 9/11 and we&#39;ve just bent over and allowed the TSA to shove their gloved hands up our collective asses and herd us like cattle through scanners that let them see us naked.</p>

<p>All of which do nothing but provide the illusion of security. (Or as <a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a> calls it &quot;Security Theater.&quot; Seriously- read his blog.)</p>

<p>Groups like AE911Truth will never convince enough people that there was a cover up. People who run the Debunking 9/11 website will never sway Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth to their way of thinking. Arguing that is was controlled demolitions or thermite or that it was neither of those will accomplish nothing. </p>

<p>All this time and energy would be put to better use reminding people of the freedoms they <em>used</em> to have and educating them about how the TSA and the DHS are complete bullshit and encouraging them to stand up and make their elected representatives work to reinstate the freedoms that America claims to be so proud of.</p>

<p>So if you want to know what conspiracy theory about 9/11 I personally believe in, I&#39;d have to say &quot;The one where a bunch of people in power wanted to have even more power and an event happened that allowed them to take it.&quot; Whether or not they actually engineered it is irrelevant as the end result is the same and we should all be working together to take back what our own Declaration of Independence declares to be basic human rights: Life, <em>Liberty</em>, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

<blockquote>
<p>from the collapse of building 7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly about the official story of WTC7 collapsed has holes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the world&#39;s most secure air space was defeated 4 times in one day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time of the hijackings, there were only 6 jets available to intercept the planes on the entire East Coast. Its not very easy to get planes up in the air in a short amount of time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what you mean by defeated but that&#39;s just what I&#39;ve found.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>supposedly by a bunch of arabs who could barely fly a single engine Cessna</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going with that but the fact is that it is not hard to learn to fly a plane, not to mention all the hijackers had to do was steer the plane. It can also be argued that it is easier to fly a large commercial plane compared to a smaller Cessna due to the amount of technology on the plane. At end of it all, all planes are very similar in how they are flown and directed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also the fact that a good number of the 19 hijackers have turned up very much alive in the years after 9/11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No hijackers were found after the attacks because they died when they flew into the towers. If you&#39;re referring to the report that shows other people with the same name then you&#39;re argument is basically that no one else in the area could have the same name. Not a very strong argument in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth have disputed the NIST report and are calling for a new, independent investigation of 9/11 and I support that too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re talking about a small group of around 2,000 members that is going against the official story and the rest of the hundreds of thousands if not millions of architects, physicists, and engineers that agree with the official story. A very small minority.</p>

<p>Call me what you want but in our time science and empirical evidence is held at a higher regard than the assumptions and speculation you are bringing forward. Unless you or someone else can prove any of you&#39;re points, or even support them with reliable evidence, it is all just pure speculation and assumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The building obviously collapsed. The scientific debate revolves around whether jet fuel and the impact of an airliner is enough to fell a tower, and whether or not other accelerants and explosives were used.</p>

<p>Flight 93 is a pretty bunk example of things surviving high speed plane crashes, especially considering the fact that we&#39;re discussing the 9/11 narrative.</p>

<p>The Columbia disaster is a poor example, considering the fact that it&#39;s an entirely different set of circumstances.</p>

<p>Back on track (funny how now I&#39;m accusing you of derailing our discussion train), you seem steadfastly convinced that jet airliners are capable of felling towers. I&#39;m not sure that there are any examples of this being the case aside from WTC1 and WTC2.</p>

<p>You also are steadfastly convinced that falling debris and office fires are cabable of felling a building. Another thing that I&#39;m uncertain there are examples of outside of WTC7.</p>

<p>There are numerous examples of buildings surviving impacts by airplanes as well as surviving office fires. In fact, buildings are especially designed to suffer both kinds of damage.</p>

<p>Science me bro. </p>
