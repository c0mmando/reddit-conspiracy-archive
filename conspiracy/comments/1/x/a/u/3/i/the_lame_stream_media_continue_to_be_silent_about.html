       It's now been over 6 hours and only the sound of crickets has been heard from M$M. 
If the BLS had reported +200k jobs the media would of been all over it within 30 minutes. But not even the BLS can lie that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       As expected the January jobs report is a significant disappointment to the voodoo economists - 113,000 actual vs 180,000 expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the 4th dire jobs report in a row (from October to January).
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the last 4 months 355,000 jobs have been added, or an average of 89,000 per month.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about half the number of jobs that are needed to be created just to keep up with population growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real unemployment has gone up by around 320,000 over the last 4 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       (The headline rate of unemployment has only gone down because several hundred thousand people have chosen to leave the labor force over the last 4 months because there just aren't any decent paying jobs out there.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The US labor market conditions continue to deteriorate.
      </p>
      <p>
       2013 averaged 110,000 new jobs per month.
      </p>
      <p>
       December jobs data highlights - massive miss +74,000 vs +200,000 Expectations, 1 million FEWER jobs than in 2012

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This has jobs data going back to the end of 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real jobs data since the start of 2009 - there has been no recovery despite what the talking heads want you to think
      </p>

       For January there was very little difference between the Establishment and Household surveys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Establishment was +113,000, Household was +107,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the recent dire jobs reports the BLS have seen fit to arbitrarily add 509,000 jobs to the numbers reported for 2013 in the Household survey. (See the release and this.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because the Establishment and Household surveys became so out of sync in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Establishment survey (used in the headline jobs numbers) dramatically over stated the numbers of jobs created in 2013 (by 1 million jobs) due to uncorrected errors in the BLS Birth/Death model for periods of slow economic growth and some other factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/05/business-start-ups-bls-birthdeath-model.html">
        http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/05/business-start-ups-bls-birthdeath-model.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       See also this on the deeply flawed Birth/Death model reporting.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I will need to take account of the arbitrary addition of 509,000 jobs by the BLS for 2013 in the Household survey, in my future jobs number reporting.

       all of these numbers are misleading anyway, several economists have estimated the actual jobless rate anywhere from 20-35%

       I was

        just
       </em>
       at the gym today about an hour ago and CNN was discussing the job report...
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's not not being talked about but it's definitely not being discussed enough. My 2 cents.

       I've seen multiple posts claiming it's a great thing saying things like "US adds 113,000 jobs!" all the while not mentioning that it doesn't keep up with the population growth rate nor meeting the expected figures.

       If you recall from a few years ago, we were living in this bizzaro world where unemployment going up was a reason for the stock market to rally, because higher unemployment meant the Fed would lower rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never mind that fundamentally, higher unemployment
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       make the stock market react negatively.

       a carefully worded PR saved the Dow from doing a 1929.

       Loads of examples. NPR isn't as bad as CNN/Fox/MSNBC etc, but theyr'e still mainstream news that have an agenda and have to to the line of "moderation" or else they lose their funding.

       Nordite's links are good enough to start with.

       When Obama won something (either the Dem nomination or the general election, I forget), the very next morning, instead of doing a piece on Obama's victory, they did a piece on how South Africa went to shit after the blacks took over. There was nothing "breaking" in their piece. They could have played it ten years ago or ten year from now... but they just had to run it on that day? Needless to say, I was pissed and never listened to NPR the same way again.
