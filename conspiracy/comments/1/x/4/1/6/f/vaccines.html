        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So a few days ago I wrote a post asking for information about vaccines.  I was disappointed by the caliber of the responses I received from the anti-vaccine camp in here.  I&#39;m sitting around here waiting for my baby to be born so I&#39;ve decided to update everyone with my decision and why we&#39;re going to vaccinate the baby and any future children we have.  My partner and I have decided that our daughter will receive <strong>ALL</strong> her childhood vaccines on the recommended CDC schedule.  When I posted in other groups (with a different name), the pro-vaxers were able to give well-thought out scientifically sound reasoning as to why my baby should be vaccinated.  They were able to cite a lot of research showing vaccines pose very little risk and that the benefits outweigh those risks. I also did a lot of research on the CDC and WHO websites and talked to my OBGYN, a pediatrician friend, and the pediatrician we have selected for our child.  None of them were able to give me any good reason not to vaccinate our child and said the only real life threatening issue that could come up is a severe allergic reaction.</p>

<p>The responses I received from the anti-vax camp were very shakey, at best.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;Why vaccinate a baby for a disease it is extremely unlikely to contract until it is a teenager or adult?  Why get so many vaccines at once?&quot;  <strong>This wasn&#39;t an answer at all, it was a philosophical question.  Why?  Because after much research, I&#39;ve decided to protect my baby now instead of worrying about treatment options if those diseases are contracted.  There is very little change of harm from vaccines and the scientific literature proves it.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Was there ever a rigorous study (and studies to verify results) testing the possible harmful effects of multiple vaccines taken at once or withing the same year on babies?&quot;  <strong>Side-effects to vaccines are very well documented.  Babies are exposed to many harmful antigens as soon as they are born and they come out fine.  Also, babies aren&#39;t given that many vaccines in their first year.  In the first 12 months of life they receive seven vaccines: hepatitis B, rotavirus, DTaP, Hib, pneumococcal, polio, and after six months they can receive the influenza vaccine.  Again, that&#39;s only seven vaccines.  Their bodies can handle these vaccines quite well.  Again, they are exposed to many more antigens and chemicals on a daily basis than they are given in these vaccines.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The reality is, most of the diseases that are vaccinated against are quite rare in the industrialized, advanced west.&quot;  <strong>This is an extremely dangerous opinion to have.  If you&#39;ve been following the news, there are outbreaks of measles and pertussis in the US that are reaching epidemic status - IN THE WEST.  A large part of these are in WESTERN Europe because the Wakefield &quot;study&quot; heavily influences parents not to vaccinate their children.  Now, those same parents and the press are asking &quot;WHY?&quot;  The answer is &quot;you were stupid enough to be influenced by a fraud.&quot;  Also, with global travel increasing, the risk of bringing one of these diseases back to the US or another &quot;industrialized, advanced west&quot; and infecting vulnerable individuals increases.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>So in conclusion, the arguments I got against vaccinating my little one were terrible <strong>NO</strong> one could give me any sort of credible, scientifically founded argument against them.  I received philosophical arguments ONLY.  As a result, I&#39;ve decided that protecting my baby early on is the best decision I an make for her because I love her and want to protect her from harm as much as possible.  I&#39;ve realized that the anti-vax movement is very shakey and is founded in a lack of basic understanding of science.  Whether or not these diseases are rare, I don&#39;t care - the risk posed by the diseases is greater than those posed by vaccines (as can be found on the CDC and WHO websites).  I&#39;d rather not take the chance that an unvaccinated child infects my baby because their parents made a poor and uninformed decision.</p>

<p>Here is my original thread:  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wm2hz/going_to_be_a_new_mom_soon_questions_about/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wm2hz/going_to_be_a_new_mom_soon_questions_about/</a></p>

<p>ETA:  My mind has been made up.  I&#39;m glad I was able to see that those who are pushing to halt vaccinations really can&#39;t provide any sort of valid and scientific argument for their stance.  Instead they mock science and doctors (who have the expertise, knowledge, and education) who are pushing for the protection of my child.  They have the best interest of my child at heart.  No one here does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why the debate is so polarized (vax/anti-vax) which is like being drug/anti-drug.  If one drug is good, are all drugs good?  If one vaccine is effective, does it make every one?  I would hardly call the science behind vaccines balanced, there aren&#39;t nearly enough people studying the side effects (if at all).</p>

<p>It&#39;s a silly argument to paint with such a broad stroke.  Are some vaccines good? Perhaps, but I don&#39;t believe we need hundreds of variants especially with pharma&#39;s track record.  When health care is profitable, sick people are good for business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, this is a great post.</p>

<p>In the same way that I&#39;d assess the associated risks with a new prescription my doctor gave me, I think we should do the same with vaccinations.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not this monolithic thing, each one has it&#39;s own risk and reward associated with it.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s happened to polarize the debate is that the study linking autism to vaccinations was clearly bad but it became the common perception. In order to undo the damage the study did there had to be a loud voice and this snowballed into what we have day, a voice championing vaccines that is so loud it drowns out any rational opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted a website that was written by doctors saying to space out your vaccinations essentially the reasons given in the topic. They felt that there was no need to vaccinate an infant for diseases that infants rarely get and they felt that it was not necessary to give them all at once. This is what they chose to do with their children.</p>

<p>I was downvoted to -3 and -2 without a single response.
Classy. The doctors who wrote the site are not anti-vaccine and they are extremely well-known and well-respected doctors in their communities. All they are suggesting is to be careful and assess the risk vs reward. If you really think your kid is going to get hepatitis then go ahead, but I personally would wait a bit before getting a vaccine like that.</p>

<p>I mean, you have taken the advice of a person who said this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shills here use sites like naturalnews and their &quot;experts&quot; such as Mercola and Ty Bollinger know very little about what they&#39;re talking about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they obviously didn&#39;t read the material as the site I posted was created by practicing, licensed doctors.</p>

<p>Anyways, good luck. I think you should vaccinate your child I just hope that you really weigh the risk vs reward of giving so many at an early age.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;d urge you to consider also, literally every single post that is not 100% pro vaccine was downvoted to oblivion. Does that indicate to you an honest discussion? The link I posted was about as non-confrontational as you can get and I was downvoted away without a single look at the link.</p>

<p>I think that the anti-vax crowd is certainly overplaying the potential issues with vaccines but I also think that the response to the anti-vax crowd has been so strong that it&#39;s literally stifling any possible debate about what potential issues there could be. You can&#39;t even suggest that a vaccine caused an issue these days without the type of response you saw in your original post.</p>

<p>That, to me, is a red flag.  Vaccines are one of those topics that you just aren&#39;t allowed to talk about these days which makes me think, &quot;Hmm.. someone out there doesn&#39;t want to allow a discourse on this subject.  Why is that..?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah absolutely. When the response is so strong as to stifle any discussion it worries me.</p>

<p>I mean, there is a vaccine court in the US that was created specifically for settling issues surrounding vaccinations. Obviously there are some issues that stem from vaccinations on occasion.</p>

<p>THe proof is in the original topic too. Every single response even remotely saying to consider a different schedule was downvoted and the one post with positive points was saying that everyone else was a shill or stupid. (screams of vote brigading to me) This clearly was not true as I posted a source written by practicing, licensed doctors.
So you can see the discussion is being stifled already. This poster now thinks that anyone even considering the risk of vaccines is uneducated or a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the kind of thinking we should be promoting.</p>

<p>I mean, I understand that the link between autism and vaccines is specious at best but that doesn&#39;t mean there is no risk associated with vaccinations. I think the anti-vax, justifiably, had to shout pretty loud to reverse the commonly accepted idea that vaccinations can cause autism, but it&#39;s become this rhetoric where any question about the safety of vaccinations puts you in the same category as &quot;tin foil hat&quot; wearers.</p>

<p>We accept risks when it comes to prescription drugs, why can&#39;t we treat vaccinations the same and look at them on a case by case basis and not just lump all vaccinations into the &#39;good&#39; category.</p>

<p>Completely FALSE.  The site was created by a lawyer (Brian P. Motroni, Esq.) who works for the law firm Adams &amp;amp; Diaco, P.A in Tampa, Florida.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s his contact information:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lawyers.com/tampa/florida/Brian-P-Motroni-4977889-a/">http://www.lawyers.com/tampa/florida/Brian-P-Motroni-4977889-a/</a></p>

<p>Have you even explored the site?</p>

<p>First, it isn&#39;t even complete.  The &quot;About Two And Talking&quot; link at the top of the page links to a page that says &quot;Information about twoandtalking.com&quot; coming soon.  Second, the last time the vaccine updates page was updated was in 2010.  Third, the contact information is for a LAWYER.  Fourth, and most importantly, the line at the bottom of the page reads: &quot;Information and resources about child immunizations and vaccines <strong>&quot;If you or someone you know has been injured by vaccine or flu shot, please click here.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Really, guy???  This is what you&#39;re using?!?  Did you EVEN click on the link before submitting it as a resource for OP to use?</p>

<p>You&#39;re just providing free advertisement for LAWYERS (which you incorrectly called doctors).  Do you understand the difference between a lawyer and a doctor?  I mean, do you get what they do?  Lawyers have expertise in the LAW, doctors have expertise in health, healing, and medicine.  They are two completely different things.</p>

<p>LOL!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it was written by doctors. I was not aware of the link to their pratice, but that has no bearing on the schedule or recommendations they suggested.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like your opinion on the schedule they recommended and the suggestion that certain vaccines be spaced out. 
If you are willing to actually discuss the material on the site without resorting to ad hominem attacks I&#39;d be willing to hear your side. Frankly your tone doesn&#39;t help your cause. If anyone in a bubble were to read your comment they would think you were a loon. You presented no information and attacked me.</p>

<p>Space the vaccinations 3 months apart. Give as few vaccinations as possible. Wait until the child is 2 and talking until giving vaccinations for things that children under 2 are unlikely to come into contact with.</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not anti-vaccine. Read my posts, all I&#39;ve ever said is that vaccinations should have an associated risk when considering them, just like you do when you take any prescription drug.</p>

<p>If you can provide me some source material as to why the above recommendations are wrong or dangerous I would appreciate it.</p>

Before you commit to repeatedly vaccinating your child, go into your doctors office and ask for the inserts that come with the vial of serum (here&#39;s where the first red flag will be raised as the nurse will look at you like you are crazy and then they will have trouble actually finding what you asked for...it is very important to watch their reactions and take note of them) and then take the inserts home and spend the necessary time it takes to thoroughly read through the dangers and the side effects possible after your baby has received the injection.</p>

<p>I most certainly do trust myself.  As I told another one of you circlejerkers, I have access to medical journal databases that you don&#39;t have.  I get the full picture on the research that&#39;s out there.  If you were honest with yourself and had the research available to you - not just the vomit from Mercola, Bollinger, naturalnews, et al, you&#39;d have very different conclusions.

<p>Mercury is harmful at any level. Formaldehyde is a poison. And remember you are not getting your baby to swallow them. They are being injected past the immune system and straight into the bloodstream.

<p>No. What I meant is the actual manufacturer&#39;s inserts...read the warnings.</p>

<p>And I guess you know if your baby is going to be allergic to the ingredients before injection right!? Big-pharma plays a numbers game with our lives. Everything is fine as long as you are not the 1 in 100,000th parents whose baby gets Guillain–Barré syndrome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, too, would vaccinate my children, but up to a point. I woukd only allow them to recieve the vaccines that i have growing up. (Hep, tetanus, etc.) Those vaccines that have been around for awhile, i think, are worth the risk. </p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, the flu vaccines will not be administered to me or my children. I have found, admittedly thriugh anecdotal evidence, that the majority of people who get the flu shot tend to get the flu, while those who opt out typically dont. I have never received the flu shot and have never contracted the flu, ever, in my almost 27 years of existence. In fact, ive never been sick except for getting the common cold a handful of times (usually after an all-night binger in the winter times...).</p>

<p>A good diet (with a high amount of vitamin c) and excercise plan is the best flu preventative there is, IMO and in my experience. </p>

<p>So, to recap, id vax my babies for the major things--Those that i have received myself. But never the flu shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll state it a different way since you seem unable to comprehend my (very, very simple) point for some reason.</p>

<p>Why would you trust that the CDC (a government agency) has the public&#39;s best interests in mind when you know that other government agencies (which also claim to have the public&#39;s best interests in mind) have been proven liars in the past (the NSA being one of <em>many</em> examples)?</p>

<p>Why is the CDC more credible to you than any of the other government agencies?</p>

<p>This is a very simple question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The irony here is that the vaccine that is being promoted to prevent cancer has not been tested for causing cancer! </p>

<p>Read the manufacturer&#39;s inserts people! </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me...read what is printed on the inserts that come with the vaccine. Before you commit to repeatedly vaccinating your child, go into your doctors office and ask for the inserts that come with the vial of serum (here&#39;s where the first red flag will be raised as the nurse will look at you like you are crazy and then they will have trouble actually finding what you asked for...it is very important to watch their reactions and take note of them) and then take the inserts home and spend the necessary time it takes to thoroughly read through the dangers and the side effects possible after your baby has received the injection.</p>
