<p>You need cash to live, so you sell your time or goods. People get around using the same types of machines and infrastructures, governed either by democracies or dictatorships. But it all comes down to the same social mechanics all over the world.</p>

<p>Why has no one theorized a completely different type of society? Perhaps one dedicated to evolving society itself, not individuals. Usually if something needs to be corrected, make a law against it. It&#39;s always the same solution and has proven to be ineffective every single time. Laws don&#39;t change anything, people do. Does making something illegal solve the problem? Does putting individuals in cages solve anything? Why does the society as a whole have to answer because of a few individuals?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t get to choose where we are born, so why do we have to abide by the rules imposed in those places?</p>

<p>I do realize some places have barter systems and some people live off the grid, but they rarely shape society as a whole. What keeps society stuck in the same hamster wheel for so long?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s said that we live in a binary star system - the sun and Sirus A (the brightest star in the night sky) <a href="http://oi41.tinypic.com/9r4rwy.jpg">circling each other in an elliptical orbit</a> approximately every 8-9 million years.  When the two stars are closest to one another, their energies, their collective magnetic charges, electricity, etc are most intensely aligned and commingled with one another, and the stars, their surrounding planetary bodies, and the inhabitants of those planetary bodies will all exist in their most profoundly intense level of psychological, physical, and spiritual development.  Unfortunately for our present moment, the stars happen to be at their <em>furthest</em> (or near furthest) point apart from one another.  As such, the stars, their surrounding planetary bodies, and the inhabitants of those bodies are at their <em>lowest</em> state of illumination and spiritual development.  They are at their lowest state of energetic ability inwardly and outwardly.</p>

<p>This is where we find ourselves today.</p>

<p>We are in the lowest and worst of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga">yugas</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">Kali Yuga</a> - the age of avarice, greed, debauchery, and overall low spiritual evolution.  It&#39;s said that we <em>just</em> started breaking out of it at the beginning of 2012, however, and are now beginning to enter the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwapar_Yuga">Dvapara Yuga</a>.  It will surely take a few very long decades at least before the planet begins feeling the relieving of all the heavy strife which humans have put upon it up to this point, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s definitely a <em>biiig</em> question, but - as far as our generally puny human understanding of cosmic phenomena goes - it seems that the joining proximity of the two stars not only increases the collective effect that the stars exert upon one another (similar to what happens when two magnets approach one another and attract or repulse one another depending upon their specific polarities), but, as the epochs and ages pass and the two stars continue to get closer, not only will the stars themselves necessarily acclimate and adjust to the energetic and electromagnetic changes that nearing in proximity puts upon them, but the constitution of the planetary bodies gravitationally joined to each star will also necessarily adjust and change in accord with the increasing energetic and electromagnetic changes taking place.  Just as the constitution of the planets associated with each respective star changes, the constitution and make up of the beings on those very planets themselves will also respond accordingly and greatly increase as well.  In other words, the vibrational energy of all surrounding bodies (stars, planets, beings on those planets, etc) will adjust, evolve, and greatly increase as the stars approach one another and eventually cross paths.  With such increase in energetic make up will presumably come an increase in all other qualities that the beings, the planets, and the stars themselves also exert.</p>

<p>All this sounds really complicated, but ultimately it&#39;s actually just basic physics that&#39;s being applied on a more cosmic scale.  The same effect that tends to happen to two physical bodies that approach one another here on Earth will also occur just as assuredly in deep space - i.e. gravity and, with that, mass, electrical, and magnetic make up are all altered as the relative distance of any two physical bodies changes in relation to one another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human society is driven by a single reality -- those with psychopathic tendencies eventually dominate those without psychopathic tendencies. This happens because they are more ruthless and violent and more aggressive.</p>

<p>When one society is run by psychopaths, all neighboring societies must elevate psychopaths to positions of power, simply to protect themselves from the psychopathic society that threatens to dominate and destroy them. Only a psychopath can effectively counter the coldly ruthless behavior of other psychopaths.</p>

<p>In this way, each society becomes dominated by a small class of mentally and emotionally abnormal individuals, who come to represent the nobility or elite. Or the society perishes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my conviction that psychopathy, or as some call it, sociopathy, is genetic and was a genetic mutation at some point in our early human evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bush family, Sarah Palin, Roosevelt, and Joseph Smith (founder of Mormon Church) are all descended from the same man, John Howland, a Mayflower passenger.

Dr. Spock, who influenced a generation of mothers in child-rearing is also descended from the same John Howland, who married the daughter of another Mayflower passenger, Elizabeth Tilley.

<p>also, there arnt really that many major variations of form of governance. either the people are in charge, or a person is incharge (and whatever in between). not much room to maneuver here and weve seen both exremes and a good bit of variations of inbetween.</p>

<p>America. 1776 during the first week of July. This very place you describe was created.</p>

<p>Sorry if i sound cynical, your questions just seem to be out of frustration more so from a clear head. but in response to your last bit;</p>

<p><em>I do realize some places have barter systems and some people live off the grid, but they rarely shape society as a whole. What keeps society stuck in the same hamster wheel for so long?</em></p>

<p>The people who have the barter systems and live off the grid are simply reacting to the world around them. The world turns a hard right, they jerk hard left as a response. normal human reaction. but the reason we are in this &quot;hamster wheel&quot; because people generally dont want to be the ones to do things, whether its to go through the actual effort or they want to be clear of the responsibility. its much easier for one to say &quot;oh <strong>they</strong> will handle it&quot;. </p>

<p>Another country does something you dont like? Oh, better have the government send some people to kill them
Not making enough money? that government better make it so i can make more!
A theif/murder is out? good thing governments there to stop him.</p>

<p>And this mentality has followed humans around for almost their whole history, it only had a break for about 60 years after the USA was born and took its first shot to the chest during Lincoln; and the problems compacted over time. Personal responsibility and society working together for a common goal under the banner of liberty made this country great and over the years the greatness was just assumed, then expected, and now its being demanded because..... &#39;murica.</p>

<p>Learning all, isnt practical or effective . Lets roll back time, say 400 years or so so were completely far away from modern mechanics and technology. Skills like baking, sewing, hunting, skinning, cooking, butchering, building, forging, farming, hearding.....</p>

<p>The list can really go on for a long time. 1 person to know all of that simply wont work.</p>

<p>Participating in a community however is a little different since youre able to divvy up the tasks. These communities do exist, but unfortunately these economic systems ( rather, lack there of) breaks down after the people within the sytem increase in numbers.</p>

<p>For example, while looking for a place to live 2 years ago, i stumbled upon just that. it was a house on several acres of land with like 6-8 people living in it, they were completely self-sufficient and your &quot;rent&quot; was to complete a set amount of tasks every day. Though it wasnt for me at that moment in time in my life, it sounded great!</p>

<p>but if we were to make those 7 people, 700 or 7000? well then they cant share everything. The whole reason it worked with such a small number is because there was a very personal and emotion attachment to said persons. Ive never seen JoeSchmo over there before, why the hell does he get a portion of this bread i baked?</p>

<p>That being said, any decently sized society needs a currency of some kind. Barter works and im all for it, but it has its drawbacks.</p>

<p>Society the way youre asking it, is the way it is because its most effective and efficient.</p>

<p>Now, &quot;why is society so <strong>fucked up</strong>?&quot; THAT is a real question</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything above a certain number ceases to be a community and turns into a full-blown society. I believe it&#39;s possible to keep these communities small, like 1000 people each one gets a few acres and they interact with each other to trade goods each one could be specialized in. As for the whole incest thing which could become an issue, the citizens could move from one community to another but respecting the number of people in that community. After communities grow, they created new ones so on and so forth. This is a concept which could eliminate money entirely.</p>

<p>You fail to account for thieves, murderers and sociopaths and everything wrong in this environment. for these people to move around these communities of 1000 people with such intricacy is something far beyond the simple lifestyle youre describing, a power structure at some point would have to be put in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the negative variables exist, but how many of these individuals are susceptible to this kind of behavior due to the way our society is set up right now? I believe this type of sociopathic behavior would be greatly reduced in smaller communities where everyone knew each other. My theoretical society, if set up right from the start could inhibit this type of behavior and would also provide an alternative to incarceration but treat it as a mental health issue. </p>

<p>What purpose would a power structure provide which self-government could not account for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because government is inevitable. You cant remove it from the equation, you think its gone but its still there, it just hasnt shown itsself. Someone with more resources, fire power, man power, or even luck will take control at some point. Government is merely a power structure.</p>

<p>The day government can no longer exist, is the day man does no evil. Which will be never. There will always be sociopaths who want power and strive for it. There will always be swindlers who will try to get a leg up on your rather than work with you.</p>

<p>the system you described is very similar to that of the native americans, however they still had a form of government within their own tribe, and knew the systems of other tribes and there was a system for how to interact for declaring war between one another, peace, trade and so on. if you broke their laws you were punished. Because even in your own community, if the people in the area all agree to a certain standard, whos to say they cant do it?</p>

<hr/>

<p>This is why i laugh at the idea of anarchy (100% self governance is anarchy, no need to pretty it up theres no stigma here), because its very pretty and ideal and the aspiring utopia. but because it is that utopia, it will never exist. Thats why the key here is minimal government. Government is inevitable, thats the independent variable in this equation; the dependent variable is its size and influence. If done right, rather than being a tool of destruction on ones rights and sovereignty, it would enhance and protect them.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you read Thomas Jeffersons writings on self governance and sovereignty. If theres anyone who hated being told what to do by an authoritative force, it was him. His wisdom is beyond anything i thought was possible at the time, considering the history of oppression humanity had. and thats why the Constitution is a brilliant document. No where in the Constitution and Bill of Rights does it &quot;grant&quot; the people freedoms or rights, the language is very clear: &quot;congress shall make no law&quot;, and &quot;shall not be infringed&quot;. Our freedoms are our birth-right/god-given. The 10th amendment makes that very clear </p>

<p><em>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</em></p>

<p>This is not the case today and shows how far off the wagon weve fallen. Im sure that youd agree that a return to our Constitution would be great thing for this country, regardless of whether or not its your personal dream endgoal</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Also, id like to add, while i agree our society has no doubt propelled mental and spiritual (even if youre not religious) health to abysmal depths, and i agree man is not inherently evil but man is prone to do evil things, so its not surprising to see evil flourish in an environment where its coddled.  but there still will be those kinds of people. all it takes is one. Imagine what a good orator (like obama) can do with nefarious intentions? well, you dont need to imagine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s definitely a <em>biiig</em> question, but - as far as our generally puny human understanding of cosmic phenomena goes - it seems that the joining proximity of the two stars not only increases the collective effect that the stars exert upon one another (similar to what happens when two magnets approach one another and attract or repulse one another depending upon their specific polarities), but, as the epochs and ages pass and the two stars continue to get closer, not only will the stars themselves necessarily acclimate and adjust to the energetic and electromagnetic changes that nearing in proximity puts upon them, but the constitution of the planetary bodies gravitationally joined to each star will also necessarily adjust and change in accord with the increasing energetic and electromagnetic changes taking place.  Just as the constitution of the planets associated with each respective star changes, the constitution and make up of the beings on those very planets themselves will also respond accordingly and greatly increase as well.  In other words, the vibrational energy of all surrounding bodies (stars, planets, beings on those planets, etc) will adjust, evolve, and greatly increase as the stars approach one another and eventually cross paths.  With such increase in energetic make up will presumably come an increase in all other qualities that the beings, the planets, and the stars themselves also exert.</p>

<p>All this sounds really complicated, but ultimately it&#39;s actually just basic physics that&#39;s being applied on a more cosmic scale.  The same effect that tends to happen to two physical bodies that approach one another here on Earth will also occur just as assuredly in deep space - i.e. gravity and, with that, mass, electrical, and magnetic make up are all altered as the relative distance of any two physical bodies changes in relation to one another.</p>
