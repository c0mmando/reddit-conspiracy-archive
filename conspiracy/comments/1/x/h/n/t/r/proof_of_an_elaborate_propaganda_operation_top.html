<p>That&#39;s a lot of shill accounts, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  The Bush family is trying to whitewash their history.  Look at what they did with Newsweek:</p>

<p>Look who gets awarded the energy/resource contracts in every situation.</p>

<p>The Iraqi Oil Ministry on Thursday said it has awarded a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp. xom -1.31% and Royal Dutch Shell RDSB -1.48% PLC the right to develop the West Qurna-1 oil field, representing the first American-led team gaining access to the country&#39;s oil patch.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that this part is just a coincidence though!</p>

<p>Sounds a lot like scratching each others back.</p>

<p>We invaded Iraq so that the Bush family mafia can give natural resource rights to their friends. They have been doing this within the &quot;intelligence apparatus&quot; for somewhere around 50 years from what you can dig up in history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is the link.  Thank you for being astute.</p>

<p>So who do you reckon Allen Dulles was great friends with just prior to 11/22/63?</p>

<p>Where was George HW Bush?</p>

<p>Why was there a Zapata offshore rig just outside of Cuba?</p>

<p>Why was the CIA operation in Cuba called &quot;Operation Zapata&quot;?</p>

<p>Why did GHW Bush meet with Al Ulmer, the CIA coup expert on 11/21/63?</p>

<p>Why did George De Mohrenschildt (Oswald&#39;s handler) send GHW Bush a letter stating that he was worried he may have been talking to much and was being investigated?</p>

<p>But hey... that&#39;s just not possible... right?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve never had a coup in the US, right?</p>

<p>I am too old to have any connection with Pokemon, but it sounds a lot like Transformers was, in terms of trying to collect them. Every time you had a complete set, Hasbro would release a new &#39;wave&quot;, most of which were just the same exact toys in different colors and as different characters, or the same exact design with tiny tiny variations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with a shill hunt is the temptation to call &quot;shill&quot; whenever someone disagrees with you. I was accused of being a shill because I challenged one of the more ridiculous assertions of a 9/11 truther. That&#39;s right, in the same thread that the truther claimed only a tiny powerful group of people were in on the alleged 9/11 conspiracy, I was basically accused of being one of those people, paid by the conspirators to infiltrate Reddit. It&#39;s one thing to point out obvious corporate accounts and what not, but the shill concept encourages lazy thinkers to just brand debate opponents as part of the conspiracy. </p>

<p>A fact is a fact, and if the truthers are so caught up in the truth, perhaps they should ensure that their statements are truthful in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to make a straw man argument against you, but I will say that when I was discussing 9/11 with someone else on this subreddit, we couldn&#39;t even agree whether Al Qaeda / Bin Laden claimed responsibility.

<p>At the same time that video was being shown to MSM consumers around the world, the internet was being shown how that video was just a video from some other situation that was regurgitated with a new translation and being passed off as new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The speculation that the 2004 video is fake is not convincing. The author just thinks Bin Laden looks a little different in videos taken three years apart. Besides, Bin Laden references the 9/11 attacks in many recordings, including another in 2006 when he again takes responsibility. You can browse the list for yourself. It&#39;s a pretty unambiguous narrative. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videos_and_audio_recordings_of_Osama_bin_Laden">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videos_and_audio_recordings_of_Osama_bin_Laden</a></p>

<p>You also have other Al Qaeda describing their roles (and Bin Laden&#39;s) in 9/11. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed described to Al Jazeera in 2002 how he organized 9/11. After his capture, KSM again made no effort to deny his role live in court. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/04/alqaida.terrorism">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/04/alqaida.terrorism</a></p>

<p>To fit your narrative, we either have to expand the conspiracy to include Al Qaeda as informed conspirators, or we have to posit that all of these videotapes, audio recordings and interviews has been fabricated on such a massive scale around the world, with Al Jazeera complicit.</p>

<p>If a shill says something good, it doesnt have to be downvoted. If someone lies or propagates BS, they arent necessarily a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so you&#39;ve basically outlined that spooks run all 5 communities. </p>

<p>Comparing the communities themselves, regardless of who runs them... GLP still has absolute breaking news - with reputable links to back it up - faster than the others. I know where I go to check my news. You&#39;re free to peruse /pol/ along with the other 4chan-loving teenagers if that&#39;s the type of community you prefer(that website looks worse than &#39;99 SMF if we&#39;re really talking about web design, completely ignoring content).</p>

<p>GLP has people from teens to 60s and 70s. People educated in all backgrounds. Most people who post there(and pay for membership to get around IP bans) know about Lucas and probably know about all the other communities as well. GLP still has absolute breaking news with the most detailed comprehensive breakdowns compared to any other community I&#39;ve ever visited. </p>

<p>There is no &quot;un-infiltrated&quot; community out there. If your point was to make people wary of frequenting GLP because it&#39;s a datamining operation... guess what, so is Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>GLP has some very fine users. I should have clarified that in my post. I only wanted to pull the blanket back on the owner a little bit to offer a little info for users who naively embrace a community without knowing the history. I enjoy GLP SH threads (among countless others) as the community investigators have been excellent in their work. </p>

<p>My main point was not the community but the ownership of the communities. Everyone knows about the teenage angst on /pol/ but I wasn&#39;t talking about the demographics of the poeple who post there but the track record of the site owner. I was comparing censorship and Poole has found a way to let users practice free speech while other sites like GLP have so much censorship you have to question it. Also there was a time on /new/ that the stormfags were not there, and sometimes glimpses of that once great era make a return and get my hopes up.</p>

<p>But you are correct, GLP is a good forum with great investigations. I would recommend and have done so =).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is much like the real world.  Most of the users trend liberal.  The powers that be provide &quot;conservative&quot; views and try really hard to make the two look even.</p>

<p>There are plenty of good conservative view points that come from users.  In general what I see is that they &quot;Greed is good&quot; crowd and &quot;the military is always 110% awesome especially when deployed&quot; are the power dealing that want the tax dollars to continue to flow into their petty empires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. I just have some regard for the word <em>proof</em>. Proof doesn&#39;t belong to the realm of intuition or inference, proof is an absolute. Noticing a pattern is not proof; maybe patterns are a discovery, maybe patterns even give you new understanding, but they&#39;re not irrefutable proof. But hey, if you think op has really found proof, more power to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have regard for the term proof. I just dont stop at face value, as if documents arent falsifiable. The question is when do we accept something as absolute, for you you its a paper trail. For me even causation has space for new inferences and isnt absolute. By aligning your regard for proof with the same regard as authorities, it gives them a basis for future determination of truth. Some would say the very idea of proof is fallible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The speculation that the 2004 video is fake is not convincing. The author just thinks Bin Laden looks a little different in videos taken three years apart. Besides, Bin Laden references the 9/11 attacks in many recordings, including another in 2006 when he again takes responsibility. You can browse the list for yourself. It&#39;s a pretty unambiguous narrative. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videos_and_audio_recordings_of_Osama_bin_Laden">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videos_and_audio_recordings_of_Osama_bin_Laden</a></p>

<p>You also have other Al Qaeda describing their roles (and Bin Laden&#39;s) in 9/11. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed described to Al Jazeera in 2002 how he organized 9/11. After his capture, KSM again made no effort to deny his role live in court. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/04/alqaida.terrorism">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/04/alqaida.terrorism</a></p>

<p>To fit your narrative, we either have to expand the conspiracy to include Al Qaeda as informed conspirators, or we have to posit that all of these videotapes, audio recordings and interviews has been fabricated on such a massive scale around the world, with Al Jazeera complicit.</p>
