       I'm sure we are all aware of what Flappy Bird is by now. I believe the app is being taken down due to the developer not wanting to release the info of several million people to the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The app was released on January 30rd and deleted February 9th. In this short period of time, it was downloaded millions of times. The money made was around $50,000 a day... but why stop now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Quoted from his twitter:
       <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800">

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I am sorry ‘Flappy Bird’ users, 22 hours from now, I will take ‘Flappy Bird’ down. I cannot take this anymore.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “It is not anything related to legal issues. I just cannot keep it anymore.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “I also don’t sell ‘Flappy Bird’, please don’t ask.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “And I still make games.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The weird part? When I first downloaded this application and XPrivacy first loaded, it only asked for Serial, Shell, and WebView. After playing momentarily and realizing that it was a rage inducing game, I deleted it.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       But once I heard the game was going to be removed from the store, I decided to reinstall the app in case I ever wanted to play again or if I had to give the app to someone else, I could upload the .apk file. But when running the application again, XPrivacy started restricting other activities that weren't in the application days earlier. Those restrictions are of course seen in the Imgur album.

        this reason

       to why the developer may have deleted it. I feel as if the real reason goes much deeper than that.

       is probably closest to the mark with his supposition, but I can't help but think the tweet about 'nothing related to legal issues' might have been a wink at 'legal issues' actually having something to do with it. You also make a good point with 'why stop now?'
      </p>
      <p>
       I can imagine sudden, unexpected success and world wide exposure like that would be extremely overwhelming but I sure as hell wouldn't allow a handfull of haters make me wanna pull the plug on $50k a day. Either he has no experience dealing with haters, or he felt significantly threatened by something he figured removing the app would fix.

       The legal issues people think of is copyright problems because the pipes are similar to Nintendo's. But he apologizes to users in such a certain way that seems almost as if he's sorry of something he's done.

       We could all say "they" is referring to the users that play the game but "they" isn't specific. "They" could be the NSA overusing the app to collect info on individuals.
