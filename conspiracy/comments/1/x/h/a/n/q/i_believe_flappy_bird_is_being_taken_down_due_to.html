<p>I&#39;m sure we are all aware of what Flappy Bird is by now. I believe the app is being taken down due to the developer not wanting to release the info of several million people to the NSA.</p>

<p>The app was released on January 30rd and deleted February 9th. In this short period of time, it was downloaded millions of times. The money made was around $50,000 a day... but why stop now?</p>

<p>Quoted from his twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800">https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I am sorry ‘Flappy Bird’ users, 22 hours from now, I will take ‘Flappy Bird’ down. I cannot take this anymore.”</p>

<p>“It is not anything related to legal issues. I just cannot keep it anymore.”</p>

<p>“I also don’t sell ‘Flappy Bird’, please don’t ask.”</p>

<p>“And I still make games.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The weird part? When I first downloaded this application and XPrivacy first loaded, it only asked for Serial, Shell, and WebView. After playing momentarily and realizing that it was a rage inducing game, I deleted it.</strong></p>

<p>But once I heard the game was going to be removed from the store, I decided to reinstall the app in case I ever wanted to play again or if I had to give the app to someone else, I could upload the .apk file. But when running the application again, XPrivacy started restricting other activities that weren&#39;t in the application days earlier. Those restrictions are of course seen in the Imgur album.</p>

<p>User <a href="/u/vagaryblue">/u/vagaryblue</a> stated <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1xdhl4/flappy_bird_being_taken_down_by_its_creator_in_22/cfaf6lz">this reason</a> to why the developer may have deleted it. I feel as if the real reason goes much deeper than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say <a href="/u/vagaryblue">/u/vagaryblue</a> is probably closest to the mark with his supposition, but I can&#39;t help but think the tweet about &#39;nothing related to legal issues&#39; might have been a wink at &#39;legal issues&#39; actually having something to do with it. You also make a good point with &#39;why stop now?&#39;</p>

<p>I can imagine sudden, unexpected success and world wide exposure like that would be extremely overwhelming but I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t allow a handfull of haters make me wanna pull the plug on $50k a day. Either he has no experience dealing with haters, or he felt significantly threatened by something he figured removing the app would fix. </p>

<p>We could all say &quot;they&quot; is referring to the users that play the game but &quot;they&quot; isn&#39;t specific. &quot;They&quot; could be the NSA overusing the app to collect info on individuals.</p>
