<p>Dr. Branchereau also suggested that they did it as a remedy for his acne, which bothered Michael himself. It all fits perfectly. And the fact that the surgeries just continued after that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but Michael Jackson had a pretty low voice. He preferred to use a higher voice in public until later in his career. I think he did so because he was keen on preserving the innocent, mysterious, boylike image he had cultivated - in order to contrast it with militaristic and messianic imagery, and sexual energy on stage. Later in his life he dropped his voice when speaking in public, and also in many of his songs he&#39;s singing with a pretty deep voice. He was simply a very, very skilled singer with a huge vocal range.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He portrayed a boyish image because his development into manhood had been impaired, it&#39;s the whole point of this thread. </p>

<p>Listening to some of his most <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=michael%20jackson%20last%20speech&amp;amp;sm=3">recent speeches</a>, he doesn&#39;t sound like someone older than 14 years old, which is remarkable for a 40-ish year old man. </p>

<p>He had a very skinny frame his entire life, with signs of weakness. Testosterone deficiency does that to people. The motive to hinder his development was also there. He would never be able to move and perform the way he is known for if he was more muscular. His image would also be affected. But it doesn&#39;t end there. He took how people perceive him to an entirely different level with the surgeries, as we all know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He portrayed a boyish image because he wanted to. That&#39;s about all you can say about it. What&#39;s with jumping to conclusions without evidence? Is it that weird to accept that he had an image he tried to uphold - and at the same time enjoyed subverting that image with very masculine imagery? He was a master in getting people&#39;s attention. This was just one of the ways in which he - purposefully - did so.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve linked some speeches where he sounds completely normal. Have you listened to people like Justin Timberlake or Chris Brown talk? This is what they sound like. </p>

<p>He did not have a very skinny frame his entire life. For a long time he was a completely healthy man with normal proportions. Have you looked at his concert tours in the late 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s? Nothing wrong at all with his body. Of course he is thin, because he liked to keep in shape while touring. But that&#39;s not &#39;very skinny&#39; or &#39;weak&#39;. </p>

<p>Those are all pictures of a man who isn&#39;t muscular, but isn&#39;t unhealthy either. He just liked to stay thin. At some times in his life he lost weight because of extreme stress - times like 1993, 2005 and 2009.</p>

<p>Yes, he was thin. He didn&#39;t need to be muscular for his lifestyle. By the way I&#39;ve seen very muscular people who were very, very good at dancing. But drawing a conclusion from the fact that he was thin to the idea that he was castrated, that&#39;s not how the truth works. </p>

<p>The amount of surgeries performed on him has always been absurdly exaggerated. As far as I can tell, he had a couple nosejobs, an operation on his chin, and cosmetic tattoos around his hairline and eyebrows. Everything else is purely conjecture and easily explained by aging, stress, weight loss or weight gain, skin colour change (due to vitiligo) and most importantly, through worldwide dehumanizing by the media. In his 40&#39;s, he looked like himself, only older. I know you will not accept this and wildly scream that he got all weird and white and feminine... but look at the pictures. The man did not change all that much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>99% of people will laugh in your face if you tell them that he &quot;didn&#39;t change all that much&quot;, and you know it. But the surgeries are a different matter. </p>

<p>&quot;Stress&quot;. Pfft. He barely has any muscle definition, whereas he was developing nicely when he was younger. Until something happened and he got weak, lacked endurance, and never gained any muscle. </p>

<p>I think that you know very little about MJ and that&#39;s why you are projecting all kinds of crazy on him, by piecing together things you read and seen in the media and hoping that it forms a coherent story to fit your theory. You really can&#39;t come to such a conclusion on someone that you evidently know very little about. It seems to have taken almost no evidence at all to completely convince you of something, which is absurd. </p>

<p>For instance, I very much doubt that you knew anything about the skin lesions, keloids, malar rash, pleurisy and blisters that MJ suffered as a result of his autoimmune disorder discoid lupus, which his fans speculated for years that he had and was finally confirmed by his medical records and doctors testimony in his death trial. It was actually shown that many of the surgeries that he got on his face were necessary as they were for reconstructive purposes. There was tissue damage on his face that required him to keep coming in to get fixed. It also caused swelling in his cheeks, and another symptom called &quot;moon face&quot; which MJ also had at time due to flare ups. 
<a href="http://rhythmofthetide.com/category/michaels-appearance/lupus-michaels-appearance/">http://rhythmofthetide.com/category/michaels-appearance/lupus-michaels-appearance/</a></p>

<p>If you are genuinely this curious about MJ and whether he was a castrato, you are going to need to do a lot more research on MJ, his vocal range (watch interviews with Seth Riggs, his vocal coach) his medical history which has been publicized, the persona that he constructed for public viewing vs the private man. He was a much more complex man than you are making him out to be. I have spoken to people who met/knew MJ personally who will agree with me. </p>

<p>This is a story told by someone who knew/met MJ that I think you will find surprising.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I <em>know</em> it. That doesn&#39;t change the fact that he did NOT change as much as people like to believe. </p>

<p>What do you mean &#39;weak, lacked endurance&#39;? When did you ever see him being weak or lacking endurance? When did this happen? You&#39;re going to need some evidence for this. He never gained any muscle because he never tried to.</p>

<p>Your insistence that he was a castrate is making you adjust everything about him and cramping it into your little theory. All you really have is that he had a high voice, and no, that&#39;s no proof of anything. I&#39;m freaking tired of people on the internet who desperately CRAVE the concept that Michael Jackson was abnormal in EVERY WAY IMAGINABLE. Jesus christ leave the man alone. He was a genius, he was a wonderful person, and he never harmed anyone in his life. Leave him out of your strange theories that lack any proof beyond speculation and nitpicking.</p>

<p>What does that have to do with anything? He was all of those things, and I personally think his dad and doctor interfered with him chemically. It doesn&#39;t take anything away from his achievements, nor was it responsible for his music. That came entirely from his mind and artistic skill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. You &#39;personally think&#39;. That&#39;s where it ends. </p>

<p>People like you who personally think things about him, are the same kind of people who ruined this man&#39;s career, ruined this man&#39;s life, and ultimately caused his death. Before you reply, think about that. He was hounded by the media. He was ridiculed, mocked, dehumanized. People no longer accept him to be a normal, thinking person. Shit theories like this are just another dung in the shitstorm he endured. Either you try to provide some solid evidence, or you stop insulting this man you never met. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s Michael Jackson aged about 25:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XIt4I.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/XIt4I.jpg</a></p>

<p>IDK about you, but that looks reasonably well developed to me. He never took his shirt off later much because of his vitiligo, but he was always very muscular because of his dancing. I mean the whole lean in Smooth Criminal only works through abdominal muscles. </p>

<p>His autopsy showed his testicles and penis were fine and normal, and that he was actively producing semen at the time of his death. It showed everything about him was normal, which contradicts this idea of him being stunted in any way. </p>

<p>I mean, even on a very basic level, if you watch footage of Michael and focus on his pants region... let&#39;s just say he had a lot there to grab. Which also easily shuts down the theory he was stunted/castrated.</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t take anyone seriously who doesn&#39;t think Michael hit puberty... anyone who&#39;s seen a photo of him aged 14 and then at 18 can see he&#39;d hit puberty just fine.</p>

Only the knowledge of what&#39;s truly going on can be described as a privilege. Knowledge = privilege = power.  Something an obedient dog staring at the shiny object wouldn&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of absurd that people still entertain this theory when there is documented proof from medical professionals who analyzed his body. </p>

<p>Also the fact that there is countless videos of him in his teen years where he is clearly going through puberty, his voice cracking while singing, he had acne like a motherfucker. </p>

<p>Honestly, listen to an authentic castrato&#39;s voice online. It sounds absolutely nothing like MJ&#39;s voice. He was a tenor. Listen to Justin Timberlake, Chris Brown, Neyo, Jay Sean,  they all have that soft male tenor voice. Were they all castrated?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a sound argument at all. It seem like a cop-out to account for that fact that he exhibits all the signs of having a deep voice, having gone through puberty, and you are simple writing it off as &quot;voice reach&quot;. He wouldn&#39;t have voice reach like that if he were castrato. He would not be able to reach the deep notes he did in songs, or in his speaking voice, (interesting how you linked his speaking voice in the Barbara Walters interview, which was not his speaking voice at all and was a fake voice he put on for his public persona. People that knew him on a personal level all say he spoke in a much deeper voice. I have heard MJ&#39;s phone voice and he spoke in a deeper voice.</p>

<p>Here he is yet again speaking in his normal voice (this is from the same time as the funeral video, it seems MJ grew tired of keeping up the persona in his later years and just spoke in his natural voice)
<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=TsSp78gq8UQ">http://youtube.com/watch?v=TsSp78gq8UQ</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve read the article you provided a while back, it was posted before on reddit. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? Listen at 0:49 his voice is clearly cracking. Even read the comments, there are others noting that the pitch was too high for him. I&#39;ve spoken to other MJ fans about this performance and there is mostly consensus that MJ&#39;s voice was in fact, cracking. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been an MJ fan for years, I&#39;ve seen and heard every bit of footage of his that there is available and I&#39;ve seen his medical records and studied his life extensively. I wouldn&#39;t have a problem believing that he was a castrato, but the fact is that the evidence simply isn&#39;t there. There is too much evidence to the contrary. </p>

<p>What is more interesting to me is that people tend to think that every aspect of MJ&#39;s life had to be bizarre, extraordinary, and larger than life. People have difficulty accepting any normalcy regarding his life. Is it that hard to believe that he was just incredibly talented and had incredibly range? </p>

<p>He does have a deep voice there. But you still can&#39;t get stuck on comparing him to other castrati. Compare him to his siblings if anything. </p>

<p>What? Provide a source for this. There is no medical documentation that I have seen that says MJ was sterile. Everything I have seen has indicated that he was a healthy adult man, producing sperm. There was nothing wrong or abnormal about his genitalia at the time of his death.  There isn&#39;t any reason to believe he was sterile other than what is said in gossip rags and tabloids. I only make conclusions based on substantiated evidence. </p>

<p>I would like to add that Michael himself addressed the rumor of chemical castration  in an interview (he was actually asked about female hormone pills, and he laughed it off, said it was absurd and that he was a tenor).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>MJ certainly had eccentricities due to his upbringing and also due to his genius. He thought on a higher plane than 98% of people and therefore was very different from you and I. But that doesn&#39;t mean that literally every aspect of his life has to be extraordinary and different from anyone else. He ate, slept in a bed, read books, talked on the phone, used the bathroom. And he just so happened to be an incredibly talented singer. </p>
