<p>Alien skull stuff gets loads of votes and the interesting political stuff often gets overlooked. I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s people upvoting from mobiles, basing it on &quot;cool&quot; titles and not even looking at the comments.</p>

<p>Gah! I downvote nearly all of the meme stuff too, unless there&#39;s something genuinely informative about it. People are &quot;visually orientated&quot; though, and they love their pictures, so it doesn&#39;t seem to stem the flood at all.</p>

<p>How would your voting result in you being called a &quot;shill&quot;? Votes are private. Why would you try to convince people that this happens?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point, actually. Oh, I&#39;ve talked to that skycentrism guy a couple of times now.</p>

<p>His ideas are nothing new. I&#39;ve seen them elsewhere years ago, and they were silly then. I&#39;ve never been able to decide if he really believes it, or if he&#39;s a troll, although I&#39;m more tending towards the troll argument, because then I don&#39;t have to think of him as that daft.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you follow his reasoning for why everything is the way it appears despite his concave earth idea, it doesn&#39;t make any difference it were true. You have to bend so many facts to get it to work it&#39;s essentially pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did manage to tease out from him one point which convinced me this is old stuff he&#39;s just rehashing. His hypothesis requires that the entire universe lies within this concave Earth, which means that space would have to be increasingly compressed the further you went &quot;up&quot; from the Earth&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s a terribly <em>vain</em> idea anyway. That our one planet just happens to be the one that is concave. I suspect he&#39;s never considered that any planet in the universe could make the same claims for themselves.</p>

<p>Why not Mars? Jupiter? Tralfamadore?</p>

<p>I mainly like the political stuff and current affairs posted here. The more fringe stuff I find not appealing, and it&#39;s difficult for me to bite my lip and say nothing if I disagree strongly. You can call that a character flaw if you like.</p>

I can&#39;t believe you people believe this crap!&quot; kind of comment (not really constructive!), but I&#39;ve had some very interesting chats with people here over the years. I might not always agree with them, but a few of them have stated their cases exceptionally well.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been times I&#39;ve had to go away and read up on subjects to expand my knowledge, which has certainly been beneficial.</p>

<p>Dare I say I may consider some of your views in a more contemplative light these day? A <em>little</em>. But I&#39;m not going to start posting about holographic planes, or the like any time soon!</p>

<p>But there&#39;s certainly the odd bit here and there that occasionally makes me go &quot;Hmmm... what if?&quot;</p>

<p>At any rate, I&#39;m thinking if everyone agreed, this would be a <em>very</em> boring place. Things aren&#39;t always as black and white as they make out though. I think there&#39;s room for sceptics and conspiracy theorists and even the concave earthers (well, perhaps not!). In the end we can sift the facts and hopefully end up closer to the truth than we were at the beginning. At least I hope so!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is that a lot of the political stuff is pointless or not affecting anyone/thing currently, so a lot of people just gloss over. I used to be heavy into politics until I realized it was all a theatrical game that the rich win, and the american citizens lose. They tout progressive movements which erode our freedom and increase our dependence on the government for just about everything, in an effort to gain more control, and what is often touted as progress and improvements of life is nothing but circuses and bread to the masses.</p>

<p>You are right those topics are hit upon often, but then they are big conspiracies. Of course some of the old info may be new to new users, and in any case it&#39;s nice to see a post of known stuff when presented in a new, well-framed and easily digestable format (9/11:ANPH).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are they &quot;big&quot; conspiracies, or are they the most obvious? My question is this: when we &quot;solve&quot; these issues, what will change?</p>

<p>9/11: Will our interaction with the middle east change? Will we stop siding with Israel? Will we stop destroying brown countries/peoples everywhere? </p>

<p>Chemtrails: Will they be ended? Will the technology be used for good ends? Will we out those who were a part of all of it?</p>

<p>And if there will be no follow up to the discussion what is the point of going over it again and again? How&#39;s that moving us forward?</p>

<p>To me, this is simple: we need to stop acting like these are all separate issues or conspiracies. But we also need to stop acting like they all have the same value. To me, 9/11 doesn&#39;t have as much value as the suppression of free energy. To others, UFOs may be more important. </p>

<p>The problem is with low quality, information-thin posts, not fringe theories. Not every post has to be &#39;true&#39; or to your agreement, but throwing around abusive language and tired old buzzwords like shill conspiratard, sheeple, yadda yadda really DOES make this place a shithole.</p>

<p>The vast amount of fringe stuff here never rises to the top anyway.</p>

<p>Anyway, cheers for the input, and perhaps try ignoring the dumb threads rather than sullying the waters with a bunch of inflammatory language? I mean it only serves to grow those threads and spark a flame-war.</p>

<p>What we are dealing with here is something that every 250,000+ community on reddit has experienced in the form of memes, low effort posts, etc. </p>

<p>As mods we do what we can to remove posts that violate out enumerated rules, but if you want the content on this sub to change for the better then the new queue is the place to be. This is because at a certain point the free flow of information cannot be mandated by procedural rules and upvotes and downvotes must be allowed to speak.</p>

<p>This is not to even address the consistent reports of briagding that we receive in the modmail from users who watch their posts go from +11 to -25 the second their link is cross posted to that tard sub.  </p>

<p>Questioning the narrative and speculating on motives are the strong points here, not bullshit posts about &quot;aliens&quot; and &quot;reptilians,&quot; which are mostly posted by users attempting to derail this subreddit anyway.</p>

<p>Every time someone(and that may be a slight exaggeration)see&#39;s a HumVee, it&#39;s Martial Law acomin&#39;. Well, my father was a career soldier. They go to work everyday like everyone else. They are flying helicopters, shooting the artillery, jumping from planes (required to get your jump pay).... Mention that and I catch hell. I know they are anonymous individuals on the internet and their opinions do not hurt my feelings personally, but sometimes I&#39;d rather not bother. </p>

<p>Got a PM from one poster saying, &quot;enjoy your downvotes, asshole&quot;. And I was soooo close to having enough votes to redeem that DVD player.</p>

<p>I hear ya. I&#39;ll join in</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Random? Ok, random it is:</p>

<p>Son of Soldier say, guns good.</p>

<p>Situations dictate change in everything. Personal, political, romantic...</p>

<p>Change is not necessarily a bad thing. Ask any person how they felt about a particular issue 10 years ago and how they feel today. Many will have changed views or their passion for that issue may be more or may be less. </p>

<p>I gave Obama my open mind. He&#39;s disappointed. I will say that I actually respect him for not getting us in Syria. Oooh, he wanted to. He was determined. But, the outcry caused him to actually listen to the people. (that&#39;s fuckin&#39; funny, I find some respect in him doing what the hell he supposed to do?) </p>

<p>Guns? Why not? The criminal element has them. They don&#39;t give a shit about you. Better to stand a chance than be a sitting duck. I can wish till I&#39;m blue in the face that it didn&#39;t have to be like that, but, it is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not a subscriber to the government is out to get us and the guns.(SOME are of course and it&#39;s always been that way) I mean, if everything comes tumbling down, that means everything. Including the lifestyles they enjoy so much. Hard to get in the back 9 on a sunny day when the peasants are looting in the streets. Taxes their gig. Can&#39;t cruise on down to Morton&#39;s for a filet in the Benz when the streets are blocked with burning tires.</p>

<p>The real dirt&#39;s in banking, big dirty oil and the way our legislators have been bought and paid for. We mean shit.  </p>

<p>I should point out memes work best when they&#39;re about agreeabel topics, when they&#39;re about polarizing topics like politics, corporations or religion they make some people upset and them being upset is not conducive to productive discussion, usually it ends up being a flame war.</p>

<p>Contentious topics like those we often find here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> shouldn&#39;t be memes if we expect to discuss them rationally <em>because</em> they&#39;re so controversial. You like them, that&#39;s okay I enjoy a quick bite-sized piece of content too but we have a place for that in <a href="/r/ConspiracyMemes">/r/ConspiracyMemes</a> .</p>

<p>Well some can have sources, but since they&#39;re images you can&#39;t click on the links they give you, you&#39;d have to go into the comments, as opposed to a self-text post which could contain the links in easily clickable-form. </p>

<p>Most memes do not cite their sources, you see them, agree and upvote then move on instead of investigating. Or, well most do. </p>

<p>It&#39;s in my interest to find things to engage people on; a lot fo the memes posted here I find myself agreeing with, but really they don&#39;t add anything new to a discussion so much as allow us to find others adding to a confirmation bias. </p>

<p>There is also the concept of individual ideas and interpretation. Not everything has to be a regurgitation or recitation. </p>

<p>Okay, still are you going to post a bunch of memes to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? Cause really if you <strong>want memes</strong> go to conspiracy memes and talk about them in the comments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve noticed is that the posts that do well on here, and reddit in general, is posts with not too much info, as in a picture with a quote or a sentence or two. I assume, and I&#39;m guilty of it too, it&#39;s because there&#39;s not much thinking involved. You just open a link see that you agree with the quote or think it&#39;s something everyone should see and you up vote it. On the opposite side there&#39;s links to whole articles that require a suit down to fully understand it or even to make sure it&#39;s legit. I&#39;m starting to feel we need two subreddit for this, one with pure news, info, data, etc. And one with powerful quotes, pictures and that sort of thing. Although you may not like the short posts they do have some importance because it&#39;s what you can show to a non theorist.and capture their attention with something quick, then you hit them with the data and info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Pretty much, but like I&#39;ve said, they are popular for a reason, and really you should take advantage of that. If you have something to post remember what captures people&#39;s attention and use that, then provide facts and stuff. Also it does no good to simply complain about it, I see plenty of posts of people bitching on here about posts but no actions being taken, honestly I see a party like this pretty often, and I get the point and also feel it&#39;s true to some extent but this is just as bad a post as a meme. I say that because it&#39;s dividing us theorists, instead let&#39;s use each other&#39;s strengths, next time you see a dumb post start a conversation, or look up some info to back it up or discredit it, we all have the same goal I feel, no secrets, no lies, just a fair government, so let&#39;s be fair to each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to point this out for awhile. Its gotten to a point where I&#39;ve been seriously considering unsubbing. The quality of posts has gone down and the vitriol in the comments has been so severe that I barely even consider it worth reading anymore. Its sad that this has happened. The thing that I find most disheartening is that suggesting peer reviewed research is extremely often met with accusations of being a shill and similar nonsense. Its a bummer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that 99% of conspiracy nuts believe that their kooky conspiracies aren&#39;t shitty. So they upvote shitty conspiracies that fit into their Grand Conspiracy of Everything (GCE (TM) (R) (License for use through application via IM! :P) and downvote the more rational posts accusing them of being sheeple, shills, or reptile alien overlords.</p>

<p>The problem stems from the fact that conspiracy theorist posting places are quite literally the last bastion of the truly autistic, ignorant, arrogant, Dunning-Kruger effect suffering dipshits with the most batshit fucking mental ideas who are just too fucking stupid to realize how heinously wrong they are about their psychotic claims.</p>

<p>Thankfully the internets populace are strongly turning against conspiretards of that ilk. These conspiretards are just so arrogant they think people telling them they&#39;re idiots and to shut up are oppressing and trying to silence them and use it for justification to be louder. Which is why you will never get quality when it comes to conspiracies, unfortunately.</p>

<p>You need to do a LOT of pruning of a lot of idiots and removing a significant amount of posting access if you ever want quality conspiracy forums or subs anywhere. Ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one of the reasons is because this sub is constantly linked as a new &quot;le reddit&quot; joke. Just as &quot;So brave!&quot; and &quot;[Insert Subject]jerk&quot; has been exploited to suppress popular opinions. This relatively new &quot;le reddit&quot; joke being that people that post in conspiracy believe in all conspiracies, therefore no conspiracies are true and we become a target for their childish amusement. It&#39;s kind of like how the kid of average popularity will make fun of who the popular kids make fun of. 
People upvote them because &#39;LUL I GET THAT REFERENCE I WANT TO BE IN THE &quot;IN&quot; CROWD&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend recommended this subreddit to me saying r/conspiracy can offer a more legitimate news source than mainstream media.  So I subscribed, also thinking it may help expand my perspective. I&#39;ve been lurking and casually participating for maybe 6 or so months (been called a shill a few times).  Ultimately, I agree with OP.  I haven&#39;t really experienced much of the enhanced perspectives I anticipated.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all about conspiracies, but I wish this sub used more common sense with a comprehensive intellectual approach.  It bothers me that there are a seemingly large group of people who naively subscribe to almost whatever flimsy conjecture gets posted, and then pat each other on the back as if it were truth.  At large, it seems like the implied theories getting attention are almost completely imagined or not well thought-out, instead of being practical.  Makes r/conspiracy look bad.  Reminds me of Fox News or Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Just leads to more misinformation, paranoia, pessimism, and a disabling for actual change within our current government institutions. </p>

<p>I do actively down vote the crap, but it seems more subscribers here have a penchant for up voting the fluff.  Hopefully that changes moving forward.</p>

<p>You can ponder all day or question a lot about the motives of an anonymous poster and their multiple accounts, but one thing you cant ponder is the hard work and dedication many have put into this sub reddit. The laughing stock, well that name is reserved for the people that try any bash critical thought and put down people who try and see through all the viewpoints and narrow sided stories being forced feed through the tvs and newspapers. </p>

I&#39;m just speaking from my perspective, as I&#39;ve seen other subreddits continuously make fun of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for upvoting posts that do not push the boundary of critical thought, as you say. This forum has the potential to be awesome, and I know there are some really great posters here. I just fear its headed in the wrong direction, thats all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because I am a huge fan of hip-hop and have been since I was born. I have <em>loads</em> of facts and knowledge of many artists, albums, labels, etc. that are old and new. I don&#39;t have my Ph.D in conspiracies yet, sorry.</p>

<p>Like I said, the reason I don&#39;t post quality things here is because I don&#39;t spend my day looking up fluoride contents in water and 9/11 from different angles. I do listen to hip-hop ~six hours a day if not more. I can go snag a couple of macros online and post it here with no evidence and contribute to the shit. But I won&#39;t... I&#39;ll have you notice that I never post links to hiphopheads. Know why? I don&#39;t have anything quality to post. </p>

<p>If I were to say if my expectations were met, to be honest, I expected (from a conspiracy-minded group from Reddit anyway) either more links to interesting/thought-provoking stories-- or at minimum, a post with an interesting question regarding some of the major SCCT (so-called conspiracy theories), such as 9/11, Boston bombing, Aurora shooting, JFK, or Oklahoma City.  </p>

<p>As you may note, I am more inclined to discuss the lies and propaganda of our government over alien skulls or some illuminati/occult which worships Satan. [Although, I have to admit that some of those stories having to do with children being kidnapped and used as sexual slaves and devil worship (for members of US Congress/the Establishment, e.g. the Jeff Gannon story) are hard to ignore given some of the evidence].</p>

<p>If you take it from that perspective, no matter what is posted, it is engaging and interesting. </p>

This is just a hypothetical example; one might not agree with Obama on certain things, he might be bought, he might be a good guy making bad decisions, he might be lying, changing his mind or whatever... But accusing him of being part of a conspiracy without any evidence is very serious. Also, all conspiracy hypothesis loses their legitimacy the more there are without evidence. And for fuck sake, there isn&#39;t a conspiracy under every fucking rock! Focus more on proof and less on speculation.</p>

<p>But when people like me make a post about doing something with our weight, whether with agenda or not, it is more or less completely ignored. I wish I could say I was butthurt. But I&#39;ve seen that it&#39;s not only the people here without focus or weak wills.

<p>This made me chuckle. I was convinced Reddit was dead after I&#39;d been here a year, too. In fact I made post to that effect not long after the start of universe (well, 2007).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/comments/601ga/reddit_is_dead">http://www.reddit.com/comments/601ga/reddit_is_dead</a></p>

<p>The truth is reddit goes through cycles. Possibly <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has grown too much, and there are too many tyre-kickers, lurkers, naysayers and gawpers. But there is also an increased problem of deliberate mischief makers (be they trolls or shills) who are strangling discussion on this subreddit. </p>

<p>A shining example of how bad society has gotten was apparent to me this morning. </p>

<p>I turned on the TV to check if the Olympics were on and I got some morning show and its video feed of a &quot;teen wolf&quot; mass holding signs and cheering for the show.</p>

<p>The passion behind TV shows and movies is astounding. Yet, when it comes to human life around the globe, &quot;woa, man. Chill out. What are you gunna do about it? Got any evidence? Oh, well that&#39;s still doesn&#39;t prove it.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeap, I&#39;m actually done now. It&#39;s been nice talking to you man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Then I understand. </p>

<p>The definition of meme is actually: an idea, style or action that spreads from person to person within a community. </p>

<p>I remember learning about it in college before the internet was big, think dial up and AIM, and memes had nothing to do with pictures with words. </p>

<p>What IS interesting is that as time has progressed, the memes that tend to stick are viral videos and pics with words, so much so that the word Meme has become synonymous with picswithwords, since those are the stickiest, it seems. </p>

<p>Reading about how memes start, what causes them to spread, stick, evolve and die, is so interesting to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the content quality, purely speculative, could be that it seems being nonmainstream is becoming a trend...&amp; so I wonder if this subreddit has seen a jump in a new, type of demographic. Maybe new to conspiracy theories, maybe a little more into the entertainment of the idea, and not as motivated by deep thought, enlightenment and change. </p>

<p>As Reddits popularity grows, subscribers do too, and it as it becomes more accepted <em>to a certain extent</em> to entertain conspiracies, the readers and posters here have changed.</p>

It&#39;s like they rent out their account for someone to make that one useless comment. </p>

<p>But more likely a <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> troll resurrecting a dormant alt account after seeing a link posted on their ableist sub, and don&#39;t want to use their main one since they post in that garbage dump and no one here would take them seriously after seeing their comment history.</p>

<p>Theory proven: <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1xpi3p/rconspiracy_where_asking_for_evidence_of_stuff/cfdpli8">I&#39;m too lazy to log on my alt account to post on r/conspiracy.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree with OP here. I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist and originally came to this subreddit for a paper I was working on. At first it seemed like a group of people genuinely concerned but lately has turned into a bunch of fear mongerers jumping to conclusions at the slightest provocation. I used to hear posts with facts, information, statistics, and eye witness reports on how 9/11 was an inside job. Or something along those lines. These were posts written by people who genuinely cared about getting the facts out there but now I see posts about us being controlled by aliens. (I swear that was an actual post.) There&#39;s conspiracy, and then there&#39;s paranoid cults. Let&#39;s try and remember the difference.</p>

<p>It seems like you need an IQ of about 130 (or about 1300 on the SAT) to be able to sift through the bullshit.

People complain in every single sub about the content of the sub.  I don&#39;t think posting a topic about it is even useful.  Everyone&#39;s heard all of this in every sub.  Just vote on things.  Really, the memes are the only thing I see a lot of that I dislike, because usually they oversimplify the issue and come across as a little &quot;conspiritard&quot; but not always.</p>
