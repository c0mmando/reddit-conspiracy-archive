       Something occurred to me while people watching at this obviously fake wrestling expedition.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of grown ass adults believe it is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       The couple in front of me (mid twenties) actually noticed one of the very fake drop kicks and started explaining it away, right before my eyes.  They were so invested in "the lie" that their brains were struggling to patch the holes in what their eyes could see.  Not only this but when you go to one of these events they are recording a whole weeks worth of TV in one night.  So you start with Saturday slam, then 20 minutes later its Monday madness, 20 minutes later its Wednesday something or other... etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       My son of course picks up on this and protests "hey! Its not Monday! And they just took Jake the snake out on a stretcher and there he is again all better". I explained to him that its just a show, like the movies, not real life.  He was okay with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways,  this same principle can be applied to people who believe outlandish conspiracy theories like lizard overlords as well as people who believe all the MSM even when the inconsistencies and fake drop kicks are happening directly in front of their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be that guy folks.  Don't explain shit away because its inconvenient or because the truth hurts your pet theory.  Its okay to let shit go when you've found holes in it.  Even conspiracy theories, but especially the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       This message is the same for everyone here friend or foe, theorist or conspiratard.  If you find yourself repulsed by this message and think its utterly ridiculous that your perception could be wrong, you're probably one of the people who are subconsciously explaining away the phony drop kicks.

       As a wrestling fan, I can tell you that we all know it's fake, but that doesn't mean we don't get into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I know that it's fake, but I'm still involved.  But just like some people really get into breaking bad, or GoT, or any other drama, we get into wrestling.  All it is, is a soap opera for guys...

       I used to watch this back in the day. I had a friend who had been a fan of wrestling for decades, and knew a vast amount of trivia which meant it was like watching it with a continual info feed!
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought JR and The King were the two best commentators, especially JR who used to really sell the outrage during a heel turn.
      </p>

       I tried watching it again a while back, but it's not the same when it's just me.

       As another wrestling fan,
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       people know it's fake. But having been involved with some local indie wrestling feds (we helped them with media, promotion, etc.), I know there are a few who take it
       <strong>
        way
       </strong>
       too seriously. However, it's the same with any pastime or fictional entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me, I used to think it was real when I was a kid, then didn't watch it for close to 20 years. Went to a live show on a whim, and was genuinely impressed by the athleticism and skill it takes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about it being a soap opera, but as Meister_Vergr mentions below, it's also a communal experience. Was as Wrestlemania a couple of years back: crap seats, would have had a much better view on TV, but it was still one of the most memorable live events I've ever attended. It was theater, on a stadium scale, and a great lesson on how crowd emotions can be manipulated

       I like where you're going with this. Good comparisons here. But I'd shift it slightly to comparing wrestling with politics. Both exhibit many similarities, and serve to mesmerize

       shouldn't really see it as a russlin because believe it or not we are not a homogeneous group all sharing the same opinions.

       gets pretty russled no matter what I do so I no longer consider them when submitting something controversial.

       I suppose its possible that some would be so turned off by the lizard overload comment that they wouldn't finish reading and thus be annoyed with me because of my opinion that they only partially comprehend.

       He puts a little green glove on and his hand becomes a snake.  Anyone know his name?

       Jake the snake roberts is the old skool one, I assume he is not around anymore as he looked about 50 in the early 90s.

       He's still around - working the indie wrestling circuit, and being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame this year. He was born in 1955, so rather than "about 50", would have been mid-30s in the early 90's! Clearly not wearing well though: check out the fascinating documentary
       <em>
        Beyond the Mat
       </em>
       for more on him.

       Sadly, addiction - to pain meds in particular - is a far bigger threat. Pre-determined it may be, pro wrestling still takes a hell of a toll on its participants' bodies, and the punishing schedule means pharmaceuticals too often become the only way to get through the day.
