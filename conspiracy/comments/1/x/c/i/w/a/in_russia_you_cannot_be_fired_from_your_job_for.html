    <div class="md"><p>Have you even bothered to look at the link I provided?</p>

<p>Did you know that the law is about children, it’s title is “On Protections of Minors from Propaganda of Non-Traditional Sexual Relations”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The examination of the earliest coverage revealed that while non-US media prominently featured/highlighted the word “children” or “minors” in their coverage, <strong>US-based media did not.</strong> Considering the word “minors” is in the title of the legislation, and as I would later learn the words “minors” and “children” are mentioned several times in the legislation, the omission of those words in US media coverage was curious if not troubling to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you know that breaking this law as a citizen carries only a fine of about $100?</p>

<p>Did you know that in the 7 years since the first region enacted the law, there have been only 6 prosecutions... and ONLY 2 convictions?</p>

<p>And by the way, <em>that</em> conviction was later overturned.</p>

<p>Click on the link please before you start blindly defending the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a HUGE difference between what the US media is portraying as:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will get arrested for being gay in Russia</li>
</ul>

<p>and the reality </p>

<ul>
<li>You will get arrested for distributing propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to children</li>
</ul>

<p>And yes, the definition of &quot;propaganda&quot; is well defined in the law. For example, there was a girl who was protesting by a school with a sign saying &quot;I am proud of my homosexuality&quot;. Under the law, she was given a $50 dollar fine. Not shot and dragged into the woods like the US media would have you believe.</p>

<p>Also, her conviction was overturned and she got her 50 dollars back. Because her sign did not fall under the term &quot;propaganda&quot; as the law describes it.</p>

<p><strong>This is the reality. Not the US media-inspired circlejerk that it is illegal to be gay in Russia. You are statistically you are far more likely to be the victim of an anti-LGBT Hate Crime in the United States than in Russia.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think his point is that your title is misleading. Your title states that in 12 states gay sex is a crime. That is incorrect. Lawrence v. Texas invalidated Texas&#39; sodomy law and by extension all other state sodomy laws. You cannot be convicted of having gay sex under current Supreme Court precedent. Some states just haven&#39;t gone through the process of removing those laws. (Source: I am a criminal defense attorney in Texas).</p>

<p>This makes more sense to me. I am from a pretty liberal/leftist stock, and my feeling is that Obama is tossing out leftwing pet-projects so that every time I say &quot;Obama kills children with robots&quot; they can say &quot;but gays!&quot;.</p>

<p>I mean, I support the gay rights thing, but to be honest, it was a looooong time coming (hello Clinton, Carter, etc!), AND, like you suggested, it is just distractions to keep the otherwise active left (at least under Bush) from doing dick all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is one giant astroturf now. That was the reason for removing r/politics from defaults. Not for advertising dollars like some suspected, but for the sake of better controlling the narrative here. This link about Western hypocrisy on the Russian gay issue got censored from r/politics and r/worldnews <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/05/russia-anti-gay-law-criticism-playing-into-putin-hands">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/05/russia-anti-gay-law-criticism-playing-into-putin-hands</a></p>

<p>The fix is in. There are fewer and fewer subreddits remaining that respect the purported democratic nature of the Internet. I suggest you unsubscribe from r/politics and r/worldnews and join <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics">r/worldpolitics</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sick of this Anti-Russian circlejerk that is going around on Reddit. It just goes to show how many fucking idiots this site has. Staggering if you think about it. BUT, to deny that LGBT Russians are not in bad shape is foolhardy. I do not agree with this law that was passed, though it could have been far worse. You forgot to mention a big thing though: LGBT Russians can donate blood while most Western nations do not allow them to. If I remember correctly, Uruguay, Chile, Mexico and Russia were the countries that come to mind that have no ban on LGBT people donating blood. You should have mentioned that.</p>

<p>If I lived in russia, I&#39;d be pissed about a law like this.  But as a US citizen, there are way too many of these discriminatory laws still on my books to be pointing fingers before my own house is in order.</p>

<p>In addition to being discriminatory, the law is too vague and too limiting of freedom of speech.  But that said- it&#39;s being misconstrued by the american media in a way which makes people believe that it&#39;s illegal for gay people to hold hands in public.  That&#39;s just dishonest. You can&#39;t be self righteous when you&#39;re dishonest ind hypocritical like this.</p>

And there&#39;s a lot of shit that gets posted here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that deserves to be labeled bullshit. Case in point, reviewing your history, it seems you went to great lengths to tell the theorists here that the snow you had recently was perfectly normal and safe. </p>

<p>In that context, following your logic, <em>YOUR</em> voice is not welcome here. Who are you to dismiss the very real plastic snow thing that is happening just because it didn&#39;t show up in the tiny small sampling you personally examined? After all, the conspiracy was posted here, and who are you to tell people what is a conspiracy and what isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a lot of people to despise. Except those who are also Plasti-Snow deniers, perhaps? Maybe you and they are not so dissimilar?

It was a gift wrapped opportunity for you to engage in discussion, to convince us why this should be taken seriously and not dismissed out of hand. After all, what you&#39;ve posted is quite lengthy, and there isn&#39;t any discussion to speak of going on because many of us won&#39;t take the time required to read and absorb a 70+ page doc (+ another 50+ of appendices).

    <div class="md"><p>Adds nothing to the discussion? It was a gift wrapped opportunity for you to engage in discussion, to convince us why this should be taken seriously and not dismissed out of hand. After all, what you&#39;ve posted is quite lengthy, and there isn&#39;t any discussion to speak of going on because many of us won&#39;t take the time required to read and absorb a 70+ page doc (+ another 50+ of appendices). I mean, FFS, dude doesn&#39;t get to what he terms the &quot;Pinnacle Question&quot; (I.E. the crux of the conspiracy) until page 69.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not speaking to the merits of your post. I haven&#39;t read enough of it yet to do so. And I haven&#39;t even begun to vet the author and his info. </p>

<p>Nor was I trying to be ironic (?), it was nothing of the sort. I was speaking directly to the notion that a user was told in no uncertain terms to <em>stop expressing his opinion regarding what is or isn&#39;t a conspiracy</em>, and that right there is bullshit.</p>

<p>Are we not allowed to think and speak freely here? If I don&#39;t think something is a conspiracy I&#39;m gonna say so. If I think something is, I&#39;ll say so as well. </p>
