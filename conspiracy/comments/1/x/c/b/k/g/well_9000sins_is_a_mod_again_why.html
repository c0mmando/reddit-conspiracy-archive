    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t fair, in my opinion. That&#39;s like censoring a post solely for swearing, which is nonsensical. If he said &quot;This place is a joke&quot; you wouldn&#39;t have done the same I&#39;d bet. An opinion isn&#39;t an attack either, his opinion matters and shouldn&#39;t be censored man. The moderators here can remove and ban whoever they want based on their interpretation of an &quot;attack.&quot; Anybody criticizing this subreddit could be censored or banned, which is bullshit. Criticize is a good thing, and a subreddit like this one needs it to keep it in line at times. </p>

<p>If I had seen it, then yes, I would have. None of us mods have the time it takes to read through every single thread here so generally it&#39;s only the comments that get reported that get reviewed. In fact, since I&#39;ve become a mod, I have had very little free time left to actually look for new submissions to post and read linked articles and the comments here. That makes it a bit frustrating when trying to read a thread then having to wade through personal ad hominem attacks on other users, mods and the sub. This sub is for discussing conspiracies. Every ad hominem or verbally abusive comment really derails discussions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I now understand where you&#39;re coming from. Although, I have differing viewpoint regarding moderation but it may be because I&#39;m not a moderator myself. I believe anybody who criticizes the subreddit, or the moderators, shouldn&#39;t be immediately censored; even if it is ad hominem. If somebody makes a blunt generalization about either subjects, they should be at the very least allowed to elaborate their opinion. If they don&#39;t, than yeah I suppose it&#39;s fair to delete the comment. I just don&#39;t want moderators to delete comments based solely on the fact they disagree with moderation or subreddit practices. I think that kind of discussion is important in a subreddit like this, in order to keep it accountable.</p>

<p>I know you and other moderators wouldn&#39;t delete a comment that actually keeps the discussion civil, so maybe it&#39;s alight after all. However, If it were up to me, I&#39;d change the rules here so that it said &quot;criticism about the subreddit or moderators must be kept civil and must be elaborated upon or it will be removed.&quot; Otherwise, moderators are free to delete whatever they <em>feel</em> is an attack, which could cause abuses. You didn&#39;t abuse your power, I can now understand your actions. It&#39;s just that the board term &quot;attacks&quot; reminds me of how our Government has a loose broad definition of Terrorism. Now, comparing you to the U.S. Government is obviously an attack. Just kidding, haha.</p>

<p>What criteria did you use to determine whether or not to reinstate 9000sins?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The error of his shadowban by the admins and consequent reinstatement. His previous well-liked moderation and participation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can we please have some proof</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mods have been discussing it ever since his shadowban appeal was successful. This has taken place over numerous modmail threads. I don&#39;t have the time to spend hours hunting back through everything in our modmail so no, no screenshots. If another mod wants to take the time then that&#39;s up to them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why was his reinstatement so quiet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you should be able to see by the link I provided, it wasn&#39;t quiet at all.The other issues in your last paragraph were also considered.</p>

<p>What it all came down to was that there was a mod consensus and a user consensus (until that thread got linked to in other subs).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright then.</p>

<p>Subreddits are not democracies. This particular one happens to be &quot;owned&quot; by illuminatedwax. He and any mods he approves of get to make decisions. When he&#39;s not around then the other mods get to make the decisions. If the mods decide to give the subscribers a voice in certain matters then that&#39;s okay. If the mods decide that certain things need to be done for what they think is best for the sub in the long run then that&#39;s just the way it is. If you want drama then there are plenty of other subs for you to create and/or participate in drama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well someone better be running the show so we don&#39;t have dumb ass mods shadow banning people or posts unnecessarily or over exerting their control.  Delete obvious shills and ban them, but no more discretion is really needed.  We don&#39;t need fringe topics like Snowden, Assange, or Aliens to draw our focus too on stickies or whatnot.  The mainstream media does enough of that for us as it is.

    <div class="md"><p>What happens is my bot creates a list of all the posts and if <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is in the title or the text post portion of the post, it counts it as one.</p>

<p>It saves a couple files and reads from files to see what it has already commented on and how many times they have mentioned <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>If it has already counted a mention, it won&#39;t count it again.  Same goes for if it has commented on a post.</p>

<p>as far as where it counts from, it is <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>.</p>
