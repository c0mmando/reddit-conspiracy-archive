       1% of 1% contains the majority of the world's wealth, the financial market is manipulated, the school system is ineffective, the unemployment is out of control, money and politics are in bed, the majority of food at our super markets is poison, the water is poised, the air is poised, ocean life across the pacific is dying, our weather is being geoengineered, 9/11 was a false flag, you're being spied on, etc. So what...

       What are you gunna do? Downvote me? Type about it on the computer? Make a lame ass book?

       I'm saying, so fucking what? You're not going to do anything about it.

       We still have to get up tomorrow and go to work, pay bills, interact with the many people still stuck in a false reality where none of the above is acknowledged....so what.

       I see in your other posts in this thread you are also a follower of Christ.  Stay in touch with me if you ever need someone to talk to.  Youre right this world will go through hell, but the kingdom of heaven is coming, and it's gonna be amazing.  Give it time, and keep the fearless faith alive.  i'm only 22, we have a lot of work to do but god gave us this gift of technology and the internet so we can actually do it.  My favorite bible story has always been when Jesus went to the temple, flipped the tables and whipped the merchants asses out of his fathers' house.  It's coming, big time.

       Only mentioning it because it's relevant to the subject matter, but saying: "just sit down calmly and don't do anything. Eventually a magical bearded father figure will appear and fix things for us", may be one of the culprits of our inaction. We have to start taking responsibility for the world or things will never get better. Even if there is such a being, I wouldn't think sitting around continuing to crap all over his creation giving all our power to tbe rich is something he would be happy with.

       Thats exactly the opposite of what im saying.  We need to burn this corrupted palace down, no one will do it for us.  My understanding of God is that he lets this universe play out without interfering.  Jesus in the temple with the whip.

       Well, technically, we all have the reptile in us. As humans, our struggle is to overcome the reptile impulses. Sadly, society teaches us to embrace the reptilian side and let it dominate.

       I can't wait. I honestly have been getting really antsy about it. Like, not in a physical way. Sounds neurotic, but I literally feel this pull on my heart to study the word and really get to know the true, biblical christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting that you mention r/tress and christ. Because, I recently quit smoking weed because of the overwhelming pulling feeling toward Christ. I don't know what's happening, but Christ really wants me to know him or really has a use for me right now.

       I just realized you feel judged at the mere mention of Christianity. That's your own issue and not reflected by the reality of my first comment. I used to be the same, but I felt God's grace. I still rejected it, it's been a long journey and I still have far to travel. But I'm no longer alone, I'm having REAL fun and happiness and

       First of all, the US did not steal the wealth of the world, that was the illuminati. Secondly, the illuminati's leaders are reptilians who were allowed to control the planet for this planet's cycle of "yin". And lastly, the NWO will never happen because the good aliens will not allow for a fully enslaved planet. Good aliens will remove the bad aliens, allowing good people to remove the bad people, allowing this planet to move into the "yang" cycle. If the NWO were to happen, the population of the planet would be greatly reduced to a more manageable number of a few hundred thousand so i am aware of what would happen if there is no shift. If the planet were to become fully enslaved it would stop the oscillation between yin and yang, of course this is the goal of the illuminati and that is why it is now that they are about to implement the NWO before we move into the yang cycle but they will inevitably fail. The leaks being released to the public right now will make sure of that. Literally, the word "calyptien" means "to cover" and "apocalypse" means "to uncover" (you should look that up) and that is exactly what is happening, all the secrets of the illuminati are being revealed to the public before it is too late, which in the near future will prompt us to start a revolution. This is a textbook example of an apocalypse thats happening right now, and if youv been keeping up with the news, youd know that Edward Snowden has only released 1% of his entire leak so far. The leaks to come are more intense than anything thats already been leaked. Also, if you dont believe in aliens idk why you are taking the government's word for it, they hide that to hide the alien technology from us, also part of what is soon to be "uncovered"

       Lol. I don't know to reach you. So, good luck. I just hope you come to realize that's not true. I would try, but you have your info and on this medium, you're a lost cause. The truth will stand the test of time tho, so eventually you'll get there.

       I'm sure you're thinking to same exact thing. But I've been there. Christ isn't a religion, its a way of life. It's a mentality, an identity. You'll see.

       Ironically its the other way around. You are right in that Christ is a state of mind, and by that logic, the second coming of Jesus would be when everyone wakes up to that fact. Aka a "revealing" of knowledge (definition of apocalypse) . But when i said that religion is a lie i was talking about the demons thing. I think "aliens" is more reality based rather than believing things that religions teach. If its the real truth it wont be promoted by the vatican in any way, being that theyr a criminal organization. The ONLY thing i am simply stating is that once it is revealed to everyone that they are all Jesus, it would be impossible to impose a NWO on a country full of Jesus's. Because, believe it or not, Jesus can preform miracles.

       If that were true, there'd be many people walking around right now that could perform miracles.

       Christ is the word. He was there in the beginning with God and was God. In an essence, every since there was, he was. And "was" in the bible there represents timelessness because the beginning wasn't referencing any time point. The word isn't a creation that came into existence at the beginning, he antedates that beginning.

       After the apocalypse iv been telling you about thats happening right now, everyone will be preforming miracles, but it first needs to become a collective belief that that is possible and so it needs to be revealed before its too late, hence all the leaks currently coming out.
      </p>

       And the word Christ actually comes from the word KRYSTLH-A, which is where the words Christ and Allah came from

       You aren't even aware at how programmed you are. There are no aliens. The ONLY thing more powerful than the elite is God, may you find him now. The NWO plan has been to reinforce individualism, hedonism and minimalism; basically that the pleasure of self at the easiest means of achieving it is the accepted norm. Look deeper, the division and derision of religion is one of their most powerful tools. Fear is the opposite of faith. Find a community that speaks to your soul, make connections and BE TRULY HAPPY. No man is an island, ans we were made to understand the nature of God through loving each other.

       Hahah yeah ok, how about you trust the government when they say aliens dont exist. That seems like a well promoted thing on this subreddit, trusting what the elite tell you. And youv also done no research at all into the topic and yet act like you would know anything about it at all. Dont be like everyone else and just assume your right without researching, as if you dont need to because you know everything already, thats the biggest problem this country is facing. This was your "research" process: "aliens? They must be fake because its programmed into people to think that aliens only exist in movies". Heres the thing, if you want to tell me im programmed, explain in what way i am, dont just say "you have different beliefs than me so your programmed". All that will do is show me how little youv actually bothered to research, being that you cant actually give an explanation for that statement. Its amazing how many people are religious on this sub, all the while the vatican is the biggest criminal organization on the planet, yeah lets trust their explanation of God.

       You assume even more. I dont understand how you can say im programmed when all programming that is done by the illuminati is to program people to think the opposite of what i think. Name one way in which im actually being programed and maybe your argument will hold the slightest bit of water but until then i can easily show you multiple ways in which you are being programed and i even did in my last comment.

       If there were aliens assisting earth, we'd know. Their technology and communication means would surpass our current military and coverups
       <em>
        couldn't
       </em>
       occur. Crop circles are like QR codes for satellites. Ancient sacred spaces are observatories and temples for polytheistic religions. No one can time travel, enter other planes, etc. Project Blue Beam won't be the return of Christ, it will be weaponized satellites w alien overlords, anything to further humanity from God. The Illuminati are Luciferians for a reason, they want the power of God. They've never understood that God always "wins" because he designed it all to happen as it has.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to argue further, I've already enraged you, and I apologize. I'm still working on my "tone". Spend as much time &amp; effort as you have on this theory into looking into the Bible. You'll realize you missed much wisdom, I promise. Otherwise, you're the result of the same accusations you threw at me, an unstudied fool who believes movies. Christianity isn't the monster you think it is.

       Let me explain each one of your questions individually and hopefully it will make some sense to you. First of all, if NASA finds any proof of alien life it is ILLEGAL for them to tell the public, so even if aliens did exist there would be a 99% chance that we wouldnt know. Secondly, cover ups occur easily because if the aliens try to force their presence it would easily be turned into a fake "invasion" by the illuminati (HENCE WHY THEY WANT TO ARM SPACE, to convince people that there is a threat of some kind of invasion/ another form of programming).. It is EXTREMELY OBVIOUS that you dont actually look at pictures of crop circles because if you did you would know that they ACTUALLY display symbols such as: The Flower of Life and The Platonic Solids (thats what like 50% of crop circles are created to look like and yes, you should research what those things are, they are displaying them for a reason) so your QR code theory goes directly out the window because i told you what they actually are and you cant say that theyr not that. The majority of the things you said are opinions based on no actual evidence at all. It also amazes me that you think the Bible would actually go untouched by the illuminati when its painfully obvious how easily they could use it to control people... Your right about one thing though, and that is that God always wins. That is why, according to the Bible, He will come in at the very last minute to stop "satan" from overtaking this planet completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope iv covered every possible angle of what you just said and if you have any evidence suggesting otherwise i would love to hear it!

       See, you don't know the Bible at all. As for the rest of all that, I can't even fathom why you would find it appealing, except if you have a sense of exclusivity.

       Haha apparently it is you who doesn't know the Bible. Or at least the book of Revelations, in particular Revelations 20:10 which talks about satan being defeated for 1000 years. But if you want other scriptures too, try looking at John 14:12 where Jesus says that WE will do greater things than he has done (aka when we move into christ consciousness). I understand this is an exclusive way of thinking but in a world ruled by "satan" you will never find the truth in any of its teachings. I would also enjoy evidence suggesting against what i said because i am always open to potentially new ways of thinking.

       Also something interesting, in Revelation 13:18 where it mentions 666 being the number of the beast, if you multiply 13 and 18 you get 234. Its reverse mirror number is 432. 234+432=666. And 432 encodes the speed of light because 432 squared is the speed of light (186,624). Double 432 is 864 which is the diameter of the Sun (864,000 miles). Half of 432 is 216 which is the diameter of the moon (2160 miles). 234 is also the tilt of the earth (23.4 degrees). Also 6+6+6=18, 1+8=9.
360 degrees -&gt; 3+6+0=9
180 -&gt; 1+8+0=9
90 -&gt; 9+0=9
45 -&gt; 4+5=9
22.5 -&gt; 2+2+5=9
11.25 -&gt; 1+1+2+5=9
5.625 -&gt; 5+6+2+5=18. 1+8=9
2.8125 -&gt; 2+8+1+2+5=18. 1+8=9
1.40625 -&gt; 1+4+0+6+2+5=18. 1+8=9
.703125 -&gt; 7+0+3+1+2+5=18. 1+8=9
.3515625 -&gt; 3+5+1+5+6+2+5=27. 2+7=9
.17578125 -&gt; 1+7+5+7+8+1+2+5=36. 3+6=9
You have ALOT to learn about what the Bible really means because its been hidden from you on purpose. I would also recommend looking into the Hebrew alphabet, which is also their numbers. You will find alot of their words work in a mathematical way. Please let me know what you think of all of this information i am just hoping to give you a new perspective on things.

       First Off, thanks for the post OP and expressing how you feel. I think that your opinion is one that is commonly shared among our fellow brothers and sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are we going to do? I ask you to look at the current state of affairs. The powers that be are becoming more desperate than ever. Their blatant attempts at trying to suppress us are becoming more obvious. People are beginning to wake up like never before. They are seeing through the veil and starting to ask questions. Which is why the darkness is trying to suppress the light. But fear not. We shall prevail. Light always prevails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try not to worry about the when. Instead focus on the now. Everything is happening now in this moment. A beautiful horizon is fast approaching and I'll shall see you when we get there.

       Well, that's probably because many religious people misuse the word faith.
      </p>

       And because many religious people aren't living the life they claim to.

       It doesn't. Because we won't change the system. It's been like this since rome, probably before.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Vatican controls practically everything and has for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vatican decides when it's done whoring America to the world in order to steal the wealth of nations.

       Important things are what you can do with your life. Yes, I'm on this sub, but that's because knowledge is important. It gives perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, to act like we have any deciding power in politics or global finances is not only in vain, it's a waste of energy.

       Of course you lost him. What youre saying means nothing to anyone else besides yourself. If I were to tell you, "see, it's Allah who really matters." Would you give a shit? No. You're not Muslim, so you have no reason to relate to those statements. In fact, you are still ignorant. All religions point in the same direction, and Jesus is not the only way to the light. Until you learn that and preach that, nobody is going to care about what you have to say except for your Christian friends. But don't worry, if youre sincere in finding truth and not afraid, then Christ will show you that too.

       I don't know, but the god of Abraham is the god of Abraham. That's why Jesus is recognized by Islam as a prophet. Nowhere near Mohammed, as far as they are concerned, but still a holy man. I try not to inject logic into the realm of religion though. That's when thing get really confusing.

       No, it does matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ doesn't require sacraments, offerings, or anything that other religions require.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ was unique and he's unlike any other religious institution. He's an identity. He's a way of life. Not through anything, but practicing faith in christ can "get you there".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not putting down other religions. I'm just saying, Christ is nothing like any of them. He changed everything. If only you knew more about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't get it twisted with Roman-catholic-protestant paganism. The world's elite have deceived many, many people by misrepresenting the mission of Christ and his disciples with its mix of paganism.

       Btw. No other religion has ever had a savior conquer the grave. As in, rise from the dead. Not one.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what christianity is about. Rebirth. You must be born again in the spirit. And, when you die, your physical consciousness gives birth to that spiritual form.

       I find it astounding how many people on the internet have no clue about chritanity, but they read a few web pages, maybe someone's book, and sudden they feel they know more than someone who has been in the faith for almost 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even better, it's great how the age of the average internet user is around 18-35, especially on reddit, and that age group is well know for going against the belief that God exists. Not only in this century, but it dates back to at least the 1850s. Also, it's great how the pendulum swings the exact opposite way when people start to reach their middle ages and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, please, tell me how wrong I am about knowing about christanity, when the popular demographics of the internet is aimed at resenting the opinion that God exists. Bias much?

       Nooooooooo! This is not true. God is waiting for you, for all of us. He's not angry, he's lovelovelove. Look for the good today, when you see it, tell it it's good, then strive to replicate it. Then you'll feel good. That's the oversimplified version of how this works.

       Your doing exactly as you should be doing. Look around though. The Pope is once again a spokesman for peace. Courageous men and woman are running for office. Things are changing.

       Keep this in mind. What burdens you, are the things that give you strength. The stronger you become, the more of His will you can carry. So wear your burdens cheerfully!

       You're falling right into the ploy. The pope isn't even a priest. He's a fake pope. He never went through the proper catholic proceedings. Not like catholicism is correct anyway, it's just a mix of jesus's teachings and paganism.

       The Vatican? You mean the largest charitable organization in the world? The one responsible for public education and health care? I think you're a little misguided here. Sure, there's been corruption, but that happens with any group of humans. Don't throw the baby out with the bath water.

        So what?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So you acknowledge the truth and know your enemy. You begin to take the steps necessary to keep your family and friends safe.  Acknowledging the truth and speaking up is literally 60% of the battle. I think the fact that public outcry stopped a full scale war in Syria is a testament to the importance of speaking up and holding your ground even when people are calling you crazy and a "conspiritard".
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the steps I have taken and continue to take in order to keep my family and friends safe and aware.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Make your family and loved ones aware of how you feel and why. Explain to them why you are stressed and why you are taking the steps you are.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Limit your exposure to the dollar. The QE bubble has to pop sooner or later. Buy real estate, buy bitcoins, exchange dollars for other currencies and/or gold. Anything. Just don't be left hanging with all your money in dollars.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         BUY A RIFLE. Do not wait.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Have food and water on hand. God forbid there is ever a shortage.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Speak out. If ALL of us continue to SPEAK up about and call out the FUCKING FRAUDULENT pieces of shit that are destroying this country, there will be too many to round up just based on internet chatter. OBAMA IS A PSYCHOPATH MURDERER, there I said it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Accept death and pray to God. Don't be afraid to die standing up for what you believe in. They can take your life but not your soul. Whether you believe in God or Blind Chance, we all must come to terms with the fact that some things are simply out of our hands. Say a prayer to Jesus Christ or The Spaghetti Monster, tell your family and friends you love them and have fun and enjoy life while you have it.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Finally, remember that knowing the truth is half the battle. Remember that when a Whistleblower comes out and gives up their life to tell you something "crazy" or "tinfoil fedora conspiritarded" that they know that's how the public will react. They know that they will be called a pyscho and a "conspiritard" and BE KILLED but they still speak the truth. And for that, you have to hear them out and listen to their stories and take them seriously. Because if you don't, you won't be prepared for the moment their words come true.

       The real question my friend is what are you doing about life? Not what are we doing, but you? Only you can change things in your life. Most people who come here to rant about what we are/are not doing are ultimately frustrated at what  they are not doing.

       All great things to work on. I agree. So why come here to complain about the state of the world? If you are working on those things what else truly matters? Flip your script. Instead of coming off all upset and challenging others why not share what's working for you? What things you are doing  now OP? What are your solutions to the problems you see? Sounds corny right. Little secret-it works.

       No person or organization is going to single handedly "fix the world." The ripple effect is what is going to do it. You say you're taking steps to fix your own life: spiritually and with your family. Well, that is the best step to take! We only really have control over our own situation, so make it count. "Be the change you want to see in the world." Positivity is contagious and if you show it, people WILL and DO follow. Deep in our hearts, well all want to be free. In some of us, that part in our heart has fallen asleep and it is up to the rest of us to wake it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Show the world what it feels like to be treated with compassion and love. They'll remember. They'll follow.

       "Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it." - Woodrow Wilson

       There are many things that we do not control and cannot easily change in this life.
      </p>
      <p>
       1% of 1% contains the majority of the world's wealth, the financial market is manipulated, the school system is ineffective, the unemployment is out of control, money and politics are in bed, the majority of food at our super markets is poison, the water is poised, the air is poised, ocean life across the pacific is dying, our weather is being geoengineered, 9/11 was a false flag, you're being spied on, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot really do much about most of these problems. But, we can become aware that these problems exist, and perhaps take action that effects our own lives. For example, you can try to eat healthy food and drink clean(er) water. You can try not to buy fish which is harvested from the ocean and instead rely on farmed animals or reduce meat from your diet. You can speak out to your friends about problems like NSA and the problems in politics. It is not easy to change things, but if things do change, they may change in a dramatic way. Look at how weed may be legalized across the country. Most people could not have imagined this 25 years ago. Yet, it is happening.

       It's been given many times. Abandon your beliefs about what freedoms have been "taken" from you and devote yourselves to what you can accomplish. Whole neighborhoods can be changed over night if those in that hood have the will to do so.

       Even if you think you can't change the world, all you have to do is not let the world change you. If you remain true to yourself and truth without fail, you are like a snowflake adding to an impending avalanche. The powers that be want you to think that there needs to be one hero to save the world, so that you wait and wait while they continue to deceive and exploit the world for profit and the illusion of power. There is no such thing as a hero, just someone who does the right thing when given the opportunity.

       We're up against people who murder and steal because they want to be human like us.  So fuck them, I'm just gonna be a human.

       What if everybody in America stopped paying their taxes? Changed their tax status to exempt at work. We know the big corporations don't pay taxes, we know the 1% don't pay taxes. If all of the working folks would just file a W4 form check marking the exempt status, the taxes would not be taken out of your paycheck. How long do you think the government would survive without money?

       to quote men in black "human thought patterns are so primitive they are looked upon as an infectious disease" we just need to infect people with notions that this is all a fucking game. What am i gonna do about it? live my life, catch moments of zen when i can laugh at society for participating in said game. if enough people realize this, we can all hang out and have a good time. Because NOTHING matters. (talking Nothing not nothing) Nothing really matters to me, because otherwise there wouldn't be things.

       They use fear to trap you in the system, but that isn't the worst part. The worst part is that the system simply is not sustainable and the 1% know it. This is why the corruption and looting has become increasingly brazen over the last 20 years.

       Voting is for suckers dude. Voting has never changed a god damn thing. You get the choice between asshole #1 and asshole #2. That's not a choice. I'd rather mop my floor than waste my time voting for someone who will do the exact same thing as the last asshole.

       First Off, thanks for the post OP and expressing how you feel. I think that your opinion is one that is commonly shared among our fellow brothers and sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are we going to do? I ask you to look at the current state of affairs. The powers that be are becoming more desperate than ever. Their blatant attempts at trying to suppress us are becoming more obvious. People are beginning to wake up like never before. They are seeing through the veil and starting to ask questions. Which is why the darkness is trying to suppress the light. But fear not. We shall prevail. Light always prevails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try not to worry about the when. Instead focus on the now. Everything is happening now in this moment. A beautiful horizon is fast approaching and I'll shall see you when we get there.
