<p>But come on... some of them are ridiculous. If you think they are all fake - lets hear from you how you think they could be accomplished?</p>

<p>If you think there must me more to the story... post some great photos of crazy complex ones and lets talk about it!!</p>

<p>And then there is that &#39;response&#39; circle that mirrors the coded message we sent out to the universe..?</p>

<p>My take is that that video from about 20 years ago that showed glowing orbs making them in seconds was legit and thats who/what is making them... well some of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surely they CAN be faked...but what of the circles found in where the stalks were NOT &quot;mechanically&quot; trampled? MANY circles are found in which the stalks are heated and basically &quot;explode&quot; from the heat (like a microwave) causing the plant to fall over.</p>

<p>This opens up a whole new argument though...if &quot;they&quot; are complex enough to make these circles why not communicate with us in other ways??</p>

<p>I guess the jury&#39;s out for me on this one still...</p>

They don&#39;t have real jobs, but they have rich parents, who provide them money to go gallivanting around the galaxy. By intergalactic law they are not allowed to directly interact with the backwards monkey people of Earth who spend all day masturbating and blowing each other up, so instead they put their space art degrees to good use by creating big neo-post-post-modern abstract-realist geometric art pieces in our natural habitat. They immediately post holograms of their work to SpaceBook so that all their friends can comment on how deep and fulfilling their lives must be.</p>

<p>There is virtually no historical precedent for crop circles before 1978 when two Englishmen admitted that they made 200 circles to make the paranormal community look ridiculous. 40 years later they are still very effective at it. The advent of complicated designs in circles is a recent thing once GPS and other technology allowed people to do those things easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically, even in your wildest fantasies you can&#39;t imagine an alien species so strange and enigmatic as to wander abound doing geometry in people&#39;s fields. Thus you are forced to conclude that it was boring, predictable humans who have been wandering around doing geometry in people&#39;s fields.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of good reasons not to believe in all this guff, but that&#39;s not really one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I suppose I invited that. Sorry, long day, didn&#39;t mean to offend.</p>

<p>You are arguing from incredulity. As far as I can see, there&#39;s only one solid reason to believe that crop circles are made by men and not by aliens, and it is this: men have been publicly observed and documented in the act of making crop circles, while aliens have yet to be publicly observed and documented in the act of even existing.</p>

<p>The reason I posted at all, which I now fear I may not have put across properly, is that I sensed a delicious irony in your reasoning: &#39;aliens don&#39;t make crop circles because really, what sort of weird shit to do is that&#39;, say you. Meanwhile, that the only sentient species we have studied to date (our own) does precisely that sort of weird shit for no apparent reason at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re asking us, fellow humans, why an extraterestial civilization would come and make crop circles? Assuming they are coming and doing these things, is it not logical to think their reasons would be as alien as they are? In other words, you ask why do aliens, if they are real, do what they do and not just anounce themselves and end world hunger? My answer is I dont know, I&#39;m not a crop circle building alien. Not that I&#39;m saying that is whats happening either. All I&#39;m saying is just because you cant understand why someone else would do something, especially say a civilization thousands or millions of years ahead of us, it certainly is not proof that we are not being visited, any more than crop circles are proof the we are. But the crop circles at least pose questions for us to answer. Who made them? Why? How? Your line of thinking, the whole why bother when I cant imagine what an advanced civilization would want to come to earth for, is a rather limited point of view, IMO. No offense intended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do humans build churches? Why do humans build skyscrapers? Why do humans believe in anything? Because they do, it&#39;s plain and simple. There isn&#39;t anything unbelievable about crop circles being made by humans. They&#39;re simple and yet &quot;complex.&quot; I believe in extraterrestrial life and life forms being infinitely different from us, though with these ideas comes a tag-a-long : crop circles aren&#39;t &quot;out of this world&quot; different, like Stonehenge, like the pyramids and Easter island - they are explainably created by humans. Why? Have humans ever needed a definitive reason to do anything? Bent stocks of corn and other vegetation aren&#39;t &quot;unexplained phenomena&quot; -- unexplained phenomena would be something &quot;unexplainable.&quot; Can humans bend things to form indentations of geometrical shapes that we recognize? Yes. It&#39;s going to take something truly magnificent for your argument to stick. Something....otherworldly and completely mindfucking-ly unexplainable.</p>

Every time you see one of the aerial shots of a crop circle deemed &quot;too complex&quot; for humans to have made, remember: that picture is being taken in a hovering, controllable piece of metal, powered by thousands of tiny controlled explosions, designed nearly a 100 years ago. Never doubt the ingenuity, creativity, and determination  of the human mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of see it the other way round.
The very simple circles are the most interesting ones, as they are the most likely to have a non-human cause. I.e, it&#39;s more fun to make a complex design, and more likely to get interest from other people.</p>

<p>The simple circles have possible pointers to strange weather phenomena or unconventional flying machines that I find more intriguing than the work of students with some rope and planks of wood. </p>

<p>The larger and complex designs are more impressive, but always seem a bit commercial to me. I.e, they are designed to appeal and distract, rather than to inform.</p>

<p>The smaller, or single circle events occur in harder to reach places with less easy access (I.e, they tend to intersect less with tractor lanes through the crop), which makes me think they may be the more interesting phenomena. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is some conspiracy aspect with cropcircles.  </p>

<p>The two old men who said they made a lot of cropcircles, named Dough and Dave, may have been working for the secret service. They have produced a lot of dis-information, and have made the idea of real cropcircles seem silly at a time when they were popular.  </p>

<p>At a place near avebury where often cropcircles appear, there were cameras set up that were able to see in the dark. Can&#39;t exactly remember if they were infrared or low-light. Still they found a hoaxed cropcircle in the field just outside the range of the cameras. These hoaxers knew about the range of the cameras, and the investigators think the hoaxers had military knowledge of the limits of such cameras.  </p>

<p>There is one report and pictures from cropcircle investigators spotting a light-ball after which a black helicopter comes after it. The helicopter comes then low towards the investigators and force them to leave the field..<br/>
As you may know the light balls are very similar to the foo-fighters and the military will certainly have an old interest in these balls.</p>

<p>There are some reports from people at the military that they use sensors that can track the energy signatures of cropcircles and can predict where the cropcircles would arrive. Only a part of the signatures become cropcircles, according to these reports. There are even some reports of cropcircles within militairy installations.  </p>

<p>Sometimes it seems there are some fanatic skeptics that want to prove that cropcircles are fake, by making them. How that proves anything is beyond me. I prefer solid scientific research, especially when this science assumes that we don&#39;t know everything, otherwise it is just a &quot;we need more research&quot; study.<br/>
I suspect some of the crazy complex cropcircles might be made by such fanatic skeptics, but I am not certain. The research done by<br/>
<a href="http://www.bltresearch.com">www.bltresearch.com</a> are more interesting. They have found a lot of diferences between real cropcircles and fake ones.<br/>
The idea of light orbs making these real cropcircles is mostly supported by the scientific researchers. What these light orbs are is a totally different question. They could be ...
a) small alien UFO&#39;s?<br/>
b) projections from another dimension?<br/>
c) spirits / ghosts?<br/>
d) nature spirits (like the mythical fire elementals)?<br/>
But there is not much &quot;conspiracy&quot; in that part. Except maybe that all of these explanations are likely to be attacked by scientists.</p>

<p>One interesting thing to mention is that in the year we saw the greatest <a href="http://wonderstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Crop-circle_photo_wonderstoday_com.jpg">cropcircle ever</a>,<br/>
and in the year the <a href="http://www.siriusdisclosure.com">disclosure project</a> was gonna start,<br/>
that same year we saw 9/11.<br/>
There..  back to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ;-)</p>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMeRd5EdBwE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMeRd5EdBwE</a><br/>
Some researchers believe it is faked, but no source is really sure. Some are afraid it will hurt the research of cropcircles when they accept hoaxed videos. Most veteran researchers are well aware of hoaxers trying anything, so they wont accept anything when there is some possible doubt.<br/>
But the witnesses usually tell the same thing as in the video.</p>

<p>My own idea is that there is a spiritual aspect behind cropcircles, besides the clearly visible spiritual symbols. Trying to understand cropcirlces is somehow similar to trying to understand zen. ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people are assuming that crop circles, if made by aliens, are in order to communicate with us. Why are we making this assumption? What if the shapes formed by the crop circles serve a purpose in and of themselves, regardless of whether or not any humans are aware that the crop circle exists? I believe crop circles are tied to sacred geometry and serve a purpose that society isn&#39;t quite ready to understand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In some sense. There really are many different ways of looking at it. One belief holds that the Earth is a sentient being, just of a much higher level than us. Perhaps crop circles are how aliens send information to Gaia; I have no idea how they would receive information back. Perhaps the shapes formed by crop circles serve as lenses/magnets to focus/attract certain energies to Earth. Perhaps these energies in turn can affect us on a non-physical level.</p>

<p>Who knows? People like too poo-poo this line of thinking, and use words like &quot;new-age&quot; to compartmentalize these ideas. Sacred geometry is a very interesting field to say the least. There&#39;s no telling what secrets it may hold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the case of markings supposedly left by UFO, the two most interesting ones to me involved leaving very simple impressions. It is the facts surrounding them which lend them greater credibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonnie_Zamora">1964 - Police officer Lonnie Zamora and others witness an egg-shaped UFO descend in flames into the desert near Socorro, New Mexico. Zamora soon after sees the (no longer flaming) craft take off. An area of fused sand and depressions from landing gear remain as evidence for Air Force investigators.</a>  </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendlesham_Forest_Incident">1980 - Dozens of U.S. Air Force personnel witness lights and a landed craft of unexplained origin in Rendlesham Forest, just outside of a British air base which is being used at the time by the United States. Deputy base commander Lt. Col. Charles Halt describes the incident in a memo to the Ministry of Defense. The following day, Air Force investigators find impressions in the ground where the landed UFO was spotted, and determine that background radiation is 10x higher than normal.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fascinating from both angles, this. If at least some of them are real, who are they for? Are they just graffiti, or a primer in some trans-dimensional cypher? Hard to believe they&#39;re anything but deliberately cryptic. One zany theory I enjoyed is that they&#39;re impressions made by objects rolling in and out from other &#39;dimensions&#39; or densities or whatever you want to call them - like tire marks on the road, or prints in sand, only from a place where the shortest distance between two points is Euclid dropping acid while Aphex Twin plays Rachmaninov on a theremin.</p>

<p>And if conventional wisdom holds, and they&#39;re all man-made; just who the fuck are these guys? These things pop up constantly, all over the world, no names, no signatures, no press releases*. It must be some sort of secret artistic movement, these guys keep so low-profile they make Banksy look like Russell Brand. </p>

<p>(* - I mean sure, there&#39;s <a href="http://www.circlemakers.org/">groups like these</a> trying to make an honest living with it, but <a href="http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/inter2012/inter2012.htm">look at this shit</a> - they&#39;re all over the place, who&#39;s up to this?

<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson has a great quote on this. Paraphrasing: &quot; There is 2% difference in our DNA compared to monkeys. When we see a monkey doing sign language or painting, we say &#39;oh nice! Look at what he can do.&#39; So if an alien species was just 2% improved compared to us, they would look at the space shuttle and say &quot;how nice. look at what they can do&quot; with the same attitude.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;re dealing with some sort of communication. This could be between humans, humans and non-human intelligence, or solely between non-human intelligence.</p>

<p>These really are the only three options, and that includes the &quot;everything is hoaxed&quot; perspective, which still falls under the first category.</p>

<p>Also, the sheer amount of esoteric/occult symbolism uses in many of the patterns demonstrates a profound knowledge of Hermetic and other occult doctrines, also suggesting that they are an attempt at communication, similar to how John Dee was attempting to contact other intelligences in the 17th century. </p>

<p>There is a ton of info out there about symbols and using them to evoke deities/intelligences.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant of the crop circles is <a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/crop/barbury/barbury.htm">The Barbury Castle Triangular Crop Circle Formation of 1991</a>.</p>

<p>The sheer amount of mathematical information encoded into this pattern is mind-boggling, and honestly I defy even the most hardened skeptic to research this crop circle and tell me with complete certainty it was made by some dudes in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>It has understandably been referred to as &quot;the mother of all crop circles&quot;.</p>

<p>Freddy Silva has <a href="https://stigdragholm.wordpress.com/signs-and-miracles/iv/decoding-of-mother-of-all-crop-circles-and-jerusalem-ufo/#Freddy%20Silva">done some fascinating analysis</a> on the glyph, even if you don&#39;t agree with his conclusions.</p>

<p>Another crop circle researcher, Brian Grist, noted the resemblance of the formation to the alchemical formulations and diagrams of the triune stone, comparing it to the 15th century monk Basil Valentine.</p>

<p>In Grist&#39;s own words: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Barbury cipher is a graphic representation of the &#39;philospher&#39;s stone&#39; or &#39;cosmic egg&#39; from which all life is derived, at the stage in the transmutation of matter which precedes the act of completion.</p>

<p>The Barbury configuration was, then, a symbolic figure of the divine order that exists at the interface between one level of matter and another, with seemingly infinite potentials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard Hoagland, for all his faults, made these statements about the Barbury Castle glyph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you begin to look at the specific numbers and angles of this circle, we find exact correspondences in the angles and constants and relationships in the D&amp;M pyramid at Cydonia on Mars.</p>

<p>And that those correspondences extend to some of these whereby if you connect the centers of the outlying circles you wind up with 19.5 and 22.5, which of course is the tetrahedral geometry...</p>

<p>This circle embodies in its fine structure the hyper-tetrahedron, the so-called five-cell projection of mathematicians like Coxeter and others, who&#39;ve been doodling for the last hundred years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whoever was behind the Barbury glyph was familiar with Western esoteric, Kabalistic and Hermetic-alchemical tradition, as well as the techniques of higher-dimensional projective geometry.</p>

<p>Crop circles are a message. Perhaps we are sending a message to some Others. Perhaps they are sending messages to us. Perhaps messages are being sent back and forth between a hypothetical <em>human</em> Breakaway Civilization and those of us on home base. Perhaps all of these are taking place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Creating an image that can be seen by everyone on the planet is much better way of communicating than sending a radio signal that needs an active receiver tuned into right frequency.</p>

<p>After all, as a requirement for species receiving the message its just &quot;can process light in a way that it can see images&quot; which is kind of low tech. Also, rather than trying to guess the native language, images and especially mathematics in form of natural geometry (like pi, perfect circles etc.) are a good way to send information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To say that they are all made with boards and rope is obviously not true.  Some of the &quot;real&quot; crop circles have complex weave patterns in the crops that should snap at a 45 deg angle, but don&#39;t. 
 Many people that walk through these crop circles have overwhelming feelings, almost dreamlike or physic phenomenon.
Not sure where they come from, perhaps there are people here using technologies we aren&#39;t aware of, or come through another dimension.  Either way something or someone is trying to communicate.  They are almost always sacred geometrical patterns that have significant meaning to our reality. </p>

<p>The complexity of a crop circle is in no way indicative of alien origin. </p>

<p>Edit: I neglected to answer your questions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think they are all fake - lets hear from you how you think they could be accomplished?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on the design, one method i&#39;ve seen is simply done by using a rope to flatten them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And then there is that &#39;response&#39; circle that mirrors the coded message we sent out to the universe..?</p>

<p>These messages were not secret. All it takes is a few individuals with time on their hands to replicate the messages in the crops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really certain which ones count as the &quot;famous ones&quot;. I recall when they all started though, as they were initially all just simple circles which rapidly evolved into more complex forms as different group learned new techniques and tried to out do each other.</p>

<p>You might notice where most crop circles are. South East England, where you have the major old Universities like Oxford and Cambridge, and they&#39;re generally near roads, which aliens wouldn&#39;t need to reach a site.</p>

<p>I think they probably seem more mysterious outside the UK due to their rarity and the fact that everyone else missed out on the really early primitive ones, but we grew up with them here, so they&#39;re not really that odd to us.</p>
