<p>But I&#39;m going to end here. I get so disgusted WITH MYSELF for even trying to converse with someone who is so obviously in love with them self, that they feel like reddit is a life mission. You need some priorities, and I suspect, some IRL friends to shock you into self awareness. You can blame your personality defects on the hive mind, but it&#39;s not until you meet new people who then are offended by your actions, that you&#39;ll really have to look at YOURSELF.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly man,</p>

<p>Your opinion doesn&#39;t matter to me because your opinion is only &quot;reinforced with votes&quot; after any particular thread is cross posted to the very people who don&#39;t want <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to exist.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you say things like &quot;why don&#39;t you wait 72 hours and see what this community really thinks&quot; because you understand exactly how the votes here are constantly manipulated.  The regulars and backbone of this community doesn&#39;t need 72 hours to weight in because they browse here every day.  The metadrama subs however do need 72 hours to make imaginary popcorn and jerk each other off over how cool they are that they can destroy a subreddit they don&#39;t agree with.  </p>

<p>Its pretty obvious  when 99% of the negative comments towards me are from usernames that never participate in conspiracy and most of the time are involved on a daily basis in conspiratard or SRD.  And that other 1% of the time its someone who is upset because they were breaking the rules, I warned them and they feel like they should be able to break the rules because their target was a &quot;shill&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its hard to judge such things when you don&#39;t see the mod mail.  I understand where you formed that opinion of me however.</p>

<p>And i&#39;m sure that i&#39;m guilty of being unfair to people in certain instances.  You kind of grow weary of listening to people&#39;s excuses for breaking rules and their justifications for breaking rules after listening to thousands of trolls spin a story, giving them a break, then having them throw it in your face with a big TROLOLOLOLOLOLLLL! </p>

<p>After a while you just start enforcing the rules and leaving the fairness in people&#39;s own hands.  Its pretty easy, follow the rules and there won&#39;t be any debates about fairness.  Break the rules and thats on them.</p>

<p>The community actually has improved since the mods quit allowing &quot;conspiracy regulars&quot; to break the rules.  Everyone acts right or they don&#39;t get to act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Number one, lets remember that you claimed you didn&#39;t originally ban me, but instead said it was another of the mods. Glad to know I was right that it was you behind it the whole time, instead of the listed, at the time, Rule 6, which stated that bans were ONLY done after mod consensus. Yeah, one of the side effects of the Autism is that I have great memory, even of convos nearly a year ago.
  That said:</p>

<p>Entering a conversation where one posted in order to get opinions from others is not &quot;mocking&quot;.  It&#39;s exactly what you wanted when you posted.  YOU ASKED for opinions.  You just seem to have a problem with people who are being truthful and not fitting what your version of reality is.

<p>The pathetic, human slime &quot;Flytape&quot; goes fishing for compliments, all while using illegal lures which have been banned by PETA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it a valid way to solicit feedback having a poll from a controversial mod who has a penchant for banning anyone who looks at him crossways, while he retains the full power to punish dissenters? I guess it is if you are after a predetermined outcome. </p>

<p>This is a sub that is notorious for smashing dissent and banning anyone who doesn&#39;t adhere to the sub&#39;s orthodoxy. Among both mods and followers here there is a widespread and wholly sincere belief that anyone who disagrees is a <em>literal enemy</em>, a <em>literal agent of the government</em> (or some other nefarious agency), and that these enemies need to be purged and punished. This is heart of fascism stuff, totally contrary to American values but perfectly consistent with the values of extreme right wing authoritarianism.</p>

<p>The point is that having a paranoid, ban-happy political extremist who believes he is waging a literal war for the survival of a besieged minority ask in a forum he still moderates if he should retain his authority is not the best way to get candid, honest feedback.  Very few people are going to feel free to say anything against Flytape as long as he continues to have the power to eliminate them. </p>

<p>The outcome of this query was rigged before it began.</p>

<p>(Throwaway account created for this occasion, simply because dissent is punished in this sub and freedom of thought and expression are expressly prohibited and regularly punished - <em>as everyone here knows</em>.)</p>

<p>The main point is that xkcd continues to operate as normal and people are still enjoying it.  Its unfortunate that your favorite mod decided to start metadrama over a mod that outranked him and got himself kicked.  </p>

<p>If you talk shit about your boss on a public forum and it gets back to him do you get in trouble at work?  yeppers...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, unless the issues that caused the commotion to begin with have been fixed (inappropriate sidebar links, auto mod that deletes and censors people who want to address the issue or the mods) then it isn&#39;t &quot;operating normally&quot;.  And the fact that <a href="/r/xkcdcomic">/r/xkcdcomic</a> has been rapidly gaining subscribers and your sub has been losing them is evidence of that fact.</p>

<p>Secondly, I don&#39;t really give a shit about the mod who got kicked.  Not every one who disagrees with you is &quot;in on it&quot; with someone else, which also speaks to your apparent fondness of accusing dissenters of being part of an SRS brigade.  I care about the sub, and I&#39;m angry because it got hijacked by people who really had nothing to do with it in the first place, and then began pushing their own agenda into the sub and censoring or banning anyone who addressed it.  I find it extremely ironic and hypocritical, as well, that a person who was a MOD OF /R/CONSPIRACY would engage in this sort of activity and then deny it.</p>

<p>And thirdly, acting benevolent by making insincere sign offs to your replies doesn&#39;t make you sound nice, it kind of makes you sound like a dick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know that he does.</p>

<p>My hope was that he would be willing to make a trade.  For example <a href="/r/stormfront">/r/stormfront</a> is being squatted by a group who hate white supremacists.  If soccer is really a big racist white supremacist then maybe he would be willing to trade xkcd for stormfront.</p>

<p>Of course we will probably never get that far because robotevil and NYPD32 see this trade option that I&#39;m trying to put out there as a way to make it look like I&#39;m trying to get played cash for the subreddit, and thus get me banned from reddit.</p>

<p>It just goes to show you who is actually willing to talk things out around here and who is just looking to rule over others. Those who don&#39;t homogenize with their worldview will be called names, doxxed, hounded, and if they find anything that remotely violates reddit&#39;s ToS then they get banned.</p>

Instead of trying to broker a shady backroom trade, you should be trying to get the admins to change their policies.

These few people have enjoyed their raids, down vote brigades, ridicule, chat sniping, false complaint reporting, and so on virtually unchallenged.

That said, as of late the entire sub has been undergoing a power struggle for direction and control internally. There has been rumor and manufactured controversy regarding who exactly is causing the deletion of many important threads.

<p>I have voiced support for you in the past, you can see in my comments.</p>

<p>I was concerned about all the meta-drama with u/soccer   I tried to follow it but I&#39;m not sure what to think about it.  Who is u/p1impstick?  What is your association with u/soccer?  I understand that he is a powerful mod, it&#39;s just that the whole thing was curious to me.</p>

<p>For the record, I support you Flytape and am happy you are back as mod.  I was just hoping for some clarification on the subject.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>He added me as a mod to two of them.  Neither of them are as Democratic as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  </p>

<p>The reality is that a liberal SRS type group doesn&#39;t want soccer to own certain subs.  They say he is a sub squatter.  You can see what subs a person owns by going to their profile and looking at the sidebar. </p>

<p>These liberal SRS type people also own a ridiculous amount of subs.  See: <a href="/u/bipolarbear0">/u/bipolarbear0</a> they of course have no problem with these people owning or squatting subs.  Its just a power struggle that never ends on reddit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really depends on how you feel about it. As a mod, you are inevitably going to be put in positions where you are hated by many people around here. Does it bother you? Is the hatred of you by others here justified? Do you feel it is time to move on? I think these are questions I would think about before making such a decision. Ultimately it is on you. Just take you time and figure out where you want to go from here.</p>

<p>As for me personally, you have banned only one person in six days. Since this board is a breeding ground for anti authoritative individuals, I would say you are doing a good job. Good luck with the decision friend. </p>

<p>**With further reading here is what I would do. Go through <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> tagging all the submitters/commenters there so you can have a better idea of who is trolling this sub. With that tag, you can more easily tell the context of who is posting here. Hell, I do it myself. It is very surprising how many of them are on this sub; and some of them actually contribute to the conversation here, (very, very few btw). Stay on as a mod, just use some different tools perhaps?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had the chance to meet you, but I&#39;ve met a mod who sides with trolls. I&#39;m still waiting for an answer from this mod on who to contact for rules violations from the same user. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1w1q64/heres_my_list_of_seth_macfarlane_coincidences/">Here&#39;s the exchange.</a>
As always, the troll&#39;s comment is at the very bottom of the thread. Scroll down to the very bottom. The debate takes place there.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve received a mixed message from another mod about the trolls. That mod says &quot;I really don&#39;t want <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to lower ourselves to the level of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. The more we ban the users over there, the more we stoop to their level.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m at a loss as to which mod will deal with trolls. If you&#39;re that guy, please stay. If you&#39;ll give the the run-around as the other mods did, then I see no point in talking to 3 brick walls.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My stance on dealing with trolls is that everyone has a different opinion on who the troll is.  Therefore I don&#39;t deal with trolls I deal with rules violations.  99% of the time this will eliminate the trolls.  1% of the time, the trolls follow the rules.</p>

<p>The problem with dealing directly with trolling while ignoring the rules is that 50% of the time you successfully remove a troll and the other 50% of the time you mistakenly remove a legit user who was having a bad day or just very emotional about some specific issue.</p>

<p>I would rather wait the troll out until they break the rules.  And not just run around hacking arms and legs off of people who have differing opinions about something.</p>

<p>Its a tough balance.  </p>

<p>please don&#39;t hesitate to report rules violations.  Via mod mail or even directly to me.</p>

<p>Why would I hope to have a known conspiratard troll removed from this sub? </p>

<p>Edit: snark aside, what answer did you think I was hoping for? The same answer that most of <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> also longs for? How many socks does this user have? I&#39;ve noticed people have pointed out this one user has at least 3 alt accounts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well,</p>

<p>Long ago I was voted on as a mod.  With Englishmunichfan and weedtastic.</p>

<p>Then I resigned because I was pretty much the only active mod and SWS was banning someone for &quot;the squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot; while talking about israel and &quot;they are very squeaky and greasy&quot; </p>

<p>Then...  SWS got canned and the rules about racism were updated to appropriately reflect this community.  So I was invited back by the mods.</p>

<p>Now they are asking me to step down because I wasn&#39;t &quot;voted in&quot; by the community.  Even though technically I was.   </p>

<p>So they want me to ask this question of the community.  I really didn&#39;t want to air all this dirty laundry like this because its a huge distraction from actual conspiracy topics.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t want to leave now that the rules are fixed.  Now that the rogue mod SWS is gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this all sounds like a really weird coming out party. I mean the wooden stake insinuates you&#39;d be a &quot;flaming&quot; homosexual, the surprise party about you means <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ileGil63s90">it&#39;s like an intervention</a> and the gay unicorn forcing you to ride them wow so symbol. Flytape it maybe me just reading too much into this but that&#39;s how I see it, but only because it sounds hilarious did I even bring it up. My apologies if you&#39;re not into my sense of comedy but I&#39;m trying not to disparage you or gay people; it just seems if it&#39;s stressful for you maybe that&#39;s one more reason you&#39;d been reconsidering the responsibilities of a moderator.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not exactly true Flytape. You were invited back by a single mod as far as I&#39;m aware - without a discussion. The issue was never talked about between the team. you also never put your hat in the ring when r/conspiracy added the new mods. </p>

<p>A number of readers picked up on this so for the sakes of fairness i suggested you address the community and ask for their opinions on you being a moderator here. </p>

<p>I have no problems with your contributions but it is right to ask the wider community after the other mods were voted in.</p>

I basically trust you, Flytape, and SovereignMan from what I&#39;ve seen of your contributions to the site.  Mr. Dong has concerned me in the past regarding his push of aliens and questionable calls on what gets stickied on top I think or promoted on the subreddit as far as side images go too.  We&#39;ve just disagreed in the past on what is of utmost best quality and what is there to make us look foolish or overly speculative.  But take all this with a grain of salt because I could easily be fooled and overly judgmental as well.  But I am very concerned with the quality of this subreddit going forward and I know there are people here who have no interest in uncovering or exposing the validity of conspiracies and would rather mock us, ridicule us, or inject absurdity in here to make us look bad.</p>

<p>Peace.  Thanks for your openness Flytape!  Someone at one time said the moderation log should be made public and I thought that was worth considering too.  Peace.</p>

<p>Thanks for being moderators.  It is a crucial, yet often thankless job.  And I appreciate it when done with good intentions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My stance on dealing with trolls is that everyone has a different opinion on who the troll is.  Therefore I don&#39;t deal with trolls I deal with rules violations.  99% of the time this will eliminate the trolls.  1% of the time, the trolls follow the rules.</p>

<p>The problem with dealing directly with trolling while ignoring the rules is that 50% of the time you successfully remove a troll and the other 50% of the time you mistakenly remove a legit user who was having a bad day or just very emotional about some specific issue.</p>

<p>I would rather wait the troll out until they break the rules.  And not just run around hacking arms and legs off of people who have differing opinions about something.</p>

<p>Its a tough balance.  </p>

<p>please don&#39;t hesitate to report rules violations.  Via mod mail or even directly to me.</p>
