I have abandoned my health for the sake of poisonous foods. I relinquished my empathy for blind, fanatical patriotism. I indoctrinate myself with media and fear and focus on maliciously crafted tools of division. I see race more than I see humanity and I back up my bigotry with ignorance etched into my soul from the ones who profit from opening chasms between people. I repeat the mantra that I am part of the greatest nation that has ever existed. I am force fed lies of exceptionalism and I swallow them because the truth is an enemy I will conquer.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize if I came off as an elitists. That was <strong>not</strong> my intent.</p>

<p>Allow me to clarify: I don&#39;t consider most people to be of low intelligence, nor willfully ignorant, though there are certainly people who fit that description (realistically). </p>

<p>Rather, the American people, by large, have been deliberately &quot;dumbed down&quot; and kept in a state of perpetual distraction, manipulated by propaganda to the extent that they are either completely complacent or blissfully unaware that their rights are rapidly deteriorating. And unfortunately, there are a minority who would actively endeavor to keep others in the dark and enable those in power who take away our rights, violate our rights and privacy without volition and engage in acts of tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what TPTB want you to believe. </p>

<p>The modern American adult? Yes, absolutely, and way too many of them. And they&#39;ve been pushing their insanity and ignorance and divisiveness on kids for decades. But this, too, is changing, slowly. Will change faster if we question, without anger or accusation, their inculcation. It may not go well at first, but you&#39;d be surprised how people come around when they get a spark of knowledge, then investigate for themselves. They&#39;re not going to believe you 100%, but they shouldn&#39;t anyway.</p>

<p>The children? Eh, go talk to some, they&#39;re amazing. I&#39;m a pessimist about everything, but I&#39;m hopeful about them.</p>

no doubt advertising plays a huge role, not to mention education (sigh, the list goes on)</p>
