       I am the modern american child; I was raised suckling on the tit of war. I have abandoned my health for the sake of poisonous foods. I relinquished my empathy for blind, fanatical patriotism. I indoctrinate myself with media and fear and focus on maliciously crafted tools of division. I see race more than I see humanity and I back up my bigotry with ignorance etched into my soul from the ones who profit from opening chasms between people. I repeat the mantra that I am part of the greatest nation that has ever existed. I am force fed lies of exceptionalism and I swallow them because the truth is an enemy I will conquer.

       I have two children in their early 20's. They aren't racist, laugh at the media, are well aware that this country promotes war. Most of their friends are the same way.

       This sounds an awfully lot like sour grapes. Sure, there are people like you describe, but you shouldn't paint everyone with such a broad brush.

       Many kids do. That was my point. It isn't just my kids. Their friends ignore advertising, regular media, etc. Most kids their age do. They have a natural tendency of distrust towards the attempt to "own" them. They grew up with it, and see through it.

       Rather, the American people, by large, have been deliberately "dumbed down" and kept in a state of perpetual distraction, manipulated by propaganda to the extent that they are either completely complacent or blissfully unaware that their rights are rapidly deteriorating. And unfortunately, there are a minority who would actively endeavor to keep others in the dark and enable those in power who take away our rights, violate our rights and privacy without volition and engage in acts of tyranny.

       Whatever, man. I'm from Australia and I don't know if that falls under the same category for you, but meh. I'd say that in my country we're pretty OK with understanding what's going on politics. We're not OK with it, and everyone thinks our Prime Minister is a fuck hat because of it, but we get the gist of what's happening, no matter how many A Current Affair episodes channel 9 tries to ram down my throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'd say that the lack of political awareness with "young" Americans would simply chalk up to apathy. I wasn't reading newspapers when I was a teenager because I didn't really care about what was going on politically. I was more concerned with other shit my teenaged brain thought was more important at the time. It's difficult to get kids involved with complex political debates, unless it's SOPA and PIPA which in this case it's bombs away.

       This is what TPTB want you to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern American adult? Yes, absolutely, and way too many of them. And they've been pushing their insanity and ignorance and divisiveness on kids for decades. But this, too, is changing, slowly. Will change faster if we question, without anger or accusation, their inculcation. It may not go well at first, but you'd be surprised how people come around when they get a spark of knowledge, then investigate for themselves. They're not going to believe you 100%, but they shouldn't anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       The children? Eh, go talk to some, they're amazing. I'm a pessimist about everything, but I'm hopeful about them.

       I think what this nation (USA) once stood for was a great thing. If there ever was meaning behind the hollow words.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can only remove the strings one nation at a time and lead by example. We have been slowly losing the battle, but the war isn't over... I believe in humans and humanity.

       Kids are smarter than we give them credit for. From Lewinsky on I could pretty much see the forest through the trees, even if I didn't wholly understand it. But I was also fortunate from a public education standpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the people raising their kids with all of the above and evangelical religious fanaticism that scare the crap out of me, they're procreating much more than we are. But even some of those kids will wake up and break free.

       I thought it ws the parents job to raise a child, but if parents don't realize the truth (about what's in the food/water, racial diversity, finance etc),
no doubt advertising plays a huge role, not to mention education (sigh, the list goes on)
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's hope some of the next generation will be aware; and not just the elite minority that are being groomed to continue as usual.

       Whatever, man. I'm from Australia and I don't know if that falls under the same category for you, but meh. I'd say that in my country we're pretty OK with understanding what's going on politics. We're not OK with it, and everyone thinks our Prime Minister is a fuck hat because of it, but we get the gist of what's happening, no matter how many A Current Affair episodes channel 9 tries to ram down my throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'd say that the lack of political awareness with "young" Americans would simply chalk up to apathy. I wasn't reading newspapers when I was a teenager because I didn't really care about what was going on politically. I was more concerned with other shit my teenaged brain thought was more important at the time. It's difficult to get kids involved with complex political debates, unless it's SOPA and PIPA which in this case it's bombs away.
