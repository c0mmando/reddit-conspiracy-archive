        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 1800 financial power in France was in the hands of about ten to fifteen banking houses whose founders, in most cases, came from Switzerland in the second half of the eighteenth century. These bankers, all Protestant, were deeply involved in the agitations leading up to the French Revolution. When the revolutionary violence got out of hand, they orchestrated the rise of Napoleon, whom they regarded as the restorer of order. As a reward for their support, Napoleon, in 1800, gave these bankers a monopoly over French finance by giving them control of the new Bank of France.[1]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So were the wars of early American history like the war of 1812, etc.  Don&#39;t forget, the Rothschild family is Jewish descent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixurN0e5oo4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixurN0e5oo4</a></p>

<p>Claims Presented in Video:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1790: Mayer Amschel  Rothschild states, &quot;Let me issue and control a nation&#39;s money and I care not who writes the laws.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>1791: The Rothschilds get &quot;control of a nation&#39;s money,&quot; through Alexander Hamilton (their agent in George Washington&#39;s cabinet) when they set up a central bank in the USA called the First Bank of the United States with a 20 year charter.</p></li>
<li><p>1811: The charter for the Rothschilds Bank of the United States runs out and Congress votes against its renewal.  Nathan Mayer Rothschild is not amused and he states, &quot;Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.&quot;  However the United States stands firm and the charter is not renewed which causes Nathan Mayer Rothschild to issue another threat, &quot;Teach those impudent Americans a lesson. Bring them back to colonial status.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>1812: Backed by Rothschild money, and Nathan Mayer Rothschild&#39;s orders, the British declare war on the United States (War of 1812).  The Rothschild plan was to cause the United States to build up such a debt in fighting this war that they would have to surrender to the Rothschilds and allow the charter for the Rothchild owned First Bank of the United States to be renewed.</p></li>
<li><p>1816: The American Congress passes a bill permitting yet another Rothschild dominated central bank, which gives the Rothschilds control of the American money supply again.  This is called the Second Bank of the United States and is given a 20 year charter.  The British war against America therefore ends with the deaths of thousands of British and American soldiers, but the Rothschilds get their bank.</p></li>
<li><p>1832: President Andrew Jackson (the 7th POTUS from 1829 to 1837) runs the campaign for his second term in office under the slogan, &quot;Jackson And No Bank!&quot;.  This is in reference to his plan to take control of the American money system to benefit the American people, not for the profiteering of the Rothschilds.</p></li>
<li><p>1833: President Andrew Jackson starts removing the government&#39;s deposits from the Rothschild controlled, Second Bank of the United States and instead deposits them into banks directed by democratic bankers.  This causes the Rothschilds to panic and so they do what they do best, contract the money supply causing a depression.  President Jackson knows what they are up to and later states, &quot;You are a den of thieves vipers, and I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God, I will rout you out.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>1835: On January 30, an assassin tries to shoot President Jackson, but miraculously both of the assassin&#39;s pistols misfired. President Jackson would later claim that he knew the Rothschilds were responsible for the attempted assassination.</p></li>
<li><p>1836: Following his years of fighting against the Rothschilds and their central bank in America, President Andrew Jackson finally succeeds in throwing the Rothschild central bank out of America, when the bank&#39;s charter is not renewed.</p></li>
<li><p>1841: President John Tyler (10th POTUS) vetoed the act to renew the charter for the Bank of the United States. He goes on to receive hundreds of letters threatening him with assassination.</p></li>
<li><p>1861: President Abraham Lincoln approaches the big banks in New York to try to obtain loans to support the civil war...  Rothschild offer 24-36%.  Lincoln, pissed, prints own &quot;greenbacks&quot; (debt free money) and declares it legal tender.  Lincoln issues $400+ million and says &quot;We gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they ever had, their own paper money to pay their own debts.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Tsar of Russia backs US in civil war keeping England and France from interfering and helping the South by sending fleet to San Fransisco and New York.</p></li>
<li><p>1881: President Garfield states two weeks before he is assassinated, &quot;Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce... and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>1917: The Rothschilds have the Bolsheviks execute Tsar of Russia even though he had already abdicated.  This is both to get control of the country and an act of revenge for Tsar Alexander I blocking their world government plan in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna, and Tsar Alexander II siding with President Abraham Lincoln in 1864.</p></li>
<li><p>1913: The last and current central bank in America, the Federal Reserve, is set up during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson.</p></li>
<li><p>JFK assassinated by Rothschilds also for revealing control of the nation by foreign bankers and signing Executive order 11110 which returned the power to issue currency to the US Gov&#39;t without going through the Federal Reserve.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>These are mostly false.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence that any Rothschild ever said that. The quote never appeared anywhere <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zqkfAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=RA2-PA6&amp;amp;dq=%22let+us+control+the+money+of+a+country%22">until  1908</a> and is not attributed to a Rothschild until after that.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nonsense. The Rothschild were local to Frankfurt in 1791. They had no operations in other countries then.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>These two items are from a late 20th century hoax. They have absolutely
no connection with the actual events. For one thing, the United States
declared war on Britain, not vice versa!</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>1816: The American Congress passes a bill permitting yet another Rothschild dominated central bank, which gives the Rothschilds control of the American money supply again. This is called the Second Bank of the United States and is given a 20 year charter.

President Jackson knows what they are up to and later states, &quot;You are a den of thieves vipers, and I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God, I will rout you out.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no involvement of the Rothschilds with the second Bank of the
United States until a couple of years <em>after</em> it was de-chartered and
became a state bank. When it was the national bank,
it was <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20087682">associated with Baring</a>,
not Rothschild. Baring later broke off ties with the Bank of the United
States and Rothschild starting doing business with them, which led to
losses for Rothschild when the Bank of the United States failed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1835: On January 30, an assassin tries to shoot President Jackson, but miraculously both of the assassin&#39;s pistols misfired. President Jackson would later claim that he knew the Rothschilds were responsible for the attempted assassination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, he didn&#39;t. He suspected <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xYh2AAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA432&amp;amp;dq=%22senator+Poindexter%22">George Poindexter</a>. The Senate investigated the assassination attempt and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZhHAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;dq=%22richard%20lawrence%22&amp;amp;pg=RA1-PA1">found that no one was involved except for Richard Lawrence.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>1836: Following his years of fighting against the Rothschilds and their central bank in America, President Andrew Jackson finally succeeds in throwing the Rothschild central bank out of America, when the bank&#39;s charter is not renewed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jackson fought against the second Bank of the United States, but he never had anything bad to say about the Rothschilds. In fact, he chose them in 1835 <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VvctAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA193&amp;amp;dq=%22president+has+directed+me+to+say%22">to act as agents for the United States in France for the biggest financial transaction of his presidency.</a></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>1861: President Abraham Lincoln approaches the big banks in New York to try to obtain loans to support the civil war... Rothschild offer 24-36%. Lincoln, pissed, prints own &quot;greenbacks&quot; (debt free money) and declares it legal tender. Lincoln issues $400+ million and says &quot;We gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they ever had, their own paper money to pay their own debts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lincoln failed to get reasonable terms from all bankers. The Rothschilds did very little business in the U.S. then and I&#39;ve never seen any evidence that they ever made an offer. The United States did print greenbacks then, but Lincoln had very little involvement with it. It was mainly congressmen—especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbridge_G._Spaulding">Elbridge Spaulding</a> working with Treasury Secretary Chase. That quote comes from a <a href="http://www.abrahamlincolnassociation.org/Newsletters/2-3.pdf#page=5">hoax created by Edmund Taylor</a> when he tried to get money from Congress. </p>

<p>Also, greenbacks were interest-free, not debt-free.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tsar of Russia backs US in civil war keeping England and France from interfering and helping the South by sending fleet to San Fransisco and New York.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1835544">Not really.</a></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>1881: President Garfield states two weeks before he is assassinated, &quot;Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce... and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Back in 1880, talking about a proposal from the Greenback Party, he said, &quot;It makes the House of Representatives and the Senate, or the caucus of the party which happens to be in the majority, the absolute dictator of the financial and business affairs of this country.&quot;</p>

<p>This later got paraphrased as &quot;Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.&quot; The last part— &quot;and when you realize ...&quot;— is a late 20th century addition.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>1917: The Rothschilds have the Bolsheviks execute Tsar of Russia even though he had already abdicated. This is both to get control of the country and an act of revenge for Tsar Alexander I blocking their world government plan in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna, and Tsar Alexander II siding with President Abraham Lincoln in 1864.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen evidence of <em>any</em> of these things.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>JFK assassinated by Rothschilds also for revealing control of the nation by foreign bankers and signing Executive order 11110 which returned the power to issue currency to the US Gov&#39;t without going through the Federal Reserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is completely the opposite of what happened. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">Executive order 11110</a> was part of JFK&#39;s plan to eliminate silver certificates and replace them with Federal Reserve notes.</p>

<p>Jesuits created Zionism. In fact, Stalin was but a puppet of the Papacy, along with Hitler and a host of other dictators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please do not be fooled.  Napoleon was never controlled by a bank, and he sure as hell did not rise to power with their help.  The French Revolution was brought on by the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment.  Rousseau, Locke and Montesquieu being the most important influences, not from bankers.  The Nobility and Clergy held the benefits during the Old Regime, and the common man was starving.  Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite.  It was no longer acceptable to the masses to go hungry while rich nobles and church members held all the wealth.  </p>

<p>Once Napoleon had made friends with Augustin Robespierre and impressing him with his pro-Republican pamphlet, and his fellow Corsican Salicetti, Napoleon, who had already been trained in military academies, was able to voice his plan to recapture Toulon from the British.  Once his plan worked pretty much flawlessly, he was appointed Brigadier General by the Committee of Public Safety, then he saved Barras on 13 Vendemiaire by blasting the Royalists away with artillery.  Soon after, the Directory was indebted to Napoleon and Napoleon even became engaged to one of Barras&#39; former mistresses, Josephine.  </p>

<p>With his new found fame and fortune he secured for himself command of the Army of Italy.  Once in command, he would go on to defeat 4 commanders of the Holy Roman Empire in succession, capture roughly 200,000 prisoners, and strike deep within the heart of Austria.  With this the War of the First Coalition came to a close and Napoleon had become the most famous General, if not person, in the entire world.  </p>

<p>He would then embark on a campaign to Egypt, to strike at France&#39;s only remaining enemy: Great Britain, who held colonial possessions in the region and, more importantly, India.  Although he was forced back into Egypt from Syria, Napoleon would win battles against the Mamelukes who controlled Egypt, as well as the final, most famous battle of the campaign against the Turks.  So upon hearing from France that a second Coalition had formed to restrain the spread of the Revolution (which was a danger to the established power base in any monarchy), Napoleon had to return, but returned once again as a conquering hero after the battle of Abukir.  He was then recruited into a conspiracy by Sieyes to be the &quot;sword&quot; of their coup.  However it quickly became apparent that they had acquired a master and not a military figurehead.  </p>

<p>Napoleon quickly outmaneuvered his two fellow Consuls and became First Consul of France.  However at this time it became necessary to take to the battlefield once again as Austria and Russia, with British support (especially monetary) were encroaching on France.  Napoleon quickly organized an army of reserves, and fought his way back through Italy, over the alps, against Austria.  His campaign was decent, and Marengo, though a very dicey battle, he would spin with his great public relations skills into a genius victory that he had planned from the outset.  This would help cement his leadership over France and maintain his fame(one of his principal rivals was also a general: Moreau, who would later betray France) along with Hohenlinden, won by Moreau and some of Napoleons future Marshals operating under Napoleon&#39;s orders form Paris.    </p>

<p>It was at this time, as First Consul of France, with a secure hold on the country, that he would implement most of his most famous and celebrated achievements in France, the Napoleonic code, improving French society, and yes, increasing the stability of the Franc (making it the most stable in Europe)by creating the central bank, implementing the modern system of street numbers and protecting and expanding the ideals of the Revolution.  In 1804 a plebiscite would confirm Napoleon as Emperor.  His power always was in the common person, never in the elite.  Fouche and Talleyrand were paramount in his downfall, as well as the betrayal of some of his marshals such as Marmont and Bernadotte.  During the 100 Days Napoleon decided to go with the Notables (read: elite) to return to power, as to go against them meant unleashing the Parisian mob upon them.  Because Napoleon lost Waterloo, Fouche took control of the government as most notables, despite many of them owing their positions to his graces, they were mostly either openly hostile or quietly neutral, ready to save their own heads, and Napoleon was forced into British captivity for the remainder of his days.  </p>

<p>He was helped by knowing the right people in the beginning, politically, but it was his own genius that saw him win their graces with his pamphlet, win Toulon, save the Directory, and become the finest general in history, before finally becoming Emperor.  Don&#39;t dumb it down into some baseless theory, the history is THERE, we have the first hand accounts of events, we know Napoleon&#39;s allies and villains, we know who&#39;s works were falsified and ghost written.  </p>
