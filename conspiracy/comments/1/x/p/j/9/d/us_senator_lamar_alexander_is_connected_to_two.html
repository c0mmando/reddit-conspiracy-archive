       February 11-13, 2014 -- SPECIAL REPORT. Washington, DC (Wayne Madsen Report) Loskarn arrest only a tip of a pedophile network that includes Alexander, other Tennessee politicians
publication date: Feb 10, 2014
      </p>
      <p>
       February 10-13, 2014 -- SPECIAL REPORT. Washington, DC (WMR) Loskarn arrest only a tip of a pedophile network that includes Alexander, other Tennessee politicians
      </p>
      <p>
       The December 11, 2013 arrest by U.S. Postal Inspectors of Senator Lamar Alexander's chief of staff Ryan Loskarn on charges of possession and distribution of child pornography in connection with international law enforcement's Toronto-based Project SPADE, represents only the tip of an iceberg which connects Alexander to a network of Tennessee politicians and businessmen associated with child sex abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loskarn, who was released against the wishes of federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia Mi Yung Park to the custody of his parents in Sykesville, Maryland for being a suspected suicide risk, was found hanging in the basement of his parents' home on January 23. Foregoing an autopsy, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Maryland in Baltimore concluded, based on a mere visual inspection of Loskarn's body, that he had died from self-inflicted hanging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Loskarn's indictment had previously been postponed until February 10, the last day which prosecutors had to bring formal charges, WMR was informed by legal experts that the delay in indicting Loskarn may have been the result of a pending plea agreement. Loskarn, who was identified as a child porn distributor, would have been in a position to identify actual or intended recipients of child pornographic photographs and videos found by postal inspectors in Loskarn's possession, had he lived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loskarn's purported "suicide note," which makes no specific mention of an intention to commit suicide, instead contains an effusive apology to his friends, family, and Senator Alexander. The suicide note has more of a ring of the type of letter drafted by legal counsel to a judge requesting leniency in sentencing, another indication that Loskarn and his attorneys may have been working out a possible plea agreement with Department of Justice prosecutors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bright Horizons and Lamar Alexander
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1998, Massachusetts-based Bright Horizons, a child welfare service company, merged with Corporate Family Solutions, a firm that provided similar services and which was founded in 1987 by Lamar Alexander and Bob Keeshan, who had been known to millions of American children as television's "Captain Kangaroo." The merged company, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, was acquired by Mitt Romney's former firm, Bain Capital, in 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alexander, the Secretary of Education under George H W Bush, has been tied to a network of Tennessee politicians and businessmen associated with government and private companies, including Bright Horizons and Omni Visions, Inc. of Tennessee, as well as state government social service agencies, such as the the Department of Childrens' Services, accused of endangerment and sexual abuse of foster and mentally challenged children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alexander's close GOP associate, Jim Henry, the CEO of Omni Visions, provides services contracted out by the state of Tennessee to developmentally disabled and troubled children. Henry is a close political ally of Tennessee Republican Governor Bill Haslam, as well as Alexander. Omni Visions has been cited in several legal cases for placing children into the foster homes of convicted pedophiles and endangering children by placing them under the care of abusive staff. There are also documented cases of children dying at the hands of Omni Vision care providers.
      </p>
      <p>
       From Lamar Alexander's University of Tennessee to Penn State and Omaha
      </p>
      <p>
       The network of child care providers linked to Alexander is also linked to the University of Tennessee and Penn State University, the latter the nexus for the pedophilia scandal involving former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and his The Second Mile Foundation. Graham Spanier, the former president of Penn State who was fired over the Sandusky scandal, had previously served as chancellor of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. Spanier's close friend was his predecessor as chancellor, Ronald Roskans, a close friend of and adviser to fallen GOP rising star Lawrence King, who operated the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union of Omaha. King was implicated in a major GOP pedophile scandal, known as the "Franklin Cover-up," said to have involved former President George H W Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the links between the University of Tennessee and Penn State is the Downsbrough family. George Downsbrough, Sr., a former head of HRB Singer, a State College, Pennsylvania-based firm that provided state-of-the-art technology to the National Security Agency, donated $3 million to Penn State. His son, Bruce O. Downsbrough, served beginning in 2003 as chief operating officer of the University of Tennessee Foundation, which serves as the fundraising arm of the state university. Lamar Alexander had previously served as president of the University of Tennessee. Downsbrough was installed in his position despite a prior conviction for child molestation. Downsbrough had previously been an executive of the Colorado University Foundation in Boulder, Colorado. He was later charged and convicted in an 1986 case for molesting two underage boys in Boulder. Perhaps due to the Downsbrough family's significant political connections, Downsbrough's law license was merely frozen by the Colorado Supreme Court because it deemed him incapacitated because of an unstated disability.
      </p>
      <p>
       As part of Project SPADE, Downsbrough was arrested in Knoxville, Tennessee in 2012. The same law enforcement operation resulted in Loskarn's arrest. Project SPADE involved the arrest worldwide of individuals found in possession of child pornographic materials distributed by Azov Films of Toronto. The common denominator in the arrests as part of the same operation of two seemingly unrelated men in different parts of the country is their professional association with Lamar Alexander.

       Has someone posted this in r/conspiracy before? Has anyone compared The Franklin Cover Up with the NSA? Why does the NSA have this all-knowing eye, but shit like this repeatedly falls through the cracks (no pun intended).

       Fascinating. A cover-up on the level of Franklin could never happen again, thanks to the internet. Lets hope the floodgates break with this one. It won't stop at just a few Tennessee politicians.

       Read: The Franklin Coverup by John DeCamp (Google 'decamp franklin coverup pdf' and the book is the number 1 hit)

       The Franklin Scandal by Nick Bryant, award winning investigative journalist. Haven't found a pdf online but it is worth buying, half the proceeds go to charity for victims of child abuse.

       February 17-18, 2014 -- Famed pathologist criticizes Maryland's lack of autopsy on Alexander's former CoS
      </p>
      <p>
       Famed pathologist and veteran Allegheny County, Pennsylvania medical examiner Dr. Cyril Wecht has criticized the Chief Medical Examiner for the state of Maryland in Baltimore for not performing an autopsy on Jesse Ryan Loskarn, the former chief of staff for Senator Lamar Alexander. Wecht worked for the same Maryland Chief Medical Examiner's office from 1961 to 1962. Loskarn was found hanging in his parents' basement in Sykesville, Maryland on January 23 after his arrest and subsequent release pending an indictment on charges of possessing and distributing child pornography. As WMR previously reported, the Loskarn case involves a worldwide probe of the Toronto-based Azov Films child pornography ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Maryland chief medical examiner concluded that Loskarn died from a self-inflicted hanging based on a visual inspection of the body but no autopsy was performed. Wecht [right], who has Cyril Wechtserved as a consultant on such high profile deaths as President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Jon Benet Ramsey, Sharon Tate, and Elvis Presley, told a representative of WMR, "I do know that even the best medical examiner offices may not do an autopsy if they believe there is clear cut evidence of suicide. But - - one -- I don’t think that’s a good policy; and -- two -- when there’s anything to pinpoint a suspicious larger issue –- there’s no question that changes the situation. Then, we’ve got to get a good autopsy as part of a good investigation."
      </p>
      <p>
       Another physician told WMR that a mere visual inspection of a body can miss "occult pathology," or concealed injuries, such as hairline fractures or poisoning, not visible unless a full autopsy is performed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operation SPADE, centered on a Toronto police investigation of Azov Films, which maintained an office in Stafford, Virginia and Toronto, has resulted in the resignation of German Social Democratic Party Bundestag member Sebastian Edathy for his alleged possession of child porn and the resignation of Christian Social Union Agriculture and Food Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich for covering up Edathy's involvement in the ring. Edathy served as chairman of the Bundestag committee dealing with Interior Affairs and Friedrich served as Interior Minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's previous Christian Democratic/Free Democratic government. The spread of the Azov Film scandal to Germany threatens to bring down Merkel's shaky Christian Democratic/Social Democratic coalition government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Azov Films scandal involves customers of the child porn website in the United Kingdom, to date, no names of British nationals implicated in the ring have been revealed by British law enforcement officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Loskarn arrest has also implicated Alexander and a network of child services providers in Tennessee. A number of employees of these services have been charged with the physical and sexual abuse of at risk children, including foster children and the mentally retarded. The abuse is also connected to the Tennessee Department of Childrens' Services and its contractor, Omni Visions, Inc. The latter is owned by Jim Henry, a top Republican Party official in Tennessee who is politically close to Governor Bill Haslam and Alexander.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loskarn was not due to be indicted by February 10, an indication that Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Mi Yung Park may have been trying to work out a plea agreement with Loskarn in return for the identification of those to whom he was distributing child porn videos and photographs. Park unsuccessfully argued before U.S. Judge John Facciola that Loskarn should not be released because he was a suicide risk. However, Loskarn attorney Pam Satterfield, who is married to chief judge for the Superior Court for the District of Columbia Lee Satterfield, convinced Facciola that Loskarn was not a suicide risk and could be released to his parents' custody with an electronic anklet brace. It now appears that based on the political connections of the Azov Films bust that Loskarn may have been as much a homicide as a suicide risk.

       I have been following these stories individually. Interesting to see the links. The franklin coverup is one of the most fascinating underreported stories. The world is run by psychopaths and pedophiles. (Not mutually exclusive).
