<p>Wrong.  Vote brigading is against rediquette.  To my knowledge there is not a single instance where Redit says it&#39;s ok to vote brigade.  Try having some respect for the rules.  Also, it makes it impossible to have free spirited discussions on topics when hundreds are organized to do everything in thier power to marginalize it.  That&#39;s what r/conspiratard does.  They are not interested in debate.  They are interested in shutting debate down.</p>

<p>Your response would appear to consist of:  glad they are breaking the rules, just fight fair against that which is unfair...is that about it or am I missing something?</p>

<p>But how do i know YOu aren&#39;t the conspiratard? I&#39;m not getting upvoted, you&#39;re challenging everything I say. You&#39;re requiring me to substantiate claims. How are you different than those you oppose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well for one I&#39;m challenging the positive light you shed on conspiratard subscribers, so right there should probably clue you in to the fact that I&#39;m not one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re requiring me to substantiate claims. How are you different than those you oppose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they require people to substantiate claims and then attack the source or something else when the claims are substantiated. If you were to substantiate your claims I&#39;d assess them based on their merit and give you an honest response. I&#39;ve made my intentions in this sub very clear and I&#39;ve changed my mind on several topics. The post history is there to show it if you care enough. (not challenging you to go over my post history, not worth the time, just pointing out that I have nothing to hide and have changed my mind publicly several times)</p>

<p>If you can provide a sample of a known sub to conspiratard taking any conspiracy theory data and actually analysing it and not just shitting on it for the fact that it&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy&quot; I&#39;d definitely be open to changing my mind.</p>

<p>As it stands though every single experience I&#39;ve had with them was strawmen and ad hominem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude why are you giving this guy any credibility?</p>

<p>He is so obvious it is not even funny, every single reply of his is meant to derail your point and turn the subject in his favor, let me give you a run down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s true, they don&#39;t bug me. Or I didn&#39;t notice because i was able to defend myself properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So his first response to you is an ad hominem claiming that the reason you are never able to debate these people is because you do not have the ability to properly defend your claims.</p>

<p>This is a laughable psychological ploy to trick the reader into thinking you&#39;re not credible, and to trick you into being provoked into generating a response which will give a predetermined outcome wherein you try and defend your ability to debate them, which is exactly what you did.</p>

<p>So since you asked him to defend his assertion that it is your inability to defend yourself which leaves you encountering people who merely mock you, he takes this as an opportunity to further discredit you and try to flip this issue back at you.</p>

<p>He first starts by using hostility in referring to people who &quot;investigate comment histories&quot; as &quot;some of you&quot; which has a negative connotation.</p>

<p>He then tries to play the &quot;I&#39;m so smart&quot; card by defining belief and fact as if you&#39;re an idiot and don&#39;t already know all that.</p>

<p>He then further defends himself as being &quot;open minded and fair&quot; and uses that to close the debate in a condescending manner, like you were really just benefiting him the whole time, he&#39;s the one that learned more and wins the debate ( or so he wants the reader to believe ).</p>

<p>The final part is a follow up to his preparation of &quot;always consider all possibilities&quot; by claiming you could be the conspiratard, and that you&#39;re just like your adversaries there, in an attempt to further marginalize you.</p>

<p>In his next reply to yours, in response to your &quot;positive light&quot; quote he reiterates &quot;conspiritard subscribers have the same right to be here that you and I do.&quot; while completely ignoring the fact that we&#39;re not complaining about anybody who is from there that visits here that follows the rules, see in ignoring that he&#39;s directly derailing the subject and the argument.</p>

<p>He then tries to belittle and dismiss the shill problem by conflating the use of strawmen and ad hominems to only be used by time wasting kids.</p>

<p>I hope I have helped expose the tactics that people like this use to try and discredit and derail users such as yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bans prevent an obstacle to those who wish to attempt to sabotage subreddits through means of account manipulation.</p>

<p>Banning is just one part of what should be a larger system aimed at preventing and discouraging the use of multiple accounts to manipulate a subreddit.</p>

<p>It does not stop malfeasance, but it makes it harder by eliminating accounts, thus narrowing the choice of user names down considerable which forces people who wish to continue to create a plethora of accounts for nefarious purposes to become more creative in forming what looks like an authentic user account.</p>

<p>Bans are pretty damn helpful, but they&#39;re not the final solution nor can they be.</p>

<p>We must engage in more measure to combat the problem of subreddit subversion.</p>

<p>What do you propose we do?</p>
