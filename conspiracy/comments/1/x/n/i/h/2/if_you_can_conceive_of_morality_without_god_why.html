<p>Yes, I understood your point.  But it&#39;s completely incorrect. They were conquered not for their anarchic ways.  But rather for their lag in technology. And the reason for this lag is that the Europeans had much more time in their lands to develop it.</p>

<p>There are inherent limitations to a libertarian, zero-government system. A society that operates like this falls apart if it grows too large, and because it is constrained by size and cohesiveness, it will always be overrun or superceded by a more powerful system. </p>

<p>Ok - and there is a percentage of the population that naturally seeks power <em>anyway</em>. </p>

<p>The Stanford Prison Experiment is valuable but doesn&#39;t really define that power/authority changes basic behavior.</p>

<p>How abouot this, power removes your ability empathize with others.  <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/08/10/210686255/a-sense-of-power-can-do-a-number-on-your-brain">http://www.npr.org/2013/08/10/210686255/a-sense-of-power-can-do-a-number-on-your-brain</a></p>

<p>When the only possible choices are carefully managed by private corporations as an exercise in corporate branding, it doesn&#39;t really count as a free vote.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I am aware of all this, and more.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are not aware of two small books called, &quot;Engineering of Consent&quot; and &quot;Crystallizing Public Opinon.&quot;  These books, written by Sigmund Freud&#39;s nephew, carry the specific template that was used for;</p>

<p>1) The rise of female smoking</p>

<p>2) The popularity and prevalence of smoking in general</p>

<p>3) Pork in the American diet</p>

<p>4) The Guatemalan coup of 1954</p>

<p>5) American fear of &quot;Communism&quot;</p>

<p>These are just some of the specific issues that the author (Edward Bernays) personally worked on.  You can see how ingrained some of these concepts are in our culture.  Yet they were emplaced through the efforts of one single man.</p>

<p>This template was used (not by Bernays!) by Goebbels in Germany to move German public opnion against the Jews, and it is being used today in America by the anti-gun movement, the major pharmaceutical companies, and the war-mongerers against Islam.</p>

<p>&quot;ENGINEERING OF CONSENT&quot;</p>

<p>This is a term Bernays invented.  It defines our national identity, and not one in a thousand understands this.  Bernays believed it was a necessary part of democracy.</p>

<p>What kind of democracy is it, when your every hope and wish is created for you by someone else?</p>

<p>Have you not socialized with people in real life? Do you know what &#39;things like&#39; means? I mean sheesh. You act like you are the only person in the world who has taken psych101 and seen an adam curtis documentary. I&#39;m trying to point out that I&#39;m not only familiar with the concept that power can change and individuals behavior (as you put it), but I&#39;m not disagreeing with it either. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, actually, you can run on the ballot. Yeah, the two big parties are controlled. That&#39;s not news. The abysmal voting record in this country is what keeps the system the way it is, not the other way around. That&#39;s why the try to suppress the vote and effectively limit the options of what you can vote for - because it&#39;s a system. Government isn&#39;t the manifestation of the ills of power and humanity, the ills of humanity are the manifestation of it&#39;s power issues. Government is a system that can amplify the actions of a community, for better or worse. To act as if government is the bad-actor instead of the people is entirely missing the point. It&#39;s also doing a favor for the sociopaths in power. You know, the ones we voted for?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m well aware of Bernays&#39; work pioneering propaganda, or better put, &#39;public relations&#39;. But your assertion doesn&#39;t discount my point. Government did not inherently decide to just push those concepts into the public sphere. Rich people (and the sickos we&#39;ve voted for) decided to pay Bernays to influence the public for their own benefit. I mean this is common sense!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This template was used (not by Bernays!) by Goebbels in Germany to move German public opnion against the Jews, and it is being used today in America by the anti-gun movement, the major pharmaceutical companies, and the war-mongerers against Islam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I&#39;m aware there was a government in Nazi Germany. And yet here I stand today arguing against you to say that the inherent wrongs of civilization aren&#39;t attributable to the concept of government, or even governing, but instead to the sociopaths that enact them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What kind of democracy is it, when your every hope and wish is created for you by someone else?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are confusing democracy with society. I don&#39;t think anyone would describe as Democracy as functional. Perhaps a better argument for you to make would to be analyze the founders and if they really intended to provide for a functioning government, or merely a tool for the power elite to manipulate. Even then, that doesn&#39;t really place government as something inherently wrong. </p>

<p>Or perhaps your time would be better spent pointing these &#39;facts&#39; out to people that <em>don&#39;t</em> know them. You don&#39;t even realize the inherent contradiction in your argument in that if people in power were able to simply exert their will on others there would be no need for Bernays. Instead the public must be convinced. Convinced to buy, convinced to vote. So clearly the will of the people is required. They didn&#39;t compromise the education system in America because an educated public isn&#39;t dangerous. They compromised the education system because informed Americans would not support many of the current actions expressed through our government. They compromised the education system because informed voters are dangerous to them. So to suggest that government isn&#39;t the answer when it&#39;s clear the only fucking slightest chance we have (this is a demonstration of how slim our chances are, and not whatever other point you&#39;d prefer to insert) is really doing the opposition a favor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an induction argument. If there wasn&#39;t a need to suppress the vote and intellect of the population, they wouldn&#39;t be doing it. Do you think it&#39;s <em>just</em> to get people to buy shit? Or is to leave them in a constant state of fear so they are barely capable of thinking past safety in maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they would do any of that if there wasn&#39;t a possibility of an informed public kicking these fuckers out of office. </p>

<p>If you look at the history of the US, and more specifically it&#39;s founding, I think you see that people were very distrusting of government, but at the same time recognized it was a necessity. It&#39;s the healthy mix that seems to be key to moderation. Government has both good and bad capabilities, because of the people that decide what government does. Simply going off one of the either ends isn&#39;t getting us anywhere. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really see the government taking strong steps to stop anarchist movements from forming as I don&#39;t think most people want to live in an anarchist &#39;state&#39; (state of being, not government). The &#39;alternatives&#39; are already compromised in that they can never be true mainstream practices, so therefore the only other option of <em>making our fucking government work</em> must be thwarted at every opportunity. </p>

<p>I see an-caps often making such arguments about currencies and notions like that. These people running the government are fucking serious. They have the largest military and navy to back up their beliefs on how the world should be run. The only way to claw their power back is to use the system that grants it (through our sheer negligence, no doubt) to them in the first place. Another &#39;state&#39; will not compete. They will destroy it because they can. The only chance is for a widespread movement at the foundation of the pyramid. Do I think there is a big chance for this to occur? Not necessarily, but it&#39;s a lot more likely than everyone suddenly becoming an anarchist. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no Leslie Knope, not a huge fan of the government. I just see it as it is, which is a system that works more or less as was prescribed in those old documents. Unfortunately for a long time it&#39;s worked more for <em>them</em> than it has for <em>us</em> but I don&#39;t really see another system where that <em>won&#39;t</em> be true. </p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s just to get people to buy shit? Or is to leave them in a constant state of fear so they are barely capable of thinking past safety in maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs.</p>

<p>I think it is both.  There are cascades of parasites that feed off of both the power and the money.  But I see your point, and fear is certainly a key underpinning to the whole system.  There is a whole &quot;consent of the governed&quot; idea.  There are a lot more of us than there are of them, after all.</p>

<p>If you look at the history of the US, and more specifically it&#39;s founding, I think you see that people were very distrusting of government, but at the same time recognized it was a necessity. </p>

<p>This was the whole Federalist vs. Anti-federalist debate.  The Federalists won, both at the time of the signing of the Constitution, and during the Civil War.  Yet the debate continues, and as the Federal government reaches more and more radical extremes, the intensity of this debate increases.  I believe we are setting up another major test of centrallized Federal control, but this time the Fed is burdened with a welfare state and massive debt.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is accomplished through cultural and social engineering to prevent people from even momentarily entertaining the idea of anarchy as a remote possiblity.  No need to move against anyone when no-one even dreams of the possibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s a lot more likely than everyone suddenly becoming an anarchist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With you all the way on this one.  The evil of anarchy has been imprinted on our minds for generations, from infancy to death.  Most of us simply cannot consider the idea at all, let alone in a positive light.</p>

<p>This is where I see the value of ideological thought experiments such as Open Source (as defined by ESR) and -- dare I say -- Bitcoin.  On the face of it, these movements have nothing to do with anarchy.  Yet they are decentralized, anarchic systems.  Furthermore, if they continue to grow, it leads to a steady erosion of centralized systems.  Open source has taken decades to gain serious traction, but is now making significant inroads on proprietary information systems and even patents.</p>

<p>Bitcoin ... I&#39;m not going to really touch on this one, but I feel that if your idea isn&#39;t attractive enough on its own merit (i.e. without using force to convince people) then it isn&#39;t good enough for people to adopt.  This is what anarchists (and communists, and religious warriors...) through history fail to understand.  But Bitcoin, like the Kingdom of Nri, attracts converts by simply being better.</p>

<p>So the bitcoin argument is really controversial and you probably have a huge lineup of diatribe taking apart every modicum of that idea.  That&#39;s OK, I am very aware that bitcoin as a specific technology has a slim-to-zero chance of survival for many reasons, but if the idea survives, I do think it will mean the end of centralized government as we know it.  It will exist, but it will look very different.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am wrong, but I think the systematic exclusion of poor and underprivileged people from the monetary system is creating a bright opportunity for the introduction of functional, compassionate anarchy.  Not by name, but by compassion and function.</p>

<p>As for government, I do not believe that any system built on premeditated violence against innocents can be moral.  I think that the &quot;good&quot; that government does is always, without fail, outweighed by the bad inflicted on those who do not benefit.  It must, because there is nothing government gives or does that is not first taken by force from others.</p>

<p>The only thing we know is government.  Do any of us know enough about any non-Western alternatives to actually make a judgement on the matter?

<p>Don&#39;t misquote me, I said the government doesn&#39;t bother <em>because people aren&#39;t interested in Anarchy</em>. You are missing my point that it&#39;s the people&#39;s lack of motivation for an anarchic system that explains why you don&#39;t see widespread movements. At least the &#39;temporarily embarrassed millionaire&#39;-esque political philosophies (libertarianism, Ancap, etc) is popular because it speaks towards people&#39;s base needs. Anarchy is the opposite. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Look, I&#39;m into bitcoins too. If you check my posting history you will see that is true. Bitcoin is not an anarchic system. If anything it resembles academia more than not. It most definitely isn&#39;t going to overtake any national currency as a nation would declare war before that happens. The notion that it is anything besides a technically innovative yet risky commodity is nonsense. I don&#39;t really get how you think bitcoin is even as remotely disruptive as you claim. I&#39;m not sure what you know about open source, but linux wouldn&#39;t exist if it wasn&#39;t for the benevolence of a number of corporations. I don&#39;t&#39; think either serve as great examples of decentralized anarchic systems. I mean - how do you see open source tackling proprietary patents? It can&#39;t. Neither are robust as you seem to want to claim. Bitcoin is laughably volatile, I&#39;m long-term bullish, but I don&#39;t see it as you pointed out. Your analysis is a bit much &#39;too the moon&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Bitcoin, like the Kingdom of Nri, attracts converts by simply being better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I think bitcoin&#39;s extreme volatility is it&#39;s main attraction as no one has actually developed an application that leverages bitcoin&#39;s public ledger innovation. The volatility is very attractive because it suggests that one can profit off the volatility if one pays attention. I don&#39;t think the Kingdom of Nri serves as an example of anything besides little-known history. You certainly haven&#39;t gone to the lengths necessary to support your suggestion that it is seeing a come-back or that such a society is even possible in the modern era. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, not everything is so black-and-white. I don&#39;t think bitcoin is going anywhere, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to the moon either. It&#39;s not going to disrupt any strong currency, that&#39;s the reason the military exists, to protect the dollar. Bitcoin&#39;s technically precarious existence isn&#39;t a threat to a system that can buy it billions of times over. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s probably true in places that aren&#39;t America. I&#39;d say the problems in the US are exemplified in the supremely non-functional congress and the legislation it <em>does</em> pass. If there is ever going to be a reason people take to the streets it will because their money is worthless (I assure you bitcoin will not be the cause of such a scenario) or congress bailed the banks out again.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ok, but who ever said government was supremely moral? That isn&#39;t something I ever suggested. I also never suggested that whatever system in place be truly moral. I also never suggested morality was some form of social constant, consistent through any society. This was an interested discussion when I was responding to what you wrote, but it seems more like you are just putting words down <em>at</em> me. Very little of what you&#39;ve written past the first paragraph is a response to notions I put forth. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the point of that paragraph even? Did you remember what you said about the consent of the governed? I&#39;m more than happy to discuss these concepts with you, but it&#39;s not a discussion if you are going to put on the libertarian turtle-shell of &#39;people can&#39;t tax me because I think it is wrong&#39; and government is just bad because I said it is. Frankly, I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t recognize that government can do good that outweighs evil (didn&#39;t know we were weighing things, but whatever). You don&#39;t have to recognize gravity for it to be true. Offering up such tautological weak-sauce isn&#39;t very conversational. When you live in a community that is paid for by taxes, and you don&#39;t pay your taxes, it&#39;s you that is taking from everyone else. If you do not follow the laws then it is you that is committing the act of aggression, surely the state must defend against your actions - that&#39;s the reason for it&#39;s existence. I&#39;m not asking that you live your life by this principle, only that you respect the fact that others <em>do want to</em>. And moreso that if you don&#39;t want to be subjected to this system, you must respect the choice of those that consent to government and take your ideas and enact them somewhere else. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry - I don&#39;t think you ever made the point that there were viable alternatives. You seem to think bitcoin and a civilization that stopped existing over 100 years ago are examples of these things, but they clearly aren&#39;t. I elaborated on that earlier in this post.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think it depends on what you consider the word alternative to mean. One would think an alternative is viable. While I do think there are definite merits to the Native American societal model (really love their feminist ideals), I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s actually an alternative to government. Have you considered that you are asking the wrong questions? As I pointed out earlier, people consent to being governed because they want to live in a society where they aren&#39;t going to get attacked by a bunch of people keen on your ideas, so the alternative would have to actually provide for that safety. As I&#39;ve pointed out numerous times, I don&#39;t see an alternative to that in anything you&#39;ve pointed out. So maybe instead of repeating my question back to me with different phrasing you can actually demonstrate the point that you&#39;ve insisted upon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) Not all centralized systems of government use violence. The Kingdom Of Nri (948-1911) used a centralized system that forbade all forms of violence (yes, ALL forms, including for enforcement/defense/conquest). It functioned for almost 1,000 years and some argue it is experiencing a revival today. Try to even imagine how that would work without looking it up.</p>

<p>Your point: Native Americans were dominated by the Europeans for the simple fact that this is the fate of all people without rulers.</p>

<p>My point: The reasonn the Native Americans were dominated by the Europeans had nothing to do with their form of governance (or lack thereof) and was purely a function of difference in technological development which is completely independent of the presence of rulers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think corporations will regulate themselves, youre far off base.  Also, humans are social animals and will group together for survival, commerce and defense.  Rules (laws) and regulations are needed to keep the antisocial fucks from ruining it for everybody.  Now, if the antisocial fucks make the rules and make themselves immune to breaking said rules, we&#39;ve got a major problem.  That&#39;s the problem we have now, corporations are pulling the strings and have largely corrupted government.  Still, there are some regulations holding them back, the ones these corporations are lobbying heavily against and tearing down.   If you abolish the government and tear down the remaining regulations in one fell swoop, you will see the rise of corporate feudalism: the libertarian wet dream.  Sadly, if our fascist (corporatist) system continues to tear down and corrupt the few remaining regulations as they have done with unions, we will see this corporate feudalism come into fruition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your &quot;own&quot; is not the same as the next guy&#39;s &quot;own&quot;.  How do you think these rat bastards came to be?  Anarchism will only lead to feudalism due to the eventual lawless shitstorm.  There has to be a guideline to protect the weak from the strong and the vicious.  This is the basis of society.  Might makes right, ie &quot;muh guns will keep me safe from gubmint&quot;, is a prepper&#39;s fantasy as Waco proved.  Our govt is corrupt and cant be saved from within, I agree.  What we need is to take out money and the elite influence such as legalized bribes known as &quot;lobbying&quot;.  Police and militarization must be restrained, in all we need to wipe the slate clean and have a govt that follows its own rules because as we have it, corporatism is and has been in charge for far too long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an induction argument. If there wasn&#39;t a need to suppress the vote and intellect of the population, they wouldn&#39;t be doing it. Do you think it&#39;s <em>just</em> to get people to buy shit? Or is to leave them in a constant state of fear so they are barely capable of thinking past safety in maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they would do any of that if there wasn&#39;t a possibility of an informed public kicking these fuckers out of office. </p>

<p>If you look at the history of the US, and more specifically it&#39;s founding, I think you see that people were very distrusting of government, but at the same time recognized it was a necessity. It&#39;s the healthy mix that seems to be key to moderation. Government has both good and bad capabilities, because of the people that decide what government does. Simply going off one of the either ends isn&#39;t getting us anywhere. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really see the government taking strong steps to stop anarchist movements from forming as I don&#39;t think most people want to live in an anarchist &#39;state&#39; (state of being, not government). The &#39;alternatives&#39; are already compromised in that they can never be true mainstream practices, so therefore the only other option of <em>making our fucking government work</em> must be thwarted at every opportunity. </p>

<p>I see an-caps often making such arguments about currencies and notions like that. These people running the government are fucking serious. They have the largest military and navy to back up their beliefs on how the world should be run. The only way to claw their power back is to use the system that grants it (through our sheer negligence, no doubt) to them in the first place. Another &#39;state&#39; will not compete. They will destroy it because they can. The only chance is for a widespread movement at the foundation of the pyramid. Do I think there is a big chance for this to occur? Not necessarily, but it&#39;s a lot more likely than everyone suddenly becoming an anarchist. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no Leslie Knope, not a huge fan of the government. I just see it as it is, which is a system that works more or less as was prescribed in those old documents. Unfortunately for a long time it&#39;s worked more for <em>them</em> than it has for <em>us</em> but I don&#39;t really see another system where that <em>won&#39;t</em> be true. </p>

<p>I think it is both.  There are cascades of parasites that feed off of both the power and the money.  But I see your point, and fear is certainly a key underpinning to the whole system.  There is a whole &quot;consent of the governed&quot; idea.  There are a lot more of us than there are of them, after all.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This was the whole Federalist vs. Anti-federalist debate.  The Federalists won, both at the time of the signing of the Constitution, and during the Civil War.  Yet the debate continues, and as the Federal government reaches more and more radical extremes, the intensity of this debate increases.  I believe we are setting up another major test of centrallized Federal control, but this time the Fed is burdened with a welfare state and massive debt.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is accomplished through cultural and social engineering to prevent people from even momentarily entertaining the idea of anarchy as a remote possiblity.  No need to move against anyone when no-one even dreams of the possibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s a lot more likely than everyone suddenly becoming an anarchist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With you all the way on this one.  The evil of anarchy has been imprinted on our minds for generations, from infancy to death.  Most of us simply cannot consider the idea at all, let alone in a positive light.</p>

<p>This is where I see the value of ideological thought experiments such as Open Source (as defined by ESR) and -- dare I say -- Bitcoin.  On the face of it, these movements have nothing to do with anarchy.  Yet they are decentralized, anarchic systems.  Furthermore, if they continue to grow, it leads to a steady erosion of centralized systems.  Open source has taken decades to gain serious traction, but is now making significant inroads on proprietary information systems and even patents.</p>

<p>Bitcoin ... I&#39;m not going to really touch on this one, but I feel that if your idea isn&#39;t attractive enough on its own merit (i.e. without using force to convince people) then it isn&#39;t good enough for people to adopt.  This is what anarchists (and communists, and religious warriors...) through history fail to understand.  But Bitcoin, like the Kingdom of Nri, attracts converts by simply being better.</p>

<p>So the bitcoin argument is really controversial and you probably have a huge lineup of diatribe taking apart every modicum of that idea.  That&#39;s OK, I am very aware that bitcoin as a specific technology has a slim-to-zero chance of survival for many reasons, but if the idea survives, I do think it will mean the end of centralized government as we know it.  It will exist, but it will look very different.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am wrong, but I think the systematic exclusion of poor and underprivileged people from the monetary system is creating a bright opportunity for the introduction of functional, compassionate anarchy.  Not by name, but by compassion and function.</p>

<p>As for government, I do not believe that any system built on premeditated violence against innocents can be moral.  I think that the &quot;good&quot; that government does is always, without fail, outweighed by the bad inflicted on those who do not benefit.  It must, because there is nothing government gives or does that is not first taken by force from others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately for a long time it&#39;s worked more for them than it has for us but I don&#39;t really see another system where that won&#39;t be true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where I have a passion for alternate systems.  My history and civics books did not discuss alternate systems, but they do exist.  Most of us in our Western-centric view of history have no concept of the possibility.</p>

<p>The only thing we know is government.  Do any of us know enough about any non-Western alternatives to actually make a judgement on the matter?  Or are we simply believing in government by default, because our European ancestors worked so very hard to exploit their technological advantages to wipe out any competing cultures?</p>
