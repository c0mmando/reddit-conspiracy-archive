<p>EDIT- Ok apparently a lot of you have noticed this as well, and have even had threads about it today. I guess I missed a lot while I was at work today. So since we&#39;re all on the same page here, should we call the users out on it, look at the evidence of these things and hear if they have a defense? Or do you guys think that would be a dick move?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want a defense? Why is it a big fucking deal? Everybodies voice deserves to be heard. We are &quot;coming out of the shadows&quot; so we can give an opinion and we are getting bagged on for that for the sole reason we have an account less than a week old. You &quot;non-lurkers&quot; are just a bunch of assholes that think you own this place because you&#39;ve been here longer and can&#39;t stand the fact that theres a few new people who have equally interesting ideas in the way that you so kindly stated &quot;A sub for fictional stories&quot; im torn on whether to call a conspiracy fictional or non-fictional because some theories have been proven, but of course not broadcasted on main-stream media. For your sake we&#39;ll call them fictional stories. Now to my belief a fiction story is what.. fake? Made up? If you change the word fictional into conspiracy then you have a &quot;made up&quot; story that people are trying to prove because they believe it is. If i say something about anything it is not wrong. If somebody posts something that concerns them and they think could be a real thing, they are not wrong. The only person that&#39;s wrong is people like you telling us we&#39;re wrong and that we are disrupting this community. YOU are disrupting this sub by creating a huge conflict on lurkers coming out of the cage. You&#39;re getting everybody to focus on something that is made out to be believed as more important than other current matter. Just how the media and celebrities cover up what Obama is doing to america and other countries. What if i were to say this whole dispute is a conspiracy. You work for the government. You&#39;ve become aware that very important world matters have been brought up in this sub. You are trying to distract us from what the real problem is. For everyone who agrees with this guy, go ahead. It doesn&#39;t concern me whether or not anybody likes what i have to say. You can hate me, just hate me from the shadows. Don&#39;t make this the most important thing in this sub. If this is a sub for goofy stories, then i want to read my goofy stories and be concerned about them and contribute further to them without being harassed. I would like to point one of the most relevant text posts I&#39;ve seen in awhile. Instead of wasting your time on a rebellion against accounts less than a week old, focus more on how a quarter million of us could start a revolution and quite possibly make a huge difference in the world we live in today. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xlgcm/there_are_almost_a_quarter_million_people_on_this/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xlgcm/there_are_almost_a_quarter_million_people_on_this/</a></p>

<p>EDIT: I mean seriously how are you gonna discredit someone trying to contribute to this community, and then go make a whole new post whining about them. How is whining about us not disrupting this sub? We aren&#39;t doing anything wrong, you don&#39;t have to ask if what you&#39;re planning to do would make you a dick. You&#39;re already a dick.</p>

<p>EDIT- And <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xl3el/re_something_huge_going_on_in_china_right_now/">here&#39;s</a> exhibit A. You&#39;ll notice he trolled the shit out of this thread, and me in particular. In fact, I&#39;m rather glad this guy decided to volunteer. He got downvoted to all hell in this thread yesterday. Not to toot my own horn or anything, but I was highly upvoted for all of my responses. At the time I wasn&#39;t sure this guy was a troll, I initially thought he was just a little slow in the head(not being demeaning, I&#39;m being serious). It wasn&#39;t until this morning that I realized what he was doing. Unfortunately, I deleted all of my own comments before I realized this.  </p>

<p>EDIT- Well, I was going to gather up more evidence but since he&#39;s going to make it easy I&#39;ll just do this- See his comments below for Exhibit B and if that&#39;s not enough <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/CodeNameTrue">here&#39;s</a> his profile, that should be a good Exhibit C. When you spend 5 minutes going through that it becomes pretty obvious what&#39;s going on here. Well shit, that was easy. Who&#39;s next??</p>

This sub and other sources has opened my eyes to what the world is really made of, could be made of, and the transition from what it used to be to what it is now. Parroting the narrative?

Dude, i gotta say, that was a compelling argument that convinced me that i was a douchbag lurker. Or maybe not.. If this is what lurking is, i will continue to do so.

    <div class="md"><p>Him creating this in the first place was an attack on users. I have been told too many times already that my account is invalid for its age. Pretty much everything i say, no matter what it is, has been negatively impacted by someone who believes that i shouldn&#39;t be commenting and posting because of it&#39;s age. He posted this and nobody says anything bad about it. What if i was to make a post attacking the regulars? I&#39;m sure it would get downvoted to hell. My comments and posts are getting  downvoted because of silly childish reasons. This is a sub for opinions. I would like for you to stop harassing me. It would mean the better for this sub as a whole. 
EDIT: yeah i called you a dick because you are, i firmly understand thats against the rules, but that&#39;s how far you&#39;ve pushed this situation. If i&#39;m a lurker, let me lurk in peace.</p>

<p>Hey man, this post was not directed to you, but if the shoe fits...! If you believed this was not relevant to you, you&#39;d just ignore it. If someone calls me a fat black woman, I don&#39;t engage them defending myself since I <em>know</em> it&#39;s not true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Maybe i just wasn&#39;t saying things the exact way i meant. I was upset because as i was trying to have an open mind, and it was being denied. Something as simple as that lead all the way to this. I know that things i said weren&#39;t exactly the most productive things, but that&#39;s what came out. I appreciate you&#39;re apology and without a doubt forgive you. You are the first user to welcome me instead of saying im a lurker. That i supposed is basically what i was looking for, to be welcomed here. It just originally took a wrong turn. Thank you for that, that alone is enough for me to drop everything, and continue browsing the sub with an open mind.
EDIT: Although the OP was the main antagonist in my story, i do respect his rep and trustworthiness, i&#39;m sure he&#39;s a good guy. Again, i just things took a wrong turn and got out of hand and i am also to blame for that. So to the OP, I too would like to apologize to you, to both of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can paint it however you want. However, what happened was you attacked me yesterday out of the blue and then continued to do so for hours. You said that that post needed to go to the top and I informed you that that post was not real. You immediately started making up all kinds of bullshit, saying that I said thing that I absolutely did not and being a complete dick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked at your debate with him, but besides that I didn&#39;t find any reasonable suspicion. The way he blindly accepted the premise on the post, urging to be upvoted could more likely be attributed to ignorance and not malice. But of course only time will tell. I just think he deserves the benefit of the doubt. We can&#39;t go treating all new users (debatable, I know) like that because you had an argument. His replies didn&#39;t have the tone or characteristics of a disinformant IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are quite a few comments that are missing in that thread. Some of them are mine, some aren&#39;t. I would like to point out though that I didn&#39;t bring this guy up. He showed up here in this thread of his own accord and opened his own mouth, when he did I merely pointed out that he perfectly fit the description of what dozens of us have been discussing for days now. In fact, I&#39;m still on the fence on what I think of this guy. That is the reason I deleted my comments from the other thread in the first place. Those comments were me very clearly pointing out that the story in the thread was about was fiction and so was the sub it was in. He continued to talk shit to me and accuse me of being a shill. In fact, our very first encounters with each other was him accusing me of being a shill. And I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t care how stupid the person is, I&#39;m not going to put up with someone out of the blue attacking me and calling me names. I don&#39;t necessarily think this guy is a shill, I think he just assumed way too much and came at me like an asshole. I&#39;m ok with that. Shit happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understandable. I just gave my own perspective on the whole situation. You account of the incident is personal so naturally you have more insight. In regards to me, I still have no legitimate reason to suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you know the rules, why did you purposefully break it <strong>first</strong> while accusing another user of the same mistake?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>everything i say is valid no matter how stupid it sounds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I.. what.. huh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s all you guys are saying is that im a dumb lurker because my account is 4 or 5 days old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has nothing to do with account age, it has to do with your activity in the sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were opinions, tell me why i can&#39;t express an opinion without harassment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP created a post expressing his opinion, you called him and everyone else here a dick.</p>

<p>LURK. MOAR.</p>
