       That explains the first 4 downvotes that were early in his comment history. After 12 hours had passed, almost nobody would have seen his comment since it was buried so far down. OP of the brigade thread said he had to search for keywords to find the comment. After that link, he should have had maybe 1 downvote if at all. Instead, he went from -4 to -35.

       You assume the no one sorts by controversial, in which case it would be pretty far up on the list. Not saying everyone does, but that is a possible explanation.

       Nope. Try searching controversial. It's buried no matter what you search for. The only way to find that comment is through the link. Otherwise, you'll have to spend a few hours constantly clicking "more comments," until you finally get to it. It was easy to find at the very beginning when OP of that brigade thread found it by searching for a key word, but it's been buried now for a while and still keeps getting downvoted.

       What's the other explanation here? Maybe they voted on it! Wow that's so hard to believe!

       You're not accounting for the possiblity that people would just naturally see the post as retarded. Yes. They linked to the post. And they all thought it was retarded. The post got viewed more because it was linked to, yes. This is obvious. But it's not like it was getting more upvotes than downvotes PRIOR to being linked to. Because, fact is, the majority of the people that saw it, both before and after the link, found it to be retarded. End of story. It sucks that an important issue was ignored because the poster filled the post with stupid shit that had no factual evidence to back it up, but, hey, it's reddit. What do you expect?

       I don't care about the content of the post. All I care about is that when conspiratard links to a comment, almost every single one of them downvotes that comment, contrary to their claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe me, sort that thread by top or best, and see how long it will take you to load page after page until you see his comment. It will literally take you hours and hours to get halfway there. That means nobody is going to see it other than conspiratard, and thus every downvote comes from them.

      <p>
       I don't care about anything else except that in this case. That is the entire point of this thread.

       LOL so the "too much personal info" is that you know the city I live, in which another 157 thousand people live.
      </p>
      <p>
       And than you assume that I'll click on a link that goes somewhere other than where it says it goes (SUCH A HARD CHECK) and have no firewall protection that would block the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, last but not least, you assume that sites like whois are accurate. If you whois me, you won't even get the right city, bro. It'll show you an internet provider facility quite far from here, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       IP lookup sites aren't actually accurate. If you actually knew anything about net security you would know that. Just sayin'. I've tested those sites myself on dozens upon dozens upon dozens of IP addresses- they will not get you shit. You're lucky to even get the right city.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to make my point- I just whoised myself. It told me I live in Monroe, Oregon. Which is not Eugene, Oregon. Really. Think about what you say when you're trying to make a big point that turns out completely invalid. I learned this shit when I was 12 trolling onemorelevel forums.

       r/conspiratard likes to point out that they don't say to each other, "Hey, lets all go attack this sub." For the most part, that's probably pretty true. They all know not to say that. And they all know they don't have to. Their entire sub's purpose is to do this shit. Simply by linking to these threads they are initiating a brigade. Obviously if there is a link they are going to click it, and obviously if they click it they are going to vote on it. There's no need to say, "Hey, lets attack." It's a given.

       It was a buried comment, buried under 13,000 other comments, 12 hours old and only had negative 4. Not a single human being was likely to see that comment ever again, and magically it received an extra 50 downvotes. I tried searching controversial using his name in the "find" box and couldn't get to it. I clicked "more comments" so many times, then gave up. It's buried no matter what you search for, so the only way to find this comment is by going to
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       and click the link. It the very beginning, when they first linked to it, you only had to click down a few pages in "controversial" and it was there. That's how OP originally found the comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that all of them claim they don't vote on linked comments, yet most of them do.

       im just wondering as an avid r/conspiracy reader since i never visited r/conspiratard I don't think I would post on r/conspiratard if I didn't want to get flamed by people that have no interest in having a healthy discussion.
I mean its right in the title itself conspira tard.
Am I correct? Not saying what their doing is right, just saying you are asking for negativity if you post their expecting that sub to follow truth...

       The comment they brigaded wasn't on
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       . It was on the Bill Gates AMA. What conspirtard does is they link to specific threads or comments in other subs, and then they all vote down on those comments. If their own members flood into those threads, then they also upvote themselves, creating the illusion that most of Reddit shares their opinions (suspicious of the government = retarded).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is called brigading and is against the rules of Reddit, yet the admins are ignoring this. They've banned a few of them for brigading, but those members just create a new account with one letter different and continue the same thing.

       Nope. Try searching controversial. It's buried no matter what you search for. The only way to find that comment is through the link. Otherwise, you'll have to spend a few hours constantly clicking "more comments," until you finally get to it. It was easy to find at the very beginning when OP of that brigade thread found it by searching for a key word, but it's been buried now for a while and still keeps getting downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the other explanation here? Maybe they voted on it! Wow that's so hard to believe!
