   r/conspiracy: Redditors over 30 what are some memories you have of our country from your youth that have drastically changed for the youth of today? I notice when I talk to younger people who grew up post 9/11 that they're unaware of how free we used to be. Maybe it's time to highlight some of those things . | /r/Conspiracy Archive

       I remember the only time you saw police with masks and military weapons was when the news was covering another country. Our police and military were totally separate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The news and invesigative journalism were real things, not just a party line or sound bites. When a story broke, a team of journalists would actually fact check multiple sources and do interviews and undercover work, rather than just accepting the govt/corporate press release as the absolute truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Travelling on a plane was fun, not a pre-arrest scenario. My dad would usually stow about 1/4 of weed in his guitar for personal use. He would ask security not to run it through the x-ray because it was a delicate,rare guitar. No one detained him, or handcuffed him they just said "OK sir".
      </p>
      <p>
       Police rarely killed someone, if they did it was usually a life threatening situation. I'm not saying it was all roses, but they used a lot restraint with mace,guns and batons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think some of the apathy we have is because people have forgotten or don't know what they've lost. Please add to this list if you can.

       No, I've worked for the government since 18, so if martial law was declared and the FIMA camps were setup. I'd be the one in the watch tower preventing you all from leaving. Lately though things have been getting a bit strange.

       Well, funding for the U.S. Government have taken cuts, some organizations have had huge cuts in their yearly budgets (50%+). The odd thing is spending hasn't been cut, it's gone up. So where the hell is all the money going?

       Forgot about gas, in highschool I could buy 4 gallons of gas and a pack of generic smokes for $5-6.00. Wages were also adjusted a little for inflation. But now with however many rounds of QE program we've done, the govt still won't admit there's an inflation issue.

       I remember paying for gas with the change from my ash tray and actually getting a couple of gallons. When I started driving you could find gas in the 99 cent range.
      </p>
      <p>
       Candy bars were 50 or 60 cents for a decent size
20oz pops were 99 cents
McDonalds value meals were 4 bucks or so

       Youngster, when I was your age you could buy a candy bar for five cents, and a really big candy bar for ten cents. Gas was fifty cents a gallon. A dollar bought you a whole meal at McDonalds, and in those days we didn't know McDonalds' food was poison.

       Seriously. I'm right around 30 so stuff wasn't as cheap as it might have been for others, but I remember gas being $0.99. I could play around for a few days on $5 of gas.

       I'm so sad. I felt like a riot grrl in the 90s. Now, I'm up to my eyeballs in student loans and can't find decent work. I'm working on getting into the organic movement, but feel overwhelmed daily, just trying to feed myself and my cat &amp; dog. I can't even imagine what parents must feel like.

       My Chevy Lumina never took more than $12 to fill a 15 gallon tank. I spent more on beer in a week than gas, and
       <em>
        we drove everywhere
       </em>
       . We used to "cruise the strip", at least a dozen cars full of teenagers, every Friday &amp; Saturday night. Then we'd agree on a wooded location to have a bonfire and no one got too out of hand, or neighbors didn't accuse us of trying to burn down a sub-division. We talked politics a lot too, not just about celebrities love/criminal lives.

       In the 70s, you could buy a domestic airline ticket at the airport and board the plane all without even having to show ID.

       I wish I could find it but I have never been able to.  Tom Brokaw interviewed Gorbachev once on TV in the late '80s.  In it, to challenge the Russian system, he pointed out that people could not travel in the Soviet Union without having to show their papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back then in the U.S. a person could get on a plane with a paper ticket and walking through a metal detector and no one ever looked at your ID.  Hell, no one even cared if your name didn't match the ticket.  You could give it to someone else or sell it without restriction.There weren't any internal checkpoints in the U.S. either.  They didn't even have drunk driving checkpoints as that reminded people to much of authoritarian regimes.

       Flying's enjoyability is subjective.  But it's not subjective that there is more invasive and time-consuming personal treatment for flyers in 2014 than there was in the 1970s when I grew up.  Which is what the OP's point was.

       Gas prices have no objective charting-by-year to be found on the Internet.  Someone's keeping that off the search engines.  Gas prices plunged under Clinton.  There's little debate about that.  And it had more to do with OPEC than anybody.

      <p>
       Police abuse statistics by year are not available on any search engine.  Possibly that's by design.  Therefore there is no objective answer to this question.  Police abuse has always been widespread in specific certain poor communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Militarization &amp; lethal capacity of police, however, is entirely different today than it was in 1994.  It would be dishonest to claim otherwise.

       The comment you replied to said that "Prisons were state-run and not operated as a for profit business."

      <p>
       That is a fact.  From the mid-1800s (as early as 1820 in some places) through the late 20th Century, prisons were state-run and not operated as a for-profit business:

       Your example pre-dates state-run prisons, and much like slavery, lynching, Jim Crow, segregation, and other predatory social customs, privatized prisons were outlawed in favor social progress.  Popular support for state-run prisons arose in the widely-held popular belief that the role of prisons should be to
       <em>
        rehabilitate
       </em>
       , not to profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not prisons should be used for profit or social good is up for debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not early U.S. privatized prisons were
       <em>
        replaced with state-run prisons
       </em>
       is not debatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statement "Prisons were state-run and not operated as a for-profit business" is a fact, and to state that privatized prisons once existed, technically,
       <em>
        bears no relevance to the thread topic
       </em>
       "What
       <strong>
        memories from your youth
       </strong>
       have drastically changed?" and simply gives the appearance that you are trolling.

       You don't even know what storage methods they used, and actually, it's not that hard to keep data stored for a long enough time and then get rid of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what old security systems do, they run on a loop of whatever duration, really important to secure facilities usually run their tapes on at least a 24 hour loop.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have the option to set the frame rate, or how many pictures per minute the camera takes so you can fine adjust your record loop for storage concerns so you can record more with less detail ( motion between the frames ) or record less but with more detail ( full motion video ).

       Gas prices have obviously always been on the rise, just like the cost of everything else. Gas prices post 9/11 have tripled - gone up at a much faster rate than previously.

       Rodney King?  Someone videotaped a few cops swing their batons against a guy who was legitimately resisting arrest and a nation was sickened by it.  Compare that to what we callously tolerate today.

       My biggest overarching problem is just the day to day deterioration of my love for my country. Watching the Super Bowl and now the Olympics I don't have the same feeling I had when I see our flag being raised by our athletes or flying across the screen during a commercial. It hits me as propaganda now. I hate that feeling. And I am not that deep into the rabbit hole as you may think. I am probably just at the surface compared to most here. I used to view us as a special nation but now a lot of that feels like a bit of a sham. Yes, before you say it I am going back to my apartment after work today, going to happy hour with my girlfriend and live a very happy existence. I am not unaware of that fact. At the end of the day I simply look at the flag with a different feeling. And that sucks.

       I get what you're saying, I feel the same way. But we used to have more things to proud of (or we were in the dark about a lot of things). We actually made things, anyone who creates feels a sense of pride in their creations. Now we just consume and accumulate debt. Our main industry now seems to be pointless wars against ideologies and ideas.

       Be grateful that you have a thing or two figured out at your age. There are people twice your age who still live in fantasy land, utterly clueless about anything that really matters.

       There are many of us over 30 and those that are younger that are doing just that. For those of us making the changes, it is ever inspiring to meet younger people rising up to a new level. Like attracts like. There are many many younger than I making choices I only imagined. It is inspirational to say the least. As much as I could respond to this post about how much "worse things have become since I was younger"; I'm gonna choose a new approach. Simply to remind others that people are being very proactive, hard working, setting new standards, teaching their children, creating new paradigms and living free lives. Again...like attracts like.

       So many here don't believe in voting, petitions and peaceful assembly though. What REALLY needs to happen is creating an advocacy organization we can trust, and hiring our own lawyers, lobbyists and journalists to expose and work through the corrupt system to overhaul it. Violence is only going to reinforce the
       <em>
        domestic terrorist threat
       </em>
       and give the military the authorization they so desperately want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which reminds me, the armed forces used to be a noble service position, in the general public's opinion. It wasn't all
       <em>
        guns and pussy and country music
       </em>
       ... It was still an honor to serve, even after Vietnam. Something changed before 9/11 though, I guess Desert Storm.

       Voting has been rigged since the instant voting was invented.  Candidates would hand out wine and a voting chip for themselves to the uneducated populous.  They would cast the vote chip that they couldn't even read, and drink their wine.

       I went, as a kid, through the secure area of an airport with a pocket knife. They just checked to ensure that it was within california law (under 3.5 inches or so) and let me through so long as I promised not to get on a plane.

       We were terrified that 1984 could actually happen. We were willing to fight against it.

       Now that it has started to happen it's only mildly surprising that nobody really cares.

       In the book there was no exchange for the loss of privacy and freedom of speech. Thankfully the reality is that we are gladly willing to trade our privacy and freedom of speech for smart phones, video games, and cheap unhealthy food.

       This past Superbowl was the most watched television event in American history. Getting excited about grown men playing with a ball for points is way more important to us now than caring whether or not anyone is putting cameras in our homes to watch our every move.

       Airport security. You used to not be molested. Driving around the country, sometimes they make you pull over and declare citizenship, whereas before you could simply drive around without being bothered for no reason. No worries about being put on a no fly list. Then you have to think about all of the rights we lost, but haven't really affected most people on a large scale yet. The government could simply drive up to your house and legally abduct you without charge or trial. So much of your life is recorded. If all of this stuff happened 20 -30 years ago, there would be outrage. Now it's just 'legal' and most people don't care. I wonder how much further they will go in the next 5-10 years twisting definitions and legalizing tyranny.

       I am not over 30 but have noticed since I was a kid cartoons and movies now have random propaganda mixed into them and are trying to push messages on the audience. All kinds of messages and even a lot of random penises popping up in movies lol what the hell is that about. its not funny! (maybe im just paranoid). New commercials that aren't about the army still have soldiers in them. I saw one for Kay Jewelers and even a dog food commercial and a few others. (recruiting)

       fingerprint scanners for lunches at school. Police have their own offices in schools now and carry guns around and get involved in minor offenses resulting in really young children with criminal records for stuff that they used to just call your parents about. the police in general care less about helping you and care more about making money off of ruining peoples lives.

       For the very old who still remember ...
       <em>
        before Reagan

      <p>
       Not all of these relate directly to freedom, but these are factoids which show how much the U.S. has changed since the 1970s:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gas stations were full-service, and they used to advertise free giveaway items like dinner plates &amp;
         <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Nice-Vintage-NFL-Mobil-Oil-Chicago-Bears-Tall-Drinking-Glass-/400632992111">
          drinking glasses
         </a>
         ... to entice people to come buy gasoline.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There were local "price wars" between gas stations to compete for customers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Until Jimmy Carter de-regulated airlines &amp; made them
         <em>
          more capitalist
         </em>
         (because of what a communist asshole he was),
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_deregulation">
          <em>
           airlines were not allowed to have different prices to the same destination
          </em>
         </a>
         .  Airlines were forced to compete only on services &amp; perks (
         <em>
          "We have lobster" ... "But we have pillows"
         </em>
         ).

        <p>
         All air flights
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflight_smoking">
          had a
          <em>
           SMOKING

          section and a
          <em>
           Non-Smoking section
          </em>
         </a>
         which was utterly asinine, because you could smell the smoke in the non-smoking section.
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_advertising_in_the_United_States#Advertising_boom">
          Doctors &amp; lawyers were

           not

          allowed to advertise
         </a>

         <em>

         Let's not be too nostalgic:  JFK was assassinated in broad-daylight by a "magic bullet"; the press helped to cover it up; the Zapruder film was hidden from the public for a decade; Operation Mockingbird was and still is entirely successful in creating a "mainstream media" that keeps the real questions off the airwaves; CIA cocaine was buried even when a reporter named Gary Webb documented it; Iran-Contra was kept low-key while Clinton's blowjobs were taken seriously as the biggest scandal since Watergate, forget Iran-Contra or BCCI.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On the other hand, the media (due to the public's lack of terror) did not hype

        Also, when opinions were broadcast on television stations (which were still considered "public airwaves" even though licensing was auctioned), any opinion was required to have an "equal-time" opposing opinion, if anyone had one.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This was called
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine">
        "The Fairness Doctrine"
       </a>
       , which was not law, but FCC policy to give opposing viewpoints equal broadcast time.

       Right-wingers now hate and decry this, but they benefitted when the Democratic Party controlled most branches of government (or all branches of government).

      <p>
       Television in the 1970s required "public affairs broadcasting" (usually at late or early hours when most people weren't watching) and citizens were allowed to give speeches (like public-access cable).
      </p>
      <p>
       This was eliminated under Reagan.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no examples of any of these "citizen speeches" on YouTube.

       No fucking cell phones. I was in my 20's when I first saw a cell phone and it was big and needed an antenna. People actually went outside and talked to each other and everything didn't revolve around text messages and phone apps and social horseshit media. It was a better time to be alive....yeah I said it.

       In my teens, there were no cell phones, no computers, no video games, and no cable television. We had two channels and they both signed off around midnight. If you wanted entertainment after that, you read a book or listened to late-night talk shows on the radio. In university we wrote our reports out in longhand, or if we were fancy, we typed them on a typewriter.

       You didn't need a helmet to ride a motorcycle, and to get a motorcycle license all you had to do was ride up and down the block once. Cars had no seatbelts, and no headrests, which means that when you wanted to back up all you needed to do was put your arm across the back of the front seat and turn your head. No restrictions on movement. And cars were big! You could put a couple of full-sized bicycles in the trunk and close the lid.

       There are so many things that are different, but for some reason the thing that always pops in my head is the song "Jeremy" by Pearl Jam. Can you imagine what would happen to Eddie Vedder and the rest of the band if that song came out now? Or what about "Cop Killer"?? Sure, that was a big deal even back then, but what would happen if that was recorded now? Hell, didn't some kid get arrested for rapping about some crazy shit on Youtube in the last year or so?

       Eminem was controversial from the very start. I remember watching the premier of
       <em>
        My Name Is
       </em>
       on MTV, and it was audio and visually censored in parts.

       Stan, Kim, Guilty Conscience.... when it comes to Eminem there is definitely a a whole slew of songs that are over the top violent. But Jeremy is always the one that I think about, mainly because it is straight up a song about a kid going to school and shooting it up. In this post-Sandy Hook America I just think that would be something our government would not allow.

       is a link to that kid getting arrested for his youtube rap. I would rank the violent content as about as intense as Eminem. He was facing up to 20 years for that.

       Wow, you are correct. According to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_(song)">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_(song)
       </a>
       the unedited video showed him putting the gun in his mouth. However, the way the edited video was cut made many people (including myself) believe that he had killed his classmates. Also, the lyrics about his drawing with "arms raised in a V, the dead lay in pools of maroon below" was another reason I thought this. Thanks, I'm a huge fan of the 90's Seattle scene, yet I never knew this.

       They were 18 and okay, I'm 24 but I can say yeah you don't magically get any smarter at adulthood but taking responsibility for your actions (uploading it for all to see) is also a part of adulthood. Not that I think he should have been arrested, youtube was practically his record label they could have just dropped him and his videos.

       No, but seriously, just playing outside in the neighborhood with all the other kids without the fear that something terrible might happen. Common sense was a thing. Irrational fears didn't overwhelm everything else. And the news had a light-hearted story every once in a while.

       You could find someone in china town, in NYC, to sell a bunch of high school kids from NJ the equivalent of 2 sticks of dynamite.....while on a school funded field trip to the city.  Pretty sure that doesn't happen anymore, and if it does the stakes are much higher for all involved.

       28 about to be 29. I hope that counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smoking indoors. The mall, theatres. I dont even smoke anymore, I think part of the reason why is because they stopped letting us smoke at leisure. I still have no issue with people smoking though, fuck, its their choice, and its my choice to go places where I know people smoke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fights. This may have been only my school, but we were allowed to fight. Not on school (unless it was in a tech class, they would take us into the welding room and let us go at it) But after school, at the park, whatever. It was not a criminal offense to fight back then. No one called the cops. You fought, you either won, or you got beat up. If you got beat up, you didn't call the cops, you just lost a fight. My youngest brother was 4 years younger than me. Apparently, now, same school if you get in a fight, outside of school, even over summer vacation you were reprimanded for it in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops. Security clearance at school. Pre 9/11 we were allowed to leave as Juniors and Seniors at my school during lunch break. Kids would eat outside no matter which grade. No hall monitors. Post 9/11, maybe two weeks afterwards. 8 full time hall monitors, walkie talkies, clipboards. Metal detectors at the doors. Dogs started sweeping the halls randomly twice a week searching for drugs. They even had parking lot security patrolling the lots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cellphones came in around my Junior year, but nobody wanted to have them. It was generally so kids could call their parents for rides for things, checking in etc. Along with cell phones, no one would text, I remember texting my friend during class when I first noticed the mms section of the phone and didn't know what it was. He asked me to never do it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside of that, the t.v. shows to me seem to be hugely different. I am sure you've heard the bitching. History channel was basically documentaries, that were fucking awesome. Learning channel had dinosaurs and shit. Animal planet was a bunch of steve irwin and really old docs on single animals. But the biggest difference would be commercials and how they broad casted products. The frothy emotional appeal, I believe it started with the Just do it campaign (which was much before my time) But it picked up steam quickly. All of the sudden commercials stopped being about showing what the product was, instead they started showing you a way you can feel if you only had this product. However, that frothy emotional appeal is in all of our media now and its gotten so dumbed down its ridiculous. They dont even attempt to act out scenes anymore, they just cue the music, slow the scene down and thats it. Its awful.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Ninja edit: I'd also like to add. Stopping by was a thing. You could stop by someones house, and people would stop by your house. Out of the blue a random friend or family would just show up, you would invite them to eat dinner, watch t.v., or join you with what you are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, dating, or friends in general. Getting out of your vehicle, shaking the hand of the parents of the girl you are taking out on a date. Picking a friend up to do something, getting out of your car, knocking on the door and speaking with your friends parent/family member asking for said friend.

        The Disappearing Middle
       </p>
       <p>
        When I was a teenager growing up on Long Island, one of my favorite excursions was a trip to see the great Gilded Age mansions of the North Shore. Those mansions weren't just pieces of architectural history. They were monuments to a bygone social era, one in which the rich could afford the armies of servants needed to maintain a house the size of a European palace. By the time I saw them, of course, that era was long past. Almost none of the Long Island mansions were still private residences. Those that hadn't been turned into museums were occupied by nursing homes or private schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         For the America I grew up in -- the America of the 1950's and 1960's -- was a middle-class society, both in reality and in feel.
        </strong>
        The vast income and wealth inequalities of the Gilded Age had disappeared. Yes, of course, there was the poverty of the underclass -- but the conventional wisdom of the time viewed that as a social rather than an economic problem. Yes, of course, some wealthy businessmen and heirs to large fortunes lived far better than the average American.  But they weren't rich the way the robber barons who built the mansions had been rich, and there weren't that many of them. The days when plutocrats were a force to be reckoned with in American society, economically or politically, seemed long past.
       </p>
       <p>
        Daily experience confirmed the sense of a fairly equal society. The economic disparities you were conscious of were quite muted.
        <strong>
         Highly educated professionals -- middle managers, college teachers, even lawyers -- often claimed that they earned less than unionized blue-collar workers.
        </strong>
        Those considered very well-off lived in split-levels, had a housecleaner come in once a week and took summer vacations in Europe.  But they sent their kids to public schools and drove themselves to work, just like everyone else.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that was long ago. The middle-class America of my youth was another country.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are now living in a new Gilded Age, as extravagant as the original.

       Growing up in the 80's, i remember going on picnics with my uncle to the cotton fields across the street from the landing strip at Luke AFB in Phoenix, AZ(Litchfield, actually). We would spend Saturday afternoons watching fighter jets going on training flights all afternoon, not ever encountering any resistance. We were separated from the base only by a chain linked fence, so had the perfect vantage point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, i tried to do this with my sons. Within 10 minutes of us parking, we were approached by armed MPs, advising us that we weren't allowed to be there, and that we could face legal trouble if we didn't leave immediately. They were polite, but firm, even after i explained our intentions. It was a sad realization that i couldn't share what i considered a wonderful experience with my sons.

       That's what social conditioning is all about. The elite doesn't care about we old people (by old, I mean, older than 30). It has control of the schools and what is taught there, and it is brainwashing children to accept its mantra of a police state for their own protection. Look at those two young white men who were beaten by the gang of black midgets in Texas. They didn't even
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to fight back. It never even
       <em>
        occured
       </em>
       to them to take any action to defend themselves. That's what the elite want to turn every white person into, and they are well on their way.

       I like to call it the shit factor.  You and your buddies got called and called each other the worst names we could think of.  IT didn't matter, it was only words.  Back then it was your actions that counted.  If you got bagged on back then you would just be like "yea, that's a good one" now you complain to the thought police.
  Now it's just racist or you're called out for sensitivity training because someone is offended, or even worse, someone is offended for another group that they themselves are not a member.  In todays society we have become so prickly that we can even fuck around and make a good, funny joke without being labeled a racist homophobia who is only a hater.  It's really out of control.  So much so that today, its the words that hurt everyone and the original rhyme is now a fossil or unheard of and certainly not practiced.

       That is nothing but propaganda that they try to shove down our throats to short circuit the comparisons such as these. The reason we look at yesteryear fondly is that we had more freedom, better health and human dignity.

       I'm 47. During the 90s, I had a job where I flew a lot. You could get to the airport with 30 minutes to spare and make your flight. I took the occasional red-eye and they were so empty everyone got a row to themselves, and you were given a blanket and a pillow and encouraged to stretch out across all three seats and sleep the whole time. Two years ago I took a red-eye and it was wall-to-wall people. It was extremely rare to have a "very full flight"; now they say that every single time I board. You got a meal for every flight -- which is actually kind of weird to even think about now, because all anyone ever did was complain about airplane food. It's weird to me that that used to be part of the process, filling out the kind of meal you wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1988, I flew to Germany and remember being shocked at the security when we arrived (they had rifles, too). Same trip, flew back with a box at my feet full of wine bottles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't feel as overwhelmed by continuous bad news, and I think that's more due to the endless availability of every news source worldwide than it would be to my youthful energy back in the day. In the early 2000s when political blogs took off, I gorged myself on politics every day. Recently I've cut back a lot on my reading of it because you start to feel like there's nothing good going on in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could plead innocent to things back then -- how could we have known? No one knew what was happening! -- when news of a genocide trickled in. Now we have Google Earth showing us concentration camps in North Korea and we are all doing nothing. It's depressing.

       BB and pellet guns were common Christmas presents for boys.  Boys in the neighborhood liked making bombs out of margarine containers and gunpowder and such.  Nobody had cell phones and there were no surveillance cameras.  If you weren't near a phone you could not communicate with people.  If you heard something on the radio you liked but they didn't say who did it you may never find it unless it was popular enough to play again.  If you wanted to hear music you had to hunt it down in a record store and you had to buy a single or the album to hear it.  If you wanted to watch a movie you had to go to a movie theater.  Later you had to buy or a rent a VHS player and rent the movie you wanted to see.  There was a lot more empty space where nature just existed without development.  There were far less police and they had far less gear.  They also tended to be more mellow, part of the community and not like military like they are now, machine-like.  If you were gay or anything anyone found different you were far likelier to be assaulted.  You rode bikes, played with other kids. There were no video games, computers, or internet.  If you wanted to learn about something you had to buy books or go to the library and you were limited by whatever happened to be in your town, just like the music.  If you wanted something else you might find a catalog and order from far away with a check you may or may not ever get it but if you did it would be months away.

       I like how you phrase all that to make it seem as if it is a bad thing. It was wonderful. People learned to rely on themselves and each other and yes you got used to disappointment and you learned patience. It made for better people in the end.

       It's important to understand these changes in our personal lives and our communities as part of a much larger sociopolitical and economic trend, which consists of a rise of the financial elite and the postwar expansion of rightwing extremism in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gradual spread of paranoia, absolutism, and authoritarianism (and most recently rabid nationalism) has largely come from the growth of the MIC/PIC/Intelligence/LEO/security trusts. Which as we know developed rapidly post Second World War and expanded even further after the Vietnam War to strengthen government powers and crush dissenting voices, and even more so after 9/11 in order to further cement and condition public tolerance and support for the dominance of the police state, the MIC, and an incalculably wasteful Interventionist foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The economic development of the US has been deliberately stunted in order to justify theft by corporations and government, to create fear, keep the population exhausted, drugged up, and over worked, and to boost enlistment and support for the MIC, and to encourage escapism, among many other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The constant, relentless fearmongering against everyone and everything, (which is largely a product of the Cold War of which the War on Terror is merely an extension of) has been the most effective tool used by the elite to justify the consolidation of wealth, expansion of extremism, authoritarianism, Interventionist foreign policy, and government/corporate oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a manufactured reaction to this, a new counter culture has arisen of the escapist consumer that seeks to avoid involvement in politics and to spend what little free time and lifespan they have left self-gratifying in blissful ignorance. This behavior is extremely pronounced in Millenials as many parents sought to shelter and coddle their children in the post 9/11 world.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for myself, I remember when gas was 95 cents in 2000. You could go anywhere and get a decent paying job with little to no education or skill set to start. The police in my area of the country would be more likely to actually help people rather than harass/assault them. The cost of living was more affordable. People could travel about more freely without worrying of being questioned or detained. Air travel was far more enjoyable and affordable. Employers actually offered benefits. Concern for child welfare wasn't extreme and overprotective. People by and large were more helpful, open, and trusting of each other.

       Just to play "Devil's Advocate" here...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am 37.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was a kid it was at the height of the Bloods / Crips / Crack epidemic and we were not allowed to play outside after dark and my parents kept some serious tabs on us.  So, the "We could play outside!" thing might be true in certain places, but it did exist "back in the good ole days" as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I was born, J. Edgar Hoover did have a lot of initiatives out there (Cointelpro, etc.) that did pretty much have a lot of police and federal agents kill and silence, etc. a lot of people.  That's not new.  I guess it's just more "accepted."
      </p>
      <p>
       We did not have even a remote understanding of HIV/AIDS when it hit the news.  When Rock Hudson and Freddie Mercury died, it freaked out everyone, and a LOT of people had, what most people would consider today, the most ridiculous paranoia about the disease.  I do realize that this was ignorance / lack of information because science did not know either, but again...  the world was not "magically" rosy back in the late 80's / early 90's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, you could go to the gate to meet people at the airport.  You still would get arrested if you joked about bombs.  There were terrorist hijackings.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was a very young kid (Elementary School) the government portrayed and many people felt about the USSR close to how the government portrays and how people feel about Middle Eastern "Terrorists."  In fact, in WWF (Now WWE) Wrestling, 2 of the most infamous "Villains" were Nikolai Volkov and The Iron Shiek.  (USSR &amp; Iran)  (TOTAL side note, The Iron Shiek's Twitter feed is hysterical)  The USSR and the USA were HUGE rivals at everything - this was a big deal in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The news was not as "Cable TV" heavy as it is now, but Wolf Blitzer was indeed on CNN.  "If it bleeds, it leads," was pretty much still like it is today... especially in terms of gang and drug violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran contra hearings.

      <p>
       A lot of the posts here are very interesting and true.  I do remember them.  However, there have always been propaganda agendas and things "to be terrified of."

       reading this thread has depressed me. the euphemism that rings in my head as i ponder all this stuff is how do you boil a frog? you don't throw him in boiling water, he'd jump out. you throw him in cold water and turn up the temp very very slowly…

       one personal tale:i started grad school in manhattan in '98. pre 9/11 you could walk into any college/university in nyc by showing your ID and use their library (finding esoteric journals at that time was a bitch). post 9/11 you needed paper work, had to make phone calls, etc. etc. at the time it was crazy frustrating, but looking back it's just one more injustice in an avalanche of lost freedoms...

      <p>
       I can't believe how jaded and unbelieving I've become.  It's not just due to government propaganda either, since as many lies are told by anti-government provocateurs as by the government themselves, so I just don't know what to believe any more.  I hear a story and chase that for a while believing, or wanting to believe.  Then someone debunks that story, then the debunker gets debunked...ad nauseum...

       Wal-Mart used to brag about how their products were "Made in the USA." Gasoline was about $1.20 per gallon. Colleges were affordable, and you could actually work your way through college. You'd see people reading books instead of looking at little screens. The USA had the tallest buildings in the world. Flying on planes didn't seem like going into East Berlin. Several pounds of meat and cheese cost less than $10.

       I grew up in Monterey Califiornia, just a couple of miles from Fort Ord, then home to the Army's 7th Infantry (Light) Division and the Naval Post Graduate School. Everyone living there knew for sure that in any nuclear war we would be incinerated by a Russian ICBM. In elementary school we did those ridiculous atom bomb drills where we go under our desks and covered our necks with our hands - as if that would do a damn thing.

       My experience was similar but not quite the same out in the sticks because they tried to make us do the drills and we laughed at them. No actual repercussions from it either, pissed off teacher sometimes, though often they secretly agreed that it was stupid. The principle might get involved, but it was still just a "talking to". Eventually parents might even be called, but when the parents told them not to be ridiculous it ended there.

       Today if you don't do as your masters tell you the police will be called and you'll be tazed into compliance. So yes, that is a good example of the freedoms we have lost, the freedom to disagree.

       Some comments in this touched on how prices for thing have gotten out of hand, but what about the whole legal aspect of doing business? Contracts, intellectual property &amp; patent law, EULA's &amp; software licensing, insurance mandates. Companies force  consumers to do business on their terms. Don't like one clause in the contract? Too bad, either sign it or don't use our product. Thing is that the same clause becomes pretty much industry standard; competition feels more and more like collusion these days. To me it can't just be coincidence. Everyone's afraid of litigation or legal action.
