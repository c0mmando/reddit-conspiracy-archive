       Lots of people, because they can easily find articles from those sites that fit their narrative. If someone has already reached a conclusion without rationalizing it (ie Fukushima radiation is literally killing tons of Americans and being covered up by the MSM), Infowars and their circlejerk is the place they can go to read about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we can both name times when CNN or another MSM has embarrassed themselves by rushing forward with a headline before getting all the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infowars and their ilk do not seem to care too much about having inaccuracies or predictions that never come true. (ie Alex Jones claiming that the US will crash on whatever date. Date passes, nothing happens, and none of the Infowars audience will call him out on it - they just move on to the next prediction. Those who do call him out on fearmongering, misleading, or complete lies are not the type to keep going to Infowars / partner sites.)

       I'm no fan of Infowars or Alex Jones. AJ tends to have ulterior motives, primarily involving profits and sensationalism. That said, while some the content from Infowars is purely speculative in nature and with some being opinion pieces/editorials, there is a plethora of content taken simply taken from other (credible) sources.

       well I will say this infowars is the least credible
       <strong>
        IMO
       </strong>
       Now natural news does actually have some legit articles but I am not saying that their is not some unfactual information also. But the Mercola guy...How can I put this? One article in particular stands out in my mind. If you or anyone else puts in "distilled water health benefits" into google. The first thing you will notice is "early death comes from drinking distilled water" Now I promise you, "grain of salt please" that is bunk. I have researched that stuff to no end. I drink it every single day and have ZERO problems "anecdotal" at best I know, but this article right here makes me REALLY wonder about Mercola. My real opinion on him is he is getting older and maybe is not at his best when addressing certain issues. He means well, but does not have a full grasp on his profession. I really would like a counter argument on the Mercola just because I am curious of what others think.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if memory serves, not to long ago AJ released documents of Washington state setting up a "spy grid". in short they were forced to respond and initially lied saying they will deactivate them, before being pushed enough that they did. Im having trouble finding a link but im looking.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT, it was Seattle, not Washington State. would explain why i was having such a hard time finding it haha;

       I dont usually go to Natural news, as its usually the same thing ive already been reading all day, just simply coated another flavor; never heard of Mercola.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the 2 links posted "360 surveillance" and "snowden level". Obvious sensationalism, but that doesnt take away from the fact that the surveillance presented from the blimps OR the fact that he had acquired documents... "snowden level" or not.

       I'll use anything that can be backed up by facts. Some of the sights you've mentioned suck, but that doesn't mean all the stories are blatantly false. With any media, alternative or otherwise you need to do some research before reaching a conclusion.

       What are your strategies for evaluating the source and the information? How do you disentangle the distortions and the facts? For example, Infowars uses a whole lot of fallacies and loaded language to deliver the material.

       If it can't be verified from multiple sources I'm going to be wary. Or if it's too outlandish(lizard people). I also look at the track record of the journalist...if they've lied or exaggerated in the past I tend to be more dismissive of their work. With something like natural news it's a little easier to look at white papers of researchers and read published works that deal with whatever health/science theory is being put forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and at least hear them out. I think sometimes there's still a grain of truth behind what people say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also try to look past the bias of the author. If I'm reading on stevequayle or raider's news update I expect the author to favor or examine things through the eyes of a religious person, if it's MSN I know it's slanted towards the democrats just like fox favors republican talking points. I try to weed out the opinions and focus on facts or trying to verify those facts.

       What about issues such as marketing in the same place? For example, Natural News and Mercola often raise fears about some "mainstream" medicine, but then sell the "alternative" right next to the article. Is this a factor that weighs into the evaluation?

       Not really for me, I think all journalism sells out to advertisers. With the web most of it is triggered by keywords/content so I expect the ads to be related to the subject. Did you see the add for the Pure Heroine song under the funeral coverage of the actor that just died from a heroine overdose? I don't think it's intentional, just the adserver.
      </p>
      <p>
       A big eye opener for me was working in a hospital. When we sponsored the "sky cam" the local news station that owned that camera was constantly doing emerging tech,human interest,and other stories about us. When we decided not to sponsor it one year, 90% of the medical news coverage started to focus on the other hospital in town. We upgraded radiology and ER equipment....media silence...the hospital across town buys the same stuff 8months later and gets a 20minute segment. They only upgraded because the doctors who worked out of both hospitals complained about their stuff not meeting the current standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is a pretty common scenario.

       I ignore them because I expect them. Another example the local paper just covered a guy who was in a budweiser commercial, he's from 400miles away from their subscribers. The night before a local guy was on conan. If you read this paper, a large portion of their ads are for stores that sell beer. It doesn't mean the story was untrue, it just means they based their coverage on getting an advertising client's brand on the frontpage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't think it's intentional.I ran a retail website and would often have ads for competitors pop in the sidebars or banners. It's a pain in the ass to go in and manually block every keyword.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a conflict of interest if the article says...you should use brand XYZ without disclosing financial ties to XYZ.

       No, but doesn't trust work in degrees? If a website is notorious for spreading false information, why would we continue trusting it? Further, should we use the source as support during debates?
      </p>
      <p>
       I frequently have people use these sources as if they hold some weight in a discussion. Personally, I'd use  different source even if they were talking about the same issue.

       It's up to the individual, not the hivemind. I wouldn't use VT as a source when they've gone on record saying 80% of their stories are fiction. But I also wouldn't use FOX or MSN either.

       Yes, I know, but I think it was a point worth challenging. I don't think we can simplify the issue into being all about the money. Money is influential, yet there are people who do try to do a good job at what they do. Many journalists put their ideals above making a quick buck.

       A valid point. Nonetheless, profits remain a top priority for most news outlets, at times for reasons of practically, in other instances out of sheer greed, creating conflicts of interest in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most news sources will indeed pander to their advertisers, adjust their reporting so not to upset their sources of revenue, and shamelessly pander to their audience using sensationalism, at times using outright deception to solely get more viewers, to sell more products, etc.

       For sure, this is something I've studied quite thoroughly in university. I know there's conflicts of interest in media, politics, science, and so on; however, we must be careful not to use it as a thought-terminating cliche.

       For example, different businesses decide how to make their money. I have more mistrust of Natural News because they monger fear about vaccines, but then sell the "alternatives" in an ad next to the article. Other news orgs don't need to create fear to push sales.

       I'm simply a curious person. I spend a lot of time discussing issues such as skepticism and science communication. Communicating science means better understanding why people trust certain sources over others, even when those sources are notoriously bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like many people here, I'm concerned with manipulation in the media, so try to understand the psychology behind media consumption and perhaps find ways to counter it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply, I don't get far by simply telling someone that sites such as Natural News or Infowars are terrible, instead I need to connect to the reasons why they trust them in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, no, no grad project unless we're talking about a lifelong grad project of encouraging society to become more skeptical.

       No worries, I can understand the suspicion. By running a forum like
       <a href="/r/GMOSF">
        /r/GMOSF
       </a>
       and by being a skeptic, I often see myself referenced around the net with accusations such as "shill", so I know what it's like to feel as if vultures are circling waiting for a weakness. So keep on being skeptical!

       I ignore them because I expect them. Another example the local paper just covered a guy who was in a budweiser commercial, he's from 400miles away from their subscribers. The night before a local guy was on conan. If you read this paper, a large portion of their ads are for stores that sell beer. It doesn't mean the story was untrue, it just means they based their coverage on getting an advertising client's brand on the frontpage.

       I also don't think it's intentional.I ran a retail website and would often have ads for competitors pop in the sidebars or banners. It's a pain in the ass to go in and manually block every keyword.

       It's a conflict of interest if the article says...you should use brand XYZ without disclosing financial ties to XYZ.

       Haha, yeah, I try to stay away from meme type pictures, but I really like that skeptical cat. It's better than what I wrote.
