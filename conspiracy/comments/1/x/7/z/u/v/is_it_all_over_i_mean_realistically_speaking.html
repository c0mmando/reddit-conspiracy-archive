       I'm not a huge conspiracy type of guy... as in I don't think most conspiracies are super strategic. I think they generally are born out of simple greed and screwing over one group for another in exchange for financial/power rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
       So within that context, I have to wonder if we've long ago passed the Rubicon. It seems as though no one is out there working to make the world a better place. The West now feels like how we would have described Russia 25 years ago (corrupt politicians, shady businesses, poor treatment of the working class, even worse treatment of the poor, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of our "lifespan" as in the next 50 years, it looks like all that's on the horizon is more of the same. It would take massive radical reform to fix a system as broken as this one has become... and there isn't even any willpower to fix it a little, much less radically.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the remainder of most of our lives are we basically looking at world that will continue to get worse and worse?

       What boggles my mind is that from 2008-2012 the

       I mean, how come this is not considered a national crisis... or at least reflective of a nation in crisis? It's safe to say that people are literally dying as a result of the crash in 2008 (and those numbers continue to go up, not down).

       Really? I know the labor participation rate is about 62%. I should do some research into the stats on suicide, homelessness, etc.  - you know the 'I've lost everything and have nothing' statistics. I wonder how those have grown.

       To add to that, they're due to cut EBT, snap and welfare benefits again, raise tuition (like they do every fucking year) while giving out billions in no-bid defense / security contracts and we're all still in the dark about the actual wage stagnation statistics and what little information we have isn't being paired with inflation and taxation statistics.

       I agree, There are alternatives but the degradation of the biosphere and more specifically the oceans suggests to me that there is no real way of sustaining a 7/8+ billion population without major changes within our own nature and  collective activities. We have become arrogant.

       I fail to understand why TPTB have let this happen without an alternative available to them. Why kill the golden goose??

       We are in trouble. Society is falling apart at the seams, moral standards are dropping. Our environment is in free-fall and we still live under a finite based resource system. Total collapse or not, we are going to face huge problems over the next 20 years if we do not change, or if advanced technology doesn't offer us an alternative to the current way of us going about business on Earth.

       Ya, that's how I see is also. As demands increase and resources decreases and the need for labor decreases, poverty will become the norm for most people. And so drug use, suicide, health problems, all these things will increase as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rich will isolate themselves from it (as they are currently doing... notice how not a single uber rich person has stepped up to the plate in any significant way over the past 5 years).
      </p>

       The only thing I don't get is how we don't see this crisis as already here,  in its infant stages. Instead we keep thinking this is something that will appear in 5, 10 or 20 years. I think it's already here.

       Things got this far because of fossil fuel, and in my opinion puts us out of sync with nature and what she can support. Even if energy is adressed, what about food and water? The rate of loss in biodiversity is staggering.

       Unfortunately it's going to get progressively worse at an alarming escalation before we as a nation mentally abolish all artificial devision between the people and unite against this plutocracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've never as a species experienced this, sure there's been brutal dictatorships, genocide and mental/physical oppression throughout history but we've never in our wildest imagination envisioned a global and faceless dictator controlled by corporations and globalists. What's truly horrifying is not a single individual can comprehend or imagine what brutality this faceless dictator is truly capable of when faced with loss of power and profit. If they're willing to kill millions to create profit they're more than willing to kill millions to protect preexisting profits.

       This absurd notion that the US population can singlehandedly overthrow the most truly awe-inspiring and technologically advanced military our species has ever known is a complete fallacy and extremely dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once people wake up, peaceful protest and a national general strike is the only way to avoid unimaginable bloodshed. They have the technology to decimate the US population with or without military personal. We would need an absolute boycott of our military and foreign assistance is absolutely a necessity. A couple thousand AR's does nothing against an equal number of stealth drones and armored vehicles.

       I don't know about you, but the people in the military that I know aren't in it to keep Angelina Jolie and Bill Gates safe and comfortable, they're in it to keep their friends and family safe. That's where their true loyalty is.

       The question though is how do you starve the beast? That's why I was asking "Is it all over?".
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, at this point even if you had a mass awakening the production requirements to sustain society don't exist outside of those who already control them. In many ways, at this point, anything you do to the system ultimate only harms you. The plutocrats are completely isolated from any harm that could befall them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in a scenario where the people somehow take back some power and oust TPTB, they will just retire to some villa and leave a broken society for some one else to fix.
      </p>
      <p>
       So should our focus really move beyond "stopping them" and move more towards "surviving what's coming". Because you can't really stop what's already been done.

       Would it be terrible of me to claim ignorance and tell you that i really don't know? We aren't politicians, economists or political philosophers so it really isn't our job to reshape and rejuvenate a dying political system.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's sure as fuck our responsibility to safeguard future generations from fascism and oppression. I'm beyond the point of wondering where my "american dream" is, now we should all be thinking about the steaming pile of shit our children and grandchildren are being left with.

       My biggest hope is that since the rate of decline seems so rapid in comparison to other empires, mostly due to the exponential growth of technology and ai, perhaps collapse and rebirth will come quicker, too.

       I do think there's a slight chance for a movement akin to India expelling the British, nationwide protest and nonviolent civil disobedience, but only if it's close to everybody. They can justify violent crackdown if they keep "other-izing" radicals, as they've been successful thus far, but if we could break through the bullshit and get like 60% of America to stop going to work - the rich would shit bricks and might cave on huge first legislative steps. Like an end to gerrymandering, campaign finance reform, abolishment of the electoral college. Stuff that's not a radical divergence but might just be the Olive tree of change that we could plant to point back towards representative democracy. But perhaps that's still hopelessly idealistic.

       You know what the real obstacle to what you propose becomes? Even if you shut the whole system down and replace all the politicians and put in people who represent the people.... if you are still using dollar bills then the moment you start the system back up, the "old guard" (who will still be rich) simply buy everything back up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you took away all their money, through their social circles and connection (and most importantly knowledge) they would quickly take over the system again. Who would set up the banking system .... ex bankers. Who would set up the military system... ex military guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the problem.... even with mass rebellion, the train has gone so far off the tracks that something truly radical would be required to change it.

       Nah. It should be more akin to a plague. People in those certain positions just keep forgetting how to drive, plowing into one another and bursting into flames. Nobody knows how or why it's happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the stretched innards of victims adorning federal buildings. I don't know what kind of plague does that. Must be a new form of herpes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps sending all the cash back to its source, while inflamed, would be a good way to stop the plague. Then they can have all the money in the world. Nice and warm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the plague is smart enough to utilize military drones and do a couple "training runs" through a few particular areas. Drones at bilderberg performing "protection" would be ideal. It's a shame when they "freak out" and just start leveling the shiny boxes containing those fortunate things over 499.
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe that same "wonderful network" that helped get us here, can be a nice home for the plague, so that all the endpoints can be mapped and "secured" in a column of smoke. So the little spiders that inhabit it can be "pest-controlled." I hear raid takes out entire families of bad insects.

       This is the real conspiracy in my mind. It is absolutely impossible to be an atheist if you really look at things. While people are focused on the material as the be all end all, they will never come close enough to the truth to do anything good about it unless by accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to make the leap from petrodollars to godlessness is practically impossible for almost everyone though, because people don't understand the subversion of religion for what it really is and they blame religion instead of bad people. I think it is a failure of those who rely on secular movements when they descend into a spiritual nihilism instead of being able to appreciate the majesty and potential latent in all humans, REGARDLESS of our source and true nature. I agree that the name is not quite so important, as long as one has it and can act accordingly.

       It's never occurred to many that maybe some of these radical offshoots with absolutely illogical ideologies might actually have been "created" to ridicule the whole of Christianity? (Like the Tea Party, that was a whole demographic, waiting for a "cause" and they don't even need a Messiah-type leader, they just took the bait of our first black president is the Anti-Christ. Mormonism was founded by a sexist, racist narcissist and still continues today to subjugate women and blacks.)

       Ok, well, the Bible has always been a mix of history, parables and wisdom. I've never stated it is literal or the only Truth. Truth speaks to the universal soul. I believe in a lot of different theologies and role models. Christ is the one that speaks the most to my soul. I guess I understand Grace and activism even, through the Bible, simply because I'm most familiar with it culturally.

       Please, don't just generalize all Christians as the same. I'm not forcing my "dogma" on anyone, but trying to repeatedly emphasize that mistrust in faith, religion and God is part of "the programming". It is possible for atheists to be moral people, but I'm trying to relay the message to others here that spiritual fitness is the strongest weapon one can have against tyrants. United we stand, divided and hopeless, we will all crumble.

       All that's needed is to make unreasonable levels of greed, or call it whatever you like, but make overt greed into a socially unsustainable bad habit, a taboo if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have made a large number of terrible habits socially unacceptable we can take this one more step and truly change the outcome for mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       It only takes a consensus that psychopaths in positions of power just don't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have always been there but we didn't understand them.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we didn't understand their mindset they became responsible for the deaths of millions and yet more millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This situation has weighed down mankind now for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has to stop and it can be stopped,  the same way we have stopped many other bad behaviors, by simple social rejection and a new attitude that does not allow the most powerful positions to be occupied by malevolent personalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       We simply cannot let the least sensitive, the least caring and the most aggressive lead us into our destruction for nothing more than a tiny bit of endorphin or dopamine or any other pleasure giving brain chemical  being forced into the consciousness of the kind of leaders we have always had.
      </p>
      <p>
       For them one tiny dram of pleasure is worth the lives of any number of other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychopathic leaders have no compunction against trading the world, our world, for a nano gram of endorphin or serotonin or dopamine. Let's understand that and let's reject it.

       It would only be 'all over' if every human was dead and the earth was ruined for all biological life.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what is most likely but it's not 'all over.'  There are things that can be done.  They may be things that just make those of us who know better and understand what is going on feel better about ourselves, but even if there is no positive change or slowdown of the end, I choose to think and believe that it's my time on this planet and it would be a waste to act opposite to what I find best.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, remove every bit of allegiance from the system itself.  Every hope that it will succeed through improvement, every good feeling for it, every new idea that might reform it, everything inside of you that has any inkling of an effective or imaginary contribution to these national governments and international businesses and anything that comprises their system.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means no more working at this or that job just to make money, no more buying gasoline, no more credit, no more paying credit debts, unless your intent and realistic effect is to actually harm said system.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is already a lot of work, but if you think about it, it is actually less work.  Sitting and doing nothing whatsoever is a more positive thing to do than it is to pay taxes to this system.  Make them make you work, make the system bare its teeth, don't do its work for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting from this point, there is much to be done, and it is kindof fun and creative.  This that I'm saying is actually just standard anarcho stuff, just reading your question it's pretty clear you probably haven't met these guys:
       <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/">

      <p>
       So no, even though fukashima may give everyone horrible cancer by 2050 when the oceans are going to be 30 meters higher, all is not lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a brain with time, maybe you have a soul maybe you don't, but a good brain with time does things that it thinks is best and doesn't do anything akin to giving up.

       The Rubicon is demographic. The Rubicon is racial. The Rubicon is religious.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the people remain oblivious to these facts, there can be no improvement in society, or in the economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have too many old people and not enough young people. Our population is dying. We are shrinking as a people. That is the demographic Rubicon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whites are becoming a minority in their own countries. This is happening as a result of low birth rates for whites, coupled with massive non-white immigration. Whites built these nations and give them both their economic power and their desirable culture. When whites go, all that goes with them. That is the rubicon of race.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a war on against Christianity. A deliberate, focused, unrelenting campaign throughout the mass media to destroy the faith of Christians, and to destroy the authority of the Christian churches. But Western culture is Christian culture; Western society is a Christian society; Christians built the West. When Christianity goes away, taking with it Christian moral principles of behavior, the West goes. That's the rubicon of religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only about one person in ten reading this will understand what I am saying. The rest have been too well brainwashed by their masters, and are incapable of comprehending these truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in a practical sense, yes, I believe it is over. But society won't collapse overnight. It will be a decline. From a cultural standpoint, the decline is frighteningly swift, but from the standpoint of an individual, the decline is slow enough that it will only be noticed from decade to decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people are brainwashed, stupid, and very poorly educated. There's no use even hoping they are going to be part of the solution. The small minority able to even understand what is happening will have to make the change happen by themselves, if indeed it is still possible to make a change against the inertia of the social conditioning that has been imposed on the mass of the population. I say good luck to you. We are on the Titanic, and we are approaching the moment when it is every man for himself.

       You job as a form of life is to be birthed - shit - eat - die. No one knows shit about the future. Shit has happened and will continue to happen, nothing has changed. Accept it and enjoy the fucking ride. You're fine now so do what your body wants more - fuck. You're going to die at one point or another, and your dick is going to STOP WORKING ONE DAY. Then you die, I see you're taking for granted your freedoms you have now, sitting on your computer thinking shit is going to get worse. You're on a motherfucking computer, you have electricity, clothing and heat. Right now, you live in one of the safest place ever created. America? Right now? Stop whining on the Internet and go bust a nut, by any means.

       Maybe you do not wish to have children or you simply don't care for the next generation but to suggest we all simply say 'fuck it' is a major problem with a current, collective mindset and one that is short-sighted to say the least.

       Your urges come from reproductive instinct, and they don't have to control your life. You "want to have children." -- the next generation? You're worrying about something you can't control. You can only imagine what should happen based on circumstances you've created in your mind. Shit doesn't work like that. Change happens, shit fucking happens. Trust me, the future generations really don't give a fuck about you right now. Within 150 years more than likely no one will remember you existed. Just think about that. When was the last time you sat around thinking "wow, I'm really glad my dads dads dads dads dad impregnated some lady so I could come here. I'm glad he's taking care for the future. NEVER. Why? Because you can't worry about the future, you have no control. If any, an infinitesimally fractional vision of the future, meaning that there will be (theoretical) light in the future.

       "Fuck everything" is fun until you get a cavity and need a dentist :) Or have high cholesterol and need some lipitor.

       What boggles my mind is that from 2008-2012 the

       I mean, how come this is not considered a national crisis... or at least reflective of a nation in crisis? It's safe to say that people are literally dying as a result of the crash in 2008 (and those numbers continue to go up, not down).

       I agree, There are alternatives but the degradation of the biosphere and more specifically the oceans suggests to me that there is no real way of sustaining a 7/8+ billion population without major changes within our own nature and  collective activities. We have become arrogant.

       I fail to understand why TPTB have let this happen without an alternative available to them. Why kill the golden goose??

       We are in trouble. Society is falling apart at the seams, moral standards are dropping. Our environment is in free-fall and we still live under a finite based resource system. Total collapse or not, we are going to face huge problems over the next 20 years if we do not change, or if advanced technology doesn't offer us an alternative to the current way of us going about business on Earth.

       What is "the Truth" according to 'you'?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I have read:
      </p>
      <pre><code> Christ's main message was...

 'Love the Lord your God, with all your being, and love your neighbor as yourself."
  When asked who our neighbors are Christ answered with the parable or the good Samaritan.

       <strong>
        No different than Confucius.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I already said, there likely is a "higher power", but the Bible is a mix between history and fairy tale.
