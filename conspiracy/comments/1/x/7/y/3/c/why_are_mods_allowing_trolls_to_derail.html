      <p>
       I've discussed this issue with 3 different mods, all of whom tell me the same thing; "No rule violations were broken."
      </p>
      <p>
       1 user with two accounts made 46 of the 98 comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       35 comments on a thread with 98 total
11 more comments with a sock on that same thread
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods, seriously? That was a fairly interesting thread until the conspiratard/sock came to dump their special brand of bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that's the point. Maybe you've been instructed to let the conspiratards ruin this sub. Maybe it's an extension of the orders on Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, sorry to continually make this about me. I'm just sick of the mods making it about "open discussion" and "we don't want to be like conspiratards" but then allow conspiratards to ruin this sub. It's an oxymoron of an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've said my piece. Peace.

       Edit3 I read a reply I made to a fellow user. I think it sums up the brainstorm you all helped me to realize. Here it is:

      <blockquote>

        I challenge a mod or user to prove me wrong. Go to

        and find:

       <p>
        A. a time when the user makes a comment that isn't in
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        (with over 5,000 comments in over a month, should be easy, right?)
       </p>
       <p>
        B. makes a comment in
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        that is in agreement with the general concensus of the other posters in the post (including the OP)
Ready. Set. GO!
       </p>
       <p>
        If you cop out by saying this doesn't break the rules, well then partners, maybe it is time for a new rule...
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule 11: Obvious trolls are obvious. If enough users complain, the allegations will be looked at by mods.

       I think I'm with the mods - at least as far as the thread you linked to is concerned. Sure there are plenty of comments that disagree with the theory, but they seemed to have a civil conversation with multiple other users about the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying that anyone who disagrees with a theory should be banned? Or anyone who questions or comments too much?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how do you know the other account is a puppet for the first? I'm asking as much for my own info as anything else on this. If there is a way to tell what users have which accounts I'd love to know how.

       Well, we know shills are on Reddit. At this point, you'd have to be brain dead to claim they aren't.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1x46ku/discussion_on_persona_management_aka_shills/cf7ylmu">
        See here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have one claim I think is reasonable, and 2 possibilities that would explain the presence of the daily 4-5 shills in this small sub of only 400-900 people. I'm talking about the people who are in almost every thread all fucking day long telling us that conspiracies don't exist. Not people with reasonable counter arguments- but people who just want to be dicks and ruin every single thread for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The top 1 or 2 slots reach potentially 200,000 people. That is a big enough number of people to justify paying 1 person a wage to shill those 2 slots. It is reasonable to claim the shill (s) are there. Remember that many, many different entities have shills. Not just the US government. Any of those entities could be diverting a shill or two here.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Shills that are paid to work on big subs like worldnews- where do they go when there isn't much work to be done for the day? Probably smaller subs to dick around. This is kinda like sweeping the floor on a jobsite. It's just busy work.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Driving a wedge into this sub and keeping it there: This sub
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be something bigger than it is, but it's not. It seems like many people here, including the conspiracy theorists (I have no idea why this wouldn't be the only group here), are highly polarized. We can't seem to work on anything without being bombarded with people spewing garbage into every thread. Since this is Reddit, and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be a big, popular sub, it might be worth it for the government to pay 1 person to just keep this sub divided and shitty like it's been. They can't have the conspiracy mindset trickling into the massive ocean of Reddit users. Keep it contained and keep them bitching at each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the mods would be paid off for this, but you never know. The government loves to waste money. Never forget that. I think a reasonable guess at our situation is 1 guy is paid to be here full time and has a bunch of accounts. He takes care of the top post usually, and then comes into the lower ranked posts when he needs work. It could be more than 1 guy, but I think it's reasonable to assume at least 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a couple examples off the top of my head:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Person makes an account impersonating a user here.
         <a href="/u/Iam_sancho3">
          /u/Iam_sancho3
         </a>
         . He deleted his account shortly after I called him out on it. This was by far the most bizarre thing I've seen here.
         <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wwkf7/wowthe_shills_are_out_in_full_force_trying_to/cf60ukx">
          http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wwkf7/wowthe_shills_are_out_in_full_force_trying_to/cf60ukx
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Bill Cooper 9/11 thread. The shill loves his 9/11 threads. Scroll down a few comments and you'll see a list of possible shills. Notice
         <a href="/u/largemason">
          /u/largemason
         </a>
         .
         <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjjj2/whatever_theyre_going_to_blame_on_osama_bin_laden/">
          http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjjj2/whatever_theyre_going_to_blame_on_osama_bin_laden/
         </a>
         This is a sock account that he later used a month later, with only 1 post in between, on another thread that was the top post. The person obviously has many, many accounts. They tried to paint the illusion that everyone thinks Bill Cooper is a loon. They can't let those 200,000 people learn about Cooper.

       You have no problem banning users who question you, but banning people who harass other members is a *no-no. Very consistent. The rules are flawed on purpose, that's why you use that excuse every time.

       My "views" are that the subreddit's rules should be applied equally to everyone. If some trolls were to be banned, then all trolls should be banned. From what I remember of some of your previous comments, you wouldn't want that to happen either.

The truth was just hidden.
The truth is mods have been instructed to leave the perpetual dissent machine alone.

       A damning indictment of the mod was just removed.

       I received a very similar explanation from the same mod for leaving conspiratard trolls in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       . It went along the lines of "Trolls are useful to us as a sub."
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: How about putting up the content without the insult? It would help prove a point that the mods are helping to keep trolls on

       that it's a common strategy to leave antagonistic comments in order to create a dialectic. He deleted his comment unfortunately, but I very much agree.

       As I said in the link, myconspiracyname is someone who does this frequently. Despite being an ignoramus.

       However, the mods are right that it doesn't violate the rules and thus can't justify a punishment.

       Those who derail the threads aren't the biggest problem though, it's those who manipulate the voting system, which is an impossibility to fix.

       You do seem to have a lot of hostility to the mods, that's probably not going to help your case. They can't just start banning people and such just because accusations are made. They do have a responsibility to look at everything and be as close to 100% sure as possible before taking action, and being hostile with them is probably not going to speed up the process. We are pretty lucky here, we all know our mods and trust them. In fact, we elected them. If they have not taken action against anyone mentioned here then there is a good reason for it.

       Letting known conspiratards ruin this sub isn't a good enough reason? Maybe they can hide behind the 'rules,' seeing as that is a popular mod default comment.

       But our mods don't let conspiratard users ruin this sub. They do A LOT to keep them out.

       deals with more shit from them then most users here can even imagine. Take a look at his history some time if you'd like to see the type of bullshit he puts up with from them. There have been plenty of times the mods have taken drastic actions to fight off conspiratard. The simple fact is that if we only have one or two conspiratard users floating around in here then they are doing a good job. When we are under attack it is obvious. 20 or 30 downvotes hitting every post within seconds of it being posted is more along the lines of a problem. So many subs here have shit mods who manipulate or who are power crazy. Our sub has mods who WE elected, who we know and who we trust. And unless they all give us some damn good reasons to doubt them then I expect that this sub is going to stand behind their decisions.

       Really? Because I briefly glanced through a couple of pages of your history and I saw a whole low of not respecting peoples opinions going on. I think I'm going to go ahead and jump on these guys bandwagon and say that I think there is something fishy about you. We'll see what the mods think when they get on.

       It's impossible for everyone here to agree on every single conspiracy theory. Some people that believe 9/11 was a false flag will make adversarial comments in threads about chemtrails. We can't ban everyone that disagrees or we wouldn't have anybody here.

       Trolls can only derail a conversation if people feed them.
       <strong>
        <em>

       . Don't respond to them. Don't make comments about them. Just down vote and move on. If you're feeding trolls you have no reasonable excuse to blame the mods for it.

       Feeding the trolls is not the problem, it's them having multiple accounts upvoting each other to make their arguments seem legit, consequently derailing the conversation and disinforming new users who see bullshit comments with +50 karma and legit, informative and collaborative at -20. So yeah, it's your fault for not being a decent gatekeeper.

       I agree with you, multiple accounts fudging the voting is a serious problem the mods must take care of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree with you that feeding trolls isn't a problem, but I would add, so long as it is with the express purpose of holding them long enough so as to expose their hide to sunlight, thus turning them to stone.

       Shills, on the other hand, are a different story.  They must be slayed with a swift, ironclad rebuke.  One might take enjoyment in putting paid to a troll, but shills are the enemy, off with their heads and move on.

       I happen to find data to be pretty cool. Also any chance you could make some of these into graph format and plot levels of each of these vs things like median, historical avg. or stuff?

        You assume all those are the same people but offer no proof at all - there couldn't possibly be more than 1 person who disagrees with you?

        You think people who don't agree with your narrative is a troll, not just someone who disagrees
