<p><a href="http://thedailybanter.com/2013/05/conspiracy-theorists-claim-alex-jones-is-a-cia-double-agent/">http://thedailybanter.com/2013/05/conspiracy-theorists-claim-alex-jones-is-a-cia-double-agent/</a></p>

<p>Comment below</p>

<p>&quot;It is quite funny to me that this author misleadingly frames Project Mockingbird as benignly halted by George H.W. Bush, board member of the Carlyle Group, former CIA Chief, VP and President. What actually occurred was that Frank Church &amp; Co. in the Senate - including Walter Mondale &amp; Barry Goldwater - forced Bush to close it after the largest and most serious inquest into abuses by the CIA, FBI &amp; NSA that has ever occurred. This Psyop program was not the only dirty laundry to come out, however, as it was made known that many foreign democratically elected progressive (or non-Communist Socialist) leaders, including Allende, Guzman, Lumbumba, Goulart and Mossadegh were assassinated, deposed or both as a direct result of CIA covert operations. All of these activities were directly in violation of the UN treaties to which we are party, not to mention our own Constitution.</p>

<p>That was the tip of the iceberg, however, as it was also revealed that the CIA abducted innocent people of a variety of ages to conduct cruel, heinous brainwashing and mind programming experiments on unwitting victims, for over 35 years, in a program involving over 80 medical institutions, including Massachusetts General Hospital and McLean Hospital (in MA), across the country. All of these programs were ostensibly brought to a halt by Mr. Church&#39;s hearings and President Ford was forced to sign an executive order ending covert assassinations. Of course that did little to change the illegal, Imperialist Foreign Policy of the United States, esp. after the fall of the USSR, as the Wars in Iraq and the 2009 Honduras coup attest. One is only reminded of the fact that US was ordered by 2 separate United Nations 9-to-3 votes to pay hundreds of millions of USD in reparations to Nicaragua for backing death squads (can anyone say State-sponsored terrorism?), mining the harbors and killing trade unionists and civil activists during the 1980s under Reagan &amp; Bush.</p>

<p>And what of Robert McNamara&#39;s open testimony that the 1966 Gulf of Tonkin Incident was indeed a false flag used to justify major escalation of the Indochina conflict? How can this astonishing revelation - backed up by reams of since declassified documents - not fundamentally alter our attitude toward the Defense Establishment. One only need to research Pulitzer Prize winning WSJ reporter, Ron Suskind&#39;s reporting on the origins of the Habbush Letter Forgery for a present-day example. This and all the other programs I mentioned are public knowledge and no longer lie in the domain of &quot;Conspiracy Theory.&quot; There is not one serious historian of post-war US History that would substantially deny any of my claims. And I challenge the authors to dispute me on this.</p>

<p>Given these past admissions, and many others - such as the decades of previously secret &amp; illegal nuclear testing for which millions of US citizens were compensated in the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, or the leak by the NYT in 2012 that the underwear bomber was an FBI operative, or that the STUXNET virus was created by CIA - it is absurd that any &quot;serious&quot; publication or news blog would attempt to base its credibility on the absolutely ludicrous idea that conspiracies concerning foreign intervention for US business interests or domestic manipulation of the US citizenry for political ends do not occur and are not currently underway in some, likely serious form (as in the past).</p>

<p>Jones&#39; more ridiculous ideas are aptly criticized by this conventionalist lapdog, but the substance behind the SPIRIT which informs skepticism of flimsy, extremely unlikely, half-baked government cover stories (such as the cause of much unrest in contemporary Afghanistan and N. Waziristan) is incorrectly lambasted. That hydrocarbon pipeline designs and Chevron are not intertwined with our continued military presence in this region is both naive and false, as Wikileaks can corroborate.</p>

<p>In short, Bob Cesca has thrown out the baby with the bathwater, in a serious but extremely typical way. Perhaps he should meet Dubya&#39;s former anti-terrorism chief, Richard Clarke, and see what he thinks, after talking to a serious adult such as him, about inter-governmental conspiracies of the present day.&quot;</p>

<p>If anyone could create a character of Alex jones...its Bill Hicks. </p>

<p>But i have no opinion on whether its Bill or not. Imo Bill is dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hicks was far too enlightened to be compared to Alex, though Jones does seem to be some type of sociopathic genius. They were from the same area, but I&#39;ve never come close to buying that one.
  Alex Jones is a blatant agent of some sort though, it&#39;s over the top obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that he is an over the top agent..but I am still not convinced one way or another. As I said Bill Hicks as we knew him is dead. If he is A.J..and thats a big if..you have to wonder why he changes sides? Is he a triple agent? Did he join the intelligence community in some sort or another? To say that hollywood actors/journalists/wartime reporters/professional athletes aren&#39;t CIA or NSA is total hogwash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there may have been a time when he was legit and a real conspiracy theorist. I came across a video on YouTube of him during the Waco/FBI incident and he was interviewing people. I believe as he got more popular, he became a CIA double agent. The CIA def keeps a tab on the non-main stream media outlets (which are growing more popular btw) and shape these views with guys like Alex Jones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His waco footage is pretty interesting. He seems way less over the top. There is still something off about him though imo. </p>

<p>I think it depends on the person. Someone like Bill Cooper isn&#39;t capable of being turned. Alex Jones I could see easily turning if approached by an intelligence agency of some kind. He seems like the person who might get off on knowing he is actually on the inside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for linking me to that show. I actually wanted to listen to the opie and anthony show with alex jones for a while, but had never gotten around to it. I find A.J. pretty revolting except for when he stuck it to Piers in front of everyone. I did enjoy that...a lot. The only thing I enjoyed more was seeing Piers get sick after taking the flu shot. I damn near died from laughing. But I digress.. </p>

<p>I have suspected A.J. for the last 5 years after first finding out about Bill Cooper. It&#39;s been a long road since then of picking up on controlled opposition. </p>

<p>I will say that I have networked with some pretty interesting people over the last couple of years. It has led to my view changing from 180 to 360. I had men that were pretty powerful in their own right telling me that the NWO is real and there are certain things you just can&#39;t do. I would also like to add though that this same group believes we are in the end times as per revelations. </p>
