        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has probably been posted here before, but after <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wt84p/gravity_is_a_push_not_a_pull_nikola_tesla_thomas/">u/axolotl_peyotl&#39;s awesome post</a> about gravity being &#39;a push not a pull&#39;, I figured it&#39;s a good time to repost. I enjoy this sub, but I think it needs more science. I see countless posts/comments like &quot;how can we fight back against the elite?&quot; blah blah blah. The solution lies in the suppressed technologies/theories of the past century. </p>

<p>Imagine if someone could crack the code, &quot;succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature...machinery driven by power obtainable at any point in the Universe&quot; (- Tesla). Such a discovery may not topple their pyramid, but it would certainly accelerate the expansion of the human consciousness. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AUA7XS0TvA">Thunderbolts of the Gods</a></p>

<p>This documentary sums up the Electric Universe Theory, which an expansion on physicists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cosmology">Oskar Klein and Hannes Alfven&#39;s theory of Plasma Cosmology</a>. The main tenants of these theories include the following:</p>

<p>-electricity plays a MUCH larger role in the workings of the Universe than we are currently aware</p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.plasmacosmology.net/">over 99%</a> of the visible universe is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)">plasma</a>, which by its very nature produces magnetic fields</p>

<p>-no large bodies in space are electrically neutral (Earth is a large negatively charged particle, the Sun positive), and all charged particles are affected by magnetic fields</p>

<p>-the magnetic-electric interaction can explain formations in the Universe that gravity alone cannot; it could replace the theory of dark matter, with proper cosmological research</p>

<p>The documentary and Plasma Cosmology wikipedia page go into more details about the respective theories, but I&#39;ll save you the details. Watch the vid if you&#39;re interested, and read up on the topic. Study the works of Tesla, T.T. Brown, and Leedskalnin. Electricity and magnetism are key. </p>

<p>&quot;Advances are made by answering questions. Discoveries are made by questioning answers&quot; - <a href="http://www.brainythoughts.com/brainy-quote-discoveries-are-made-by-questioning-answers-551.html">Bernard Haisch</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>We only know what we see and are told. Tesla is an interesting person to research considering his major documented importance in the way modern technology works. Couple that with the major suppression of his works (seriously... what in the fuck) and the direction he was preaching at the same time.</p>

<p>I personally dont even understand the majority of how my technology I use EVERYDAY works! Yes I can regurgitate how it works if I went though the trouble of learning, but ulitmatly I do not know shit.</p>

<p>When you have people that are innovating the field, believing and pursuing things that change EVERYTHING... They might just be onto something. To say otherwise would be on the class of denying stem cells today, denying the idea of personal computers in the 1960s, denying the ability of flight in the 1900s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another prominent figure to check out would be Walter Russell. Tesla is quoted saying that Walter&#39;s Cubic Wavefield theory should be &quot;put in the Smithsonian for 1000 years,&quot; because humanity wasn&#39;t prepared for it.</p>

<p>Rather than write an essay here about him, I&#39;d say if you&#39;ve ever heard of Tesla, you will have the time of your life checking out W. Russell.

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. Long story short we don&#39;t know how the bombardment of radio frequencies is going to (already) affecting humans and nature. I&#39;m sure some do however. </p>

<p>In a simple explanation. Certain brain Beta waves are associated with anxiety, stress, etc.. If someone was externally bombarded with those frequencies their brain would, for lack of a better term, sync with the external waves and produce anxiety and stress. </p>

<p>You can block it, but it takes tremendous control over your energy and thought process. </p>

Certain compressors &quot;bug&quot; me, I get clicks in my sinuses from certain electronic devices, like the HD camera on my cell, makes my sinuses &quot;pop&quot; a little. It&#39;s not just noise sensitivity, it&#39;s pressure or restlessness/irritability.

    <div class="md"><p>When you clap your hands, the sound it makes is percieved by your ears as informational vibrations carried by mechanical waves. But, does that clap vibrate anything else in the environment? Of course! We&#39;re all familiar with the resonance effect that causes objects to tap or vibrate as a function of some repeating noise/sound.</p>

<p>However, there is evidence that the clap you just did also produces radiowaves, microwaves, infrared, uv, visible light, etc. ALL of the spectrum of light is represented with literally every movement and action that everything does. It might not be prominent enough for us as humans to mentally perceive those other spectrums of information. But, it might. So now we can ask a question: How do regularly produced patterns of microwaves, radiowaves, etc. effect biological systems?</p>

<p>Straight up, anyone can tell you that microwaves tend to generate heat in biological systems. 4G cell phones are the first generation to use microwaves regularly as an information receiver. Same goes for certain wifi transmitters (being installed regularly inside of schools nowadays btw). When a pregnant woman exposes her developing fetus to copious amounts of this constant microwave field, what can we expect to happen?</p>

<p>Well, we can expect the developing eggs of a fetal daughter to be exposed to those microwaves as well. Hmm. That ain&#39;t good! The direct effects on the family line will be represented physically when THAT daughter&#39;s microwaved eggs are fertilized later in life. Just based on principle, we can suggest that exposing ourselves to artificial wavefields can have drastic effects (biological, mental, etc) on future generations.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a SHIT TON we don&#39;t know about the universe, and it&#39;s not all about math. So don&#39;t be so close-minded, objectively read these posts and see if you can widen your pathetically narrow mindset</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not physicist.  I am a mathematician.  I also probably know a bit more about this subject than you since a good portion of the mathematics behind GR is kind of my thing.  Where do you want to start? You want to debate on it, lets go, your nobel prize awaits if you can start by convincing me that GR is wrong in some serious way. </p>

<p>There was theorizing going on in that shitpost, it was amatuerish navel gazing of the highest caliber, the kind easily conflated by non-techincal folks as being something worth considering.  Unless you are part of the scientific community, don&#39;t expect me to find such an endeavor worthy of anything less than scorn if it&#39;s offered up as an incitful new twist on current theory.  The age of amateur exceptionalism in these fields has long passed and redditors clinging to it for their next round of guffawing wonderment is pathetic since these same people cannot nor will not make the intellectual investment to <em>really</em> have a serious debate on the subjects.</p>

<p>So again, do you want to have a fruitful technical discussion or you just here to look and point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to make a claim that gravity is either way. But I don&#39;t think there is enough evidence to even really support the mainstream ideology of gravity. </p>

<p>I know there is gravity because I step on a scale and numbers show up on the screen. </p>

<p>The rotational speed of the earth, at the surface, is slightly over 1000 miles per hour(1). If I was to even make an attempt to spin my body so that my surface speed was 1000 miles per hour do you think any of my extremities would remain fixed to my body? That same rule would apply in space but without air resistance and subsequent friction. </p>

<p>Remember, to understand the <em>current</em> theory, you have to man up and get some serious intellectual backing to your thinking.  You may have an intuition about the deficiencies of the current theory, but until you can force that thinking into a technical construct clear enough to convince the scientists, mathematicians and general theoretical physicist of the field, then what you&#39;re doing is at best amateurish mental masturbation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scientists and mathematicians are being ignored for attempting to question certain accepted doctrines. Take Einstein&#39;s black hole postulates.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q185InpONK4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q185InpONK4</a> &lt;(listening to real mathematicians and scientists with supported evidence is not mental masturbation)</p>

<p>They don&#39;t mathematically or linguistically cooperate. We&#39;re not trying to say &quot;oh man we know everything and scientists are wrong about blah blah blah...&quot; in this thread. What we&#39;re trying to say is that there could possibly be clearer lenses to use when interpreting the physical manifestation of the universe.</p>

<p>We&#39;re simply piquing interest! I think in this case it is appropriate to tell us to slow down and check math/physics and not take new theories on faith, however in this case it also seems like you are functioning as negative inspiration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>perhaps, but as another pithy phrase goes &#39;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.&#39;  It is clear that GR and QCD are lacking as theories, however, their deficient does not imply that they are wholly mistaken.  On the contrary, GR and QCD are spectacular feats of 20th century physics and mathematics and the theory that can sucessfully combine them has so far eluded very very smart people.  This should tell you that the problem at hand is far more subtle and difficult than meets even the technical eye.  </p>

<p>This is also why I heap much scorn and skepticism on claims such as this.  There may be a veneer of technicality, but it does not mean they are approaching an understanding of the current theories, its deficiencies, in a way that can be scientifically probed via experimentation or even mathematics. </p>

<p>Exotic R4 is a tricky beast, yes.  I am familiar with that and its topological consequences and I suspect the answer lies in there.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have the background, it&#39;s arrogant and naive to think you can approach these kinds of problems and get anything more than amateurish appreciation for it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You people are so obvious lately...Do I even need to explain what I&#39;m talking about?  I really am confused by how obvious you are making this game all of a sudden.</p>

<p>Either that, or I&#39;m finally waking up to what&#39;s probably been going on for a long time.  Or a combination of both.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not even mad that you supposedly dissagree, or at your stupid attitude problem, or evn that you seem to be doing this with a nefarious purpose...</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that at all, it&#39;s that you&#39;re making it too easy at this point.  It&#39;s the same reason I wouldn&#39;t enjoy winning a game of basketball against a toddler...and I think it&#39;s the same reason you probably would enjoy that same kind of game....I think that&#39;s the kind of game we both know we&#39;re playing here...except what you don&#39;t know is that you&#39;re the toddler.  Time to wake up friendo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no connection with Evil_Critique, as you failed to have noticed he turned up three hours after I&#39;d left. Your entire comment is an ad hominem, incidentally.</p>

<p>Tesla was very clever for his day, but his understanding of the universe was based in a 19th century perspective. He&#39;s so massively out-of-date it isn&#39;t even funny any more.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to experiment with a technology based around an electronless, luminiferous aetheric universe, but I&#39;m afraid you will be brought down to Earth with a bump when you find that none of it will work.</p>

<p>Aether is all very well to consider as a thought model to explain various phenomena, but when it fails to live up to the ability to explain how the universe works in practice, then it&#39;s time to retire it.</p>
