    <div class="md"><p>so, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/10/families-fallen-navy-seals-in-2011-attack-say-government-is-to-blame/">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/10/families-fallen-navy-seals-in-2011-attack-say-government-is-to-blame/</a></p>

<p>The families of Navy SEAL Team 6 members killed in a disastrous August 2011 helicopter crash in Afghanistan blamed the government for the tragedy, during an emotional press conference in Washington Thursday. </p>

<p>The family members, speaking at the National Press Club, tried to reopen the book on the crash, in which 30 Americans were killed, <strong>most of them belonging to the same unit as those who carried out the raid on Usama bin Laden earlier that year</strong>. The helicopter was shot down by insurgents. </p>

<p>who kills people and throws their body in the ocean? - the mob</p>

<p>Jeb Bush was a PNAC signatory and he signed Executive Order 01-261 September 7, 2001 which allowed martial law to be declared in Florida. His was the first state to declare a state of emergency on 9/11.
Marvin Bush was a principal in a company which provided security for the World Trade Center, United Airlines, and Dulles International Airport, and he was in New York on 9/11.</p>

<p>Whilst the entire world was transfixed by events at the World Trade Center President George W. Bush did nothing when he was told America was under attack - he found reading a book about a pet goat more important.</p>

<p>The Bush family are huge beneficiaries of the &#39;War on Terror&#39; thanks to their connections to the Carlyle Group, and it just so happens that Shafig bin Laden, brother to Osama, was at a Carlyle Group conference in Washington on 9/11:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 11 September, while Al-Qaeda&#39;s planes slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Carlyle Group hosted a conference at a Washington hotel. Among the guests of honour was a valued investor: Shafig bin Laden, brother to Osama. [Guardian]
The morning of the attack George Bush Sr. is meets with members of the Carlyle Group in Washington. Bin Laden&#39;s own brother is at the meeting. [CBC]</p>

<p>My theory is that he didn&#39;t want to bother digging him up from the whitehouse back yard (kidding. Maybe). OBL gave the military industrial complex precisely the paper tiger they needed, and they&#39;ve milked the world for all it&#39;s got from it.</p>

<p>This was not the reason given at the time of the &quot;burial&quot;. They said it was because of muslim custom. Then, after it was revealed to be total bullshit, then they came up with this shrine nonsense. Not to mention, even if you have a shrine, it&#39;s better for the US than anything else as it gives an easy way to identify and target such terrorists. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t even know how to react to this but feel a combination of humor and sadness that this is actually how you think. The tea party (the modern one, not the original one from ron paul&#39;s campaign) is as mainstream nowadays as the obamabots are, and just as glad to hear OBLs death as anyone else, other than the fact it was a democrat to finally take him out.</p>

<p>Either way this is all besides the point. OBL wasn&#39;t behind 9/11 (which he said so himself), and died many, many years ago.</p>

<p>Really? A rallying point for extremists? They DIDNT want that? Talk about an easy way to catch the bad guys if they all line up at this supposed shrine. Also, I don&#39;t know where you are getting this shrine excuse (valid or not), but the official story said it was muslim custom to be buried at sea, not because of anything related to a shrine.</p>

<p>Not to mention all of this is besides the point anyways. OBL was on dialysis back in 2001, and was dead long before the &quot;seal raid&quot;.</p>

<p>They SAID it was because of muslim burial custom (according to the official story). Now they are changing it and saying they didn&#39;t want to create a shrine?</p>

<p>International intelligence experts saying he died over a decade ago (ignore the alex jones shit, it&#39;s mainly as a point of reference anyways):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/osama-died-in-2001-msnbc-hit-piece-unwittingly-reveals-corroboration-for-dr-steve-r-pieczenik-s-assertion/24753">http://www.globalresearch.ca/osama-died-in-2001-msnbc-hit-piece-unwittingly-reveals-corroboration-for-dr-steve-r-pieczenik-s-assertion/24753</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pieczenik’s source for the information comes directly from intelligence files that he saw over nine years ago confirming that the terror leader was dead. This means that the entire narrative of Bin Laden’s alleged assassination put out by the Obama administration is an act of mass public deception. Obama has benefited enormously from cultivating a ‘tough guy’ image out of the fabled raid, enjoying a 13 point approval rating bounce according to an Associated Press poll.</p>

<p>Pieczenik’s credibility is beyond reproach (bio). As well as serving under five US presidents, he wrote the book on psychological warfare and counter terrorism for the State Department, while also developing foundational strategies for hostage rescue that were later employed around the world. He also won two prestigious Harry C. Solomon Awards while studying at Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>Pieczenik’s record underscores the fact that he is one of the most deeply connected men in intelligence circles over the past three decades plus. He was a top spymaster involved in all manner of black-ops, undercover missions and classified work.</p>

<p>Pieczenik’s assertion that Bin Laden has been dead for years is also backed up by a myriad of other intelligence professionals and heads of state, including Former CIA officer and hugely respected intelligence &amp; foreign policy expert Robert Baer, as well as former FBI counter-terror head Dale Watson, who have all gone on the record to state that Osama was dead long before the raid on his alleged Pakistani compound earlier this month.</p>

<p>Even if this story were true (which its not, no doubt about it), why would the government not want free intel on potential terrorists.

<p>Not whatsoever. These are vetted people with experience in the field, especially pzinek (however you spell it).

<p>Those are well known fakes for numerous reasons, but particularly the fact that he gets younger and younger with each video.</p>

<p>That&#39;s laughable. I remember seeing pictures of Sadam&#39;s dead sons faces on CNN, they were parading those pictures around all day. I was surprised and disgusted, and I have no sympathy for those men, I just found it disgusting that corpses were being treated like trophies. I never watched the hanging of Sadam, absolutely disgusting to treat any human beings death like that.</p>

<p>So yea, it&#39;s definitely not because of the graphic nature. Unless they absolutely annihilated his face with bullets or something, I don&#39;t get it.</p>

The pictures would immediately go viral and end up on t-shirts and bumper stickers without any way to stop it. The idea is to try and narrow the rift between East and West, and throwing up a middle finger after removing OBL isn&#39;t the way to do that. </p>

<p>Parading around the dead body of any Muslim, whether it be OBL or anyone else, would be a PR nightmare for the US government and would deeply offend most of the Muslim world regardless of politics. That&#39;s why you haven&#39;t seen the photos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone already corrected me on the live hanging of Saddam. But as far as the sons go, I saw that on TV myself, it&#39;s not something I wanted to see so I remember it pretty clearly. </p>

<p>For the life of me I can&#39;t find any footage of it being on live TV. Not too surprising considering this was 11 years ago. I can only find articles from 2003 showing their faces. Something kinda interesting that I&#39;ve learned during my search is that they actually reconstructed their faces because they were so badly damaged and many Iraqis didn&#39;t even believe that it was them.</p>

<p>Sorry I can&#39;t find any actual footage, I&#39;m just going off my memory. </p>

<p>edit: Got another link <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/07/24/sprj.irq.sons/">http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/07/24/sprj.irq.sons/</a> Unfortunately I can&#39;t view the video, I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s a clip from their live broadcast where they showed the pictures.

    <div class="md"><p>I looked it up and you are correct about his sons photos being released by the US. I did not know that, that is pretty interesting. Their deaths may not have been important to Americans, but both sons were notorious for torturing Iraqis so that may have had some reason, to get the locals on our side. As far as why their pictures were shown and Laden&#39;s were not, I do not have a good explanation for that. Some possibilities are that laden is wanted for religious reasons (is shia) and has many religious followers. Uday and his brother were not wanted for religious reasons and did not have any followers so trophying their bodies would have no negative consequences. Laden had and still has many followers </p>

<p>That&#39;s a great point. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know really anything about the Fedayeen, but they seemed to view this in a religious light.</p>

<p>&quot; Dubai-based Al Arabiya television broadcast footage of a group of masked men with automatic rifles who said they were members of Uday&#39;s notorious Saddam Fedayeen militia and vowed to press on with a jihad, or holy struggle, against US forces.</p>

<p>&quot;We pledge to you Iraqi people that we will continue in the jihad against the infidels. The killing of Uday and Qusay will be avenged,&quot; one said. He said their deaths &quot;will not decrease attacks against the Americans but rather increase them&quot;. </p>

<p>I pulled that quote from this article, which I was reading to get some understanding as far as why Rumsfeld released the photos. There are pictures of the Hussein brothers in that article, so if you aren&#39;t comfortable seeing that don&#39;t click.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah That&#39;s the one I meant.  Which sort of makes sense to me since there were both american and iraqi forces, both of which knew what a big deal it would be to get footage of this.  This was also at the advent of cellphone technology so I felt like it wasn&#39;t as anticipated.  </p>

<p>OP made it sound like it had full production value.  I was just saying I can see how this recording could be organic.  And Ghadafi&#39;s death would be recorded seeing as how it was mob justice.  Whereas Bin Ladin&#39;s supposed death was a special ops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>these people are so blind to the world. i just watched like 4 documentaries about 9/11 and its incredible that people dont know about this stuff. like one of the planes was a military plane! the real plane was taken out into the atlantic ocean and shot down! do you know how deep this goes?! and dont even get me started on pearl harbor, that has inside job written all over it. </p>

<p>i watched this documentary that said we put our own Japanese citizens in the planes and flew them into pearl harbor against their will. it just makes me so mad!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real conspiracy is the level of impunity with which the people in charge are able to operate because people will dismiss it, forget about it or turn it into a joke.  For instance, how many people made fun of conspiracy theorists when they discussed government spying years ago.  Lots of chuckles from that ridiculous notion.  Or, how many people rolled their eyes when both rappers and civil rights leaders were swearing that it was the government pushing crack into the ghettos during the 80&#39;s.  The Iran Contra scandal broke, showed that the CIA was indeed transporting large amounts of coke into the U.S. for distribution.  Zero fucks were given. How could they pull that off?  How could it be found out by the American people that it&#39;s government was the biggest drug dealer around and nothing was done?  That wasn&#39;t a conspiracy theory btw, that shit was documented fact.  It&#39;s still going on.  I know you are going to keep trolling.  Nothing I say will change that.  But, you should at least ask yourself why you are doing it. You know that you are being lied to on some level, you know that all of the shit that is happening in places like Greece, Spain and Ireland isn&#39;t going to stop at their borders.  It&#39;s one thing to be complacent about it or dismiss it.  But you are actively trying to disrupt people who are talking about it.  I mean, don&#39;t you get a little annoyed when you turn on the news to find out what is going on in the Ukraine and they are discussing Kim Kardashian&#39;s new haircut?  Or standing next to Justin Beiber reading tweets to him from his fans.  That shit seriously doesn&#39;t make you question anything? I&#39;m not saying that you have to believe in conspiracies about 9/11 or Pearl Harbor.  I discuss shit in here all the time without believing anything one way or the other.  But you do have to know that Justin Beiber&#39;s tweets are being read to you while new revelations about the NSA are coming out everyday.  You get that right?  You seriously don&#39;t want to dig any deeper?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone already corrected me on the live hanging of Saddam. But as far as the sons go, I saw that on TV myself, it&#39;s not something I wanted to see so I remember it pretty clearly. </p>

<p>For the life of me I can&#39;t find any footage of it being on live TV. Not too surprising considering this was 11 years ago. I can only find articles from 2003 showing their faces. Something kinda interesting that I&#39;ve learned during my search is that they actually reconstructed their faces because they were so badly damaged and many Iraqis didn&#39;t even believe that it was them.</p>

<p>Sorry I can&#39;t find any actual footage, I&#39;m just going off my memory. </p>

<p>edit: Got another link <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/07/24/sprj.irq.sons/">http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/07/24/sprj.irq.sons/</a> Unfortunately I can&#39;t view the video, I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s a clip from their live broadcast where they showed the pictures. I can&#39;t even view the gallery, the link is dead.</p>
