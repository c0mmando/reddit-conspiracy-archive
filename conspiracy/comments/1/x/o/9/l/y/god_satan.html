       What if that is the big secret? That the modern religion is a lie and swindled millions of people to follow and worship satan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems far fetched. Possibly retarded. But doing some digging on it brings up some interesting theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts or additional info on this?

       That is kind of what the gnostics believe. If you haven't read the apocryphon of John I would suggest you do. It's extremely interesting.

       I've always used a similar argument to discredit portions of the bible. Because Lucifer exists, how can we trust what is written in any book? If Lucifer has the power to deceive, we can presume he would use it. In all reality, humans don't know shit. We're just apes with pants.

       I agree, I do think that the Bible is mostly accurate and speaks in  broad metaphors for the average man back then to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if Satan is just as powerful as God, which I think he is. And all of man is inherently corrupted (Original Sin) then for sure the Devil tried to corrupt the Bible, and was probably somewhat successful.  Strict Christians would argue "Divine Inspiration" and the Bible is perfect.  But the modern Bible was basically chosen by the Catholic Church, which at the time was one of the most corrupted structures in the world.

      <p>
       “Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?” – Epicurus

       Well the jews sure look up to him for being a genocidal, murderous maniac who told his people to kill kids, women and to save the virgins for themselves. Yea he's alright. Oh and don't forget slavery was A-ok. What a GGG.

       I'm atheist but I like this outside-of-the-box kind of thinking regardless of the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me wonder. Religious people, if they truly believe, think there is gonna be a day of judgment. Imagine their reaction when it's the Devil. A humorous thought.

       That's kind of what my vision was. End times happen and everyone is like "Yay!" and the Devil rises up from the ground and everyone is like "Whut."
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't subscribe to atheism because I don't think anyone really knows the answer to why we are here. Atheism would indicate (to me) that you are taking "higher being" completely out of the equation....and I don't think we are there yet.

       The gospel of Jesus (hidden in plain sight) is that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are God. That is to say, you are divinity itself, that same energy that created the universe. That's you, expressing itself in the here and now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan worship is the putting of man before God, or in this way of understanding things, the separate ego before the divine unity of all things. Certainly with how the church frightens people into putting the salvation of their own souls before anything else, it seems like the church is "Satanic" in this sense.

       No, Satan's doctrine is not "you are God" but "you don't need God." Serve yourself, not him. Satan is not about realizing one's own divine unity.

       I am with most people here.

       They are stories that had good intentions. I have even had a Priest(?) of a Hindu Temple by me tell me while giving me a tour, that most of their practices and prayers are actually based on science and the stories behind them are to get the general population to follow along. I know people are simple now, but imagine way back when; when even a bic lighter would have blown someones mind.

       Take not eating pork in religions, some see it as a health benefit as its fatty. Then you have taking off shoes when entering buildings; it prevents the transfer of dirt/bacteria from outside. Take a look at the way devout religious people pray a lot of it is up/down repetitions and stretching; which is good for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have always had that sort of view with religion and try to live by the golden rule; Treat others as I would want to be treated.

       Interesting. That is the golden rule. I think many people say they live by that rule, but don't actively practice it, unfortunately.

       I try to practice it to the fullest extent that I can. It is not always easy and sometimes seems useless. But every now and then it does pay off.

       Lucifer.  Satan is not a being.  Just like god, Satan is but a concept.

       So, people worship the concept of Satan while they actually think they worship the concept of God. Whichever way you want to put it.
