       Is it the notion that a conspiracy that big is impossible?  That our leaders would never hurt Americans?  I am really curious to know.  Every single person that I know of that has researched the subject has had to alter their view of the event, but I see quite a few people here who still believe the official story.  What are the most compelling pieces of information that make you sure that you are right?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  also what are your thoughts on WTC7?

       Your first point is the main critique I hear. There's no way such a big conspiracy could exist without it being leaked.

       or the fact that outside of the government saying "we did it", there is tons of shit that make the whole situation pretty sloppy looking. So because the gov't hasn't literally said "you caught us, we did it", they some how think that means it was air tight? no, it wasn't perfectly executed. yes, there are still lots of unanswered questions. they are just ignoring it until it hopefully goes away.

       Yes, we have numerous examples of how good the govt is at keeping secrets; they are masters of "compartmentalization".  It kept Manning and Snowden from stealing millions of pages of info, didn't it ?  And the govt prevented Aldrich Ames from selling some of our top secrets, names of agents in Russia, for $1 million or so, didn't it ?  Govt is great at keeping secrets.

       Compartmentalization is the exact reason Snowden matters. He realized what sad going on and spoke out about it. An example of what happens when compartmentalization fails.

       Not to mention all of the rivalries between agencies.  And rivalries between officials.  If there really had been a conspiracy about 9/11, someone in CIA would have leaked the evidence to make the FBI look bad, or some Democrat in Executive Branch would have leaked the evidence to make the Republican administration look bad.

       How did the Kennedy assassination work out?

       It does work if only a handful at the top have all the accurate details. People can be suicided as time goes on if need be.

       I'm fairly certain that a same unnamed family has ties to both that and 911.

       Left vs. right is for the proles. They play within their own system, and I dont think many involved are even aware of it, or even care. It pays their bills, and does wonders at dividing the masses.

       This is a FACT
      </p>
      <p>
       28 pages of a 9/11 report linking the Saudi Arabian goverment directly to the attacks  are 100% Redacted . This would make the event an Act of War which would warrant a full scale response by the United States of America and would change the course of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       But earlier last year, Reps. Walter B. Jones, R-N.C., and Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., were given access to the 28 redacted pages of the Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry (JICI) of 9/11 issued in late 2002, which have been thought to hold some answers about the Saudi connection to the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I was absolutely shocked by what I read," Jones told International Business Times. "What was so surprising was that those whom we thought we could trust really disappointed me. I cannot go into it any more than that. I had to sign an oath that what I read had to remain confidential. But the information I read disappointed me greatly."

       I tend to believe the Islamic terrorist story because the implications from a conspiracy of that magnitude would be enormous. What motivation is worth the risk? Money? The alleged conspirators have infinite money. Why would they kill 3,000+ people for money at the risk of the public finding out it was fake? I don't know if there has been a "consensus" reached in the conspiracy community regarding a motive, but I haven't heard a believable one.
      </p>
      <p>
       A group of Islamic radicals wanting to destroy the symbols of the United States is actually believable. After decades of imperialism nations tend to become magnets for these sort of things. If there's a conspiracy involved, it was allowing terrorists to accomplish the mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think government take advantage of crises to their benefit. They steer the dialogue, create new legislature, and tighten down on citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it all depends on the "grand" conspiracy and the level that TPTB play on. If aliens or Lucifer are running the show, anything is possible. But, for all intents and purposes, I like to grasp at reality as much possible.

       What about the part where the bin laden family is neck and neck with Saudi royalty, who are terribe fucking people. How about Russia invading Afghanistan? How about America arming and training the mujahideen/Taliban to stop Russia in Afghanistan? Who was the leader of the resistance of against Russia? Osama bin Laden was. That's right. Osama bin Laden fought against Russian invasion and future imperialism, and 20 years later he said "fuck it! Lets have America invade Afghanistan, instead!"

       Bin Laden had nothing to do with 9/11. He released a statement the next day saying "wasn't us, whoever did it did it for personal reasons." Dick Cheney is on record saying "we never made the case that bin Laden was behind 9/11". Bin Laden was top of the fbi most wanted list for the uss Cole and the embassy bombings, 9/11 was never one of the charges against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, Bin Laden was just a symbol. A symbol used to deflect from the real culprits. Saudi Arabia and Israel in collusion.

       The first part of my post is a matter of record. The second part is speculation based on recent revelations of Bandar bin Sultans threats against Sochi. So I'll take downvotes, but I believe I'm correct and will be vindicated in the civil suit.

       Hey, I'm curious about something.  Let's say for sake of argument that Bin Laden was killed in 2001 or 2002 or thereabouts.  So govt had this in their back pocket: at any time they needed a boost, a win, they could stage a fake SEAL attack or missile strike or something and claim "we just killed Bin Laden !".
      </p>
      <p>
       So, 2004, Bush is in a fairly tight race against Kerry (margin of victory was about 2.5%, which means a 1.25% change makes it even).  Doesn't pull out the "Bin Laden killed" card.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2007/2008, economy is crashing, Bush's legacy is looking like toast, the Republican candidate is going down to defeat.  Bush and R's don't pull out the "Bin Laden killed" card.
      </p>
      <p>
       In LATE 2008, Bush still in office, Obama is president-elect, why leave the "Bin Laden killed" card for HIM to play later ?  Bush and R's don't pull out the "Bin Laden killed" card.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the "Bin Laden killed" card finally IS played, in 2011, not much changes.  Wars still go on, Al Qaeda still is great brand name, lots of terrorist groups everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all doesn't make sense to me.

       Those are valid questions. Unfortunately I can't provide an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the most believable statement was from Benazir Bhutto. Who was former prime minister of Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a 2007 interview on BBC she stated the Bin Laden was murdered in 2007. I think she even gave the name of the person who did it. That part was edited out of the BBC broadcast and she was not much later assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if it makes you feel better that we weren't the boogey man on this one, and perhaps felt like it should have been us that did the murdering? At that point though something would have to be done to bring the Osama situation to a close on the american front.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about the death in 01' or 03' things. I don't see any motive for Bhutto making the statement she did, unless she knew or thought it was factually true. She stated it matter of fact, and then moved on with the rest of the interview. I dont think it was something she dropped the bomb on just to inflame people.

       Another thing: why did "they" decide that May 2011 was the time for Bin Laden to "die" ?  Why not keep him alive, so they can keep waving him in front of us as a threat, to get more money for the military etc ?

       Who do anything they do. I'm sure only some are privy to the factual background story. If he was in fact already dead, without revealing the truth, they would have to bring the ordeal to end. People aren't going forget about Osama since he was portrayed as the leader behind the biggest event on american soil since Pearl Harbor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like flight 93. Rumsfeld addmited it was shot down. It also fits within the original times the shoot down order was in effect. They made them national heros instead. I don't necessarily disagree with what they did, but it shows how they take things and spin it for what ever purpose is convenient at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bhutto said he was murdered. Its possible it wasn't something that they had any discretion in. If she was being honest, and I see no motivation for her not to be.

       If OBL was dead, and "they" were faking that OBL was still alive, why did they EVER "kill" him, and why in May 2011 ?  Why not keep pretending he was alive, to keep all the military and security spending going, and keep the fear going ?

       OK, so you're saying they DID keep a massive secret (more than one, 9/11 and Bin Laden and probably JFK and others) for years, but then by 2011, "not every one can keep a secret" ?  Don't secrets get EASIER to keep as time goes by, memories dim, witnesses die ?
      </p>
      <p>
       And they needed Bin Laden as a bogeyman to keep it going for years, but then in 2011 didn't need him any more ?  What changed ?  Military companies and intel agencies got tired of collecting all that money and having all that power ?

       Lol. I don't think they get tired of collecting money. Do you?

       I don't think keeping Osama a secret is as big a secret as some of the others you mentioned, but thats my opinion.

      <p>
       I agree I think secrets do get easier with time. People die, jump out of buildings, etc..

       This is all my supposition anyways, but maybe someone in office wanted to do some political grandstanding and bring the situation to an end? Thats a lot of brownie points for bringing that one to an end. Perhaps the only thing hes done while in office that the majority perceive to be a good thing?

       I don't know. A lot more evidence points to he was already dead. Thats all I'm saying.

       Yeah, and I'm just saying A) I haven't heard ANY convincing evidence, just supposition and innuendo, and B) the supposed reasons and timing for his real-death and then fake-death don't make any sense to me (as I've outlined in this thread).

       Well if you're definition of convincing evidence is the gov apparatus coming out and admitting it, I don't think you'll ever get that. Your only evidence is that Obama and associated media tentacles made the claim that it was the raid in 2011.

       They make sense to someone aware of politics and the backroom stuff. I think a lot of people on this forum would agree, and if you disagree so strongly find another forum where they support your line of rational. There are many subreddits to choose from. Perhaps conspiracy isn't your strong suit?

       In all likelyhood the event was used at the pretense for shifting focus to the middle east. It was needed to extends somes world view of the empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       To think many people didn't profit directly from this is foolish. The MIC grew from 01' to 03' before the invasions and in many ways hasn't been abated. Many suppliers and contractors now have quite a bit of business. Oil and US companies got the contracts for the iraqi oil wells, in addition to rebuilding the country after we bombed the shit out of it. It allows us strategic middle eastern vantage points to constrict Ru and Iran and support Israhell.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion is it was the saudis, and possibly mossad and double agents from within our own intel. This was treason on the highest level, and an act of war.

       Increased power, increased surveillance, increased profits for the MIC to further solidify their hold on politicians. Fulfills a reason to invade afghanistan and iraq, and gain greater control over the middle east resources, and build bases closer to russian and china.

       For me, the crucial part of the whole 9/11 story is that there are so many different pieces of it. To believe the official version of one part isn't to believe the whole story. I believe large chunks of the official story, but there are some things that don't fit or need explanation before I can even consider them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the story that the planes brought down the towers, with no explosives involved, but I would like a better explanation of how that happened. I think it's likely that the buildings just weren't built to the tolerances claimed, and that any admission of that would invalidate the insurance claim on the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the plane that crashed in the field did indeed crash with all the passengers aboard, but I believe that it's likely the plane was shot down to avoid it hitting another major target like the White House / Washington DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the attack was perpetrated by terrorists against the US, but I believe that there were a lot of people aware that such an attack was going to happen. I think that the reason the public wasn't made aware was so that there was no mass panic unless there was 100% certainty. They sure as hell weren't going to shut down/evacuate the entire of NYC. But I'm certain that lots of people were expecting a major terrorist action and that the nature of the attack was made clear to some individuals a few days before it happened as a 'very strong possibility'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the Pentagon was hit, but I'm highly sceptical as to why there's no video/images been released of it.

       I just think there are too many stories out there. I don't even know what the "official" one is, anymore. I, personally, am not sure how far we can draw conclusions before we reach the realm of conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I know there is no sure thing as a final conclusion, due to the nature of science and the fact that not information is known, I do have some points that I current hold above others until there exists contradictory scientific evidence:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The World Trade Center, Pentagon and field in Pennsylvania were all the sites of plane crashes on 9/11/2001.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The World Trade Centers (including 7) fell due to structural failure brought on by damage from the impact and subsequent fires.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The most compelling pieces of evidence are, of course, the video evidence and eyewitness testimony. As a scientist, I'm open to opposing views, as that is the best way to disprove a hypothesis. However, after reviewing countless "Truther" videos, I found their methods flawed and unable to provide a coherent argument for an "inside job".
      </p>
      <p>
       For those interested, the biggest flaw I find in "Truther" videos is their heavily-edited footage, along with limited camera angles (when others exist that would show more detail that happens to disprove the narrative).

       Have you actually watched more than a popsci amatuer debunking of the evidence, because if you have you would realize just how much of a joke the official story is. Even if you can point out flaws in "truther" arguments half the time, I can point out flaws in the official story nearly 100% of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only factual part of the official story is that planes his the twin towers, the rest is up for debate. Especially the pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know for a fact they have more than one shitty security booth camera watching the building, yet for some reason the FBI and other government agencies immediately confiscated every video of the event and classified it ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as eyewitness testimony, how about the firefighters, and witnesses that heard explosions in the basements of the twin towers before the planes even hit? How about barry jennings?

       No, I think the official story is that debris hit WTC 7 and created a 10-story gash in the building, then there were fires that burned for a long time.  Weren't there also big fuel tanks inside the building ?

       You should read the NIST report.  They specifically said that debris damage did not cause the collapse.

       Wasn't my comment you were responding to.  I was simply pointing out that claiming the official story mentions debris as a cause for the collapse is false.

       No. The "official story" states that even though the debris hit the building, it did not initiate the collapse. It also states that even if there were 0 debris impact, the building would have collapsed from a similar fire. It also states that fuel oil fires did not play a factor.

       All valid points of view and can see you are not just blindly taking information given without searching on your own. Here is one question I have for you regarding your point on limited camera angles: the ONLY camera angle of the Pentagon crash is a blurry 3 second clip. That right there in all honesty is enough to make me extremely worried about what truly went on that day. And I don't buy the response "the camera angles were confiscated and are not for the public to see". Being from DC I know the amount of security and sheer number of buildings in the Pentagon area. And were given a blurry clip that no one can truly make out? I am not even convinced of what exactly happened at that site (missile theory, etc) but know that video is patronizing at best and makes me lose all faith in those with the real information.

       I don't know where you got this number from, all you need to do is shut off the receiver and fly it out into the ocean, pretty easy to do especially considering all planes at that time and several years before then had the capability to use remote control systems designed to be used in the case of a hijacking (planes today still have this option).

       Not if it's flown into the ocean or (more likely) landed at some small airport and never seen again. So...zero.

      <p>
       If you fly low enough, especially near the appalachian mountains (and of course if you know where radar stations are ahead of time) and turn off your transponder, it's quite easy to avoid any and all eyewitnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a few people saw a plane flying low, but it wouldn't be THAT low.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...maybe 20 people at most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between black ops (who are obviously all in on it) and a few people in cheney's bunker (

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y

       ), you really need only a dozen or maybe 30 people at the most to pull off an operation like this (concerning just the plane switch).

      <p>
       The only crew at the pentagon was a pre planned group of individuals that rolled out some wreckage and a piece of an engine. Eyewitness accounts of the scene even point out how they came out of seemingly nowhere and all of a sudden there was smoke and wreckage where before there was just smoke and fire from the explosion.

       Well according to NIST, the collapse of WTC 1 &amp; 2 destroyed the water lines that would have helped with fire suppression, and it sparked the fires inside the building,  but the damage wasnt the direct cause of the building's collapse.

       No one has been able to explain why bin laden forced an invasion of Afghanistan ~20 years after he specifically fought off a country that was communist and the "the enemy." America hasn't been regarded as a honest and respected country for a while now. That is, unless you're a white American from the 50s-80s. Did a wealthy business man really think "well you know, if I do attack the Americans, they probably won't do anything." 9/11 wasn't a terrorist attack by any means. It was a spark for a natural gas explosion. 
Afghanistan fights Russian occupation with American influence and training ---&gt; Afghanistan freedom fighter attacks America causing an imperialistic invasion of afghanistan by America? Seems completely fucking backwards to me. Illogical. Especially for a man who built tunnels through some of the most dangerous mountains in the world. You know, with the largest constructin company ever. Where's the science?

       So, you're saying the 800 or so (I don't know the number) of people supposedly on those 4 airplanes were taken somewhere and murdered in cold blood ?  People in airports saw the passengers board, I assume, and some passengers were in cell-phone contact during the flights.  There couldn't have been much time to do a switch.  Other jet airliners, remote-controlled, were obtained from somewhere, and the originals destroyed later ?  Seems like the conspiracy would have to be getting pretty enormous and complicated.

       this is a picture of the passengers and "terrorists" boarding the "south" terminal at dulles airport, in the morning, the sun set from east to west, as you can see, these people are boarding on the north terminal. Look for compartmentilization within the government. Specifically the manhattan project, those who worked on the bomb "I would not have agreed to do this work knowing the end product."

       If you're looking at the observations that only the government is pointing out then sure, it's most likely to be correct. When you bring up other evidence and serious flaws in the official story, then you have a bit of a problem with the occams razor play.

       Merely because other theories require more complex models says nothing about the likelihood or evidence pertaining to the situation.

       Thats because we are working with theories. We know for a fact that the planes alone didn't take down the towers, for numerous reasons. As to what else helped, well thats just speculation because it's after the fact.

       It's like saying that you believe oswald was the only guy that shot kennedy because the theorists are unsure whether it was the grassy knoll or another location. That's irrelevant when it comes to the evidence that there was more at play than just oswald.

       NIST models were not based on factual science, and were simulations made up with an end goal in mind. No one that actually looks into the possible effect of the airliners and the heat created by the jet fuel/office fires has any doubt as to the outcome that would be created if there were no other factors.

       I'm not even going to go into the whole "melting steel thing" as everyone knows it didn't need to melt steel, just weaken it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that it is well known that the steel could not be weakened enough to destroy the structural integrity of the building to a point where the "pancake collapse" was initiated just from jet fuel/office fires alone. The science simply does not back this up. Even ex NIST employees admitted this.

       That's like saying that just because we can prove there was more than one shooter in the kennedy assassination, that it's irrelevant if we can't prove how many there were exactly, or exactly what kind of weapons they were using.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be the CIA or the Russians or what have you, but if I can't prove one 100% then I don't have strong evidence saying that it's not a lone shooter. Which is laughable...
      </p>
      <p>
       You're essentially arguing that if I can't prove 100% without a doubt EXACTLY how the towers came down, then there is no strong evidence for anything other than the official story. Which is some seriously lacking logic.

       However, you're not dealing "just from jet fuel/office fires alone," you're also dealing with something weighing over 150 tons, slamming into the side of the building at 500 knots. Buildings just aren't built with that kind of traumatic impact in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no denying that when the South Tower (say) collapsed, the collapse begins at or very near the point of impact:

      </p>
      <p>
       If you're saying this was not a result of the plane, then you would have to make one of those large leaps mentioned. For example, believing that the pilot - widely derided in this subreddit as inept - was capable of hitting, not just the building, but virtually the precise
       <strong>
        floor
       </strong>
       where pre-existing demolition charges were located.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's really what I mean by coming up with a better theory. There isn't one I have heard, which has less holes, requires less conjecture, and fits the known facts better than the official explanation.

       Actually, the world trade center WAS specifically built with that kind of impact in mind. And in the late 70s when it was completed was designed to withstand an impact from the largest passenger plane at the time. Now, the planes that impacted the WTC were larger, but not by much, and certainly not enough to break the threshold that the designers built into the structure as far as redundancy goes.

       That's because the pilot didn't pilot the plane into that specific area. It was remotely piloted. And don't even for a second tell me that's far fetched at all....

      <p>
       So let me get this straight. You claim that it wasn't designed for an airliner impact (which it was). Then you rightfully point out that the planes hit where the collapse initiated, which is true but is irrelevant to my claim that we know for a fact they were not the only reasons the towers came down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you talk about the pilot...which is irrelevant because the planes were remotely piloted (not a leap of faith whatsoever).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you summarize by saying come up with a better theory...when in reality the evidence still points towards there being other elements at play than just jets hitting the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you even look at my link above? It shows blatantly falsified science by NIST and essentially they just modeled what the government told them to...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet another classic example of someone coming into r/conspiracy and making a fool of themselves trying to make the government 9/11 story look like anything other than total bullshit.

       Yeah, and the

       Sarcasm aside, ihis does nicely illustrate the double-think of doubters. A 40-year old study is accepted in its entirety without apparent question, while something which posits a more conventional theory is subject to harsh scrutiny from every angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the big difference in the original study is that the WTC lead structural engineer
       <a href="https://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/EngineeringandHomelandSecurity/ReflectionsontheWorldTradeCenter.aspx">
        said
       </a>
       , "It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark." This is radically different from the 9/11 scenario of deliberate impact at the fastest speed possible, with the plane hitting it at a fraction of the velocity - and thus a fraction squared (probably one-tenth or less) of the kinetic energy. So, the WTC was
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       build to withstand the scenario which unfolded on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's arguable how "far-fetched" the remotely piloted claim is - certainly, the evidence
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       it is limited. But it's certainly an assumption, one of quite a few apparently needed to support the alternative theory. Indeed, if the collapse was not the result of the plane at all, then the entire hijacking basically becomes superfluous: it would have been much less convoluted a plot just to blow up a tower and blame terrorists.

       Your math doesn't pan out. Even at increased speeds, because of lighter materials and more fuel making up the majority of weight in the modern airliner, the majority of these materials essentially vaporized on impact in the initial fireball, leaving very little to affect the core columns.

       I am not suggesting anything as extreme as just accepting anything without question. I am merely pointing out that they WERE designed to withstand the impact of an airliner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you assume larger mass and speed that what they accounted for, it's not as if you are hitting a phone booth with a semi trailer going 100 miles an hour. The mass of the WTC towers was SO much larger than the planes that even if you do the physical calculations and look at how much kinetic energy it is, the sheer size and weight, and structural redundancy built into the WTC meant that the planes practically vaporized on impact. It's obvious in any of the videos that show the planes impacting, they LITERALLY disintegrated on impact. Thin aluminum and jet fuel. The amount of force that was left to do any kind of damage to the core columns was minimal. Which is why even in the NIST report they practically discounted the physical damage done from the airliner and blamed it all on office fires and jet fuel combining to weaken the steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings us back to the main point...intentionally falsified data, intentionally faulty models, and a 9/11 commission that was setup to fail according to the very members that served on it.

       Nope, it was a very intentional design decision to use planes, for numerous reasons, but particularly because it gave a reason to pass the patriot act and increase security at airports, and slowly ramp up the police state. Doing all of that just blowing up a building or two is not as feasible, for obvious reasons.

       Just occurred to me:  since 9/11, we've had two ENORMOUS leaks of classified docs straight out of the government: Manning (diplomatic cables) and Snowden (NSA stuff).  I haven't heard of ANYTHING from those massive leaks that supports any of the 9/11 conspiracy theories.

       I'll bet those leaks contain tons of info relevant to 9/11.  NSA because 9/11 happened well after the advent of the electronic surveillance age, with internet and cell-phones and email and such.  The diplomatic leaks because 9/11 led directly to the major diplomatic concerns of the time, the two Mideast wars and terrorism and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak
       </a>
       says "Dated between December 1966 and February 2010, the cables contain diplomatic analysis from world leaders, and the diplomats' assessment of host countries and their officials."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm unable to find anything about exactly what time period is covered by the documents leaked by Snowden.  But NSA certainly had major programs collecting data starting right after 9/11 (such as
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Wind_%28code_name%29">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Wind_%28code_name%29
       </a>
       ), and I'm sure figuring out who executed 9/11 was a major focus of their efforts.  So it's reasonable to assume the NSA has lots of data relevant to 9/11.

       Your mistake is assuming that the people planning and pulling off such a massive event were unaware of NSA surveillance at the time, which they were. Obviously none of the parties involved were stupid enough to use unsecured lines or to email plans...I would think this is obvious.

       Right, so now the conspiracy had to be hidden from NSA and State Dept and everyone they gather info from, foreign intel agencies and foreign diplomats and spies and foreign sources.  And they had to plant evidence that Al Qaeda did it into those places.  Sounds pretty unlikely to me.

       Is this a serious statement?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're running black ops at a higher and more expensive level than the CIA, avoiding the NSA and the state department is more than feasible. Same thing for foreign intelligence agencies (which, by the way, don't believe the government story about 9/11), and diplomats.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the entire purpose of these black ops agencies is to be effectively invisible from everyone and to pull off operations like these, it's more than feasible to hide your information from classic intelligence sources, at least until you pull it off, then everything gets out into the open, and you have the majority of intelligence agencies saying that 9/11 wasn't al qaeda at all.

       There wasn't any evidence at all it was Al Qaeda, particularly since its just a made up organization anyways. They simply blamed it on Al Qaeda, and OBL (even though he said he didn't do it), and then everyone takes them at their word.

       I believe planes piloted by "terrorists" hit the towers and pentagon causing the destruction, no charges or controlled demo, I even believe the "terrorists" may have had official support and assistance from the Saudi ruling party. However I believe the US government or at least a high up group inside the government knew well in advance and basically let it happen.

       no there is not evidence for both sides, there is only evidence of an inside job (inside job as a term is seen as a joke by most skeptics, but really what other term is there?)

       central stucture was cut/removed prior to the event, then demolition charges brought it down, the trusses which did remain attached pulled the facade in and it all came down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats for the 2 towers, as for bldg 7 thats even more obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no doubt in anyones mind that that one came down via controlled demolition.  I take that back.  Anyone that believes the official story for the 2 towers generally does doubt that bldg 7 was deliberate.

       I am here because I think talking to those who disagree with me is good, for me and for them and for society.  If you only talk to those who agree with you, you'll never learn anything.

       One nit-pick: it's not "trolling" if you really believe in what you're saying.  Trolling is when you say something you don't really believe, just to make people mad.

       Saying there is evidence for both sides of the story is like saying that the militaries of the United States and North Korea are about equal in terms of military strength because they have about as many or more ground forces than we do. Let's ignore all the other factors, and just focus narrowly on a minor statistic.

       There is virtually no evidence for the official story being true other than planes hitting the twin towers. All other "evidence" points towards the official story not being true.

       I could point out literally thousands of reasons, but some easy ones are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Dick Cheney giving the standown order on intercept fighters (fact) that prevented the hijacked planes from being shot down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxi cab driver on the bridge near the pentagon admitting it was planned and he was part of the setup (fact).
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST intentionally falsifying models (fact, according to ex employees) and the 9/11 commission being setup to fail (fact, according to it's members).
      </p>
      <p>
       Confiscation of security footage around the pentagon and refusal of FOIA requests to see the footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimony by expert pilots saying that the maneuvers the hijackers supposedly did on 9/11 were physically impossible, amongst other physical simulations showing this to be impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on and on. The number of holes, downright lies, and sheer impossible things supposedly done on 9/11 is truly ridiculous.

       I appreciate your reply, but the problem is that all of this "evidence" can still be questions and holes can still be found. Its certainly not "incontrovertible" proof.

       I'm unsure as to whether you're really this dense, or just naive. They intentionally hide information from the public and refuse FOIA requests on BASIC things such as security footage, and this doesn't seem fishy/complicit to you? Really?

       These guys barely passed flight school flying a single engine cessna. Thats worlds different than a massive airliner.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if it were true, the physical requirements for an airliner to make the descent into the pentagon (the twin towers have issues as well) make it a PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY. As in, the descent required, as far as physical laws go with an airliner of that size...it's not difficult. It's mathematically impossible.

       When you have a government that falsifies models intentionally, sets up a commission to lie to the public intentionally, and lies about numerous other key events throughout the day, how is this not "complicit"?
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of incontrovertible proof would you like? I would assume that intentionally setting up commissions to fail and to ignore the facts and intentionally lying about models and falsifying evidence would count as proof, but then again I guess you wouldn't settle for anything less than president bush himself saying it was all a setup....

       Really? Sounds like you just pulled that out of your ass. Only people in r/conspiracy that believe the official story are people that have never been here before/never looked into 9/11, or shills. Theres basically no in between. It's like the very first thing people learn when they come to this sub is about 9/11. It's not even remotely a question as to whether or not the official story was legitimate. It's like basic math.

       I read the posts, which is why I responded the way I did. It seems only new people who have never read the basics of 9/11 conspiracies are commenting in on why they believe the official government story. Things like "what does the government have to gain?" to "I believe that "islamic extremists did it" are pretty elementary opinions.

       I have not seen a single piece of convincing evidence that contradicts the official accounts.  I've heard TONS of innuendo, distorted stories or facts, outright fabrications and lies from the conspiracy theorists.  I've read lots of sites, talked at length online with half a dozen theorists.  Sorry, you guys don't have anything solid.

       If there really WAS solid, incontrovertible evidence, why hasnt anyone filed a lawsuit?

       The answer is: because the evidence presented is either total conjecture or completely circumstantial.

       However, this does not provide any evidence to support the hypothesis that the attack was perpetrated by the government. It only implies that there was corruption in the government that allowed the attack to take place.

       You asked for relevant cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously you cannot take things to court when the very commission that investigated 9/11 was "setup to fail" (in the words of a commission member) and was a whitewash from the beginning. They basically just wrote down the government story, and ignored everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is common knowledge. How do you expect anyone to take a case to court when the very government running the courts setup the investigative commission to fail?
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely you can't expect an actual lawsuit to come out into the open when the truth has been so heavily suppressed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps years later it will come out into the open (when no one gives a shit) just like it did when a circuit court found nearly 30 years later that "U.S. Government Agencies" found guilty in MLKs death:
