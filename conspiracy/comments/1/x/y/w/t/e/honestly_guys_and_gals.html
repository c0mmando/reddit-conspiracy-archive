       Things are being done. There are guys working on a movement to turn the water and power off for the NSA data-center. (offnow.org I believe)

       <strong>
        This rant is not directed at you personally, just at the tone of your post that I have seen repeated in other places as well:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop using the term "we".  If you want things to change, do something about it. I'm not saying you have to protest and get arrested, but simply contributing to change is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a Canadian, and I started a political blog some time ago.  I decided it would be a good place to start exposing the clear lack of transparency in various places of government.  I also am a strong supporter of independents and small parties that do care about the rights of the citizens.  This is my current outlet, however I am always looking for more things I can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       My purpose of telling you this, is that you are an individual.  You have the power to affect change without asking permission.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need anyone's approval to start affecting change.  Even if your solutions are unpopular, at least you are trying.  If you truly want freedom, start acting like you are.

      <p>
       So you fault me for trying to understand by asking questions?

        You are incompetent at raising awareness and thus you are a distraction, a shill.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While you may point at the privy council, there are other issues at play. For example, I pointed out on my blog how workers in Canada have to compete with 3rd world labour due to free trade agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Different people have different focuses. My goal is to empower everyday average people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I visit this sub to understand about conspiracy topics. I never claim to have all the answers. It's called Politcs, ideas &amp; People not "deep candian conspiracies."
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of needlessly attacking me for being a shill when I'm here to learn about the issues, you could actually explain what's so wrong with the privy council.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead you'd rather argue with someone who commented in this thread to show people that they can make a difference.
