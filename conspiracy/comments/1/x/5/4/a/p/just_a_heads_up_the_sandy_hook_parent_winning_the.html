&quot;Stop singling out relatives of the students who were killed. I get it, there&#39;s interesting stuff to discuss surrounding this event. But just because you can search for someone&#39;s extended family and jobs and what have you online doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not personal information.

    <div class="md"><p>We have been asked by two admins in the past 5 days to pull threads related to Sandy Hook victims. </p>

<p>The first request was by cupcake1713 and the second was by hueypriest. Any questions you have regarding the removals really need to be addressed by them.</p>

<p>The one big thing that is not okay by me is manipulation of the free flow of information. But they own the site and they have enumerated rules against supplying personal information which are (on the whole <em>ahem predditors tumblr</em>) applied evenly across the entire site. As such, if they want to come into this sub and pull a thread they have the right to do that. </p>

<p>They were kind enough to offer us explanations and a dialogue when they have pulled these two threads and, as far as I know from my habitual reloading of this subreddit, they have not touched any other content here in my tenure as a mod.</p>

<p>You become an admin the same way you become senior management at any company.  You get hired because you&#39;re qualified to do work.  You work hard and provide a niche skill or other asset and you rise through the ranks.  You&#39;re acting like reddit is run by shadow assassins.  It&#39;s just a website.</p>

</ol>

<p>FTR, the last two detailed Sandy Hook posts were removed by two different admins. They have been courteous, and they send us mods a note explaining their action and the reasons behind it.</p>

<p>The first time this happened, the post was <em>full</em> of personal information. The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users noticed the post was removed almost immediately and began demanding answers.</p>

<p>This time, as soon as the admin messaged us about removing it, I made this self post because I was sure it would be missed, as it was reaching the top of the sub.</p>

<p>Granted, this time there was less personal information, but ultimately it&#39;s not our decision.</p>

<p>My advice would be to stay clear of detailed Sandy Hook posts. These seem to be targeted the most.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t give more information initially, if you have any more questions please ask and I&#39;ll do my best.</p>

&quot;Stop singling out relatives of the students who were killed. I get it, there&#39;s interesting stuff to discuss surrounding this event.

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to publicly say that I got a very genuine, honest explanation from <a href="/u/hueypriest">/u/hueypriest</a> regarding privacy rules and the reason my other post was removed, and to be honest, I may not completely like it, but I do get it.</p>

<p>The subjective issue of what is private and what isn&#39;t is completely based on so many things that it can be hard to determine what to post, what we can&#39;t etc.  I can see where if I owned/managed a business, and was afraid of a wealthy family&#39;s lawsuit, or negative publicity of injured reputations, I might want my users to use a little more suave with the method of their posts. </p>

<p>I think it is a good reminder for us- <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> discusses REAL life things, that involve very real people, and we have all got to look out for one another, and ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;m the person who posted both threads. I am not trying to hide behind one account or the other. I was <a href="/u/QuebecMeme">/u/QuebecMeme</a> and I am obviously <a href="/u/mindsequalone">/u/mindsequalone</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/u/hueypriest">/u/hueypriest</a> removed my recent post about Sandy Hook. I did not post any addresses, dates of birth or pictures. I did not post anything other than names and winnings I had copy and pasted from the Lottery website. Which I provided a link for.</p>

<p>I mentioned, and was specifically careful, THAT I DID NOT post any phone numbers, or addresses. </p>

<p>I messaged hueypriest and he deleted the message thread and did not reply.</p>

<p>I did not know until tonight, but he is Reddit&#39;s manager and one of Time&#39;s most influential people of the year, and I&#39;m sure this thread makes some people a tad nervous about legal issues. I understand the eggshells upon which we walk, and the CYA it takes to run things.</p>

<p>However, my last username which was really important to me was instantly banned with no warning, no message, not just taking down that one post. </p>

<p>I literally got tears in my eyes, bc as that username I&#39;d made friends on here, connections, and I am sad that is gone.</p>

<p>This SH lotto thread from today, I truly believed, was done in taste and with care for identities. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not releasing names the press didn&#39;t release or anything along those lines.</p>

<p>Everything I&#39;ve learned I&#39;ve found on public websites. </p>

<p>I will not be posting anything more about Sandy Hook and corruption so that I can enjoy pictures of cats in sweaters and Futurama memes.</p>

<p>Any feedback is welcome. </p>

<p>Please remember, it was NOT the mods of this sub who pulled my post, it was the Manager of Reddit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m awaiting replies about what THEY define as personal, and I asked how THEY would suggest I post my info. <a href="/u/reostra">/u/reostra</a> is the only one who replied and he said &quot;the last account and your most recent post were deleted for the <em>massive</em> amount of personal information on them.&quot; I can see my errors with my <a href="/u/QuebecMeme">/u/QuebecMeme</a> post. But this one was just names and dates of winnings pretty much.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> for taking the time to post this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m feeling a bit lonely and disheartened over all this... Thanks for &#39;listening&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for coming back, it&#39;s actually much appreciated! </p>

<p>We&#39;re not faulting you personally for this decision, I think the issue is that it&#39;s such a murky territory, the whole &quot;personal&quot; information thing, that many users are unclear about where exactly the line is that shouldn&#39;t be crossed.</p>

<p>I realize that sometimes it&#39;s difficult to make a set of rules for this sort of thing, and ultimately it must be decided on a case by case basis, but I&#39;m sure you can understand the confusion and frustration that someone like <a href="/u/Mindsequalone">/u/Mindsequalone</a> must be feeling after having two posts removed and his first account shadowbanned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if I looked at this correctly, the biggest problem with the most recent post there is no actual proof connecting the person who works for the lottery to the kid. Just because they have the same last name doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re actually related. So that&#39;s a piece of personal info that immediately goes against the site rules as they are obviously <em>not</em> someone directly related to the event. Then the post went on to mention that extended family of one of the victims lived on the same street as so and so etc etc. </p>

<p>It really shouldn&#39;t be that difficult to determine what is personal information or not. I think the problem here is more that people are trying to find a way to skirt the rules which are pretty well explained.</p>

<p>With all due respect, people might be a little peeved due to a perceived gradation in howin these rules are applied. </p>

<p>I have seen person information about users of this site stay up for 18 hours, eventually requiring a mod-lead revolt to stop the spread. But for the Sandy Hook victims you and Erik were right here, right away? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info and investigative work, it was compelling. It seems obvious that the course of action is to post the info at a website and then link to it. Not sure if you are aware of <a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/">Memory Hole</a> which is dedicated to suspected false flag events like Sandy Hook and is well moderated.</p>

<p>Please post your research somewhere else on the web and let the community know where.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What &quot;happened&quot; was a classic government &quot;op&quot; in which we are meant to believe that MANY people were killed (shot multiple times actually) in an accurate fashion by a 140-lb autistic kid who was scared of the sound of leafblowers...but apparently had no problem with handguns (or shotguns, or AR-15s, or whatever lie &quot;they&quot; are pushing about what guns were used).</p>

<p>So, basically, an autistic kid dons MANY pounds of body armor, ammunition, weapons, and TAC gear then jumps into a school through a broken window...somehow achieving an INVERTED killed-to-injured-ratio...which special-ops shooters have a tough time with--so tough, in fact, it&#39;s basically considered impossible.</p>

<p>I guess to be a perfect shooter all those millions of dollars in training are useless...all you need is a mentally-disturbed autistic kid with no weapons training who&#39;s scared of loud noises and...<em>bang!</em> You now have a shooter that can out-perform nearly any special-ops shooter or paid assassin in the entire world.</p>

<p>Funny how that works, huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is one of the aspects of the story that I really can not believe. The wounded to kill ratio is too damn high. How convenient for the story that there are no wounded to give interviews for the television&#39;s programming. </p>

<p>&quot;Stop singling out relatives of the students who were killed. I get it, there&#39;s interesting stuff to discuss surrounding this event.

    <div class="md"><p>We have been asked by two admins in the past 5 days to pull threads related to Sandy Hook victims. </p>

<p>The first request was by cupcake1713 and the second was by hueypriest. Any questions you have regarding the removals really need to be addressed by them.</p>

<p>The one big thing that is not okay by me is manipulation of the free flow of information. But they own the site and they have enumerated rules against supplying personal information which are (on the whole <em>ahem predditors tumblr</em>) applied evenly across the entire site. As such, if they want to come into this sub and pull a thread they have the right to do that. </p>

<p>They were kind enough to offer us explanations and a dialogue when they have pulled these two threads and, as far as I know from my habitual reloading of this subreddit, they have not touched any other content here in my tenure as a mod.</p>
