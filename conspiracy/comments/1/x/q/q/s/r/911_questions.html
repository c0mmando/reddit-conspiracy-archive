<p>If I accept the premise that amateur pilots could not have made those flights then who flew the planes? Or if, as some people have suggested, the planes were swapped out for drones (a huge, unproven leap in my mind) what happened to those planes and all the people onboard? </p>

<p>If the claim is that the planes were remotely piloted by drone pilots, is there any evidence of 737s being operated remotely like that? Was it possible in 2001?</p>

<p>Also, the whole cell phone calls thing. If I accept that cell phones can&#39;t make call midflight then a) where were the calls made from and b) why would the people plotting this attack force the passengers to make cell phone calls to their family knowing full well that cell phone calls can&#39;t be made while in the air. That seems like a massive oversight in a highly complex operation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK&#39;s older brother was killed in a drone plane in WWII because it blew up prematurely.</p>

<p>&quot;Operation Aphrodite made use of unmanned, explosive-laden Army Air Forces Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Navy PB4Y-1 Liberator bombers, that were deliberately crashed into their targets under radio control.[3] These aircraft could not take off safely on their own, so a crew of two would take off and fly to 2,000 feet (610 m) before activating the remote control system, arming the detonators and parachuting from the aircraft.&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy,_Jr.">(wiki)</a></p>

<p>From &quot;Operation Northwoods&quot; 1962 a US military plan to start a war with Cuba:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Panama, or Venezuela. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non-scheduled flight.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a <strong>drone</strong>.</p>

<p>b. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. <strong>From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan.</strong> When over Cuba the drone will begin transmitting on the international distress frequency a &quot;MAY DAY&quot; message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO radio[14] stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the United States what has happened to the aircraft instead of the United States trying to &quot;sell&quot; the incident. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">(wiki)</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with the comparison between 9-11 and the Northwoods plan is that even though the military was able to conceive of a plan to fake an assualt on a commercial aircraft in order to start a war, they still didn&#39;t actually want to shoot down an aircraft filled with American citizens. The plan called for inside people with aliases to be on the planes, not regular old Americans as happened on 9-11. </p>

<p>That seems like a false equivalency to go from planning a fake assualt on a fake commercial flight to remotely flying an actual commercial flight into actual occupied skyscrapers. </p>

<p>Do you really believe that the government/military would never kill innocent people in order to achieve nefarius objectives? Are you really convinced that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0">they would never do such horrible things</a> to the point of rejecting the possibility?</p>

<p>I believe there is some evidence to show a large amount of MIC type employees on the planes.  Speculation is this is a great way to erase someone&#39;s past in preparation for a career in black ops.</p>

<p>Hard to prove someone works undercover when it&#39;s first priority is to not be discovered of his true job, BUT I am already stretching too much here so let&#39;s leave at this: there is no evidence to the contrary. Was just pointing out that your logic was forcing the realm of impossibility because you were assuming something that can also be false.</p>

<p>Same thing NIST did with investigating how fire collapsed the buildings instead of why did the buildings collapsed.</p>

<p>Well, that isn&#39;t even what I asked, you knowingly ignored the question and addressed out of proportions what was just a mere example for mutual understanding. I didn&#39;t even went to the recent drone scandals because I was trying to make this question very short, something that I thought you would appreciate. Would you care to try answering again or you&#39;d rather not answer it at all?</p>

<p>Sorry, too many useless discussions with r/tards/debunkers shaped my kind of talk this way.</p>

<p>So you concede that the american military does murder innocent people for nefarious purposes. The same military regime that upholds &quot;bravery&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;.</p>

<p>Still only one left: do you think the same about the government or there is just no way you will believe that the government would be capable of doing such things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not so sure those 3000 people died on 9/11. </p>

<p>I found a list of names and started looking down through it. The names all kinda seem contrived, overly ordinary like &quot;john smith&quot;, and when you start digging into the history of any of these people, it ends quickly. Most have very shallow histories.</p>

<p>Others have done this kind of digging too, and come to similar conclusions. Google 9/11 victims names&quot; or similar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why you have those questions (and probably more) is the result of 2 things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You still have some research to do because those might be already answered somewhere</p></li>
<li><p>We cannot answer yet because we, sadly, only have limited powers to investigate compared to the power that NIST and the 911 commission had</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Take into account that just because we haven&#39;t answered other questions yet doesn&#39;t meant that they cannot be explained, it just means that we hit a wall that is not letting us find out more. e.g. rejected FOIA requests for the NIST models data and pentagon confiscated tapes.</p>

<p>There is also something else that you might not know about another aspect of the story: How the hell did they even planted charges in the buildings?</p>

<p>This may vary when you do your research but I will give you this amazing coincidence example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He was really on a flight with his family back to Afghanistan the day after 9/11. He remained hidden until the Battle of Tora, where he escaped but grew ill etc. and died. </p></li>
<li><p>he&#39;s never been found and the story about how he was found was to restore some civilian confidence back in our government. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>1.) The planes were drones and not flown by any terrorist. Pilots for 9/11 truth prove this. Watch their videos. Just to wet your whistle, the plane that hit the south tower was going 500 knots. The max speed of this plane is something like 400 knots (my numbers are off slightly but not by much). This is a physical impossibility for a standard non-military jetliner.</p>

<p>2.) This has been answered. Yes.</p>

<p>3.) My speculation is purely for emotional reasons. They have &quot;tapes&quot; of people telling family they love them to make it that much more heart wrenching. The story of flight 93 is totally made up. They even made a movie about it. Total propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the plane that crashed in PA was shot down by the military, then the story about them rising up against their captors was created to give them a heroic status in trade for having been shot down. I doubt the government would concede they shot it down, even if it was to save more lives on the ground. Instead of causing some great debate on whether or not it should have been shot down they would rather not tell the public.  </p>

<p>It could have easily been done by computer control.</p>

<p>Yes there is evidence of computer controlled airliners before 9/11. No I can&#39;t find the video of it tonight. Here the exact scenario is played out and shown  on television before 9/11, in the summer of 2001</p>
