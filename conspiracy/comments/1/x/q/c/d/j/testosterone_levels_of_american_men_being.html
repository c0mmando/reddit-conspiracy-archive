    <div class="md"><p>Bisphenol-A (or BPA for short) is one of the chemicals causing lower levels of testosterone as well as the high incidence of breast cancer in females.  There&#39;s many, many articles on how BPA binds to the estrogen receptors and simulates higher estrogen levels effectively pussifying men (or making them more feminine).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bisphenol+a+estrogen+receptor+binding&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=sb">Google search: bisphenol a estrogen receptor binding</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be difficult to prove that with a scientific study, but... most likely, that is it.  For males, it just feminizes them a bit (perhaps even turning them gay), but imagine the females&#39; bodies on a continuous high of fake estrogen.  Every trait that defines a female would be exaggerated.  You&#39;d have super-sensitive, highly emotional, scandalous women on the prowl everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;most-likely&quot; the &quot;gay epidemic&quot; is caused by BPA in packaging? That sounds like a reasonable explanation for everything from the physical background of homosexual preference to the presumed socio-cultural &quot;widespread&quot; acceptance of homosexual lifestyles, BPA?

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have anything against gays, but if it&#39;s true, then it&#39;s true. I understand this is a touchy subject, but thankfully I can allow myself to speak about it without using a filter like most people. </p>

<p>Anyways, you&#39;re using a strawman at the moment...Not just BPA packaging, but many many things out there can flood your body with estrogen mimickers. Take soy for instance. I had a best friend who was gay, and he was one of those really feminine ones. His diet? He ate a lot of soy. Soy bacon, soy this, soy that. He also used a lot of different things like makeup, and a shitload of chapstick, and all kinds of lotions and stuff. All of those things have ingredients within them that flood your body with estrogen mimickers. </p>

<p>The truth is the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me stop you right there. </p>

<p>We do tend to assume that testosterone can contribute to agression, but we can&#39;t accurately comment on the mechanics that may exist there. Indeed, we cannot relaibly say that increased testosterone leads to increased agression, and we certainly can&#39;t find a link between high testosterone and violence (a physical form of agression). I don&#39;t know where you came up with the idea that resistance to obediance is a quality of testosterone, but it sounds tacked on. </p>

<p>I am also going to argue that <em>even if</em> the qualities you set forth were true, people with high levels of testosterone would be no more difficult to control than people with low levels of testosterone. If you are interested in why I take this position I&#39;d be glad to explain. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to clarify my previous position to avoid possible confusion. I think that people with higher aggression and violence are just as easy to control as people with lower aggression and violence. I&#39;m going to amend this statement slightly and take an even more extreme position. I posit that people with higher aggression and violence <strong>are easier</strong> to control than people with lower aggression and violence. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s why: The more aggressive and violent a person becomes, the less calm rational contemplation they employ. </p>

<p>How do you manipulate a man calmly reading Sergei Lukyanenko&#39;s <em>Night Watch</em>? There may be a number of ways, many of which include shifting him from his calm and logical state to a more emotional state.</p>

<p>How do you manipulate a man looking for a fight? This is much easier. You give him one. </p>

<p>To put it in terms you may be more familiar with; How do you manipulate a calm and rational nation? That would be a very difficult feat to accomplish. On the other hand, how do you manipulate an angry and violent nation? Much easier. Give them something to direct that aggression and violence at. Whip them into a frenzie, and this becomes even easier. Get them to abandon all logic and empathy and you can get them to do whatever you want.</p>

<p>This is why phrases like <em>blinded by rage</em> exist. Raw aggression and violence is predictable. Because it is predictable, it is easily manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are attributing the will to fight to testosterone. Would you say that a group of women, who typically have testosterone levels many times lower than the typical man, are nearly incapable of fighting for anything? Testosterone is a hormone that catalyzes the release of various chemicals in the body. These may contribute to the strength of an emotion or mental state but the hormone does not govern the emotions or mental state. </p>

<p>As I said before, a bunch of aggressive and violent people would be easily controlled and steered away from a rebellion of any kind. But since testosterone isn&#39;t linked to the will to fight, this point is moot. At best testosterone makes people more competative and aggressive and even these are not proven to be true. In fact, when looking at both sexes and aggression in general research has been largly inconclusive.</p>

<p>&quot;In men, high levels of endogenous testosterone (T) seem to encourage behavior apparently intended to dominate -- to enhance one&#39;s status over -- other people. Sometimes dominant behavior is aggressive, its apparent intent being to inflict harm on another person, but often dominance is expressed nonaggressively. Sometimes dominant behavior takes the form of antisocial behavior, including rebellion against authority and law breaking. &quot;</p>

<p>James Dabbs, Jr., studied 4,462 men in 1990 and found that &quot;the overall picture among the high-testosterone men is one of delinquency, substance abuse and a tendency toward excess.&quot; These men, he added, &quot;have more trouble with people like teachers while they are growing up, have more sexual partners, are more likely to have gone AWOL in the service and to have used hard drugs</p>

<p>Evidence that human behavior is partly governed by hormones is mainly restricted to correlations, which are not the same as causes. At least one experiment found that large doses of testosterone increased aggression but only for a small proportion of men. Young men who use anabolic steroids - a synthetic version of testosterone - are also more likely to be involved in violent crime. Taken together, such findings imply that high levels of testosterone can cause aggression in at least some men. Other evidence points in the same direction</p>

<p>Seems to, sometimes, often expressed non-aggressively, etc. It is mostly agreed that testosterone contributes to the tendancy to dominate (though nobody says it is the sole or even major contributor). However, the tendancy to rebel is dictated by <strong>far</strong> more than just high levels of testosterone, as indicated by the rebelious acts of women and younge children not yet saturated with testosterone. </p>

<p>Cool. I have some stuff that references Dabbs from Scientific American. Check this out.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What Dabbs didn&#39;t address was whether this correlation was the cause or an effect of the environment these men found themselves in. Which is to say, are high-testosterone males more likely to become violent criminals, or does being a violent criminal raise a man&#39;s level of testosterone?</p>

<p>No one really knows the answer, but a growing body of evidence suggests that testosterone is as much the result of violence as its cause. Indeed, both winning a sporting match and beating an opponent at chess can boost testosterone levels. (On the other hand, losing a sporting match, growing old and becoming obese all reduce levels of testosterone.)</p>

<p>&quot;The causal arrow goes both ways,&quot; says Peter Gray of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose own work shows that marriage and fatherhood lower testosterone levels. &quot;There&#39;s evidence in humans that, just as in animals, testosterone is responsive to male-male competition.&quot;</p>

<p>Now back to your post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidence that human behavior is partly governed by hormones is mainly restricted to correlations, which are not the same as causes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole rest of this paragraph just reiterates what I have been saying. It seems to correlate with increased aggression but we have not determined that it is the cause.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most militaries are men, and nearly every revolution throughout history has been entirely lead by men. Yes women aren&#39;t nearly as capable as men for fighting for something/ But that being said men and women are different, and women have different ways of manipulating things and getting their way.</p>

<p>Last time I checked, women make up around 20% of the US military. Sure its a minority, but 20% is still a significant percentage. There are also women like Gina Carano who could like put the hurt on nearly any violently aggressive, testosterone leaden inmate you put in the ring with her, based only on physicality and the will to fight (as opposed to whatever manipulation you were inferring).</p>

<p>Testosterone is there. We know it probably contributes to an increased desire to dominate. Higher levels of testosterone don&#39;t make you any less susceptible to control or manipulation, and testosterone is not nearly as closely linked to a rebelious attitude as you suggest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said there was a correlation, not a causation. Crime rate among small children and women? Yeah there are other factors leading to criminality but crime rates for small children and women are MUCH lower than adult males.</p>

<p>Women make up 20% of the military, out of a population of over 50% of the country. And how many of them are in active combat? Very few. Keep in mind the U.S. military is a volunteer military and anyone who gets through boot camp is a member.

<p>Well i said there was a correlation, which there is. That&#39;s about all i suggested. My overall post is not about high test persay, but increased test in general which all males would have if it wasn&#39;t for the recent environmental factors that have led men to have decreased test. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Men naturaly gain and lose testosterone throughout there lives. In fact, men experience lower levels of testosterone from very basic lifetime landmarks. Having children, settling down, aging, etc. So really, not all men would have high testosterone.</p>

<p>As to the criminality of women and children, I don&#39;t know how you made that connection. I never said women and kids are just as criminal as men. I said they are no less rebellious then men.</p>

<p>With the military thing; its true that men typically occupy the more combat oriented roles more than women. That doesn&#39;t mean the women are unwilling to fight. Interestingly, both the men and women in the military probably have higher than their baseline testosterone levels, probably as a result of rigorous physical conditioning and these levels don&#39;t necessarily reflect the levels they had before enlisting.</p>

<p>You may have only suggested a correlation between testosterone and certain aggressive qualities, but you did suggest a conspiracy to reduce the general testosterone levels of the population in order to make them more easily controlled. Which is to say you implied a causation between testosterone levels and susceptibility to manipulation. I refuted both the notion that testosterone is certain to increase aggressive qualities as well as the notion that the qualities you presented (aggression, violence, etc.) are qualities that make a person difficult to manipulate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There would be no difference.</p>

<p>Anyone has access to testosterone, or HGH.  If they were going to try and control steroids they would shut down anti-aging clinics which prescribe them to anyone over the age of 25ish.  I just don&#39;t see the correlation, coming from personal experience and the experience of people I know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but when EVERY SINGLE males T levels in the nation have been lowered, most aren&#39;t aware of it and taking medication to increase it takes time, money and effort, the overall effect is still a population with lower than natural T levels.

<p>I&#39;m really just speculating, you&#39;re right, i don&#39;t know much about endocrinology. But i&#39;ve read quite a bit about testosterone (trying to raise it naturally myself) and i understand that it not only has physical effects on a person, but mental effects as well.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I wouldn&#39;t really see the logic behind the whole thing.  It doesn&#39;t make people violent, I mean don&#39;t get me wrong I do feel more confident and a sense of well being on it.  Also, it doesn&#39;t really take much time or money.  Straight test, 500mg a week for 15 weeks (average cycle) I could get for 70 bucks of UG grade.  Pharmacy grade being sold on the street is actually cheaper then that. If we&#39;re talking about straight test I could take one with no ester attached and it&#39;ll immediately increase my test levels after I inject it so it doesn&#39;t really slowly increase unless you want it to be. </p>

<p>Where have you heard or saw that test levels are lower?  In relation to what?  I mean, it&#39;s natural for test levels to decrease with age that&#39;s why people jump on TRT or HRT.  I could get into details on how clinics work but it&#39;s really long write out.  I&#39;ve personally never used one but they artificially create their own standards for what a normal test level is, so when you write them that check and send in that blood sample (via mail) and give them your scouts honor that it&#39;s your blood, they will send you back your results. Would you look at that, you qualified because you have low test levels.  And you will have yourself a script for some test. </p>

<p>And if you want to raise your test levels naturally, workout your legs.  Squats are your friend, don&#39;t believe those supplements you see at GNC that claim to raise your test levels 10000x or whatever bullshit it says.  Most supplements that claim to raise your test are expensive placebos.  Actually, most of the supplements you see in magazines are garbage.  Or goto your doctor, he will prescribe you AndroGel, I can&#39;t think of it now but you rub the gel on, I think your thigh? And it slowly raises your levels.  Insurance I think should pay for it also.  It&#39;s safe.</p>
