    <div class="md"><p>Here is the thing.</p>

<p>99% of the time when I ban someone for making personal attacks in a comment here. I warn them first and then ban them when they fail to follow the rules.  99% of the time when they know they failed to follow the rules, they go cry to conspiratard about how they were banned for having a different opinion or because flytape is corrupt.  They are rarely capable of accepting responsibility for their own actions.</p>

<p>If you automatically believe what you&#39;re being told about us by a subreddit dedicated to mocking people who they disagree with, you&#39;re not really thinking for yourself.</p>

<p>Conspiratard banned me for explaining why people were banned (inside of conspiratard) because my side of the story made too much sense and didn&#39;t fit their circle jerk.  Their head mod literally spews insults and curse words when you attempt to debate him like a normal human being.  </p>

<p>Have a great day and I hope you realize that there are two sides to every story.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ll prevent them from ever thinking for themselves by banning them from the subreddit. <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> thanks you for your dedication to keeping the wool over the eyes of the sheeple flytape. We&#39;d salute you, but you know there are rules about acknowledging officers in the open. </p>

<p>However that didn&#39;t answer the question, why ban someone from saying that in <a href="/r/subredditoftheday">/r/subredditoftheday</a> you went on a tangent about how you got banned for interrupting conspiratards circlejerk. </p>

<p>There are two sides for every story, I think banning someone for having a smile on their face is a bit harsh and you were too quick to pass judgement on them. </p>

<p>I got here kind of late to the party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how r/tards work:</p>

<p>They mock us in their sub, a few that feel offended fall for it and go there trying to clear things up.</p>

<p>When that is not enough, they come here to mock in our faces, more fall for it and they have orgasms of circlejerk that are anything but rational discussions.</p>

<p>When that also isn&#39;t enough, they come here with faked accounts to create their own mocking content to use it later and feel like badass in front of their groupies.</p>

<p>Then, when they stretch it too far and violate the rules, they post the ban itself to their groupes and lie about the reasons why they were banned in order to gather circlejerk acceptance from the few that make a daily habit of this.</p>

<hr/>

<p>r/tards also forget that there is a rule here about linking things to this sub:</p>

<pre><code> 9. Posting links in other subs pointing to specific submissions
     or comments here is subject to a ban, depending on context.
</code></pre>

<p>But they don&#39;t care, as long as they have their peer&#39;s attention they will keep doing what they do best, mocking us everyday and everynight. </p>

<p>Perhaps rather than banning them, we should start tracking them.</p>

<p>It would be much more easily managed if we had another team of lower level mods who would be in charge of handling submission and user and comment reports in a manner that allows them to be tracked so as to root out users who are provably determinable to be shills/bots/tardtrolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would conspiratards be concerned with being unable to come to the one place they hate, ridicule and scorn?</p>

<p>Are you guys so concerned with being unable to come here and make fun of us in our own face when making that same thing in your sub is not enough anymore?</p>

<p>I will never understand why do you do it. If there is something that bothers me, goes against what I believe, provoques my anger, I wouldn&#39;t be consistently going after it day after day after day, making sad jokes about said people, going as far as making new accounts to create their own content and ridicule it after, create alternate accounts to circle around bans, cynicism every fucking day, etc.</p>

<p>You guys are the same as KKK going after african american bars for one simple reason &quot;I hate them, that&#39;s why I go there and I won&#39;t stop until they are all gone&quot;. Pathetic.</p>

<p>He did not dismiss what you had to say without refuting it.</p>

<p>He said you took his post out of context, which you did, which I have explained in a different reply to you but will state here again, because his comparison of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> to the kkk was that of the ignorant hate which motivates them, which is not in any way disrespectful to any of the victims of any of the hate.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re not capable of comprehending this from what he said, otherwise I have no choice but to believe you&#39;re not that intelligent.</p>

<p>Making a false assertion about your opponent and then closing the debate does not mean you have won, it means you&#39;re trying to deceive people which unfortunately for you I have thoroughly exposed.</p>

<p>To come back to the reason why I &quot;butted in&quot;, as I have thus far established here, is to EXPOSE YOUR TACTICS.</p>

<p>You have horrible grammar by the way, and your attempt to call me stupid for engaging in conversation with a person who I feel is of lesser intelligence is pathetic at best.</p>

<p>&quot;Good company, with each other.&quot; How cute.</p>

<p>I only make the assertion that what you provide leads me to believe you are not that intelligent so that you will think about that so that you may become more intelligent.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does not exist solely on the internet. Yes, the data here is all digital but at the same time it is all physical as it is represented by physical energy and stored on physical drives.</p>

<p>It also exists in the real world in form of the exchange of information from person to person outside of the internet, like when we go to parties and instead of just talking about non-sense worthless gossip celebrity sports entertainment bullshit, we actually inform people of things that we&#39;ve learn from research we&#39;ve taken from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>GayUnicorn6969 was making the TRUE assertion that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> fosters an environment which actively encourages hate, and the users engage in these hateful activities because it satisfies their desires to see that which they hate harmed. This is the exact reason people engage in racist hate.</p>

<p>Stop making false assertions and false equivocations, those level one tactics are juvenile at best and are no match for a man who is intelligently informed in the manners of speech and debate. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> IS like the Nazi party in that it uses polarizing propaganda to paint its&#39; enemies as savage idiots who are lesser because of whatever the hate is directed at, be it their physical characteristics or ideologies.
