        Somehow, the pervasive mysteries of the past century—nuclear physics, relativity, quantum mechanics, UFOs and alien contact cover-up conspiracies, the clandestine operations of the military-industrial complex—all converge in the life of this one extraordinary man. I have come to the inescapable conclusion that Townsend Brown’s singular knowledge, unique insights and clandestine connections may have opened the door to a universe very different from what the rest of us mere mortals can comprehend. And after staring into this rabbit hole for all these years, the only thing that I can safely say is that I have yet to find the bottom.

       <p>
        Long before the story of the Philadelphia Experiment emerged to complicate the picture, [it seemed] as if two portraits of Brown had been painted and were now in circulation: one portraying him as a mildly eccentric inventor with some hare-brained ideas about negating the forces of gravity; the other showing him to be a man responsible for some of the most highly classified research of the war. Seen through this ambivalent prism, the story of the Philadelphia Experiment has helped to perform a very important function. By 1980, it had managed to tip Brown over the edge; make him a wholly discredited figure in the eyes of science. That left me with the uncomfortable feeling that the story had been carefully stage-managed. If so, why? And why so long after the supposed events had taken place?

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Townsend_Brown">
        The Wikipedia page
       </a>
       for Thomas Townsend Brown leaves much to be desired. While his name will forever be associated with the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biefeld-Brown_effect">
        Biefeld-Brown effect
       </a>
       , he also was the founder of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Investigations_Committee_on_Aerial_Phenomena">
        National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena
       </a>
       and the (uncredited) inventor of the “ionic air purifier”...and possibly much, much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Born in Zanesville, Ohio in 1905, by the time he was 10 he was electrifying the soil outside his house to collect earthworms for fishing. The only male heir to a wealthy family, Brown's parents spared no expense for his experiments throughout his early life.
      </p>
      <p>
       At 12, his achievements reached the local papers when he demonstrated his first home-made wireless set for his class, when radio was used for transmitting little more than Morse code. A newspaper story at the time read:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Townsend Brown is the possessor of what is probably the only complete wireless plant in Zanesville. Zanesville’s Second Edison [has] a wireless telephone. When he is at play away from home, he wears a wireless telephone over his ear. Members of the family are able to call him wherever they want to merely speaking into the wireless transmitter in the house, and he can hear them perfectly.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       His inventions were well known around town, and during World War I it was rumored he could pick up radio signals from Germany, and was visited by a government officer to dismantle the antenna on his roof.
      </p>
      <p>
       By 1923, only 18, Brown made some sort of discovery. While we don't know precisely what moment it occurred to him, his daughter Linda confirmed that her father would later claim that he knew it “all at once.” According to his own memoir:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I began to cultivate the thesis that a radiation (other than light) prevailed in the Universe, independent of our Solar system. I felt this radiation could be gravitation. That it exerted a pressure (however small) on all forms of matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        This gave rise, in my view, to what could be considered as a new theory of gravitation. Such a theory called for gravitation being a “push” and not a “pull.” This seemed logical in that Nature abhors a vacuum. A mechanism for the transmission of gravitation theoretically was needed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This view would inspire him to investigate the relationship of electromagnetic phenomena and gravitation. Brown referred to “sidereal radiation,” claiming that the strengths of the radiation were related to the positions of the planets at any given time. These claims, as he continued to experiment throughout his life, seem to have been verified.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to mathematician A.L. “Beau” Kitselman, a friend of Brown and his wife Josephine, Brown believed conventional rockets to be completely impractical, and he began to consider electric propulsion at a very young age. In his version of events, during a high school experiment with an X-ray tube, Brown applied high voltage to the tube and saw the electrical cables “jump.” This planted the seed in his mind that began rapidly developing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The young Brown designed dielectrics—basically square bricks of dielectric material—which he would suspend vertically from the ceilings of his laboratories, and then suddenly charge with high voltage. As a result, the dielectric would swing
        <em>
         up
        </em>
        against gravity, and then gradually settle back into its zero state
        <em>
         in steps
        </em>
        , rather than descend gradually and continuously. This strongly suggests that, whatever the phenomenon was, it was not
        <em>
         continuous
        </em>
        but
        <em>
         quantized
        </em>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The high voltages Brown was using in these experiments suggested to him something absolutely radical, and nowhere encountered in the standard science of the period—outside of the
        <em>
         unified field theory
        </em>
        papers.
       </p>
       <p>
        These papers were but scientific curiosities until Hungarian electrical genius Gabriel Kron, taking Einstein's tensor calculus, demonstrated that the higher-dimensional unified field theories could be used to explain electrical anomalies electrical engineers encountered on an everyday basis! With his observations, Brown had entered that little-known conceptual world where high voltages were demonstrably having an effect on the mass of the apparatus producing it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By 1924 Brown was enrolled at Caltech in Southern California, and he quickly grew tired of the stifling rules and procedures in the laboratory there run by
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Millikan">
        Dr. Robert Millikan
       </a>
       . Although Millikan is well known today as being the first to measure the precise electrical charge of an electron, according to Schatzkin: “There was no sudden, inward, intuitive sense of something that needed to be revealed. Rather, Millikan was visited by a manifestation of his ego, and set about to make a name for himself.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the world was in the midst of being torn asunder by the work of Einstein and others, and the firmly held dogmas that had lasted centuries had been turned on their heads, Millikan was completely uninterested in Brown and his experiments. Brown even sent out invitations to fellow students and Millikan himself to a private viewing of the phenomena he was observing, but no one showed up, which must have been disheartening, to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even after approaching Millikan himself about his belief in “electro-gravitics,” the coupling between electromagnetism and gravity that was
       <em>
        locally engineerable
       </em>
       , Millikan dismissed the notion as utterly impossible. These rejections seem to have affected Brown deeply, and he left Caltech soon after.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, he would soon find a sympathetic ear in
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Alfred_Biefeld">
        Paul Alfred Biefeld
       </a>
       , a professor at Denison University in Granville, Ohio. Before their encounter, Brown was encouraged when one of his invitations prompted a reporter for the Los Angeles Evening Express to run a story called “Claims Gravity is a Push, not a Pull.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Although Millikan said Brown's claim were impossible, his story began to be picked up by national wire services and eventually was carried in the New York Times. He was on the map.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to the close-minded and ego-driven Millikan, Paul Biefeld was constantly on the look-out for  something that might represent an “electrodynamic-gravitational coupling.” When the young Brown asked the professor what physical instrumentality might it resemble if such a coupling existed, Biefeld replied confidently, “the capacitor”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown had already discovered this to be the case with his Coolidge tube experiments. Biefeld had confirmed he was on the right track and that they were of like mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       To summarize what would eventually be known as the Biefeld-Brown effect, Brown himself observed in 1977:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The basic Biefeld-Brown effect is quite simple. It is manifested as a departure from the Coulomb Law of electrostatic attraction, in that the opposite forces are not equal. The negative electrode appears to chase the positive electrode, so that there is a net force of the system (dipole) in the negative-to-positive direction.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How did Biefeld's name get attached to Brown's discovery?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is just the first occurrence of a pattern that will repeat itself through the rest of Brown's life. Considering the relative obscurity that his reputation struggles with today, you might say that the “Biefeld-Brown Effect” was really the earliest manifestation of Townsend Brown taking extraordinary measures to “hide in plain sight”–by diverting credit for his own discoveries toward others in what we can see now was a carefully calculated effort to obscure his achievements behind a veil of anonymity that would follow him the rest of his days.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By 1928 Brown was awarded his first patent, in Great Britain, for his “gravitators” or “gravitors,” simply dielectric devices charged with high voltage that lift and return to their ground state in step-wise quantized fashion.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The importance of this point cannot be overlooked, for in the same year, 1928, that Einstein was writing yet another unified field theory paper coupling gravitation and electromagnetism, Brown had filed for, and received, a patent for a technology that demonstrated, and therefore,
        <em>
         locally-engineered
        </em>
        the coupling!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From a Cincinnati Enquirer article from 1929 titled Zanesville Inventor 'Applies' Einstein in new Electrostatic Pendulum Motor: “[It consists] simply of surrounding or impregnating mass of any non-conducting material with an electro-static condition. This is accomplished by applying high-voltage but low-amperage current to opposite ends of material that does not transmit electric force.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In other words, Brown has sandwiched a layer of a material that
        <em>
         does not conduct
        </em>
        electricity between two layers of a material that
        <em>
         does conduct
        </em>
        electricity. The material that does not conduct electricity is called a “dielectric” and the material that does conduct electricity is called an electrode.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the dielectric layer interrupts the flow of electrical energy in the apparatus, the circuit is not completed, and this is one reason why Brown and scientists called in by him to test his results unite in saying
        <em>
         the electrical energy present is not the cause of the force liberated.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why was Brown convinced there was an electro-gravitic coupling being demonstrated by his device?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While conducting experiments with it, Brown noticed varying results depending upon planetary and stellar positioning relative to the galactic center. When the Sun and Moon were aligned in the direction of the positive thrust of his gravitator, the displacement of the apparatus was greater. In other words, the apparatus responded to conditions of local celestial space. This in turn affected the quantized release of energy as the gravitator returned to its ground state.
       </p>
       <p>
        This quantization phenomenon is quite important, and Brown began to write of this concept himself, calling it “gravitational atoms,” and with it, Brown is suggesting,
        <em>
         contra
        </em>
        Einstein, that space-time is
        <em>
         not
        </em>
        a continuum, but rather, like the implications of quantum mechanics itself suggested, is a quantized phenomenon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brown was saying that
        <em>
         space itself was a dielectric
        </em>
        and the material universe an asymmetrical dipole in a state of non-equilibrium. His gravitators were not just an idle curiosity, they were the “only way to go” if mankind ever hoped to venture to the stars.
       </p>

       After the crash of 1929, the Great Depression prevented Brown's father from providing further funding for his son's experiments, and Brown was thrust into the world of corporations and covert operations
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown joined the Navy in 1930, and within a few months was promoted and ordered to report to the Naval Research Laboratory in DC. Here one begins to encounter the signs of deliberate obfuscation in his history and record.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A FOIA request for Brown's activities from 1932-1942, the year of his discharge, earned the response that the Navy Research Laboratory's Archives were unable to locate any services records for anyone by the name of Thomas Townsend Brown. Brown apparently had been doing something
        <em>
         so
        </em>
        classified that the Navy's and National Archives' response could only be characterized in the following way: “We've never heard of the guy. And if we have heard of the guy, we don't have any records. And if we do have records, anything that you might really want to know is classified. And if it is classified, we can't even tell you that it exists.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What could possibly be so classified? According to Brown himself, he had
       <em>
        his own private office
       </em>
       at the Naval Research Laboratory, unheard of for someone who wasn't an officer or credentialed academic, and he was
       <em>
        continuing to conduct experiments
       </em>
       that “seemed to prove the concept of Gravitation which I had hypothesized at Caltech in 1923.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What had just a year or two previously been talked about and described in newspapers across the country, eventually winding up in the New York Times, now had gone deeply black, as deeply black as anything could be in the inter-war period.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why would the US Navy be interested in just a purely theoretical concept? In 1932 Brown wrote the following to the director of the Naval Research Laboratory:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For the past seven years I have been conducting experiments on the forces produced on highly charged rotating bodies immersed in fluid dielectrics. This work had continued at the Naval research Laboratory at odd times outside of working hours leading to a novel arrangement of electric and magnetic fields producing a powerful mechanical reaction on fluids. After considerable thought some demonstrative tests were performed which seem to indicate that there are a numbers of important naval uses to which the action might be applied.
       </p>

       Increased voltages, leading to increased electrical field pinch and increased fluid flow, had now caught Brown's attention.

        It is found that a model ship can be propelled through water at a comparatively high rate of speed and with fair efficiency. The electromagnetic device is installed inside the hull and the mechanical reaction is induced outside the hull directly in the water. The movement of the model is controlled by the magnitude and direction of the electrical current applied to it. The method requires no propeller or paddles, in fact, employes no moving parts. No vibration or sound is created by the source of the motive power.

       Someone was beginning to take Brown seriously, because when he was ordered to the sea for duty in 1932, the orders were countermanded by the Chief of the Bureau of Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given all of this information, it should come as a surprise that Brown was suddenly discharged from the Navy in 1942.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Many, including Linda Brown herself, have pondered Brown's discharge from the Navy in 1942, at the height of WWII. Why would Brown, by then an officer deeply involved with radar and other sensitive wartime technologies, be so suddenly dismissed? Brown may have been working on something
        <em>
         so
        </em>
        secret that even the Navy did not know about it.

       In the person of Thomas Townsend Brown, we may have the perfect example of something who has bumped into the phenomenon referred to by Richard Dolan and others as the Breakaway Civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown, who was thinking in terms of the relationship of localized gravitational effects and geological formations, was offered and accepted a place on a Navy-Princeton Gravity expedition to the West Indies in 1932. He was to be the assistant of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Andries_Vening_Meinesz">
        Felix Andries Vening Meinesz
       </a>
       , who today is known for his invention of a precise method for measuring gravity. It's obvious why Brown was chosen, for as Schatzkin observes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A number of observations made in the region of the Bahamas raised questions about just what role gravity might have played in the formation and structure of the islands. The anomalies discovered at the time suggested that it might be useful to further attempt to measure gravitational anomalies in deeper waters, hence the need for a submarine to conduct the expedition.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Brown prepared the journal of the expedition, and apparently did well enough to warrant an increase in salary, a promotion to an officer, and a commendation as being “indispensable” to the Naval Research Laboratory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of his connections to the enigmatic Dr. Vening-Meinesz, Brown earned a place on board the private yacht
       <em>
        Caroline
       </em>
       on an expedition in 1933 as the sonar and radio operator. The yacht was owned by magnate Eldridge Reeves Johnson, owner of the Victor Talking Machines Company.
      </p>
      <p>
       On this expedition, Brown likely met James Bond, quite literally. When the
       <em>
        Caroline
       </em>
       docked in Nassau in 1933, it is alleged that
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Samuel_Stephenson">
        William Samuel Stephenson
       </a>
       boarded the ship. Stephenson, again, literally was the inspiration for Ian Fleming's creation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Something quietly changed in Brown and his life after this expedition, and that if indeed there
        <em>
         was
        </em>
        a covert actor in his life, it is associated with the group surrounding the expedition, the “Caroline Group.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In the period between the two world wars the intelligence operations of various nations were curtailed. Businessmen filled the void by their networks of contacts in finance, science and academics, and it's possible that the “Caroline Group” was one such private intelligence network.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Or to put the same point a bit differently, what would emerge
        <em>
         after
        </em>
        World War II in the USA with signing of the National Security Act in 1947 was but a network of these very private international groups
        <em>
         before
        </em>
        the war.
       </p>
       <p>
        In any case, it is this expedition that marks the turning point in Brown's life, for in the months immediately following the Caroline Expedition, something changed, because it's at that point that the trail beings to get much more difficult to follow.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Having been just promoted to a lieutenant, junior grade, Brown wrote to the Naval Research Laboratory, summarizing his experiments and requesting custody of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of the experimental apparatus he was using!
      </p>
      <p>
       Photographs from the 1930's of Brown and his equipment raise the question: where did the now financially-strapped Brown get the money for the equipment? Was it the equipment that he had requested access to in 1933? If so, then how did it get there? Who authorized the transfer if indeed it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       his equipment from the Naval Research Laboratory? Even Schatzkin's sources raised considerable doubt about the year and location of these photos, one even claiming that they were taken somewhere in Bermuda in the spring of 1934.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strangeness continues when Brown apparently took what remained of his family's fortune to begin a non-profit corporation called “The Townsend Brown Foundation.” In 1938, Brown wrote to Denison University to ask if they could store expensive equipment in his home laboratory, some of which he used at the Naval Research Laboratory.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Curiously, however, Brown indicates that the reason he is asking Denison to store the equipment is because he had to sell his family home. Yet, at the same time, he states that the Townsend Brown Foundation would be able to cover any expenses incurred in renovating space for the equipment, but also that it would cover the costs of renting the space from the University!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Schatzkin concluded “that not all the money in the 'Townsend Brown Foundation' was coming strictly from the remaining assets of the Townsend and Brown families.”
      </p>
      <p>
       By 1938 Brown was promoted to full lieutenant, and surprisingly, again, he requested sea duty without pay. After being assigned to the
       <em>
        USS Nashville
       </em>
       in August of 1938, Brown recalled the following after docking at Portsmouth, England:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Before we left Portsmouth we loaded $50 million worth of gold bullion aboard. It was gold brought form the Bank of England, and it arrived at shipside in three garbage trucks. No escorts, motorcycles, or convoy. We had it carried aboard and placed in the magazines of the ship. It was in ingots, encased in wooden boxes; each gold ingot in a wooden box with numbers boldly stamped on each box, each box worth a quarter of a million, and weighing so much it was all one man could do to carry it. The gold was consigned tot he Chase Manhattan National Bank of New York.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Schatzkin and Farrell expand upon this bizarre event:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That's 200 wooden crates of gold bullion, delivered from the Bank of England onto a US Navy vessel destined to return to the United States—and the whole proceeding is witnessed and noted for posterity by a Lieutenant who was officially attached to Engineering and doing special duty in the Fire Control and Radio Divisions. This Lieutenant knows exactly what's in the 200 wooden crates: gold bullion—the only form of pure money that is otherwise virtually untraceable. Just why an officer so assigned would be witness to such an event is left to the reader's imagination.
       </p>
       <p>
        What it leaves to the reader's imagination is that the bullion was perhaps earmarked as backing for research projects that would have required an engineer with precisely Brown's unique “skill set” and conceptions.
       </p>

       There is further corroboration that Brown was conducting experiments for the Navy that embodied his novel approach to gravity, for there exists an Annual Fitness Report from 1939 for Brown in which he wrote that he had been building equipment for measuring sidereal radiation in the Physics Department of the University of Pennsylvania, and he was “computing the records for 1937 and 1938.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This bit of information means, at the minimum, that at some point during his research for the US Naval Research Laboratory, that his research was being taken seriously by someone, for there is no explanation of what the term “sidereal radiation” means. The bureaucrat shuffling his files would not know, but
        <em>
         someone
        </em>
        would, since Brown's presence on the West Indies voyage was precisely in order to measure local gravitational fluctuations.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is one final consideration that also argues, independently of Schatzkin's research, that the gold bullion
        <em>
         was
        </em>
        directly tied to Brown's research, and
        <em>
         it is almost the identical pattern
        </em>
        that we saw being established after the war, when plundered German and Japanese loot was used to establish an entirely secret slush fund for covert operations and secret research.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The mysteries continue with Brown's sudden resignation from the Navy in 1942.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The standard “Brown mythology” would have it that he resigned because of a nervous breakdown brought about by the disastrous results the crew of the USS Eldridge suffered during the Philadelphia Experiment. But Brown's letter requesting a resignation states that it was “for the good of the naval service in order to escape trial by General Court Martial.” In his final orders from the US Navy, there was no mention of the cause or reasons for the sudden resignation, a resignation made even more inexplicable due to Brown's expertise in radar, and not even a full year after America's entry into WWII.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A quick note about the infamous
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Experiment">
        Philadelphia Experiment
       </a>
       . I'm going to avoid discussing this event in detail as to not distract from Brown's story, but for better or for worse, Brown's name “is inextricably tied up with the Experiment.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Indeed, the selection of the
        <em>
         USS Eldridge
        </em>
        for the construction of the mythology was, according to Schatzkin's sources, a component of the disinformation campaign. But given the highly unified physical conceptions with which we have been dealing, it should not surprise us that some of Brown's experimentation was conducted in Philadelphia, and that any “electro-gravitic” technology to engineer the fabric of space-time would be a source not only of energy, a means not only of field propulsion, not only a way to unimaginably destructive weaponry, but also the ultimate in cloaking technology.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, as for Brown leaving the Navy, more information can be found in his FBI file:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The “real” reason was found in an FBI report filed in March of 1943, in which Brown is called a “confessed homosexual.” Within a matter of mere weeks following his resignation, the “confessed homosexual”—considered an obvious risk in the days of WWII—found himself employed at the famous Vega Aircraft Corporation, the forerunner of the even more famous Lockheed “skunk” works! When Brown reported at Vega in Burbank, he also brought with him all the research equipment that he had worked with, and which had been assigned to his keeping when he left the Naval Research Laboratory.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This may be a clue to another mystery, the “error”
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Rich">
        Ben Rich
       </a>
       may have been referring to when, at a speech in 1993 at UCLA, he made the following extraordinarily provocative statements: “There is an error in the equations, and we have figured it out, and now know how to travel to the stars, and it won't take a lifetime to do it.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This raises the possibility that Rich knew of Brown's work, for if anyone's concepts suggested an “error in the equations,” it was Brown's, for with his steady insistence that gravity and electromagnetism were coupled, it was an easy process of reason to arrive at the idea that
        <em>
         mass
        </em>
        , an “electrically neutral” concept in standard physics models, may have been tied to potentials and dielectrics, precisely as his “Biefeld-Brown Effect” suggested.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Schatzkin speculates that there may be more to the “homosexuality charge” than meets the eye:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If one suddenly needed to be separated from the service to pursue research in a civilian environment, what better way in the 1940s than to feign homosexuality? In that period, even the suggestion of homosexuality was the equivalent of an instant “get out of jail free” card. Such an allegation was conceivably the only way that somebody who knew “more about Radar detection than any individual in the US Navy” was going to be released from the service. Thus, it seems safe to conclude that the story about the nervous breakdown was deliberate misinformation intended to steer researchers away from the “official” reason for Brown's sudden departure.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we find then is not one, but two layers of misinformation, and the beginnings of a complex and recurring pattern, where everything that is “known” about Townsend Brown is actually camouflage for something unknown (and perhaps unknowable). The best clue no doubt lies in the combination of Brown's almost immediate reappearance at Vega, which itself was a very secretive operation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Schatzkin's own sources, for what it's worth, confirmed that Brown was involved with the intelligence community. This involvement began during the interwar period, a component of the private network of businessmen, financiers, and scientists that may have connected to something like the hypothetical “Caroline Group.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But there is an obvious point about Brown's employment with the Vega Aircraft company at its secret Burbank facility: Brown's ideas were now being investigated for their implications for aircraft propulsion...in 1942!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If the connection between Brown and Ben Rich seems unlikely:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is worth noting that Brown himself states that he was assigned to Lockheed's Advanced Project Division...much of what Brown was researching
        <em>
         would
        </em>
        connect to finding “an error in the equations.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       His ideas continued to mature when Brown wrote an essay in the 60's in his private notebooks entitled “The Structure of Space.” The essay can only be described as a meditation on the electrical properties of space (the Electric Universe, anyone?), and “an exploration into the manner by which those electrical properties might explain the still-mysterious forces of gravitation.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brown concluded that the fluctuations of these properties in space—his “sidereal radiation”—might explain gravity itself, and thus it followed that the structure of space “might not be uniform” based on these variations. If so, then it became possible to manipulate these variations for propulsive purposes. Space, in other words, had variable dielectric properties, with “high” and “low” pressure zones, and thus could be used in a grand version of his gravitators, since matter would, by dint of these high and low pressure zones, gravitate to regions of “low pressure.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The energy of the total system is in a state of non-equilibrium, which Brown illustrates by means of a simple analogy: “A glass globe (evacuated), submerged to its crushing depth in the deep sea, would suddenly disintegrate and send out a wave motion possessing energy. But, the energy was contained not in the evacuated globe, but in the pressure of the water surrounding the globe. It might appear that mankind lives in an aether “sea” of tremendous pressure, an aether “sea” of likewise unbelievable energy.”
       </p>
       <p>
        While using the vocabulary of early twentieth century electrodynamics, Brown is in fact entertaining the concepts of non-equilibrium thermo- and electro-dynamics, and of quantum mechanics' zero point energy, that were also being thought about by theoretical physicists.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Brown saw his invention as been applied towards propulsion
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       a source of energy generation. “Free” energy and a field propulsion technology aren't the only possibilities, as Brown must have been aware, as the possibilities of
       <em>
        weaponizing
       </em>
       this technology are quite apparent (shades of Tesla!).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, those who have extensively researched the subject of UFOs are aware of the sheer amount of sightings that occurred in the 40's and 50's, especially at many nuclear test sites (for more information on this topic, it doesn't get better than

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since UFOs very possibly used propulsion based on conceptions very similar to Brown's, it is therefore conceivable that the technologies Brown was envisioning could be used as a means of communications
        <em>
         and
        </em>
        a means of the
        <em>

        </em>
        detection of nuclear detonations, and indeed, such detection of nuclear detonations may be the reason UFOs seemed to “show up” in large numbers just as humanity was entering the nuclear age.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Brown's conceptions gave the “breakaway group” a scientific means—howsoever far out of the mainstream box they may have been—to
       <em>
        rationalize
       </em>
       the UFO phenomenon, and its apparent increase and tie to human nuclear weapons detonations.

      <p>
       In 1955, Brown wrote a proposal called “Project Winterhaven” in which he reviewed his work on gravitation and proposes some experiments to “confirm or deny” the relationship between electromagnetism and gravity (electro-gravitics). These experiments were to be conducted “with emphasis on military applications of recognized priority.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Noting that his work has been so highly classified that any publications was precluded, Brown then makes a significant, and often-overlooked statement. Namely, that further progress in his research was not due to any failure of experimentation or of his conceptions, but rather, because the dielectric materials then available were not able to withstand the high potentials required for practical application. This should give pause, for such limitations, after nearly 60 years and “enough money and manpower” might conceivably have been overcome.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Winterhaven proposal also ties directly to nuclear weapons:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He states clearly and unequivocally that the result of his research thus far had led to the hypothesis that “a gravitational field can be effectively controlled by manipulating the space-energy relationships of the ambient electrostatic field.” It is this hypothesis that he wished to explore further in the Winterhaven proposal. Nuclear bombs, with their tremendous burst of energy or electromagnetic pulse are precisely manipulations of the ambient electrostatic field, and hence, of the permeability characteristics of local space.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These effects also vary as a result of local celestial mechanics, for in Brown's own words: “there are tidal effects apparently cause by the Sun and Moon which influence to a small extent the power developed.” These effects were also due to “the passage of the Earth through diffuse clouds of cosmic dust or electrified particles ejected from the Sun.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In other words, in a conceptual culture in which the forces of electromagnetism and gravity were unified or coupled, both propulsion efficiency and weapons yields were variable dependent on the local structure of space-time. There is thus, at the most basic level, a “clash of civilizations” between the breakaway group and the public world, since the scientific conceptions are very different. In the breakaway world, the relationship is
        <em>
         engineerable.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        One may gain some appreciation for the vast difference of cultures by pondering a significant, and very obvious fact. From Tesla, through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside">

         Kurt Debus
        </a>
        , and Brown himself, the people advocating an electrically dynamic view of space are all
        <em>
         actual electrical engineers.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        Significantly, most of their work is suppressed, or classified. On the other hand, in the overworld of “public consumption physics,” most of the people are
        <em>
         theoreticians,
        </em>
        producing a blizzard of mathematical hieroglyphs “arguing” the impossibility of what the engineers are talking about, and
        <em>
         doing.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again in Brown's own words: “it is already becoming apparent that the rocket must be superseded and speeds even further increased.” Is there a hidden context to these words? Is that context the UFO?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brown was instrumental in the formation of the UFO reporting group, NICAP...and most importantly, Brown has coupled all his research and conceptions to the problem that at the time was uppermost in the minds of the breakaway group as it was assessing the UFO phenomenon. That phenomenon had already exhibited a great interest in human nuclear and thermonuclear weapons.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Brown spells it out in his Winterhaven proposal: “Due to the tremendous momentarily displacement of air and the gravitational disturbance resulting therefrom, there is reason to believe that the electrogravitational receiver may be one of the few devices capable of instant long-distance detection and ranging of atomic bomb explosions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What is lurking behind this statement is the strong possibility that Brown had also concluded, along with the generals and technocrats in the breakaway civilization, that the yields of nuclear weapons were variable over time and consequent upon the
        <em>
         longitudinal
        </em>
        wave phenomenon of the geometry of local space (Tesla, again!). And hence, this could be a means of detection of nuclear detonations. Brown had just handed the breakaway civilization his explanation for why UFOs were suddenly appearing around Earth so close to the nuclear age. He had handed them not only the “why” explanation, but also, the “how.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Another fascinating piece of information uncovered by Schatzkin from his sources, although entirely uncorroborated, is Brown's alleged secret mission to Germany at the end of the war. In this account, Brown rendezvoused with the famous German panzer commander
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_von_luck">
        Hans von Luck
       </a>
       to smuggle a German scientist out of the country. The scientist was none other than
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_UFOs#Early_claims">
        Dr. Richard Miethe
       </a>
       , well known in the UFO research community as one of the alleged early developers of
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       sort of exotic propulsion technology. Regardless of what happened, Brown apparently lost a
       <em>
        finger
       </em>
       during the mission, and had to recover in England before returning home.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the war, Brown moved his family to Hawaii and established a lab at Pearl Harbor, relatively isolated and behind the security of a military base. He had his equipment moved from the University of Pennsylvania and soon gave a demonstration of his devices to high Navy brass, including
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Radford">
        Admiral Arthur Radford
       </a>
       , commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet. Brown demonstrated his emerging ideas about using his conceptions for communications, which would later be incorporated into his Project Winterhaven proposals, and another for propulsion. He also showed his “magneto-hydrodynamic drive” which he had been working with since 1929.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that during this stint in Hawaii, Brown still was investigating “sidereal radiation” as well as how it might affect the stock market!
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1952 Brown moved his family back to California, and soon demonstrated one of his “gravitator disks” to Air Force Major General Victor Bertrandis. As a result of this demonstration, a few skeptically claimed that the effect was merely the result of “ionic wind.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brown was subsequently invited to Paris to perform tests of these devices in a vacuum in 1955, which would once and for all disprove that they were being propelled by an electrified wind. The tests were wildly successful...[they] were absolutely essential to disproving the ionic wind theory, and that indeed Brown's devices were demonstrating an electro-gravitic coupling effect. [A letter from Brown] indicates that his devices were undergoing much more extensive testing under all sort of conditions than even the “Thomas Townsend Brown” legend commonly states.

       Brown writes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The results which were most significant from the standpoint of the Biefeld-Brown effect was that thrust continues,
        <em>
         even when there was no vacuum spark,
        </em>
        causing the rotor to accelerate in the negative to positive direction to the point where voltage had to be reduced or the experiment discontinued because of
        <em>
         the danger that the rotor would fly apart.
        </em>
        The total thrust or torque remained virtually the same in both instances, seeming to prove that aero-ionization was not wholly responsible for the thrust observed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The torque was measured continuously day and night for many years. Large magnitude variations were consistently observed under carefully controlled conditions of constant voltage, temperature, under oil, in magnetic and electrostatic shield, not only underground but at various elevations.
        <em>
         There were pronounced correlations with mean solar time, sidereal time and lunar hour angle.
        </em>
        This seemed to prove beyond a doubt that the thrust of “gravitors” varied with time in a way that related to solar and lunar tides and a sidereal correlation of unknown origin.
       </p>

       Electromagnetic and electrostatic systems are
       <em>
        open systems,

       interacting with the local space-time geometry. Nuclear bombs would do so as well.

      <p>
       By 1958, Brown began continuing his work privately in North Carolina at the behest of yet another corporate mentor, Agnew Bahnson. From Bahnson's own notes, their goal was “a self-propelled, self-lifting and controlled, self-powered 'battery' model at least.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In other words, it was neither the technology nor the concept that was the obstacle, but a portable power supply powerful enough to place on board the gravitators to provide the power needed. That this is the goal was further indicated by Bahnson in a note that their other corollary objective was to achieve “100% counterbary.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Then, in an entry for January 11, 1958, the goal of 100 percent counterbary was achieved using a 35 in. diameter bamboo canopy as the positive pole, with foil covering, and 18 in. alumina half ball of foil placed 13 and ½ in. below the canopy as the negative pole, in an apparatus charged with 210 kilovolts. The entire apparatus, Bahnson notes, weighed 98 grams.
       </p>
       <p>
        With this success in hand, Brown turned his attention to the power supply, and again applying his own insight that if his apparatus was held stationary and a medium were pumped to flow through it—as in a jet engine—a generator of great electrical power could be constructed. Thus did Brown conceive of using an electrified jet engine as a
        <em>
         generator
        </em>
        for the power supply for his propulsion system, which was patented in his Patent #3,022,439 for an “Electrokinetic Generator.” According to the claim of the patent, “this invention provides for the direct conversion of the energy of a burning fuel into electrical energy.” Bahnson records a visit of the Glen L. Martin aircraft company to his laboratory on October 30, 1958. The same notes record that Brown would make a presentation on “Electro-hydrodynamics.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So what of Brown and his founding of a UFO study group, NICAP?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The founding of NICAP by Brown achieved his real purpose. Starting NICAP not only got his name associated permanently with what many consider to be a 'fringe' element of pseudo-science, but it also did so in such a way as to leave a permanent, public record challenging both his competence and integrity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       However, Brown's interest in the UFO phenomenon obvious
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       genuine, and indeed one of the more mysterious things he told his daughter Linda, after handing her several  “UFO” reports to sift through, was that she should separate out the ones that “wobble” because those were “ours.” This statement is obviously open to many different interpretations.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1967 Townsend Brown, his wife Josephine, and their 22-year old daughter Linda were living in Santa Monica, California, where Brown had taken his efforts to further develop — and hopefully commercialize — the device everybody simply called “The Fan.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Brown’s invention was an electrostatic air purifier, a device that could move air without moving anything else. No motor, no whirling fan blades. Just turn it on and the air moves through it, driven by an electrical charge that pulls out impurities before the air is propelled out of the system. As with all of Townsend Brown’s inventions, the idea was simple, novel, and elegant.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It was one of the first practical applications of the Biefeld-Brown effect he had ever developed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The device could, at the flip of a switch, be converted into a loudspeaker, again with no moving parts to cause distortion. And, since it was completely electric, the loudspeaker was capable of reproducing sounds far below and above the human range of hearing. Brown himself viewed such inventions largely as amusing applications of the Biefeld-Brown Effect without much commercial potential (!), and believed their real potential lay in their application to advanced propulsion systems.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       His inventions attracted attention in some interesting circles.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1967, when he and his family were located in southern California, Brown gave a demonstration of his bladeless turbine—for that is indeed what Brown's fan or “ionic purifier” was—to none other than Dr. Edward Teller, the father of the American hydrogen bomb. Teller was not the only high-ranking personage within the realm of American black projects, however, to receive such a demonstration. Another was US Air Force General Curtis Lemay, chief of the Strategic Air Command. The famous defense contractor and think take, the RAND Corporation, not only received a demonstration, but was actually given a set of the “bladeless fan” to examine for themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        It becomes clear why a Lemay, a Teller, or a RAND Corporation would show an interest. Imagine increasing the potential of the electrical field acting on the medium (in this case, air), by several orders of magnitude until the point that one way moving air producing a thrust like a jet engine, and doing so with no moving parts, subject to inevitable breakdowns and repairs. Indeed, one could envision moving air at speeds far greater than ordinary jets. Putting it succinctly, a whole new form of propulsion was implied by Brown's simply “electric fan.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Something, however, happened at the RAND demonstration:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Whereas most demonstrations of either The Fan or its loudspeaker application elicited unrestrained expressions of amazement and curiosity, the assembly at RAND was “ominously quiet” after the demonstration. “It was kind of odd,” Linda said. “No puzzled looks, no furtive walk-arounds.” When they were done, Townsend Brown gently instructed his daughter to pack all the units but one and take them back to the GTI facility in Santa Monica, explaining that he would catch up with her later that evening at home after he stayed behind to talk with the RAND officials. One unit (the “big unit”) was left behind at the RAND offices.
       </p>
       <p>
        When he got home that evening, Brown shocked Linda with the announcement that the project they’d been working on for so long was being shut down. “It's over, Sweetie,” Dr. Brown told Linda, “Maybe now it's time you got on with your own life.” He didn't offer much more in the way of explanation. Whatever the reason, the work on “The Fan” came to an abrupt halt that summer. And that’s pretty much how it went with Townsend Brown, over the course of his entire life.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What can we conclude with this overview?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Of all the figures representing that common surface between multiple worlds of covert operations, private intelligence and scientific research groups, black projects, and the military industrial complex, Brown
        <em>
         best
        </em>
        exemplifies them all. Brown represents a clash of civilizations, for being very much a part of a breakaway civilization, his scientific conceptions and the technologies he invented based upon them, were quite different than those of the public consumption physics of the world he inhabited in everyday life. Brown was demonstrating experimentally that mass was a phenomenon deeply related to dielectrics, to electrical permittivity, and magnetic permeability. This was not
        <em>
         theory,
        </em>
        this was
        <em>
         observation.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        But above all, Brown, throughout his life, points to the involvement of
        <em>
         private and corporate
        </em>
        influences in these developments that ante-date the military-industrial-national security complex of the postwar period, moreover, one that had international extent and therefore factional involvement.
       </p>
       <p>
        The question that now remains is this: assuming that all these ideas could be made to
        <em>
         work,
        </em>
        what would one do with them? The answers are simple: One would collateralize space, or rather, what was to be found in it, as a means of payback for all the vast sums risked to create such technology in the first place.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'll conclude with a quote from an anonymous email Paul Schatzkin received in 2002, which set him on the adventure that he ultimately abandoned:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So where did all the R&amp;D go? If you go out in the desert about 125 miles south west of Las Vegas at night you will see an object flying around in the distance with a bluish haze around it. That’s where it went. Also Sharper Image is selling an air purifier on cable TV for $60. He never collected the royalties for that either.

       It was mentioned that while he was on an operation in Germany just before the end of the war that he lost his finger.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to my sources... He had parachutted into Germany to retrieve a high voltage German engineer. Arrangements had been made with a German tank commander to deliver the man where Dad and his small team would pick him up and hand him safely into the hands of the the Allies. They were actually working for a private intelligence network ( lets just call them the Caroline Group because Paul Schatzkin used that name for them)
      </p>
      <p>
       Several things went " pearshaped" as some operations can go.
      </p>
      <p>
       The handoff went wrong when one of Dads new men got nervous, drew and fired at a German he thought was reaching for a gun.... all heck broke loose.... Dads team was killed and he was captured by the German communications team in the farmhouse who then tried to use him ( or parts of him) to buy release from the Army... which by now had them surrounded. A sort of negotiation ensued. A chopped finger was sent to the Army with the note that unless they were all released the "important man" that they had captured would be sent back in pieces. Only the Army decided that one scientist was expendable. They attacked... Dad was found slumped under the Tank Commander who had apparently shielded him from gun fire.  Later it was discovered that the high voltage expert dressed in a German army uniform was killed, Dad had a bullet section in his lung... but here is where it gets strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dad already was missing a finger... from an "industrial accident" in the 30s......the German tank commander... unknown obviously... had taken a finger from one of the men who had died earlier.....it was a ruse.... and it might have worked.... at least he tried. I have been told that the tank commander was " Caroline" .... it was not Von Luck but one of his officers.... I have been told that he saved my Dads life and I believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two Caroline officers collected Miethe out of a prisoner of war camp in Russia the next year and it was Von Luck who contacted the group to get Miethe out of there. He stayed behind..... so the account that was written here was just a little off....all of this is unsubstantiated I have to remind all of you. I do however trust my sources.   Linda

       Just one late night thought to add to the experience that Dad had in Germany. I have asked myself for years what would be so important that the man ( who was the original white -knuckle flyer) would volunteer for a mission that would take him over the skys of a still hostile Germany during the last days of the war... where he would jump out of a plane into the darkness, never having done that before except for a leap off a training tower in Canada on his way to Germany. He was forty years old but not a soldier. He declared that he would not take the pistol that was offered because he would never raise it against anyone, even to protect his own life. He was picked up by a young British Royal Marine Commando who was told that if capture was imminent he was to shoot this scientist in the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       That man has been my source in this story and I have no doubt that he would have done exactly that, without hesitation. Fortunately he was not part of Dads team when it was captured. .
      </p>
      <p>
       Dad was not in the military.  He was not trained in covert operations. The man that he was going to pick up must have been very important to " the Caroline Groups" future plans. And Dad had help on the other side of the battle lines because certain Germans had arranged this pick up. Why was it so important for them to get this high voltage expert out of Germany before he was captured by the Russians? Mr. Twigsnapper told me that during those last days there were private and military groups going through Germany like "pickers in a cotton field".
      </p>
      <p>
       The important man they meant to "trade" was killed and Twigsnapper has not told me who it was. " It doesn't matter" has been his only response to my questions.    Linda

       I have often wondered why Paul Schatzkin organized the Biography of my Dad the way he did. If he was actually telling the story of his life... why didn't he divide Dads life into ten year increments. It turned out that he wrote 80 Chapters but they jumped all over the place and several of them had nothing to do with Dad at all but about the relationship that I had with a young man who was drawn into Dads organization... and in that process of course... we lost each other as lovers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its strange now to see how that person has come back into my life ... Forty years later.... but that does not really have anything to do with Dads LIFE... which is what my arrangement with Paul was all about........ much of the urgent disinformation projects that have been launched in my direction in the last few years really have more to do with blunting the importance of the fact that single important person and I are communicating again after all of these years. What is that going to mean for the future relevations about Dads work?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know.... thats for later.....But it is extremely important for me to know right now that he is at my right hand side now and I am not facing this horrendous chore alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a little side personal note... hoping that wherever he is tomorrow he will be watching the interview.  Linda

       Thanks for the details about the German situation, really awesome to read flytape's reporting and then have you come in and provide that gritty details that history tends to overlook in the name of expediency; often to it's peril.

       After six years of work Paul Shatzkin published his 600 page manuscript without doing an ounce of proof reading or editing. It was almost as if it had become such a "hot potato" that he didn't want to be handling it any more so he published it and walked away. I was upset with him, of course, for not following through. I figured that I (and Dads legacy) deserved a professionally finished product....but, perhaps he did the very best he could. I do not know the kinds of pressures that he may have faced. Maybe it was best that he did what he did. He did abandon the project but at the same time he managed to publish the result of 6 years of very hard work and that was not inconsequential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just sticking up for him a little bit. His biography of Dad is the best one, the most carefully researched, out there. I believe that he went  as far as he could go at that time. Perhaps someday he will consider revisiting the subject...

       REmember that I have said that Dad always had very strong and high level contacts with the Navy... especially with submarines. Admiral Rickover and he had served together on the old diesel sub the S48... rumored to be the worst in the fleet at the time. I believe that both men felt lucky to have survived her almost constant attempts to go down and not come back up!!! When Dad developed this... who do you think he would talk to about it?

       "It is found that a model ship can be propelled through water at a comparatively high rate of speed and with fair efficiency. The electromagnetic device is installed inside the hull and the mechanical reaction is induced outside the hull directly in the water. The movement of the model is controlled by the magnitude and direction of the electrical current applied to it. The method requires no propeller or paddles, in fact, employes no moving parts. No vibration or sound is created by the source of the motive power."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Navy today will not talk about what they actually have out there and I am very happy about that. But I know that our ships can go wherever need to go.... without making a single sound.    Linda

       Hahaha not even close. Is there a word for someone who summarizes things? A "summarizarian?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I used my knowledge of reddit formatting to summarize the crap out of the work of a handful of different authors and researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is original research, I want to make that clear. Check out the three books I linked to at the top to get waaay more information than I've given here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just can be such a pain to sift through things on the internet that sometimes it helps to put it all in one place, and reddit is a good place for that, especially
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       These are my basic instructions from Axolotl
      </p>
      <p>
       "So, come tomorrow, you will go to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       (see how the thread I made is still at the top? That's because I "stickied" it there. Since I'm a moderator, I can do that with some threads).
On the right side of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       you will see two "bars", one says "submit a new link" and the other "submit a new text post."
You will choose the second one, again tomorrow at noon. After clicking "submit a new text post" it will ask you for a title. 
I would suggest something like the following: "I am Linda Brown, daughter of physicist Thomas Townsend Brown, AMA!"
And then you hit "submit" wait for the questions, and that's it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       So I will meet those of you who want to ask me questions there I guess....Thank you for all of the interest everybody and especially to you Axel for doing this magnificent presentation.... I will do my best on my end of things here.....  Linda

       Hi Linda,
      </p>
      <p>
       I am another one of the mods here and I just wanted to touch base to see if you have any further questions with regards to the formatting of the AMA that you are going to post.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one peace of information I would add to Axolotl's wonderful description would be that after you title your post, you will also see a box called "
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jwxSj0b.png">
        text (optional)".
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can use this text box to introduce yourself a little bit, as well as bring up any relevant information that you feel would benefit the users in the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again so kindly for taking the time to join us here, and I do wish you the best of luck with your AMA. Although I have just started my research into your father's life and work, I am already enthralled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please feel free to send along any questions you may have and I do wish you an enjoyable rest of your day,

       Just so you both know there is an active element which is already trying to introduce his name into the conversation... ( note the posts of 1Resolute) I am going to try very hard not to respond to what I know are going to be provocations. That disruptive Element, you will discover later, has only one agenda... and that is to discount anything I may say or do so that Dads importance and information about his career will get buried.  They resort to some pretty nasty tactics sometimes. I have been training myself not to respond to them. But its taken me many mental bruises to learn that lesson! Whatever they get into degenerates into name calling and broken Forums so I promise you that I will avoid confrontations.   Linda

       I do apologize for posters like that, their combative predisposition is an affront to the free flow of information. I can never tell if they are part of some paid online organization, or just enjoy trolling for it's own sake. I suspect a bit of both has been going on with regards your Father's legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the provocations you may encounter in your AMA; the mods of this subreddit are relatively well versed in the metasphere and how trolls/disinfo agents tend to operate. If we see this occurring we will make sure to deal with the offending party in the most appropriate of manners.

       Quick question Linda - I have been preparing to do some experiments of your dad's effect, and been attempting to acquire a high dielectric strength material, calcium copper titanate oxide (CCTO), as my understanding of the effect is that the dielectric strength of of the dielectric used (typically air in most lifters, the "air gap") is key to producing greater thrust. Air having a quite poor dielectric constant compared to materials like CCTO or barium titanate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately I've run into some roadblocks in procuring large diameter (60mm for instance... vs 16mm that they have available) ceramic CCTO, and mixing it with epoxy appears to cut the dielectric strength far too much to be reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to get your thoughts on using high-dielectric constant materials for the dielectric in a lifter design, such as barium titanate or CCTO.

       Marcus,

      <p>
       I wish that I had that information at the tip of my fingertips for you right now but as I have explained... I am no scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I am putting together a group of experts in this field and very soon I hope to be able to release technical and specific information. Please hang with me for just a little bit and keep in touch with me. I hope soon to be able to put you in contact with someone who could help you with that.

       Thank you for your reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my question to the experts you might have contact with is if they know of any suppliers/manufacturers capable of manufacturing CCTO ceramics with decently large diameter (i.e., bigger than the 16mm ones I found via contact with a Chinese metals company... I wanted to test one at 60mm) and would be willing to share contact details.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I don't even need details of the basics, I have a plan for what to test and how to do it, etc. as there is a fair amount of good information out there, once you make the connection with your dad's writing and certain hints therein.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a matter of finding a supplier that can handle the specifications that are needed for the best results.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear about the CCTO ceramic dielectric, it seems like most companies can only make it in a flat disc shape, so the 60mm would be the diameter with a 3-4mm thickness. I believe this shape will work fine for the applications of the effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I intend to pick up the 16mm ceramic discs, but I think it won't be as interesting with such a small surface area.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the dielectric strength of CCTO is incredibly high, thousands of times greater than barium titanate for instance (I was quoted a dielectric strength of 60,000 for the ceramic material, which is consistent given the peak dielectric strength of CCTO which is around 200,000).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is rather newer material and has an irregularly high dielectric strength (apparently) due to its internal structure, so I am excited to experiment with it.

       I am a friend of Linda Brown's. I first met Linda at a UFO Expo West conference in Los Angeles in 1996. For those of you who might be interested in seeing some of the experiments that were performed from 1958 through 1960 at the Bahnson Labs. You can see the full video on my YouTube channel located here

       Some of you have been thinking that this is electromagnetic but no it is not. There is a reason why it is called electrogravitics. Where electromagnetic uses magnets wiring and movement to create electricity plus how most of our electronic works, electrogravitics does not use any of this. Think of a capacitor as the device that can create this effect. Now it is not like normal capacitors that are in our electrical circuits today. It is required of a dielectric material which has a very high K value. In the report titled electrogravitics systems that was published in 1956, it stated that a K value of at least 50,000 would be needed to produce a disk shaped craft that could fly at Mach 3. When you apply very high voltage DC to one of these capacitors the positive charge creates what is known as a gravity well and the negative charge creates what is called a gravity Hill. Combined they create a gravity wave. Today though they have gone way beyond that. Where Paul is talking about our craft is because the United States has been flying these craft for more than 50 years. Now I realize this may be hard for some of you to comprehend but it is a fact. I myself first learned of the technology in May of 1971 but it took me 20 years before I could even do any research on it until I received a copy of electrogravitics systems. I am though not allowed to speak about what I did in 1971 because of a nondisclosure statement that I signed. On the YouTube channel you can see a video of this craft flying over the Nellis test range. It was recorded in November of 1994, I received a copy of it in early 1995 from a friend of mine who was a controller on the range there.

       And thats always easy for someone to say when perhaps you have not been required to sign one of those documents. The idea of leaking information is not that exciting when you think that you might end up in a federal prison somewhere with a Wackenhut guard at your cell door.( not that it apparently can't be done!) ( does Wackenhut still have that government contract? Probably not... who is it now?)

       I remember that meeting! I was doing my normal thing trying to sort of " blend into the background" just listening to what was being said without interacting that much but my Daughter was with me at the time and it was her first experience listening to what some people had to say about her Grandfather. Her eyes were wide because she had only known him as the quiet man who used to enjoy watching her ride her pony and who taught her how to swim when she was just a year old. She remembered having  these long conversations with him about " flying saucers" and space travel that she had heard about from her classmates but he never mentioned anything about his past experiences. So that was her first experience meeting people who understood how Townsend Brown had gone into the secretive world that some of them there understood so well... She was in her early twenties and this was all new information to her. As I recalled she was very impressed..... and proud I think.... which was nice to see.

       Well Linda you didn't do that well staying in the background. during my talk who raised your hand to tell me that your father was the founder of NICAP. And I told you that yes he was but I felt that the information about electrogravitics was more important for the public to learn about. After my presentation we met in the hallway and spoke briefly. You told me that your father considered the propulsion end of it was an ashtray development and that there was a bigger picture. Let's see if others here can figure out what that was.

       <p>
        In his version of events, during a high school experiment with an X-ray tube, Brown applied high voltage to the tube and saw the electrical cables “jump.” This planted the seed in his mind that began rapidly developing.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How do we know this wasn't an electromagnetic phenomenon? E.g. how an
       <a href="http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/MagParticle/Physics/CoilField.htm">
        electric coil produces a magnetic field
       </a>
       , thus affecting the metal cable with a magnetic force.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brown concluded that the fluctuations of these properties in space—his “sidereal radiation”—might explain gravity itself, and thus it followed that the structure of space “might not be uniform” based on these variations. If so, then it became possible to manipulate these variations for propulsive purposes. Space, in other words, had variable dielectric properties, with “high” and “low” pressure zones, and thus could be used in a grand version of his gravitators, since matter would, by dint of these high and low pressure zones, gravitate to regions of “low pressure.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Reminds me of Einsteins general relativity, which is based on "fluctuations in the fabric of space-time", which doesn't seem uniform to me, as dr. Brown suggests Einstein's theory is.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...Brown was demonstrating experimentally that mass was a phenomenon deeply related to dielectrics, to electrical permittivity, and magnetic permeability. This was not theory, this was observation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not entirely convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding if gravity is a "pull" or a "push", thinking about it, it can either be both or neither. So the whole "pull" concept could be misunderstood from the beginning as an analogy, making the "push" phenomenon a false concept as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Einsteins general relativity tells us that mass affects the fabric of space-time, like an
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg&amp;amp;t=1m51s">
        indentation
       </a>
       . So mass affects the fabric, which in turn affects another mass, like a secondary effect. In other words, two objects with mass don't directly affect one another. Would it then not be weird/wrong to claim that a mass was following the path in the fabric by either a "push" or "pull" force? When rainwater runs down a downspout or a gutter, we assume that the water follows the path of the gutter, without describing it with a "push" or "pull" sideways force that prevents the water from spilling out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, with the discovery of the Higgs particle, it indicates that some form of "aether" might exist: the Higgs field. The Higgs particle gives (some) other particles mass, without involving the electromagnetic force. Nevertheless, if anything is close to describing gravity, it could be how the Higgs particle interacts between two objects with mass, and to alter the Higgs field could lead to a "gravity-propulsion". As it is now, there is no unifying theory, which leaves the book empty for most ideas, including dr. Brown's research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting stuff to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Just realized that the laws of gravity could be a non-existing tertiary effect (third, after the secondary fabric). Don't quote me on that though.

       I see it as a stronger force moving towards earth that pushes, but is partially absorbed and partially reflected by earth's core. The reflected force pushes matter away from earth, with a overall push towards earth (gravity) because the reflected force is  weaker.

       My point was that there is no force to begin with. It's the playing field that is skewed, changing the path of the moving mass (even though "movement" has nothing to do with it). The force we use in our measurement (Newton's F=G(m1*m2)/r

       It doesn't exist because everything is energy potential, frequency, and resonance. The universe is created similarly to the concept of cymatics. And this makes sense of the elusive aether theories.

      <p>
       "Long before the story of the Philadelphia Experiment emerged to complicate the picture, [it seemed] as if two portraits of Brown had been painted and were now in circulation: one portraying him as a mildly eccentric inventor with some hare-brained ideas about negating the forces of gravity; the other showing him to be a man responsible for some of the most highly classified research of the war."

       If I am able to do nothing more significant here than re-establish that thought then the effort has been well worth it, because if people don't see that about my Dad, then they have missed the point of what happened in his life...
      </p>
      <p>
       That YES he was living a very orchestrated existance. One said what he actually was..... the man that the FBI reported as one of the " foremost experts in early radar detection" during the war, surrounded by loyal and powerful friends.... the other shouted that he was a "harebrained kook in search of " little green men".  William Moore also tried to claim that he was involved in the myth that a destroyer disappeared into another dimension and then returned.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are seeing in some of the stories about my Dad are intentional markers laid down to bolster that last opinion while totally obscuring the first.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I know my Dad. He was no kook. For reasons (that now I am beginning to respect even more)... he allowed that first impression to be sent out there as he cultivated his work in secret in the first.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as brilliant as he was with the construction of his working models... he was just as brilliant in making sure that the public perception of him was " properly warped". That perception has affected and protected his legacy bu nearly obscuring it completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we all " buy into that" We will never uncover what he was actually doing.... and we will not be able to develop for ourselves what he has hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not anything thats just going to be handed to any of us. The question becomes.... is it Time? I believe this is a world wide effort at disclosure and rediscovery.   Linda

       I will ask Linda if she can get the site admin to create a "Library folder" that we can upload files into, or possible some sort of "cloud storage" place so we can all get access."
      </p>
      <p>
       That message was sent to my forum and I have permission to repost it here too. Please just browse through these links. We are NOT the only country interested in what Dad called " electrogravitics" so many years ago.

       And as far as disinformation is concerned.... the games for it are already starting. Just use your own heart to discern what is valid and what is not.   Linda

       While trying to get my head around just how this AMA thing will happen tomorrow Axe said this and with his permission I would like to share the thought with you all.... and my response to it all.... He had asked for me to send a photo of myself and I have to admit that I don't know how to do that... and that the Avatar that I use on the cosmic-token is the closest thing to me... the most immediately recognizable photo that I happen to have.... being ego centric is difficult for me but when I look at it.... I recognize myself... does that make sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway the discussion goes like so....
      </p>
      <p>
       "Also, I will see what I can do with your image. Just in case someone requests proof that it's you, what would you have to offer? I know you've gone through some drama before (I've read through some of those threads!) so I don't want to repeat any of that. However, for the skeptics, it helps to have something that shows that you're not some 14-year-old kid having fun in his parent's basement (who also happens to be well-versed on exotic physics concepts, haha).
      </p>
      <p>
       And all I can say to that first is.... read my words.... after that... if there is ANY doubt that I am who I have said I am I will be happy to meet with a trusted representative and supply him or her with paperwork, photos and ANYTHING they need to assure them that I am who I am and not a kid in someones basement.....thats the absolute best that I can do. I will however note.... that once that offer is made... I expect the courtesy of being taken up on it.... and not be ignored ..........so that the agenda of claiming that I am not who I have said here can be continued. That is a misdirection ploy that has been used to exhaustion in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was extremely nervous this fall meeting with a group of scientists in Los Alamos. My travel companion noticed that and then quietly said.... "They all may be experts in their fields....all brilliant men but YOU are  the only daughter of Townsend Brown here."

       Now baring any computer attack we should be all set. I have become accustomed to anything happening.....I woke up one morning and logged into my cosmic-token forum and discovered that EVERY ONE of my membership was GONE... replaced by handbag salesmen accounts from all over the world! It took awhile to rectify that.....
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect too that there will be counter attacks to my words... if everything follows true to the course to what I have been dealing with in the past. All I ask is that whomever decides to speak negatively about me here be held to the same strict guidelines that I am willing to follow. If you have charges against me... stand up with proof. And stand behind your words with a REAL person... not just a mask. I am tired of dealing with this sillyness but I recognize that it is not just a passing agenda by some jilted enthusiast but a well rehearsed and carried out attempt at further obscuring my Dads work. Knock my credibility down becomes an important agenda.  We have all seen the attempts in the past. If those with that same agenda appear here I will expect them to play by appropriate rules.

       For those of you who are interested in the mathematics I suggest that you get and read the book, Subquantum Kinetics the Alchemy of Creation, by Paul A. LaViolette. This is an excellent book that continues on from where Elbert Einstein left off. There is also a section on Thomas Townsend Brown and electrogravitics. You can also visit his website:
       <a href="http://starburstfound.org/">
        http://starburstfound.org/
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For myself I am not one who does mathematics, I am much like Thomas Townsend Brown in that manner. And one thing I have to say to all of you is THINK SIMPLE!

       I have no idea why a newspaper of the time would choose to " tell that story" if it did not have a basis in fact and it seems that you are being very quick to decide that this story is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even at that time my Dad had an electrical ( and a chemistry lab) that was better than the local schools, and even rivaled nearby colleges. It was funded entirely by the enthusiasm of his combined family... the Townsend and Brown fortunes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever it took... he had... (and that included getting special equipment from DeForest himself!)....
      </p>
      <p>
       You can decide that this is all ridiculous if you choose but that was not the case. The article in the paper is a matter of public record.....When Dad was " at play" at the age of 12... he was in his own private lab. I know that perhaps this is hard for you to understand but sometimes things that are "ahead of their times" are not ridiculous.

       If there are " red flags" which make them hard to believe lets talk about what concerns you the most........
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all with the news story of the " wireless set" in 1917... have you decided that now that might have been possible with a crystal radio? So perhaps it might have been a valid story?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know myself that particular incident happened, so I am prepared to stand behind it. I have seen the article and I knew about it from family stories told by my Dad himself....
      </p>
      <p>
       But.....I am as troubled by the story of " dielectric bricks" that would " swing up against gravity and then gradually settle back int its zero state in steps rather than descend gradually and continuously." as you are! That sentence bothers me too because I don't remember reading exactly those words in anything that Dad wrote himself ( though I could be wrong.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If the quote was taken from someone more recently then I would like to ask your help in tracking that down.... because if it makes no sense to you... (and I am sure that you have a pretty good handle on this stuff).... then I should question it too. I have seen it happen more than once that someone takes it upon themselves to add their interpretation of Dads work and the story that gets generated is not valid. So what I am saying here is that I am dubious about that too... I myself have not heard it, as far as I remember.......
      </p>
      <p>
       You said
I am especially troubled by the story of "dielectric bricks" that would "swing up against gravity, and then gradually settle back into its zero state in steps, rather than descend gradually and continuously."
This just doesn't make any sense. It sounds like the author had heard something about quantum mechanics and discrete energy levels, and then tried to make up a similar story for an electro-gravity experiment. He didn't even bother to make it more believable.
Do you honestly believe that they had dielectric bricks that would jump up and then fall down in steps?"..........
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I don't know what to believe about this.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I feel like going back and forth is getting a bit pointless. In order to make up my mind, I guess I'll need more than just historical notes about these incredible inventions and ideas. If you have some pictures, diagrams, details for any of the experimental setups, some kind of measurement data, or some sort of mathematical formulations, then that is something to work with".
      </p>
      <p>
       Well here is the problem that we are going to have with that... You can not buy an " electro-gravitic radio" off the shelf at WalMart.... and if it is in use somewhere else they are sure not going to talk about it.... will they? and information about it is not going to be passed around for inspection.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I am sure most readers here would find the stuff very entertaining, and then forget about them just as easily. But to have a serious and meaningful conversation, to make any progress, we will need something more substantial than verbal catchphrases like "engineering the fabric of space-time". I hope you won't take this the wrong way"
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely not... I take no offense to what you have said here at all.... and I welcome your help in finding out who it was who mentioned the " falling down... in steps..." I am as unfamiliar with that phrase as you are..
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your input. More homework for me to do... I appreciate your help if you have the interest in it.   Linda

       Thats exactly the kind of agreement that we could come to DTOSS ( Hope you don't mind the initials)
      </p>
      <p>
       I sometimes need alot of help being " methodical" I will warn you upfront.
As some who know me will testify, I sometimes get information in the strangest of ways ( in a block of a certain color... and when I get that I also get the entire "message"... whatever it is.... all at once with nothing left out. If it happens to be ahead of the subject that I happen to be on.... then I have to simply " wait for it..." eventually the subject builds up around me and then I can match with others and go forward together. I know that will seem mysterious to you but thats just another example of me not being able to explain things... and having to " wait for it."
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said.... I will try to be as methodical and "in this moment" as I possibly can! &lt;g&gt;
Yes.... I am prepared to go through everything that you have mentioned. The one thing that I will do eventually is create a " team" that I trust to go through all of this and see to it that it gets properly placed. I have started that process already... and it will be an ongoing thing that we can talk more about later.
Everything is already stored safely and has been collected carefully since Dads death in 1985. I had to loan some material to Paul Schatzkin while he was writing Dads biography but finally got all of it back and now have it carefully and safely stored.
I have a decent facility here and when I get finished with a couple of other projects that are taking my time right now.... I intend to do some prototype work myself. Perhaps later we can talk about that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are already groups which are very well invested in muddying the water concerning this exchange of information... most of those I have dealt with recently are relative amateurs in disinformation and misdirection theatre. I have seen some show up here already... and I expect their presence on Saturday but this is something I have to learn to deal with successfully. Thats why I told you that not much will fluster me. I have learned that I cannot afford to let others "push my buttons".....
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure that we will have plenty to talk about in the future.

       "It seems to me that there is this fog of fiction that is surrounding his works. So to get the facts separated from fiction, the first thing would be that you go through everything that is diligently gathered and posted here by axolotl_peyotl, and give your opinion of which ones are the ones you remember personally as absolute facts that had happened, and which ones you have heard about and suspect to be true, and which ones you've neither heard nor remember."
      </p>
      <p>
       The most difficult thing about information surrounding Dads work is that there IS a cloud of fiction that obscures his work. I have come to the conclusion that it was a carefully laid smoke screen that he himself employed. Using an old Navy saying.... I think that he very effectively " Blew Smoke and then steamed in another direction!".
      </p>
      <p>
       And this screen is still existing. It was either so well designed at the time that it has yet to unravel or he has had help through the years in it being reinforced. No one was to take him seriously..... he was supposed to be discredited. He and his associates intentionally put out information that has relegated my Dads reputation to the very back of the class. And no one has paid attention to his work because ( I believe)that he felt that it might lead to technology that was far too dangerous to " discover " at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the conclusion is still valid. But I am not about to decide that until I have more information. I do think that we are standing on the very edge of a breakthrough only to be matched by early mans discovery of how to use fire. and I mean that quite seriously.  Linda

       Your statement here really defines what I hope to be able to do in the future. As I have told you all, I am no Scientist... I was pleased just to make it through my Physics classes and my Chemistry classes with grades that did not pull my average down for the subjects that I did enjoy.

       "It seems to me that there is this fog of fiction that is surrounding his works. So to get the facts separated from fiction, the first thing would be that you go through everything that is diligently gathered and posted here by axolotl_peyotl, and give your opinion of which ones are the ones you remember personally as absolute facts that had happened, and which ones you have heard about and suspect to be true, and which ones you've neither heard nor remember"

       Thats precisely my chore here during these interactions and the AMA tomorrow. Thats all I can do now... then... and in the extended future....

       And he left me with a mission when he helped me start my first journal in 1963. He cautioned me to write what I was thinking at the time... and to capture what was happening around me, even if it seemed insignificant. He told me to organize my words and write in pen in a hardbound book so that I wouldn't be tempted to tear out pages to " edit" my work....
      </p>
      <p>
       Those journals have taught me alot. In a strange way they are a window into my own past and I really have to thank Dad for doing that for me. But I know now that he realized that it was important for his work too... that I was becoming his little " tape recorder" and that he could count on me to be there in the future. Turns out he was right.  " You are the moment between the Chalk and the Eraser" he told me.

       My point was that there is no force to begin with. It's the playing field that is skewed, changing the path of the moving mass (even though "movement" has nothing to do with it). The force we use in our measurement (Newton's F=G(m1*m2)/r
       <sup>
        2)
       </sup>
       is imaginary. It doesn't really exist.
