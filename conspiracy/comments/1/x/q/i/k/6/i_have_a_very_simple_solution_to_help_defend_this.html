    <div class="md"><p>Whoa, you are really making a false correlation here. </p>

<p>A witch-hunt is based on nothing more than an accusation. I am talking about a solution that would be very cut and dry and based on facts. If Reddit Inspector shows you post on conspiratard then you are banned from posting here.</p>

<p>It is quite simple. Either post here and ignore that subreddit, a sub that is the polar opposite of this one, or post there and ignore this subreddit.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;grey&quot; area regarding r/conspiratard. They are literally the exact opposite of r/conspiracy. They exist to mock our sub and 2 minutes on their front page will show numerous posts linking to our posts.</p>

<p>Give me one good reason why someone should post in a sub that makes fun of conspiracy theorist while simultaneously posting in one that is supposed to encourage them?</p>

<p>And lets not forget that this sub is currently being destroyed. And of course it is not all from conspiratard. But guess what, we either start seeking solutions and trying to fix things with baby steps, or I can promise you that very soon, everybody who takes this sub seriously is going to find somewhere else to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think the bigger issue with this sub is that many people here are unwilling to engage in discussions with people who don&#39;t think like them.</p>

<p>Dare question evidence that 9/11 was an inside job?  Downvote, insult, ignore.  </p>

<p>Point to reasons why Sandy Hook wasn&#39;t a false flag?  Downvote, call a shill.</p>

<p>Question whether America is literally just like Nazi Germany?  Call an ignorant idiot, downvote, ignore.</p>

<p>Provide reasons why the inside job theory of 9/11 has many holes?  Call stupid, ignore reasons pointed out, provide more dubious evidence, downvote and ignore.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not giving these examples to complain about down votes, or cry that my feelings were hurt.  It is to point out how so many here are unable/unwilling to actually defend the things they say.  </p>

<p>I realize this problem isn&#39;t unique to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but it is particularly troubling for a place that claims to be a place for open discussion, and for people who are claiming to seek the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you will wrongly ban many people. For example I whole heartedly agree with SOME ideas around here. There are others I think are flat out ridiculous, have no evidence etc... But if you disagree on here, at all, you get called names, like shill, and people act absolutely ridiculous about it. Its stupid behavior like that that makes a somewhat skeptical person (but not full on skeptical) head on over to conspiratard to vent my frustrations. Because yeah, hate to say it some folks here just act stupid, paranoid, and lack critical thinking skills. If everyone here agreed on everything all the time it would become a giant preachy circle jerk which is what this sub nearly is anyway. Which is why I don&#39;t post anymore, except on topics of agriculture. You can&#39;t disagree or post contrary evidence for anything without being shrieked at and called a shill. </p>

<p>So anyway personally think that&#39;s a bad idea but won&#39;t hurt me as I rarely post anyway and mostly poke around looking for anything interesting or convincing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you want to insta-ban anyone who wants to foster evidence-based critical thinking. In other words, anyone who doesn&#39;t contribute to the circle-jerk.</p>

<p>A free-thinker would welcome questions about his thoughts. He would consider evidence contrary to his beliefs and possibly even change his beliefs in the face of such evidence.</p>

<p>He would see a request for logic or evidence backing his theories as a welcome challenge to shore up his reasoning or to re-examine his thought process. Or to dig deeper to find that nugget of evidence to crack that conspiracy wide open, prove it to the world, and win fame, fortune, or a quick death at the hands of TPTB.</p>

<p>You want to insta-ban people? How about insta-banning anyone crying foul or troll or shill at anyone who dares to ask any of the critical questions about a conspiracy theory?</p>

<p>1) Who benefits from the conspiracy?</p>

<p>2) How do they benefit?</p>

<p>3) Do the benefactors have the political and/or financial clout and ability to make the conspiracy happen?</p>

<p>4) How is the benefit significantly better than the benefit they could obtain by applying the same resources (effort, money) in more conventional, less risky, less shady, less illegal means?</p>

<p>5) How do the benefactors ensure the complicity of all civilians that must be complicit for the conspiracy to be successful?</p>

<p>And the bonus question...</p>

<p>6) Show me one shred of <em>evidence</em>. I know it&#39;s supposed to be secret by definition so there won&#39;t be much. But there has to be more to go on than just, &quot;I have a feeling&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;ve seen you post these litmus questions elsewhere, and I do not agree that they should all be answerable in the affirmative for someone to make a post to start a discussion. People arrive at answers through discussion. And, many of these 6 questions are never thoroughly answered, even after a conspiracy has been revealed. I suspect many people will never agree on the nature of the benefit of the NSA&#39;s domestic spying program. </p>

<p>Take yourself back 70 years and imagine trying to start a disussion about what the Germans were doing with the Jews they were rounding up. And let&#39;s say you wondered if they were being systematically killed. And we&#39;ll put your extermination theory to the test:</p>

<p>Question #1: (Who benefits)  Since most people in the world weren&#39;t caught up in the Nazi mass hysteria or the racial purity mythos, there is no conceivable person that could benefit, from the general perpective. Your extermination theory is already dead.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Question #2: (How do they benefit) See question #1. Tell me, how <em>did</em> the Nazi&#39;s &quot;benefit&quot; exactly? How did Germany, as a whole, &quot;benefit&quot;? </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Question #3: (Political and financial means to carry it off.) Fair enough. But, keep in mind, money can be funneled in ways that are hidden to us. We don&#39;t know everything about how the CIA abets drug sales and funnels profits for off-the-book activities, but enough investigation has happened to know that this is something they have done in the past. Or, see Iran-Contra. </p>

<p>Question #4: &quot;How is the benefit better than a more legal means?&quot; That&#39;s a very reasonable question, but, like questions #1 and #2, it assumes we are operating by the same playbook as the conspirator. Consider the conspiracy of silence around the Jerry Sanduski serial rapes. How is child-rape rape and a cover-up better than <em>not</em> raping? You&#39;d have to ask the rapist. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Question #5: (How do the benefactors ensure the complicity of people in the know) I agree that someone offering a conspiracy theory should be willing to either answer this question or should be very interested in it being looked at from all angles. It&#39;s an especially good question for the very grand and outlandish theorish.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Question #6:  (Evidence) There doesn&#39;t have to be evidence for someone to just say &quot;I have a feeling&quot; and put the idea up for discussion. That happens all the time here, and people step in and reject the idea if the evidence is very weak.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>I think your setting an uncessarily high standard for discussion of something that is possibly true, but secret. These are the standards you would apply if, for example, you were the leader of a country that was deciding whether to take in thousands of Jews seeking amnesty during WWII. </p>

<p>Then, there are at least a couple of questions missing from your list, and these are the background or backstory questions that usually lead people to come up with a conspiracy theory to begin with:</p>

<h1>7: Are government officials or other officials in power using an inordinate level of secrecy around an event or issue that is of paramount concern to the public? Is there a lack of investigation or are investigative panels stacked with non-expert political allies?</h1>

<h1>8) Are there policy decisions that are extremely at odds with stated policy goals or rationales or with evidence at hand? As an example, see the lead up to war with Iraq. If instead, the US had investigated the Saudis further (regarding 9/11 terrorist connections) rather than hyped a public fear response around Saddam Hussein, there would be a lot less speculation about 9/11. The inconsistencies make the speculation and discussion justified.</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair points, except for #6 because that just leads to all sorts of speculation and bullshit and imagination running rampant thereby providing a distraction from evidence-based discussion. Plus ideas don&#39;t get rejected when evidence is weak. The weaker the evidence is, the more emotional and hostile the support for the theory that lacks the evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone over and looked at the first page of conspiratard. Seems like they&#39;re big on asking for evidence and asking the sort of questions I outlined.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to link maybe a handful of posts from conspiratard denizens that seem clearly designed to disrupt conversation here, I&#39;d sure love to read them.</p>

<p>If the answer is no, then you are proving my point. Why should you be there if you are a genuine user of this subreddit? </p>

Does it mean I don&#39;t believe shits fucked up? Not at all, but also hearing counterpoints is very useful, otherwise it&#39;s just an echo chamber. Are they all good points? Also, not at all...but sometimes the things are so outrageous, there really isn&#39;t a good counterpoint short of mocking it.</p>

<p>But for a similar (but not as disruptive) example would be r/vinyljerk or r/frugaljerk, or any *jerk sites for that matter. They&#39;re mocking, but I will find them entertaining at times, but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t like to be frugal or listen to vinyls. </p>

<p>To portray them as people who are giving counterpoints is absolutely ridiculous. They are having a laugh.</p>

<p>It seems you are wanting to say all 30k people on that sub are out to get you and ridicule this sub, based solely on the fact they&#39;ve commented at sometime. Seems drastic and pure censorship to me.</p>

<p>And maybe if the ideas presented here, a sub of over 200k, can be crushed by a 30k person sub that treats itself as a joke...then maybe it was just a really shitty idea or not some conspiracy to keep people in the dark?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good example (other than realizing I use the word &quot;point&quot; too much). I used the word &quot;Obama&quot; 11 times. None of those were positive, per se. Some were to make a point about what was and wasn&#39;t illegal regarding the ACA.</p>

<p>Once we ban one subreddit, do we start looking for other subreddits that are &quot;bad&quot;? How about people who use certain words?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just (to me) self-fulfilling, especially for outsiders. They would see this subreddit as more and more unwilling to discuss anything. An &quot;echo chamber&quot;. A group that says &quot;we value free thought&quot; but goes out of the way to limit the same.</p>

<p>I realize there needs to be some control, but I worry what happens when you start down the road of these kinds of limitations.</p>

<p>3rd down on the front page sub includes &quot;Why I hate r/conspiracy
the 3rd one down on the front page says this : &quot;<a href="/r/conspirata">/r/conspirata</a>]*rd[1] provides some catharsis, and help my stay a step ahead of what I&#39;ll be hearing about from my friendly neighborhood conspiracy theorist over the next couple of days.&quot;  -  <a href="/u/Amelius">/u/Amelius</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a self help sub where they can blow off steam when dealing with people they dont agree with.  Thiis &quot;poing and laugh&quot; propaganda They&#39;ve been repeatins is just pure bullshit and not catching on.  They are genuinely butthurt, and they use a bigoted-named subreddit to carry it out o top of all this.  It&#39;s fucking shameful

    <div class="md"><p>What would be interesting is a <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a> type rule set where even if you don&#39;t agree with someone, the story is <em>true</em>.</p>

<p>This makes it so people who want to have a discussion(regardless of how true the theory is) can have that discussion and come to their own conclusion. </p>

<p>Sure there is some crazy shit here I don&#39;t agree with, but with rules like <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a> we could just boot people for not following rules and let them come over and make fun.  If the rules state that everything is true no matter what, they wouldn&#39;t have the opportunity to troll.</p>

<p>If everyone discusses things as if they are true, people would be required to look up information and come to their own conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of opposite things look alike and being able to distinguish that is what separates intelligent people from unintelligent people.</p>

<p>Yes, trying to get people to agree upon a new rule was the point of my post. But it turns out that people need to be spoon-fed every little piece of information because they are so informed.</p>

<p>It is mind-blowing how many people in this thread misinterpreted my post as &quot;ban people you don&#39;t agree with&quot;.</p>

<p>It is mind-blowing how many people in this thread ask where the &quot;line&quot; is when the line is clearly presented as an option to chose r/conspiracy or r/conspiratard.</p>

<p>It is mind-blowing how many people there are in this thread who have no idea what r/conspiratard is, even when 2 minutes on their front page at this very moment, shows a ridiculous amount of posts linking to this subreddit.</p>

<p>Now on your second question:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The problem is obviously the detractors.  People who have no interest in being here, other than being paid, or trolling.  The problems are the argumentative ten day old accounts that contribute nothing other than name calling, rhetorical questions, forum dilution, and general nonsense.</p>

<p>Do I know if you are a shill, robot, or not?  No.  But, your don&#39;t have anymore decrement than one, so why not ban you?</p>

<p>Look at it the other way.  Why should you get to be part of a community, when you show disdain for that community, and you contribute nothing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it is still thousands of voices discussing subjects. And if I am discussing a subject, I don&#39;t want a disrespectful 12 year old entering to give their 2 cents.</p>

<p>And if we can add a single rule to make it harder for people to mock this sub, <em>on this sub</em>, then it should be implemented.</p>

<p>The problem is the world, people, and reddit in general is full of pussies who stand by bullshit principles like political correctness. There are obviously no leaders running this sub or else one of them would have stood up and tried to progress this place.</p>

<p>But they don&#39;t. Because they wrongly believe that if a single person got butthurt over a new rule, that it wouldn&#39;t be worth it.</p>

<p>I say that is part of life. Sometimes you need to make a tough decision. Let the chips fall where they will. If some people get incorrectly swept up, let them make their case, I could care less.</p>

<p>In any community, you need rules, good leaders, and smart people. Otherwise life itself will ruin it, like a pool of water that becomes stagnant. So this subreddit needs to evolve, otherwise it is fucked. </p>

<p>And it is my belief that some interest want it to be fucked. So we need to look at it like a battle. Too bad our generals are pussies. </p>
