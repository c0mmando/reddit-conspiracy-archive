        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-02-09 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Haerdune.html">Haerdune</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it&#39;s either an ignorance, or just layman speculation. We&#39;re basically one of the oldest and the largest of fraternities. So, in a sense we&#39;re like Time Lords as in, we&#39;re not necessarily all the other fraternities, they just kind of look like us. </p>

<p>I frankly think this subreddit is more about freethinking in general than specifically Masonic conspiracies. I still kind of want to debunk any speculation you may have, with, well experience. </p>

<p>Just to clarify, I&#39;m not here to advertise the Freemasonry, nor can I say it&#39;s for everyone. As I said, we&#39;re very old, and we use symbols to convey idealistic ideas. For example, the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/MasonicEyeOfProvidence.gif/220px-MasonicEyeOfProvidence.gif">All-Seeing Eye</a> is not used to represent exactly, &quot;We&#39;re watching you&quot; but rather is used to represent providence and how we should judge our actions likewise. </p>

<p>Another common question I get is, &quot;Can I join if I&#39;m an atheist?&quot; which the answer you&#39;ll get depends on who you ask. The Freemasonry originally said you had to believe in <em>some</em> god but now I think they&#39;re becoming more open. </p>

<p>Really, we&#39;re not seeking to control anything, except ourselves. Sure, it sounds odd, but essentially we, &quot;Check ourselves before we wreck ourselves&quot; because we know bad mentalities can be very destructive to one&#39;s self, such as sloth, arrogance, pessimism, etc. We don&#39;t seek to force views on anyone, which is why you must join out of your own free will, and deemed of good moral stature. </p>

<p>Really, we come from ideas that originate from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_Templar">Knight&#39;s Templar</a> and not the ones from, &quot;Assassin&#39;s Creed&quot; because that&#39;s historical fiction. </p>

<p>The history behind the Crusades is actually very interesting, although very simplified in how people these days view it. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have access to any magic either, we&#39;re not magic as a whole, although some of our members have an interest in Wicca and that&#39;s alright. </p>

<p>In a sense, Freemasonry is kind of a place just people to <em>talk</em> and with people who aren&#39;t necessarily super geniuses, but just people. Really, I think a lot of fraternities get to be kind of narcissistic, in a sense. </p>

<p>I actually kind of recommend you go over to <a href="/r/Freemasonry">/r/Freemasonry</a> to learn more about us and what we do. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference in definitions between intelligence and wisdom, a lot of the time the two are considered synonyms, but they&#39;re not really. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, that would be unrealistic, the Freemasonry can&#39;t really be ruled by any one man or even a small group of men, that&#39;s just the way it&#39;s set up to prevent that from happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Freemasonry developed a system that protects against this, which is pretty much the only reason that it has survived so long.</p>

<p>You can become the Grand Master of Masons in your jurisdiction (by state in the US or by country most everywhere else), but you can&#39;t tell any other jurisdiction what to do. There are other bodies that have larger regional autonomy, but the main body of Freemasonry doesn&#39;t have to do anything that they want and even then, much the same protections are in place.</p>

<p>The Grand Master in a jurisdiction is elected by his Brother Masons. Like any election, there&#39;s politics involved, and to be sure, Freemasons are people and people can have all sorts of agendas, but it&#39;s hard to keep any one agenda alive outside of the central goals of the Fraternity: to make good men better and to contribute to the community.</p>

<p>But the mistake that the conspiracy theorists make is assuming that such consensus is trivial to reach. American Freemasons are liberal and conservative; Christian, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, deist and dozens of other faiths; rich and poor; public figures and blue collar workers; authors and teachers. If you get those groups to agree on something, even by elected proxies, I&#39;ll be impressed.</p>

<p>When people assert that Freemasons act as one, I point to the Battle of Bunker Hill where the Grand Master of Masons in Massachusetts, Joseph Warren, was shot in the head and killed. There were almost certainly Freemasons in British uniforms on that hill that day, and they probably would have gladly sat in Lodge with Warren (some may have even done just that!) but politics and country are separate from the Fraternity, even though one informs the opinions one might have about the other.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t we all. I think that the greatest insight that any of us can have in our lives is just what a small part we play in the progression of generations of humanity.

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, because the way Freemasonry is structured, that isn&#39;t really plausible that anyone could do that. It&#39;s possible that someone could <em>try</em> certainly but they most likely would not succeed. </p>

<p>Pike&#39;s influence within the Federal Government (and there&#39;s no denying that he did have influence at one point) has exactly nothing to do with how influential he was within the Fraternity, which was your original assertion.</p>

<p>I would say that, because of his role in solidifying what the Scottish Rite was and codifying its rituals, he was far more influential than a modern SGC would be (on both the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions, though he was SGC of the Southern Jurisdiction).</p>

<p>That said, if he had walked up to the Grand Master of Masons in South Carolina and told him how to manage his Lodges, said Grand Master would have been under zero obligation to pay any attention at all.</p>

<p>Today, SGCs have even less influence than in Pike&#39;s day, so I&#39;m not sure how you think that there&#39;s any monolithic, central bureaucracy within the Fraternity.</p>

<p>As close as we get in core Craft Freemasonry, I would say, is the Conference of Grand Masters of North America, but even that is just a conference, and members are under no obligation to follow through on any decisions made. To quote,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... a voluntary annual meeting of the leaders of the Craft. ... it answers a ... need of Grand Masters to know each other and to learn how others are meeting and handling the problems of the Fraternity in their jurisdictions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, that link you gave is... just horrible, and a prime example of the kind of rambling, poorly edited, screed that gives conspiracy theorists a bad name and sadly, keeps anti-masonry alive. It also doesn&#39;t really bear on what you just said or what you were replying to. If you want to have a debate about whether or not Pike was a racist, I will be happy to have that with you (it will be a short debate that starts and ends with my opening statement, &quot;yes.&quot;)</p>

<p>But if you want to try to connect that to Freemasonry today and to the question of there being some kind of centralized control that exists within it (that <em>was</em> the topic...) then you&#39;ll have to look no further than <strong><em>Pike&#39;s own writings</em></strong> about African Americans in the Fraternity, where he took great comfort in the Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction being wholly autonomous and not having to answer either to the Blue Lodges (the foundation of Freemasonry) or to other Supreme Councils of the Scottish Rite as the latter organizations moved toward inclusiveness.</p>

<p>What top? The Grand Lodge of your particular jurisdiction? The head of one of the other bodies of Freemasonry in your  jurisdiction?</p>

<p>Even if there were a shadowy organization bent on controlling Freemasonry, how would they get anyone to listen to them when no jurisdiction is required to do anything that any other jurisdiction tells them to?</p>

<p>My Blue Lodge dues cost less, annually, than a World of Warcraft account for the same year. My Scottish Rite dues plus York Rite dues come to a tad more. That&#39;s not paying heavily.</p>

<p>Enoch (Hebrew: חֲנוֹךְ) appears in the Book of Genesis and a figure in the Generations of Adam. Enoch is the son of Jared (Gen 5:3-18), the father of Methuselah, and the great-grandfather of Noah. The text reads—uniquely in the Generations—that Enoch &quot;walked with God: and he was no more; for God took him&quot;, (Gen 5:22-29). The Christian New Testament also has three references to Enoch (Luke 3:37, Hebrews 11: 5, Epistle of Jude 1:14–15).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s more of a hypothesis than fact, but it&#39;s said that the Great Architect of the Universe&#39;s name was revealed in an old ritual, performed by Freemasons. </p>

<p>To be honest, it&#39;s probably just a rumor, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard. Apparently, God&#39;s name is Jah-bu-lon, but as I said it&#39;s more rumor than fact. </p>

<p>It has a lot of ground in conspiracy theorist, well, theories, such as the Masons secretly all worship Jah-Bu-Lon. Really, if that were true, I think that would mean instead of the diverse set of religions we have on this planet today, we would just have Jah-Bu-Lonism </p>

<p>I watered it down because I know people have lives and won&#39;t really want me to talk all day. I&#39;m not really here to persuade, just to give people a source to ask questions to me, to learn, to grow. </p>

<p>Our books aren&#39;t exactly secret, although I guess some of our education materials may in some places geographically private, but that&#39;s only in some lodges.

<p>The problem with that is, by the same logic, you should worry about crossing an Italian, they might have ties to the mafia.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this, Brother! A few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What jurisdiction are you in? (there are big variations sometimes)</li>
<li>How long have you been a Master Mason?</li>
<li>Tell me what I&#39;m thinking :-)</li>
</ol>

<p>A few points of clarification:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another common question I get is, &quot;Can I join if I&#39;m an atheist?&quot; which the answer you&#39;ll get depends on who you ask. The Freemasonry originally said you had to believe in some god but now I think they&#39;re becoming more open.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correct answer to this question is &quot;no.&quot; It&#39;s in the landmarks of the Fraternity. There are jurisdictions who have changed this rule, and mainstream Freemasonry no longer recognizes them as &quot;regular&quot; (this is, they&#39;re not Freemasons as far as we&#39;re concerned).</p>

<p>That said, you don&#39;t have to be a member of a religion or be of a particular tradition. In Massachusetts we require that you be a monotheist, but that&#39;s not a universal requirement, and our definition of monotheist can include people who come from a polytheistic faith, but assert the primacy of a Supreme Being.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really, we come from ideas that originate from the Knight&#39;s Templar and not the ones from, &quot;Assassin&#39;s Creed&quot; because that&#39;s historical fiction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Knights Templar were one influence on the religious and philosophical landscape of Europe that gave rise to the Fraternity, but that&#39;s about all you can say. Claims that there is a direct tie between the Knights Templar and the Fraternity are tenuous at best (there&#39;s a Knights Templar body within Freemasonry, but it&#39;s generally accepted that they&#39;re as symbolic as the other bodies).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don&#39;t have access to any magic either, we&#39;re not magic as a whole, although some of our members have an interest in Wicca and that&#39;s alright.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear, <strong>there is no religion that is a part of the Fraternity</strong>. We use the symbolism and allegory of the Abrahamic faiths in our degrees, but we&#39;re not a religion. Sure, there are members of nearly every religious tradition on Earth that are members, but I hesitate to call out any one, especially on this sub, because people will tend to focus on that one as if we&#39;re all members (I&#39;ve heard conspiracy theorists assert that we&#39;re all Catholics awaiting the Pope&#39;s orders; that we&#39;re all devil worshipers; that we&#39;re all Neo Pagans trying to convert Christians; that we&#39;re all Jews trying to manipulate society; etc.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing, I fear crossing a Freemason. I might end up dead.</p>

<p>The problem with that is, by the same logic, you should worry about crossing an Italian, they might have ties to the mafia. You should worry about crossing a Russian person, they may try to stab you to death in a drunken stupor. You should fear crossing an Asian, they&#39;ll lecture you on how you didn&#39;t get good grades last semester. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we really <em>can</em> send anyone to kill you, really, I think even if you insult us, we won&#39;t really care, we may debate you but I don&#39;t think we as a group decide who lives and dies. </p>

<p>We&#39;re not gods, and we know we&#39;re not meant to be gods because we&#39;re human. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say they didn&#39;t exist, just that just because we have ranks doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s an oligarchy. </p>

<p>Give me a break with this bullshit. How many prominent, &quot;elite&quot;, powerful historical figures have been and continue to this day to be Freemasons?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably a lot, and I don&#39;t think that means we&#39;re controlling history, or even the present. Generally, people who want to find themselves can come to us, we help them see their own potential and use it to help problems they see. </p>
