<p>Why does US media always reduce everything to papparazi-like photo ops on a red carpet?  Besides fucking up the competition and sports, this is also really disrespectful to all the athletes from all the nations who put in a lot of hard work to get there.</p>

<p>And if the Olympic committee weren&#39;t such a bloated whore, we could have TV coverage on lots of other channels, so different networks could cover it in different ways.  But that would be a free-market solution, and we can&#39;t have that.  We have to concentrate the profits and thereby ensure that only <em>approved</em> propaganda gets aired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol... I think you just hit on one of the big paradoxes of the (mis)use of the term &quot;free market.&quot;  Americans think, &quot;Well, it must be a free market  because a lot of money exchanged hands in a way that corporations approve of.&quot;</p>

<p>And yet we have a shitty product, partly because somehow this &quot;free market&quot; has created a consumer-hating monopoly (and a propaganda mouthpiece).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A true free market (which exists solely to benefit the cosumer) wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing. Our &quot;free markets&quot; exist to benefit the corporation. It&#39;s one thing to buy rights to the Olympics to get people to watch your network more. It&#39;s another to buy them to sell add space around them. I&#39;m not saying I have a solution, but that&#39;s what I see as one of the problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Competition is great for consumers, but &quot;free markets&quot; don&#39;t always lead to competition.  It depends on how they are implemented in practice.</p>

<p>For example, are there any curbs on cartels?  (Corporations that secretly agree to work together instead of competing.)</p>

<p>And what counts as part of the market?  If Microsoft has a nuclear arsenal, can they use it to threaten Apple during patent negotiations?  (That&#39;s an exaggeration, of course.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the whole point is that a real &quot;free market&quot; should lead to cutthroat competition among producers to satisfy consumers.  But since serious competition is the <em>last</em> thing that producers want... it&#39;s easier to just concentrate power and collude to get ahead.</p>

<p>People (?) seem to use the term &quot;free market&quot; instead to mean a system where corporations have all the power and consumers are unable to work together to balance their side of the economic curve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that there&#39;s a better term. Have the majority of economists even agreed that a true free market doesn&#39;t work? </p>

<p>Or (since we ARE in conspiracy) maybe people only refer to it as a free market because the politicians that are perpetrating the farce of the idea that a market can be free but still have regulation (which tends to benefit the business and not the citizen) only call it by that name (newspeak). It&#39;s a distraction. And it seems to be a damned good one.</p>

<p>What would be wrong with that?  That doesn&#39;t mean somebody else can&#39;t come along and under cut the two of them.  Doesn&#39;t it also allow two small guys to join up and compete against a bigger guy by agreeing not to compete against each other?</p>

<p>The problems you are referring to government is involved with licensing or regulating out competition.  Now if government regulates everyone out but two big guys, or restricts the number of licenses  then price fixing is immoral but the price fixing isn&#39;t the problem it&#39;s the reaction to government not the market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no.  Cartels or monopolies exist to crush their competition.  Standard Oil, for example, could destroy small competitors by selling at a loss in areas where its small competitors were trying to compete.</p>

<p>This does not help consumers except in small areas for a very short time.  When the competition is gone, the prices are controlled by the cartel.  Consumers are eliminated from the equation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, NBC has exclusive rights to film and broadcast the events, which means no other network may do so. Add to that the fact that there&#39;s not enough time in a day to show all events AND the fact that they need some ad revenue, and you end up with what you&#39;ve described. It&#39;s really turned me off this year. </p>

<p>On the plus side, I think the World Cup should be viewable. </p>
