        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>More info:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Townsend_Brown">Thomas Townsend Brown</a> is well known in the alternative research community, and IMO he&#39;s one of the most fascinating people of the 20th century.</p>

<p>We are <em>very</em> privileged to be joined by his only daughter, Linda Brown, for a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> AMA session that you wont want to miss.</p>

<p>For some more background information (much of this is in the realm of speculation), I put together <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wt84p/gravity_is_a_push_not_a_pull_nikola_tesla_thomas/">this overview of Brown and gravity</a> last week. </p>

<p>Linda came across this post, although she hadn&#39;t heard of reddit, and after she contacted me I knew I had to snag her for an AMA.</p>

<p>More info from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1956, the aviation trade publication Interavia reported that Brown had made substantial progress in anti-gravity or electro-gravitic propulsion research. Top U.S. aerospace companies had also become involved in such research (see United States gravity control propulsion research), which may have become a classified subject by 1957. </p>

<p>Others contend Brown&#39;s research simply reached a dead end and lost support. [Citation needed Wikipedia!] Though the effect he discovered has been proven to exist by many others, Brown&#39;s work was controversial, because he and others even believed that this effect could explain the existence and operation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want a crash course on the early lives of Brown and his daughter, I would suggest attempting to tackle this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Defying-Gravity-Parallel-Universe-Townsend-ebook/dp/B00266OWY6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391961481&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=defying+gravity+schatzkin">Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T. Townsend Brown</a></p>

<p>Paul Schatzkin, the author, is known as writing perhaps the definitive biography of the true inventor of the household television, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_Farnsworth">Philo Farnsworth</a>.</p>

<p>Schatzkin spent over 25 years researching Farnsworth, and clearly is no stranger to inventors whose importance has been marginalized. </p>

<p>However, after 6 years of research into Defying Gravity, he completely abandoned the project and released the unedited manuscript, which shocked many, especially Linda Brown, who had spent years helping him research the work.</p>

<p>As it is, Defying Gravity is available on Amazon, but the whole thing is so full of typos and repeated passages that it&#39;s difficult to sift through, although it&#39;s undeniably a fascinating tale and absolutely worth the read.</p>

<p>For those who want to prepare some good questions, I highly recommend it, as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Covert-Wars-Clash-Civilizations-Oligarchs/dp/1939149045/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391963078&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=covert+wars+and+the+clash+of+civilizations">Covert Wars and the Clash of Civilizations</a> which excellently summarizes and expands upon Schatzkin&#39;s unfinished work.</p>

<p>Mark your calendars, this is going to be a good one.</p>

Its important to remember those ideas when faced with statements that are now understood as &quot; disinformation&quot;. The device that Dad was known for does indeed work in a vacuum but the release of that information has been held under a blanket now for years. With your help I hope that we all can reverse that process. This is not going to be easy though. I appreciate your help.  Linda Brown</p>

<p>The description of the fan loudspeaker was taken from Paul Schatzkins description of the first meeting of a young man he code named &quot;Morgan&quot; for the book... and my Dad. Notice that Morgan realized immediately that the RAND unit would be used as an ultra secure communications device. That no one would ever be able to intercept.  Enter the very dark world that eventually changed his life forever.   Linda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dad was never interested in the fact that the fan-loudspeaker could be developed into a commercial success... (though that I think was the &quot; cover&quot; while it was being developed.) The most important trait of the loudspeaker was that it seemed to have no upper limit with its frequency . It didn&#39;t have a diaphram which would limit its range. Consider what that meant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AS I may have explained the large fan that I have pointed out ( Dad called it the RAND International fan)..apparently had no registerable limit to its high frequency. So thats what the work was all about and YES... I would have to say that it promoted some very unusual effects on the minds of those who where close ( or even a great distance ) from it.Those Effects have not been explained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quaint, and extremely interesting. I&#39;m familiar with some of the work done on the impact of infra-sound on human sensory perception and cognition, but either much less work has been done at the opposite end of the spectrum or I&#39;m less familiar with it.</p>

<p>Like many others, I&#39;ve been fascinated by your fathers work with asymmetrical capacitors and the potential gravito-electric implications for years, and I had heard some anecdotes connected to the demonstration of the &#39;fan&#39; device. I was unaware there was this much more to that part of his story though: Hitherto I had thought the &#39;fan&#39; to be essentially an ionic mover of air molecules and as such one of his least remarkable inventions, albeit visionary.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s anything else you might recall, I - for one - would be very interested in any stories you are willing to share. In fact, forget about replying to me; that&#39;d be grossly selfish - if you were to write some small essays, I&#39;m sure the good people of PES would be crying tears of happiness if they were to be posted over there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my memoir &quot; The Good-Bye Man&quot; I spend some time writing about our experiences at the Decker Lab in Bala Cynwyd Pa ( near Philadelphia) during the summer of  1966. If you have done some studying of the &quot; fan&quot; you might be fascinated to know that they were building a &quot; Theater sized unit.... but that there was also something quite mysterious going on in that area at the same time... all apparently under my Dads direction. We were all required to wear white lab coats ( with Dosimeters attached... which were removed every night and replaced.).... Dosimeters... I asked him if I should be worried about that and his response was &quot; If I was worried Sweetie, you wouldn&#39;t be here.......&quot; and the subject was never addressed again.</p>

<p>But thats just one of the mysteries that presented themselves that summer. Dad got a single phone call.in the early fall...... practically threw the phone down... uttered F*#k ( which I had NEVER heard him use...) got up and stormed out.  I learned later from the man who was on the other end of the phone at that time that a prisoner had just escaped from Wormwood Prison in England .... a Russian spy who had been quite a danger to Dads work and security. From that moment on Dad disbanded the entire operation and within a couple of months he had left for California and everything that had been happening on the hill there at Deckers was....&quot; erased&quot;....still trying to put all of that together....</p>

<p>Forgive me but the &quot; good people of PES&quot; are who exactly? I think I must spend a great deal of my time out here in the desert, under a rock!</p>

<p>and may I ask you what you meant by &quot;quaint &quot;  in this context?.... again , I think I must lead a strange sheltered life. &lt;g&gt;</p>

<p>There is MUCH more to the fan than an air mover. Much more.  thanks for your comments!  Linda </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my, I didn&#39;t realize that you had written one. That will be put firmly near the top of my list of &#39;books to buy, whenever funds for procuring books presents themselves&#39;. Well, nobody&#39;s perfect, and I figure my poor naming skills are adequately counterbalanced by my affinity for being descriptive.</p>

<p>Your memoir seems slightly difficult to obtain outside the US, since Amazon doesn&#39;t carry it though - could I perhaps trouble you to recommend a retailer of your work that does international shipping? I&#39;d absolutely love to read it, and I have a fair few acquaintances who I&#39;m sure will want to get a copy as well -- assuming they&#39;re not better informed than I am and already have it, of course.</p>

<p>Dosimeters? Initially that struck me as incredibly weird. Gamma and X-rays seem implausible to me. Although it&#39;s trivial to convert electricity directly to high frequency photons, in 1966 that would imply vacuum tubes, and as I understand the &#39;fan&#39; device, none were directly involved nor needed. A more plausible reason for the dosimeters might be Beta radiation. Since the &#39;fan&#39; was presumably an ionizer and accelerator of the generated charged particles, Beta radiation may well have been a natural consequence of normal operation of a sufficient powerful model. But what do I know: I really don&#39;t have enough information to do more than vaguely speculate.</p>

<p>Although this is the first time I&#39;ve heard of Russian spying in conjunction with the work of your father, this is regrettably what I&#39;d have expected. It mirrors some of the trouble experienced by Mr. Moray, decades before your fathers time, although Moray&#39;s situation probably differed in two important ways: 1. He was unaffiliated with US military and intelligence institutions which might have made him a less obvious target, but on the other hand: 2. He did not enjoy the protection of the same institutions and their affiliates. At least not in the official and informed way your father is likely to have after Winterhaven. Happily, things worked out much better for your father than for Moray. And many others who have worked on similar things.</p>

<p>Hopefully, one day - when the fruit of your fathers labour is finally released for civilian use - more people than just the current small cadre of informed individuals will rejoice about that outcome.</p>

<p>By &quot;PES&quot;, I was referring to the <a href="http://peswiki.com/index.php/Main_Page">Power Energy Systems Wiki</a>. Most of the more ardent and serious students of what your father appear to have achieved regularly frequent it.</p>

<p>With my &#39;quaint&#39; I was trying to express surprise, (pleasant) confusion and interest in one go. Well, it was also a choice driven by the time I&#39;ve spent in the UK. It&#39;s a word they enjoy immensely over there, so it&#39;s gotten sort of... stuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the word &quot; Quaint&quot; and I asked about it because I have only heard one other person use it and that was the older gentleman I have come to refer to as &quot; Mr. Twigsnapper&quot;... He, like so many in his &quot;profession&quot; is known by many names...&quot; Boston&quot;, &quot; Quinn&quot; and on my forum we refer to him as Mr. Twigsnapper.... so if I registered a sort of an odd reaction it was because I was thinking of him... I had not realized before that that you were writing from &quot;out of the country.&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding &quot; The Good-Bye Man&quot;... please save your money on the purchase of it. I know thats a strange thing for an author to say...&quot; Please don&#39;t buy my book... right now&quot; </p>

<p>but thats my request... because I am working on a REWRITE of that book which is going to be so much more important and better informed. The character I have called JD in my memoir, ( and Paul Schatzkin has called &quot; Morgan&quot; in his...) has stepped forward to help me with this rewrite.... so in a small way perhaps we will be able to get a more rounded picture about what was happening in my life.</p>

<p>And for the ladies reading this who have already poured over the pages of &quot; The Good-Bye Man&quot; and who realize how much of a love story it actually is.... Come along with me.... forty years later... and discover with me what was actually happening. I will be turning the pages with you... trust me....</p>

<p>So the word &quot; quaint&quot; was sort of a cosmic haha word to me. I appreciate seeing it.</p>

<p>Thank you for telling me about PES.... there are times when I really do think that I am living under some kind of a rock out here!<br/>
Thank you for your response.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to see his contribution too... Perhaps he will not be able to unravel all of the mysteries... but to see the mans side of my story is fascinating to me and I hope others will appreciate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. Twigsnapper! If I ever end up with a nickname like that, well, I must&#39;ve done something right (or, alternatively, repeatedly demonstrated to others that they&#39;ve done something wrong, depending on the interpretation of &#39;Twigsnapper&#39;. Hopefully we&#39;re not talking about legs here). Still far too young for that kind of honour either way, I fear. Later, later...</p>

<p>Maybe I should have mentioned my geospatial location up front, but really, on the internet it&#39;s usually irrelevant. Being too good at a language is actually a disadvantage I find. In the beginning, native speakers will give an amateur a lot of license to make mistakes, but get <em>too</em> proficient and you&#39;re no longer a &#39;charmingly ignorant tourist&#39;, but a &#39;native who ought to know better&#39;. So it goes.</p>

<p>An odd thing for an author to say, yes, but one that reflect well on you. There can surely be no indication more clear that you care more about telling the story than getting wealthy doing it, and that in turn is just as surely a good sign that it&#39;s a story well worth waiting for. With your consent, can I hand you a contact email address per PM? I process a lot of information, and if I have to check for it periodically, I fear I might manage to forget. And I really don&#39;t want to.</p>

<p>Pointing you in the direction of PES is my pleasure, I assure you. It contains a significant amount of information and speculation about your fathers work. You were there of course, but perhaps some of the information might help you re-contextualize or -interpret events in a useful way.</p>

<p>Anyway, cheers Linda. No matter what you do or where you go, I wish you all possible luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just picking this out of what you have said above to talk about it for a moment. Hope thats alright.</p>

<p>&quot;In a nutshell, the device works by ionizing air molecules.</p>

<p>One device.... basically..... YES.... Its called &quot; Ion Momentum Transfer&quot;</p>

<p>How many of you have an &quot; Ionic Breeze&quot; promoted awhile ago by Sharper Image?  Look into the &quot; prior art&quot; of Jim Lees device and you will see my Dads name. In fact Dad basically handed it off to Mr. Lee and wished him well in the commercial development of it....When Sharper Image promoted it they said that they had developed this &quot; revolutionary new technology in their own labs&quot;..... (perhaps they refined it for sale to the public but the truth was that Dad had developed the technology and built the first prototypes YEARS before.) I can vouch for that because I helped him build them. And there was much more going on with those simple units than just pumping air and acting as a precipitator. Much more.</p>

<p>Did you know that they were also loudspeakers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the original prototype that my Dad and I built in 1962. It was a small oval shaped desk model with the grids that dropped down from the top...( almost like bread would be dropped into a toaster.) I have been told that it belongs in the Smithsonian but for now I am pleased to be the caretaker of it.</p>

<p>The large Rand Fan was taken to a very important meeting at the RAND building in Santa Monica in November of 1967 and it never came home. That evening Dad said that our project had been &quot; shut down&quot; and that &quot; perhaps its time for you to build your own life sweetie&quot;. I had worked with Dad in developing these fans for most of my young adult life....and his announcement was a shock.. but I accepted his advice. Another example of &quot; things suddenly going black&quot;. I never saw that unit again. I don&#39;t know if it survives somewhere or not. I hope so because it was an important unit.</p>

<p>And yes....one could make a Sharper Image Unit into a loudspeaker. It has been done but you might be better off starting from scratch.  I am not familiar with the changes that Sharper Image may have made for production, and certainly I am not the person you would need to talk with regarding the details of that proceedure.</p>

<p>Many of those who have done this in the past are working quietly in the shadows but perhaps if you were serious someone may step forward to help you with a project. I can not speak for them but I could probably make introductions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was my favorite unit actually. I designed the case that it traveled in....which sort of looked like an oversized wooden suitcase... but when you opened it up the front panel and the back panel of it folded down in sort of a triangle base which elevated the fan to eye level. It was a good solid design and that case protected the fan from damage. So I imagine that it might still be sitting somewhere. Maybe whoever has it doesn&#39;t know what it is capable of
.</p>

<p>That same fan was sitting in my Dads office when &quot;Morgan&quot; walked down that hallway and hesitated at his door. He had come for an ice skating party with some of our other classmates but somehow Morgan happened to catch sight of Dad working at his desk... I heard my Dad say &quot; Hello there..please, come in...... About thirty minutes later I realized that Morgan hadn&#39;t joined the rest of us so I went up to investigate. Apparently Dad had given him some sort of demonstration of the fan... when I showed up at the Door Morgan turned to me as if he had experienced something that was truly mind blowing.... he was asking something about the high frequency of it....and then he just headed toward the door as if he had seen a ghost.( It took him a couple of months before he even started to look in my direction at school...and that hurt my feelings.) I didn&#39;t know what had happened.</p>

<p>Years later Morgan said that what he had experienced there in Dads study was so mind blowing he could never have described it to me then...(standing in the flow of air from the fan, he had experienced what he thought was sort of a massive vision. He had seen his entire life, all of its adventures and heartaches laid out in front of him... all at once, in a flash).... That had just happened when I reached the doorway and when Morgan turned in my direction the color just drained from his face... He was excusing himself and rapidly heading for the door... trying desperately to get out into the cold and dark and AWAY......He told me later that what he had experienced was  almost too much for him at that moment.</p>

<p>So yes... whoever has it. Do they know what it is capable of?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am familiar with the effects of negative and positive ions on the human mood.... the fans were adjustable.... and you really noticed how much better you felt when it was more on the negative side.... like the air during a thunderstorm... or the air near a waterfall or the waves crashing on a beach... Ever feel like just dancing for joy in that kind of a setting? Where the postive Ions make you feel depressed and slow... The Navy useds negative ions in their subs ( and I can&#39;t help hearing &quot; we all live in a yellow submarine! In the back of my mind....</p>

<p>But this &quot;vision&quot; went far beyond that.... I have had a chance now to talk to Morgan about that experience then and he has told me that almost everything that he &quot; saw&quot; has already come true.... even the sight of small pebbles rolling away from his boots on a rocky trail... He won&#39;t share the rest of it... and frankly I am not sure that I want to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A clarification for my previous message. Dad called the large fan &quot; the Rand Fan&quot; because it was developed under the auspices of the business entity he had at the time. Based in Nassau it was called &quot; Rand International&quot; and was the business link of  the Townsend Brown Foundation, Nassau Ltd. It was not at all connected with the RAND company in Santa Monica which is still known as the &quot; think tank&quot; for the military, CIA and other organizations. Whatever the &quot; Rand Fan&quot; represented to them...it must have been important because that particular unit never came home.</p>

<p>Years later Dad contacted a man by the name of Jim Hill and basically handed him working information on how to make the simple fan..... which Mr. Lee then developed into the Ionic Breeze.. ( a couple of years) after Dads death. Dad didn&#39;t care about the fan. He called it an &quot; ashtray product&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THe ion iwnd fan is very simple. A positvie and negative charge on the wire vs the metal strip (or a grid or a screen) moves air between them.</p>

<p>Since sound is the pulsing of air allit would take is to modulate the electricity going to the machine to create pulses of air.
A loudspeaker normally has to move the mass of the diaprahm back and forth(usually a black paper cone). that limits how fast it moves and since all peices of the diaprhamm don&#39;t actually change direction fast enough it causes distortion in the sound wave.</p>

<p>since the electric wind machine is moving the air itself then it can move it faster (limitedonly by how fast you can switch or modulate the power to it) and without any mechanically induced distortion.</p>

<p>There may be different types.. electrostatic speakers have been wonderful but make sure  when you are looking at the speaker...( to be the same as Dads &quot; fan-speaker&quot;) it has to have no diaphram at all. No moving parts. Thats a very important distinction.</p>

<p>&quot;Air was pumped out to a pressure of 3.75E-5 Torr, indicated by the big red dot on the dielectric strength plot shown above. At this pressure, the 30 kV potential across the lifter element can easily be handled and no arcing or glow discharge occurs. The result of this experiment was zero thrust, or at least no thrust that could change the position of our very weakly spring loaded lifter. This definitely confirms that the main lifters&#39; thrust is of an ElectroHydroDynamic form, due to ion interaction with neutral air particles, and disproves once for all any antigravity theory.&quot; </p>

A demonstration of the &quot; Biefeld Brown Effect&quot; is indeed related but not entirely the same thing. Please be careful to note that there is a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Precisely DoTheOrdersStillStand.... My Dad was a very quiet, diligent and self effacing man. He would not have made grandiose statements. His &quot; Stress in Dielectrics&quot; was what his Effect was actually showing.... and thats what he said it was.</p>

<p>Others have ramrodded the word &quot; antigravitic&quot; into the words describing his work. He would not have called it that. Ever since the fifties there has been a very strong element of intentional disinformation inserted into almost every discussion of my Dads work.</p>

<p>The fascinating part of all of this... from my part of it...is that I can see situation where my Dad himself was responsible for turning the tide of interest away from himself and his work. I don&#39;t necessarily buy the idea that it was always &quot; the government&quot;.... though I am sure that the military had their hands in things... especially the Navy.</p>

<p>Dad had strong and very high level connections with submarines. You can expect this once you learn that very early on he devised a propulsion system that was totally silent and had no moving parts. Do you think someone like Admiral Rickover might have been interested? Linda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Precisely axolotl. Precisely. But you have to remember the times. It was the fifties... the atomic age was suddenly upon all of us and the Russians were considered our mortal enemy ( at least that is what we were being told... the arms race was on full throttle. The CIA and its English counterparts were infiltrated by Russian agents. If you HAD something it was a matter of national security to keep it safe. Yes... I believe that Dad cloaked his work in disinformation that was so well orchestrated that it is still working.... but the edges are meant to start fraying...and I think that it is time for us finally to figure out what was REALLY going on.</p>

<p>To understand his actions then we all really need to put ourselves back in that mindset.... and to know that this was a project that is still being protected even as I type this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what Dad said about that particular &quot; departure&quot;</p>

<p>Here he is talking about the Effect he discovered as a student.....and wrote about in 1977.</p>

<p>&quot;The Effect is manifested as a departure from the Coulomb Law of electrostatic attraction, in that the opposite forces are not equal. The negative electrode appears to chase the positive electrode, so that there is a net force of the system  in the negative-to-positive direction&quot; (T. Townsend Brown, 1977).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for taking the time to put this all together and keep the discussion going.</p>

<p>I wonder, what would you think of Paul La Violette&#39;s book?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a little unfair to his legacy if we kept focusing on his interpretations requiring major changes to fundamental laws of electrodynamics and gravity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my understanding, he was by no means the only person to make these claims, though he was one of the first.</p>

<p>Even if he didn&#39;t interpret his observations correctly at first, couldn&#39;t it still mean that they <em>are</em> indicative of something outside of the realm of &quot;normal&quot; electrodynamics and gravity?</p>

<p>Is it <em>so</em> unreasonable that there exist &quot;off-the-books&quot; areas of physics that are being pursued in clandestine research operations?</p>

<p>If this were true, wouldn&#39;t there be a history of brilliant inventors/scientists whose histories have been marginalized and obfuscated because they were being to tap uncomfortably close to these realms?</p>

<p>Brown isn&#39;t the only person who falls into that category, but he might be one of the most important. </p>

<p>Again, I really do wonder what you would think of Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion by La Violette.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said &quot;Now I don&#39;t know everything about Thomas Brown&#39;s works (which is why I like to learn more about his loudspeaker), also don&#39;t think it is unreasonable at all to consider clandestine research and black ops.......</p>

<p>.His &quot; loudspeaker&quot; has some extremely unusual qualities which were useful in the clandestine world so much of what was known about it is not going to show up for public use. Not a whole lot I can add to all of that....</p>

<p>. one of the things that I can say about it was that it was extremely linear and the feeling that you had about the sound that came from it was that it never &quot; dropped off.... You could be 200 feet away from the front of the loudspeaker and it sounded the same as if you were standing right in front of the face of it. And the odd thing about that is that you got the impression that the sound then was somehow several feet BEHIND the unit.... Odd, to say the least.</p>

<p>The fan though... as far as Dad was concerned was simply an &quot; ashtray product&quot;..... an electrokinetic device.... he handed the technology over to a man who spent some time and effort making it user friendly and that became the Ionic Breeze..... just ashes off of the real importance of the developments it represented. He couldn&#39;t have cared less about developing it for a household appliance.</p>

<p>I really think that you guys have your hands full regarding what all of this is going to mean....because there are still alot of puzzles missing.</p>

<p>That you have read my words about Townsend Brown and have come to the conclusion that he was &quot; an honorable man, with a big heart&quot; Is all I could ever ask of you and of others!</p>

<p>Myself? Frankly.... I don&#39;t give a rip about how all of the &quot; science&quot;  is explained eventually. Its going to be up to all of you and I WANT you to look hard at everything that Dad proposed! He was not a mathematician and sometimes couldn&#39;t even explain how he had come to the decision that a certain model would actually work. He thought of it.... he built it...it worked as designed and he  left others to explain it.
And sometimes because of security concerns, he could not even mention what he had accomplished. </p>

<p>Thats the way the process of inspiration worked for him. He probably wasn&#39;t right many of the times as far as classical physics but the fact does not discount what he accomplished.  There are those who do not understand what is happening right in front of them... especially  when it comes to his working models, the things that can be publically demonstrated.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1967 I personally sat and watched Dr. Edward Teller investigate the same fan that was pictured in one of my links. It was called the RAND fan ( simply for Research and Development) After studying it for at least an hour the learned Scientist... (self proclaimed &quot; Father of the Atomic Bomb&quot;( edit in.... I meant Hydrogen Bomb, of course) declared quietly &quot; I don&#39;t know what makes it work.&quot;</p>

<p>I want schooled people ( such as you)  and others of the same quality  to find exactly what is going on here. And as I said... I don&#39;t personally care how you all eventually explain it or whatever conclusions you may  reach. Was Dad  right or wrong? ...he never wrote his theories down so there is no way to judge what was in his head... he just built the danged things and they did what he expected them to do. I would think that proves something. </p>

<p>Its the first of a very long road now and I wish all of you the very best at it.</p>

<p>You cannot hurt my feelings regarding my Dad and who he was. I have a pretty good handle on that over the years...and your description of him is just fine with me..In fact its one of my favorites so far. His biographer called him &quot; Gracious and Resolute&quot;..... and that means more to me than any fleeting scientific opinion.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t care about whether &quot; fundamental laws &quot; are changed or not...( But I do understand that it has to be vitally important to you.) I have the advantage here because I am not a scientist and I can rightfully turn to all of you and say.... explain this? Don&#39;t just call it anomalous behaviour and stash the Effect away where you don&#39;t have to deal with it.  Its really going to be a problem that you guys are going to have to figure out someday. If there is anyway that I can help in that quest I will be right there for you.</p>

<p>and I assure you..while writing this..... I am not angry, not even ruffled....I am putting alot of pressure out there in your direction and am  going to repeat to you something that my Dad would have said..... Go Forth!   Linda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say this DoTheOrdersSTilStand</p>

<p>You said:</p>

<p>&quot;You mentioned interests from armed forces in your dad&#39;s ideas and inventions. I have respect to all men and women in uniforms all around the world defending their lands. That being said, these fellows are not hardcore physicists. Their interest in science is usually limited to its potential applications in their fields. They usually lack that deep sense of appreciation we physicists have, which comes only after years of active research. For all we care, the US Army might have simply lost interest after realizing that it won&#39;t unlock the difficulty of space travels which was the big issue at the time.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you including the physicists of the Naval Research Lab in your comment? I am not sure that they might agree that they did not have a history of being hard-core physicists.  &lt;g&gt;   </p>

But as you know DoTheOrdersStilStand.........
 Many quality scientists however are not able to step forward with their discoveries in the public...Some of them can and do prove their work but can not reveal it.   What do you call them then?</p>

<p>What if your work needed to be hidden like that?</p>

<p>What would you want to be called if you were one of them? </p>

<p>You seem like a very well-informed and intelligent individual, I <em>highly</em> recommend you check out this book:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Antigravity-Propulsion-Classified-Technology/dp/159143078X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1392046869&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=paul+laviolette">Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion: Tesla, UFOs, and Classified Aerospace Technology</a></p>

<p>Also, I can&#39;t help but quote Linda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh....there are many things happening here. When you talk about an EHD device you may be referring to what they now call &quot;lifters&quot;. A demonstration of the &quot;Biefeld Brown Effect&quot; is indeed related but not entirely the same thing. Please be careful to note that there is a difference.</p>

<p>Dad hated the use of the word &quot;anti-gravity.&quot; He used the phrase &quot;stress in dielectrics&quot; but the press dumped that in favor for the more sensational antigravity phrase.</p>

<p>There is much more here folks than you have been encouraged to see in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I encourage you to follow her advice and research the experiments that occurred in France in the 50&#39;s. </p>

<p>Not only were they wildly successful, but indeed the effect <em>was</em> observed in a vacuum! </p>

<p>IMO it&#39;s no coincidence that research into exotic technologies went black in the 50&#39;s.</p>

<p>Thank you for your healthy skepticism, it&#39;s much appreciated and helps create a better discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I would like to agree at the time that they were &quot; wildly successful&quot; ( and I believe that they WERE.....) the public was not treated to that enthusiasm. In fact... the public was not treated to any information at all. The entire subject of the tests became highly confidential. I am not going to use the word &quot; Classified&quot; because that infers that the military was involved. In this case... I am not sure that the military even knew about these tests or where the results were moved afterward. Thats one of the arms of this disinformation project... the simple use of that word Classified leads people to make certain assumptions... which may be a mistake.</p>

<p>If you read what the organizer of the French Project said.... they did get a result that could not be explained. And then suddenly the entire project shut down and no more information was available. And it was not until just the last couple of years that the translations of that French Project have become available ( thanks to a wonderful man by the name of Raymond Lavas)</p>

<p>I believe &quot; wildly successful&quot; is probably a very good expression to use. (though all of that was later buried) The picture of my Dad drinking champagne with a straw during their celebrations speaks to that. Alcohol made Dad very sick. It had to have been a very special occasion.   Linda</p>

<p>&quot;Here is a way to respond to this individual. The following is a description by Dr. Mason Rose who was an associate of Thomas Townsend Brown..............................</p>

<p>“The saucers made by Brown have no propellers, no jets, no moving parts at all. They create a modification of the gravitational field around themselves, which is analogous to putting them on the incline of the hill. They act like a surfboard on the wave…. The electro-gravitational saucer creates its own “hill,” which is a local distortion of the gravitational field, then it takes this “hill” with it in any chosen direction and at any rate. The occupants of one of Brown&#39;s saucers would feel no stress at all, no matter how sharp the turn or how great the acceleration. This is because the ship and the occupants and the load are all responding equally to the wavelike distortion of the local gravitational field.”</p>

<p>A better way to describe this would not be antigravity but actually a warp drive. If you look up the term anti- you will find that it means the opposite of or the cancellation of. Now you must ask yourself is that what is actually happening here or is it controlling gravity by manipulating the fabric of space around the craft?&quot;..</p>

<p>I thank him and I hope this helps Nemnel.   Linda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Linda, that&#39;s very interesting. I actually studied physics, and I would love to see a more rigorous (i.e. mathematical) description of what this is doing. While I do admit that it is possible, in so far as anything is possible, I am not sure that I totally understand exactly what you are trying to describe. (I mean, I understand the analogy, I just don&#39;t know how an electromagnetic field would modify the gravitational field.) I would love to know more, though! I&#39;m very open minded, I just haven&#39;t heard of this area of research before!</p>

<p>If unification with gravity really has been suppressed, I know quiet a few physicists who would be very interested in reading about and spreading this work to a more general audience. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that there are more than a few &quot;citation needed&quot; marks on that Wikipedia page...it&#39;s a highly controversial subject.</p>

<p>FTA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The effect has become something of a cause célèbre in the UFO community, where it is seen as an example of something much more exotic than electrokinetics.</p>

<p>At one time, Brown believed his devices produced mysterious fields that interacted with the Earth&#39;s gravitational pull. Certain fringe researchers continue to claim that conventional physics cannot adequately explain the phenomenon.</p>

I am sorry that I will miss responding to you.</p>

<p>I am the sole heir to my Dads Estate and have been caretaking his material since his death in 1985. I have slowly released some information from his files for years now and possibly much of the material that you have read about T. Townsend Brown has come from those family archives,  released through various helpful individuals.</p>

<p>I have seven of his handwritten notebooks ... some of which have been copied and released on the Internet. I expect that other of Dads more covert associates are in control of even more notebooks and I am hoping that soon even those may be released . </p>

<p>I have dedicated myself, especially in the last decade to assisting researchers in his field and helping where I can to expand the public knowledge about his work.  Thanks for your question.... Did I answer it alright for you?   Linda </p>

<p>One more thing. I hope the mods do well regarding your AMA. You may be ridiculed by some less than notable reputations around this site but I think the mods will probably keep it fairly clean. That thread is going to be big for this forum and probably just what it needs. Thanks again for your prompt reply.

Dads patents are all in the public domain now so they are available for folks without restrictions. Patents only are available for a certain number of years as you know, and of course any protection that Dad might have had with them belongs to the public now.....And of course his private notebooks are being held for the future and I haven&#39;t decided how I will make the balance of them available to the public yet. Its an interesting thought though. I agree with the idea but am not sure just yet how to apply it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I mention a &quot; hornets nest &quot;response, I meant a coordinated response which is meant to wipe all of these conversations into nothingness..I am sure that all of you have experienced this kind of thing in various conspiracy forums but you will learn that subjects surrounding Thomas Townsend Brown seem to warrent very close attention by some groups that will spend an amazing amount of time trying to see to it that the subject gets buried or erased. It seems a rather standard response when conversations get uncomfortably close to a subject that needs to remain hidden.</p>

<p>I am speaking from a certain amount of personal experience with what I would call silly diversions but they are actually very effective time wasters....( I spent close to 6 months once communicating with a forum which suddenly decided to declare that I wasn&#39;t actually Townsend Browns daughter. Falling for that.... I offered information that only his daughter would know....went through strange conversations trying to &quot; prove myself&quot;... finally even offered to meet the head of the  Forum website in his own hometown.... buy him lunch and since he was having car trouble I even offered to send a car for him......I promised I would bring my birth certificate and other paperwork which would prove beyond a shadow of doubt that I was who I said I was.... He never responded..... about then.... like a mule and a two by four.... I finally figured out what was happening.... diversion....diversion.... bury the conversations in it.... its an agenda certainly and fairly easy to spot once you are wise to it!!!

<p>This is one of the more intriguing things I&#39;ve come across in the legends surrounding Brown. </p>

<p>There are so many different ways that statement can be interpreted that it&#39;s a little ridiculous. </p>

<p>What did he mean by &quot;ours&quot;? Was he referring to those working with Brown or employing the technologies that he may have helped pioneer? Or does &quot;ours&quot; refer to humanity as a whole, or at least &quot;mainstream&quot; humanity?</p>

<p>&quot;Ours&quot; also implies &quot;theirs&quot;. Who are They? Obviously one assumption would be extra-terrestrials, but it seems possible that it could&#39;ve been <em>human</em> others as well, perhaps an enemy or a faction of some sort of Breakaway Civilization that was already well beyond the capabilities of the rest of humanity, possibly even beyond the word of black-ops. </p>

<p>So, are to we assume that he was admitting that some craft <em>don&#39;t</em> wobble? Or anything that doesn&#39;t wobble might fall into the category natural phenomena?</p>

<p>If the former, then would these non-wobbling craft be a <em>more</em> advanced version of the same (or similar) technology, or would they be using an entirely different means of propulsion?</p>

<p>I know many of these questions can&#39;t be answered, but it&#39;s such a provocative statement that I&#39;m glad you brought it to everyone&#39;s attention. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re continuing to post here, but remember this is just a thread announcing your upcoming AMA...though I&#39;m glad this has turned into a practice round! That&#39;s probably why, however, not many people are asking questions yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes,
I understand the situation here and this is just a sort of &quot;practice&quot; run. But I am always fascinated by the thought that someone out there might ask a question that has never been considered before and that very.... seemingly simple thing... could launch an entire new investigation. So its hard for me to back away from encouraging the questions that I feel might be out there... just waiting for the right moment.</p>

<p>I have to realize that though Dads work has surrounded my life and some of Dads associates and has elevated his work to major importance in our lives... there are some out there who would rightfully say.... Townsend Who? The fact that we realized that he placed himself in that position intentionally is something that is hard to let go of and now when the time seems right for all of that to be stripped away and revealed... its a difficult passion to ignore. ALL of the questions that you have asked above should someday be answered and when they are we, I believe, will find ourselves living in a far different world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To throw flame on your fire just a little bit.... In 1950 a representative from Dr. Robert Sabachers office in Washington told a Canadian ( Wilbert Smith) that there was an ongoing project that was several points higher in classification than the bomb... and it had something to do with the propulsion systems of UFOs ( or Flying Saucers they called them at the time)</p>

<p>I encourage you all to just Google Sarbacher Smith and perhaps &quot; secret project&quot; and just see what bubbles to the surface.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t go far without bumping into Dads involvement, though his name is seldom mentioned. This was a HUMAN project.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very cool, I will definitely look into this.</p>

<p>I know this might sound crazy but currently I&#39;m doing a little research into what, a century ago, used to be a hot topic...the great airship mysteries of the 19th century.</p>

<p>It seems that thousands of sightings of flying machines, contraptions that seemed very likely to be of <em>human</em> origin, have been recorded in countries around the world, especially peaking in the 1880&#39;s and 90&#39;s, shortly before flight was &quot;officially&quot; achieved by man. Further evidence suggests the hidden hand of secret societies and wealthy business interests in many of these alleged experiments.</p>

<p>I know that isn&#39;t necessarily relevant to the link you just provided, but it just occurred to me when you mentioned a &quot;historical precedence&quot; to the story, namely that secret research in different types of propulsion has been going on <em>much</em> longer than most people realize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you wonder why I have considered some things here of vital interest... this is a short quote from some of the material sent from New Zealand. Think on what this actually means</p>

<p>&quot;Of the applications of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs), communication appears to be the
most important and most immediate. Gravitational waves have a very low cross section for absorption by
normal matter, so HFGWs could, in principle, carry significant information content with effectively no
absorption, unlike electromagnetic (EM) waves. Multi-channel HFGW communications can be both pointto-
point (for example, to deeply submerged submarines) and point-to-multipoint, like cell phones and
interconnect the global anti-terrorist assets. HFGWs pass through all ordinary material things without
attenuation and represent the ultimate wireless system (Baker, 2009). For example, one could communicate
directly through the Earth from Moscow in Russia to Caracas in Venezuela as noted in Fig. 1—without the
need for fiber optic cables, microwave relays, or satellite transponders. Antennas, cables, and phone lines</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, Linda, I just want to say thanks for sharing your thoughts, experiences and memories with us.  I picked up a small booklet on your Dad&#39;s work years ago and found the whole concept of the gravity system fascinating.  I love that he wanted to hear accounts of UFO sightings to help him with his research, and the description you posted from a colleague of his that puts how it works in layman&#39;s terms.  I hope some day these technologies will see the light of day and that your Dad gets his due.</p>
