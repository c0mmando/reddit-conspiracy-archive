<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7mDXHn_byA#t=1420">0.23.40 - Pentagon summary</a></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that, according to the Pentagon Building Performance Report, &quot;<a href="http://www.twf.org/News/Y2003/01-PBPR.pdf">the aircraft frame most certainly was destroyed before it had traveled a distance that approximately equaled the length of the aircraft (p. 40)</a>&quot;, and that &quot;it is highly unlikely that any significant portion of the fuselage could have retained structural integrity at this point in its travel (p. 40)&quot;, can you explain what caused the most perfectly round exit hole in the outer wall of the C-Ring?</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that the maximum fluctuation between the two cameras would translate in a difference of 25 feet in the position of the plane, can you provide a valid explanation for the large discrepancy between the two corresponding frames (23:19)? Absent a valid explanation for this discrepancy, we must conclude that at least one of the two frames is the result of intentional manipulation, or &quot;photoshopping&quot;.</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain how most of an airplane weighing 100 tons could end up buried deep underground in a hole that closed itself up before the first responders arrived? (31:51)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Since the plane was carrying 8 to 10,000 gallons of fuel at the time of impact, can you explain why there is no plume of black smoke raising from the ground after the initial explosion? (34:45)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Since the plane is supposed to have hit the ground in one piece, can you explain how it was possible for debris to be found 6 to 8 miles from the crash site on a day when only a light breeze was blowing? (37:16)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Since they were only 20 minutes away from Washington and for almost 6 minutes the passengers had been unable to enter the cockpit, why didn&#39;t the hijackers continue flying towards the Capital? (43:25)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Even if they thought they couldn&#39;t make it to Washington, why didn&#39;t they try to crash the plane onto a small town nearby? Why crash the plane in an empty field where they knew they could not kill any more victims than those who were already on the plane with them? (43:30)</strong></p>

<p><strong>The &quot;Sagging Trusses&quot; Theory: Problem - 1. No proof of insulation &quot;widely dislodged&quot;. 2. No proof of temperatures above 250ºC (480ºF) (1:10:58)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you provide any evidence that the fireproofing from the steel trusses was &quot;widely dislodged&quot; by the impact of the planes, which NIST has made a necessary condition for the collapses to be caused by fire? (1:14:48)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you provide any evidence that the temperatures in the Twin Towers were high enough, and lasted long enough, to seriously weaken steel in the areas where the initial collapses occurred? (1:14:51)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can explain how a sagging truss weakened by heat could pull and eventually break apart the structure it is attached to with no external force being applied to it? (1:15:00)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that &quot;the building section above came down essentially in freefall&quot; (Source: <a href="http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=909017">NIST NCSTAR1 - p. 146</a>); given that for freefall to occur no supporting structure must be present; and given that the falling sections did not have any extra energy to destroy the structure below, can you suggest anything different from some kind of demolition for the removal of the supporting structure which was necessary for near freefall speed to be achieved?

<p><strong>INTERESTING FACTS: 1. Major elevators renovation. 2. Heavy equipment moved on empty floors. 3. Bomb sniffing dogs removed. 4. Unprecedented power down (first time in 30 years) (4:31)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fuel in elevator shafts theory: 1. No regular elevators from top to bottom. (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/pVMNxRD.jpg">Diagram 1</a> | <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NIYVGa6.jpg">Diagram 2</a>) 2. Personnel not cremated by &quot;fireball&quot;. 3. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wcm2W7Q.jpg">Volumes not considered</a> (15:41)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that after the initial explosion and the ensuing fires there wouldn&#39;t have been enough jet fuel left to pour down the elevator shafts in substantial quantities, can you explain the at least three separate explosions reported by multiple witnesses at the time of the first impact in the North Tower? (29:16)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: In particular, can you explain the huge explosion reported by multiple witnesses in the basement of the North Tower moments before the impact of the plane? (29:31)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain what caused the huge explosion that literally devastated the lobby of the North Tower, according to multiple witnesses, about one hour after the impact of the plane and before the collapse of Tower Two? (29:40)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain what caused the big explosion reported by Mr. Jennings and Mr. Hess on the 8th floor of Building 7, before either tower had collapsed? (29:51)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain what caused the multiple explosions recorded by different camera crews including the BBC and CNN, after the towers had collapsed and before the collapse of Building 7? (30:00)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain how more than 100 witnesses, most of them firefighters and policemen, could have all &quot;been mistaken&quot; in reporting explosions at the WTC? (30:15)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that what we see is clearly not glass from a broken window but concrete and debris, can you explain what caused the squibs observed 30-40 floors below the level of collapse? (32:45)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that the falling, upper sections of the towers had no additional energy to destroy the healthy structure below, where did the energy to hurdle these large chunks of structure at such a distance from the towers come from? (37:39)</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of half-truths in this movie. They frame every aspect to make it seem sinister as possible and also ignore contradictory evidence. They take a lot of statements out of context </p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to explain the skeptical position and answer the questions they provide. If you want to talk about anything specific, please share with me what section you think has the best evidence for a conspiracy. I&#39;ll give you the parts they leave out to intentionally mislead you.</p>

<p>This one is free: </p>

<p>Q) <strong>Where are the interceptors?</strong></p>

<p>8:34 Boston contacts NORAD about Flight 11 being hijacked</p>

<p>8:37 NORAD puts fighters on alert</p>

<p>8:47 Flight 11 hits north tower; Fighters just taking off... fighter parked off long island because they are unsure where Flight 11 is</p>

<p>9:01 NY Controllers notice Flight 175 is off course</p>

<p>9:03 NY Controllers call NORAD to tell them about 175</p>

<p>9:03 Flight 175 crashes into the south tower</p>

<p>9:15 Controllers in Washington are told flight 77 is missing by Indianapolis</p>

<p>9:32 DC Controllers call NORAD and tell them Flight 77 is missing</p>

<p>9:37 Flight 77 crashes into Pentagon</p>

<p>9:28 Cleavland loses contact with Flight 93</p>

<p>9:43 Herndon (VA) controller calls the FAA and tells them United 93 is not responding and is off course</p>

<p>10:00 A pilot sees Flight 93 rocking its wings reports it</p>

<p>10:03 Flight 93 crashes</p>

<p>10:14 Controllers call NORAD and tell Flight 93 is down</p>

<p>It is all on tape here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/09/08/nyregion/911-tapes.html">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/09/08/nyregion/911-tapes.html</a></p>

<p><strong>A) They did not have enough time to intercept</strong>. Compare the time.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So all that bullshit in the middle about the military and Cheney means nothing.</p>

<p>The military did not have enough time to respond. Yeah, if they somehow knew from Flight 11 that there were 4 planes hijacked, they could have intercepted them. But that is 20/20 hindsight something they did not have on 9/11.</p>

<p>Wargames did not reduce the level of alert fighters on duty. The wargames going on at the time was a Russian bomber over Alaska. -The month long- training exercise could include hijackings. </p>

<p>There was 4 planes on alert for that section of the United States and it had been that way since 1997 when Clinton started closing bases.</p>

<p>Guess what? Today, there is a total of ~18 alert fighters for the entire United States and they fixed the system of controllers reporting to NORAD. The approximate time to respond -TODAY- is 10 minutes. (they don&#39;t release the actual number so this is estimated)</p>

<p>But we are looking at the problem with 20/20 hindsight. They didn&#39;t know how many planes were hijacked. </p>

<p>The reason they got 300 in the air so fast is because every military person saw what was happening and ran the hell there to every military base to get 300 planes in the air. Which is pretty damn remarkable.</p>

<p>Are you going to pay all those people required to get 300 planes in the air to stand on alert? 24/7 for approximately 1 hijacking ever 10 years in US airspace?</p>

<p>Oh and the advace warning stuff is all 20/20 hindsight too. The president gets all kinds of intelligence on this country and that rebel looking to do this act here. It is really easy to look back and see with full clarity what should have happened. Predicting the future? Not so easy. What do you think the Pentagon does every day? They are trying to predict the future.</p>

<p>When when you do try and predict the future, like say, someone using liquids to blow up a plane, every soccer mom yells at the government why she can&#39;t take her three bottles of wine on the plane now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite part about your post, is how it is quite possibly the only post in this thread offering a legitimate rebuttal to the insanely-biased &quot;facts&quot; from the OP, yet every response dismisses it simply because it doesn&#39;t fit the hive-mind.</p>

<p>Great job on taking the time to collect and post this. You&#39;re the reason I can still have a sliver of faith in the American public every time the truthers piss themselves over some new post.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting this, it has crystallized an already solid position.  Dimension has been around for years and only pops out in these threads.  He has a somewhat supernatural ability to rise to the top without saying much at all.</p>

<p>Fucking bingo.
Unfortunately it seems most posters here might only realize this shit when they&#39;ve either bought into it hook line &amp; sinker, or actually given their hard earned money.</p>

<p>No kids, Beck, and Alex Jones aren&#39;t interested in &quot;enlightening&quot; you, they want you to spread their &quot;word&quot; which in turn gives them attention, and money.
It&#39;s probably one of the most ironic things about modern conspiracy.
It&#39;s the fact that, the only reason these people promote them is for money from gullible fucking halfwits, who are soon parted from their money.</p>

<p>And you fucking buy it.</p>

<p>Because you aren&#39;t armed with sufficient faculties to discern rational conclusions from fucking fairy tales.</p>

<ul>
<li>Key people in the chain of command were missing that day.</li>
<li>Simultaneous training exercises that were not canceled drew most of the planes away.</li>
<li>&quot;Confusion&quot; caused the few planes that were around to be ordered to fly <em>away</em> from the hijack zones.</li>

<p>If you believe the official 9/11 story, this represents a massive failure of the U.S. military. You&#39;d think people would be more concerned about that.</p>

<p>Terrorists on the other hand, flew above speed into things purposely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indestructible as much as the Titanic is unsinkable. You can google about them and read about it. They are designed to survive, but it isn&#39;t impossible to be destroyed either.</p>

<p>Flight 77 and 93 were found.</p>

<p>Flight 11 and 175 in the towers, were probably still in the building when it collapsed. </p>

<p>Generally the best place to survive a plane crash, a conventional one that crashes into the ground, the tail usually survives. Cuz it is in the back and it works like the crumple zone in your car. Everything in front, including squishy people cushion it. </p>

<p>Things pilots generally do when they know they are about to crash:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the pilots slow down</p></li>
<li><p>they do everything they can to stay in the air</p></li>
<li><p>they try not to hit the ground very hard</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So there are usually large parts left over.</p>

<p>Terrorists on the other hand, fly maximum power into things. So smaller pieces. Things do survive, but they aren&#39;t very large. There are personal effects of passengers(credit cards, wallets, jewelry, even a paper wedding invitation) that survived too. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they had the collapse of a 110 story building in mind when they designed the blackbox. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there is. But they aren&#39;t good enough if you recall. Two cameras captured the impact. But they are 320x200 @ 1 frame per second. Your camera on your phone is a thousand times better then those cameras. They weren&#39;t designed to capture a plane moving at 500mph. And my  phone camera today still takes kinda crappy pictures. I would have some doubt at it capturing anything moving at 500mph.</p>

<p>There was another camera but it was destroyed at the impact area. Why they didn&#39;t have a remote recording device? Hell if I know. But that is what they say happened. I doubt it would be pointed up anyway.</p>

<p>There exists three more camera that <em>might have</em> caught the plane.</p>

<p>Traffic cam that wasn&#39;t recorded. (why would I need to see the traffic two days ago? makes sense)</p>

<p>The gas station video and the hotel video. Those were the videos that the FBI took that Loose Change made you think was part of the conspiracy. </p>

<p>They were released in 2006. They show nothing because again, video recording devices weren&#39;t the greatest thing at the time. </p>

<p>Well why doesn&#39;t the Pentagon have more cameras? Well for one, it has a full time security army around it at all times. An army that is really good at stopping the occasional lone nut, but very bad at stopping planes.</p>

<p>Your movies lie to you. The Pentagon isn&#39;t some ultra modern building with sleek huge monitors recording everything going on around it. It is just an office building. Yeah a really large one, but you are more likely to be surrounded by 70s green shag carpet on the walls vs a ultra modern decor.</p>

It synchronized both cameras sufficiently you can match the smoke plume frame by frame. This shows the frames are synchronized enough to be superimposed. One video shows an object that could be the aircraft but on the other video, on the same frame, there&#39;s nothing but a trail of smoke behind what would be the aircraft of the first video.</p>

<li><p><strong>at least 45</strong>   The amount of eye witnesses who reported seeing a plane and described it with words like: &#39;airliner&#39;, &#39;big&#39;, &#39;silver&#39;, &#39;roaring&#39;, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>at least 23</strong>   The amount of eye witnesses who specifically said they saw an American Airlines jet. In all cases a large jet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>at least 22</strong>   The amount of witnesses who reported the noise of the plane was very loud to deafening.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>at least 17</strong>   The amount of eye witnesses who stated they saw a plane running down light poles when crossing the highways.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds of explosions means nothing to me. Sorry. There are way to many variables. I can give you an example directly involving the collapse of World Trade Center 2.</p>

<p>This video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE7fWV2qUVU%5B1%5D">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE7fWV2qUVU[1]</a></p>

<p>Clearly the reporter sees no bombs, hears no bombs, as we can see the video and hear exactly what he hears. Yet he says &quot;A huge explosion&quot;.</p>

<p>Now he clearly says a &quot;a huge explosion&quot; as the tower collapses, yet there is absolutely no evidence of actually seeing one or hearing a bomb or an actual explosion for that matter. He heard a loud noise, and he heard it as an explosion. But we can replay it a million times and see and hear that there was no explosion.</p>

<p>But when you pull the quote out without the exact context, eg. &quot;a reporter saw/heard a huge explosion&quot;, it sounds more sinister than it is.</p>

<p>So reports of explosions are always dubious.</p>

<p>So do you believe that if there was a hijacking today, someone would be able to fly around in that plane for over 1.5 hours without NORAD being able to respond?  </p>

<p>The reality, is that under normal conditions, there would be a fighter jet on your ass in under 10 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the whole process back before the Alert/Scramble system got streamlined was ridiculous. </p>

<p>The call would come down to scramble. And youd wait for a wheels up time, and then have to get there. When theres only so many bases with alert capabilities it can take a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coincidentally I was just reading about the scramble situation a few days ago.</p>

<p>Apparently there was an entire chain of command from the time ATC noticed a plane off course until NORAD was even notified, and then NORAD had their own chain of command to go through before the scramble order could be given.  The order had to go through something like 8 or 10 different people before a pilot would get the order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intercepting Payne Stewart&#39;s Leer-Jet took 35 minutes. At 9:33 am (EDT) the air traffic controller attempted unsuccessfully to contact Payne Stewart&#39;s Lear jet. &quot;Pentagon officials said the military began its pursuit of the ghostly civilian aircraft at 10:08 am.&quot; In total, 10 military jets and one refueling tanker were sent up to escort Stewart&#39;s jet to crash in a sparsely populated area of the country. In the last 30 years there have been 682 hijackings in the US which have been responded to in accordance with appropriate FAA procedures. In the calendar year prior to 9/11, fighter aircraft were successfully scrambled on 56 occasions in response to such emergencies within minutes.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the NTSB accident report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 0933:38 <strong>EDT</strong> (6 minutes and 20 seconds after N47BA acknowledged the previous clearance), the controller instructed N47BA to change radio frequencies and contact another Jacksonville ARTCC controller. The controller received no response from N47BA. The controller called the flight five more times over the next 4 1/2 minutes but received no response.</p>

<p>About 0952 <strong>CDT</strong>,7 a USAF F-16 test pilot from the 40th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida, was vectored to within 8 nm of N47BA. About 0954 <strong>CDT</strong>, at a range of 2,000 feet from the accident airplane and an altitude of about 46,400 feet, the test pilot made two radio calls to N47BA but did not receive a response</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it took from 9:33am Eastern time to 9:52 Central time to get to Stewarts plane, or roughly an hour and 19 minutes.</p>

<p>My point is simply that offering an argument and calling it &quot;irrefutable&quot; damages your credibility.  It gives the appearance of being dogmatic rather than open to reason. It&#39;s not exactly conducive to a discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the book from the German researcher and alternative journalist Gerhard Wisniewski about 9/11 which I read about 2 years ago I remember that he researched a few very important things concerning the interceptors. </p>

<p>He proved that the interception of commercial planes in america was a pretty common thing and that it happens regularly and quite automatically.  There was also no need for a hijacking to have taken place to send up some jets. Interceptors were send out immediately as soon as a plane changed its course by more than 15 degrees and if there was no radio contact with the plane. Usually there was no danger and just a mistake by the pilot. I also remember that the book stated it took them only a few minutes to reach their targets. And this was the situation before 9/11. He backed up his claims with interviews with NORAD and other people working in this field. </p>

<p>Sadly I don&#39;t have the book here right now, so I can&#39;t provide you with good sources. But I will try to get my hands on it.</p>

<p>Intercepting Payne Stewart&#39;s Leer-Jet took 35 minutes. At 9:33 am (EDT) the air traffic controller attempted unsuccessfully to contact Payne Stewart&#39;s Lear jet. &quot;Pentagon officials said the military began its pursuit of the ghostly civilian aircraft at 10:08 am.&quot; In total, 10 military jets and one refueling tanker were sent up to escort Stewart&#39;s jet to crash in a sparsely populated area of the country. In the last 30 years there have been 682 hijackings in the US which have been responded to in accordance with appropriate FAA procedures. In the calendar year prior to 9/11, fighter aircraft were successfully scrambled on 56 occasions in response to such emergencies within minutes.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>You have clearly no idea what you are talking about. He was accused to be antisemitic by the usual suspects, but he actually filed a lawsuit and won. They had to take back their accusations because they were simply untrue. I don&#39;t want to say that there are no antisemitic self claimed truthers, sadly a lot of them are. But Wisniewski is definitely not one of them. It is just pretty common to accuse everybody of antisemitism if they are not comfortable for the establishment. This happens a lot in Germany.  </p>

<p>Edit here is the excerpt from German wikipedia: 
tdlr: Both times he was accused of antisemitism the ones accusing him had to take everything back and pay compensation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Am 27. Februar 2009 wurde die Technische Universität Berlin vom Kammergericht Berlin wegen schwerwiegender Ehrverletzung zu einem Schmerzensgeld in Höhe von 5.000 Euro an Wisnewski verurteilt, weil sie ihn in einer Ausstellung in die Nähe zu antisemitischen Verschwörungstheorien gestellt hatte.[11]
Am 9. September 2009 warf der österreichische Militärexperte Gerald Karner Wisnewski in der Sendung Club 2 vor, „antisemitische Verschwörungstheorien“ zu verbreiten. „Diese Verschwörungstheorien […] haben sehr oft einen ganz banalen, anti-amerikanischen, anti-israelischen, anti-jüdischen, sozusagen auch anti-semitischen Charakter“, behauptete Karner und fügte hinzu: „Das steht in Ihren Büchern, Herr Wisnewski.“ Ferner behauptete Karner, in Büchern von Wisnewski stehe, dass bei 9/11 „nur eine Person mosaischen Bekenntnisses“ ums Leben gekommen sei. Diese Falschbehauptungen wurden Karner vom Landgericht München unter Androhung von 250.000 Euro Ordnungsgeld, oder ersatzweise Ordnungshaft, untersagt.[12]

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  So how do you come to the conclusion that there is &quot;no way they didn&#39;t know where these planes were on radio or had time to intercept&quot; while presenting the fact that they were sent to the wrong destination by the FAA?</p>

<p>Edit: since I&#39;m getting downvoted without discussion, I&#39;ll point out <em>that the video itself</em> presents the evidence that the WH already had the capability to fire on the pentagon airliner, freeing any interceptors to investigate other potentially hijacked airliners in the vicinity (which, again, the FAA told LAFB to investigate one over the water).</p>

Now with a huge plane, all kinds of things can happen. All I can say is it did. It wasn&#39;t the only paper like object found either. There was a bill that was in the US mail bag in the belly of one of the planes that survived too. A wedding invitation from one of the passengers survived too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its obvious you didn&#39;t watch the movie, like all skeptics about this you are parroting.</p>

<p>The amount of fine detail searching that was done to the rubble was unprecedented.  They found watches, coins, finger bones, bone fragments the size of fingernails .. but no black boxes that were by comparison fucking HUGE.</p>

<p>and before you say - they were buried.  All the debris was gone over with a fine tooth comb out of deference to the dead, and then it was gone over even more closely a second time (conveyer belt and sifting)</p>

<p>The black boxes were found and removed ..we will never see them.</p>

<p>do you consider yourself a smart man? .. like intelligent not just common sense smart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 85 tapes you refer to were not confiscated from the Pentagon surveillance system.  The 85 tapes refers to the number of tapes cited by the FBI in the Maguire Declaration as being possibly responsive to an FOIA request .  The tapes include a variety of video sources pertaining to the FBI&#39;s 9-11 investigation, including video of the WTC and video of investigations into locations linked to the suspected terrorists.</p>

<p>That FOIA request (which can be seen in the OP&#39;s video at 17:28), specifically requested video recordings that showed the impact of flight 77.  The FBI reviewed the 85 possibly responsive tapes and concluded that only one of them (the security gate tape with two vantage points) showed the impact.  They thus disclosed only that tape in their response to the FOIA.</p>

<p>There is nothing stopping anyone from submitting an FOIA for the other 85 tapes.  The contents of those tapes was listed in the Maguire Declaration and they would be relatively easy to request.  The reason you don&#39;t have them is because no one actually requested them.</p>

<p>“I decided to walk closer to the South Tower. I was about 100 ft from the South Tower looking up when the bodies started coming down. I counted 35.

<p>“I have seen plenty of death in my life, and burned bodies and so forth, but this was incredible. As I was looking up, <strong>I saw a body coming down, hit a lamppost and explode like a paint ball.</strong> Its arms and legs got torn off and the head ripped off and bounced right by me.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should also add that yes, he was referring to bodies hitting the ground as an explosive sound. And he&#39;s far from being the only one to describe bodies hitting the ground that way. </p>

<p>There is footage recorded from the lobby of one of the towers of extremely loud noises. When someone off camera asks what the noises are a fireman says &quot;it&#39;s people jumping from the tower&quot;. So it isn&#39;t unreasonable that someone would describe that sound as an &#39;explosion&#39;.</p>

<p>My point is the eyewitness use of the word &#39;explosion&#39; isn&#39;t evidence of anything. </p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. The fall wasn&#39;t symmetrical, first off; you can see quite clearly in the video that the east side penthouse and it&#39;s support collapsed long before the rest. Additionally, there were several points of the north face that were clearly visibly collapsing at different speeds.</p>

<p>Secondly, only the north face was every reported to have been at free fall, and only for a short period of time because it&#39;s support -the core of the building - had already collapsed behind it.</p>

<p>Finally, saying &quot;it&#39;s never happened before&quot; mean absolutely nothing. For every single thing that has ever happened, there was a first time for it. This is the first event of its kind in history; I would expect some unusual or even unique events given the circumstances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe most of the conspiracies behind 9/11. The one that baffles my mind is the crash at the pentagon. I am no expert but I can&#39;t wrap my head around how a plane could leave that kind of damage. It seems like a square peg in a round hole problem.  You however sound knowledgeable on the subject. What is the reasonable explanation for the appearance of the pentagon crash?</p>

<p>People who have never seen the Pentagon are at an extreme disadvantage. It is a HUGE building. People don&#39;t give respect to scale till you see it in person. Same for WTC7 (it would have been the tallest building in 33 states)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How on earth could they find remains of everyone in that plane, even the hijackers? When something crashes into a stone wall and explodes in to a massive fireball it would be very unlikely you would find analyzable remains from <em>everyone</em> on board. Bodies would be torn apart, burnt beyond recognition, and otherwise destroyed. The fact they say they found remains from everyone, analyzed them and had definite proof of who the body parts belonged to, should be a red flag to you. It is just highly unlikely.</p>

<p>Also, how would they know how to identify the hijackers? Did we have their DNA? If so, why? Did we have their dental records? If so, why? These were foreign nationals  (or so they say) and US databases rarely have foreign identification records. Unless, that is, they are on a watch list, but if these &#39;terrorists&#39; were on a watch list, how did they get on the plane in the first place?</p>

<p>They did not find any burning plane in the pentagon, you are just lying on that part. An aluminum plane could not withstand an impact like that. And there <strong>would</strong> be sheared off wings on the lawn, if the fuselage did enter the building. We see no significant wreckage.</p>

<p>Also: How did an inexperienced pilot fly that plane so fast so low? That is an incredibly difficult maneuver. And why wasn&#39;t the plane shot down? This is the god damn pentagon we are talking about, not a Wal-Mart. There is security at the Pentagon beyond measure, things the public does not even know exists, and you expect us to believe <strong>no defensive measures were taken</strong> to stop this plane from striking the hub of all global US military operations? Get real, &#39;jory26&#39;, or should I say US government employee. Get, fucking, REAL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have the flight manifest, and an account of everybody in the Pentagon.  Jet fuel doesn&#39;t burn nearly hot enough to disintegrate bodies, so it becomes a matter of experts matching up bodies to whatever records are available.  This is what they did after the Titanic, and after Waco.  They didn&#39;t find all the remains, but most of them.  Somebody above me gives much a better analysis and explanation of why we were unable to defend from it.  I don&#39;t know what sort of wreckage you expect to have rolled back out of the pentagon and be sitting on the lawn, but I&#39;m sure the plane is all in there.  This wasn&#39;t a bomb where pieces explode outward.</p>

<p>The amount of people you need that are able to respond in 2 minutes and the amount of people you have that can respond within half an hour or an hour are different.  These amounts are based on the necessity.</p>

<p>Some other comments...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was 4 planes on alert for that section of the United States and it had been that way since 1997 when Clinton started closing bases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aren&#39;t those being scrambled from Virginia? It would seem to me that it would take less than ten minutes to get to NYC or Washington from where they were stationed once they were already up in the air, but admittedly, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>I can understand how that they couldn&#39;t get there in time for the north and south towers, but the flight that went into the Pentagon was an hour after NORAD was already on alert. Why weren&#39;t they able to intercept it, and, if the movie is correct, how were the hijackers able to get into restricted airspace? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason they got 300 in the air so fast is because every military person saw what was happening and ran the hell there to every military base to get 300 planes in the air. Which is pretty damn remarkable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, they didn&#39;t prevent anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you going to pay all those people required to get 300 planes in the air to stand on alert? 24/7 for approximately 1 hijacking ever 10 years in US airspace?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We already do, and that&#39;s precisely what their job is. Maybe not be on alert, but to be able to get jets in the air within ten minutes or so. It&#39;s the same principle with cops and firefighters, they&#39;re on call 24/7 and are also paid through taxes. The military gets hundreds of billions every year to do exactly that (among other things like nation building and overthrowing dictators). </p>

<p>Hopefully you can provide some more data to back up your claims, I&#39;d be interested to read more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first, if you could answer</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Especially when there were already 2 other planes that day that had flown into buildings. Surely, shortly after Flight 11 flew into the north tower, NORAD should have been ready to deploy immediately, no? They had 50 minutes from that time to the time that Flight 77 hit the pentagon. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wargames going on at the time was a Russian bomber over Alaska. -The month long- training exercise could include hijackings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to read about that. Does that mean that most of the planes were in Alaska so were not able to effectively respond? Also...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, there is a total of ~18 alert fighters for the entire United States and they fixed the system of controllers reporting to NORAD. The approximate time to respond -TODAY- is 10 minutes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you provide some information about this? I&#39;d like to read this as well. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo1ZtpKqlYw">Tru dat. But in the 4000+ planes in the air, which one is the hijacked one?</a> NORAD had to be told what was hijacked. And they were moving 500+mph. </p>

<p>You know 77 is hijacked. The problem nobody at the time knew. If they had all that information available, they could have stopped them for they got on the plane. You gotta put yourself in their shoes.</p>

<p>You gotta remember nothing like this has happened before, even after the first plane hit, it was more of: Wow, dumb pilot.</p>

<p>Second plane hit: OH FUCK. That isn&#39;t a conscience. Holy shit this the worst possible thing ever.</p>

<p>Third plane hit: OH CRAP That isn&#39;t NY. They could be anywhere. That is when they started closing the airspace of the whole country and tall buildings/government buildings around the country went on alert.</p>

<p>First it was mistake. Then it was a NY event. And then it was a national event. In that order. </p>

<p>Yes, they did. They were well aware.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=O1GCeuSr3Mk#t=1222">&quot;According to the Secret Service, the plane that hit the Pentagon was tracked for at least 30 minutes before it hit the pentagon.&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, if they somehow knew from Flight 11 that there were 4 planes hijacked, they could have intercepted them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They did know, after Flight 11, that there were other planes that were also hijacked. This is also addressed in the film. </p>

<p>You are not really addressing the issues that have already been presented. There is ample proof that they <em>were</em> aware of the planes, they just did not get there in time, which seems strange since they could have easily gotten there in time, especially when they knew that the plane was in restricted airspace over DC. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So all that bullshit in the middle about the military and Cheney means nothing.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s actually very pertinent evidence that people were aware that there was a plane coming in to the Pentagon. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y">Norman Mineta&#39;s testimony</a> under oath in a congressional hearing is proof of this. </p>

<p>So they were expecting a plane from the wrong direction. </p>

<p>You know that whole 50 miles out thing? 40? 30? That wasn&#39;t flight 77, that was the phantom plane. How they knew something that didn&#39;t exist was so many miles out?

<p>Flights were not intercepted because nobody was psyhic enough to know that 4 planes were hijacked. </p>

But, that is not the appropriate way to look at things.  Something happened that morning unprecedented in the history of the world and it happened multiple times in multiple locations in the span of a few hours.  Meanwhile, planes are being redirected (to land), and there were repeated reports of multiple hijackings, some of which the planes had already crashed, as well as reports of other things like car bombs.

<p>Yes because this time it would be peer reviewed, this time they wouldn&#39;t reach to the conclusions they would want to without hearing what the other experts had to say about it. Just like when the conspiracy theorists corrected numerous problems with the NIST report, including the free-fall statement.</p>

<p>The reason why the government won&#39;t do it is because they know they will be caught with their pants down, same reason why NIST will not release their models data, same reason why FBI wont release the other 80 pentagon cctv videos that, according to them, &quot;don&#39;t show anything&quot;.</p>

<p>That is another easy one.</p>

<p>tl;dr</p>

<p>Office drone says they have 85 tapes that match the query of the FOIA request. Truthers misinterpret as 85 separate tapes of something hitting the Pentagon. When the office drone meant 85 tapes total related to 9/11. (Hanlon&#39;s razor again)</p>

<p>In my link you can find an itemized report of what are on those 85 tapes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not even that they have 85 tapes that match the query of the FOIA request; it&#39;s that they had 85 tapes that potentially matched the query request.  The query request was very narrow: only videos showing the impact of Flight 77 at the Pentagon were requested.</p>

<p>What the FBI did was review the 85 tapes that might potentially contain such footage and determine that only one video (the security gate system that contained two cameras) showed the impact.  The FBI thus disclosed only one tape.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorists simply wrote their FOIA request too narrowly to get the 85 tapes.  And now no one can explain to me why they do not write a broader FOIA request since they have had years to review the list in the Maguire Declaration.  Instead, they blame the FBI for giving them only what they requested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the official report that exists already was compiled over many months and included all the available evidence and included input from 1200 experts and witnesses.  A majority of the experts in the world agree with most or all of the conclusions of the report (or at least don&#39;t actively question them). Only a small contingent of vocal truthers, most of whom have no first hand account of the attacks or expertise in the subject matter, hold out that the conclusions reached are false and none of them has, thus far, provided any hard evidence to prove their claims.  So, why, based on this, should the government spend the time, manpower and money to produce what will surely be a very similar report based on the objections of a shrinking, but vocal, minority of fanatics?</p>

<p>I thought that quote right there was enough for you to understand that the official story is completely flawed and has no reason at all that justifies not investigating the other possibility. In fact it has as much evidence of &quot;terrorism&quot; as it has of &quot;conspiracy&quot;.

<p>&quot; He noted that the severity of Lindauer&#39;s mental illness, which he described as a &quot;lengthy delusional history&quot;, weakened the prosecution&#39;s case. In his decision he wrote, &quot;Lindauer ... could not act successfully as an agent of the Iraqi government without in some way influencing normal people .... There is no indication that Lindauer ever came close to influencing anyone, or could have. The indictment charges only what it describes as an unsuccessful attempt to influence an unnamed government official, and the record shows that even lay people recognize that she is seriously disturbed.&quot;</p>

50 fighters on alert ready to fly air defense missions.

    <div class="md"><p>As I said in another post. Reaction time since 9/11 has drastically changed. As has the identification of a hijacked aircraft.</p>

<p>No longer is it a chain of 10+ individuals at an FAA facility before it reaches FAA HQ. Only to be disseminated to the military liaison and ran ttlhrough another 10+ people before the orders to scramble are given to the Alert pilots. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Nowadays its quick. One air traffic controllers <em>suspects</em> a hijacking and DC is notified. Alert jets scrambled within ~8min.</p>

<hr/>

<p>JB Andrews, the base you speak of in DC, is a cargo base whose primary airframes are to move high level brass (leerjets, citations,  boeing bbj). The F16 squadron there is air national guard and not on manned 24/7.</p>

<p>The next closest base to DC is Dover AFB... they have C17s and C5s... no fighters...</p>

<p>From Mass. To DC is 270nm straightline. The f15 will cruise at 750kts low level (below FL250)... so 20mins ish to get there.</p>

<hr/>

<p>And those 24 jets are always ready to go. From the time the order comes to scramble (iirc) theyre to be airborn within 4minutes. Not each of the 24, but regionally, why scramble CA jets for an eastern seaboard thing makes no sense...</p>

<p>The pilots change out every 8hrs or so, and there is always a maintenance and ammo team with each jet. </p>

<p>to reduce the whole complex matter to one question, conveniently chosen to be the most murky, while blanking out all the rest, is lazy reasoning <em>at best</em>. an argument ad hominem would look like &quot;you&#39;re a truther, of course you would say that, biased as you are.&quot; or just rummaging through your post history, find a mean sentence or personal confession and use that to attack you personally, like &quot;yeah, seems like the heroin experiments have reduced your capacity for logical thinking&quot; (i made that up.).</p>

<p>The video claims that a person cannot make a cell phone call from over 30000 feet, yet somehow several calls connected from flight 93 at a time when the black box shows it was very high up and moving very fast. I have tried this a few time and I have never gotten any bars on my phone once we are in the air pretty high.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy the idea that the planes were parked at the time of the supposed hijackings, and the passengers were somehow talked into calling their loved ones, pretending they were being hijacked, and then were never seen again. But how did they make the calls in the first place?</p>

<p>Another interesting fact, did you know in 2001 those phone were more powerful then our current phones? Less towers, so they had to be stronger and there was no standard yet for the power they could put out. Analog phones were more powerful then today&#39;s digital phones. Save on battery life too that way.</p>

<p>So you could try your phone today at 5,000 feet, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is at all analogous with the phones at the time.</p>

<p>&quot;We got the call about 9:58 this morning from a male passenger stating that he was locked in the bathroom of United Flight 93 traveling from Newark to San Francisco, and they were being hijacked,&quot; said Glenn Cramer, a 911 supervisor.
&quot;We confirmed that with him several times and we asked him to repeat what he said. He was very distraught. He said he believed the plane was going down. He did hear some sort of an explosion and saw white smoke coming from the plane, but he didn&#39;t know where.
&quot;And then we lost contact with him.&quot;</p>

<p>The entire collapse took over 13 seconds from the time the penthouse collapsed, which was the visual indication of a significant portion of the interior of the building coming down.</p>

<p>Of the facade...for 2.25 seconds...the top 18 stories collapsed in 5.4 seconds (free fall speed for 2.25), if the entire structure fell at free fall speed it those 18 stories would have come down 1.5 seconds faster.</p>

<p>Leaving the science behind for a second and switching to something strictly logic related.  How is it that the FDNY knew WTC7 was coming down 2 hours before it did?</p>

<p>No one was closer to WTC7 than they were.  They assessed the damage from inside and outside that building and concluded it was coming down.  There are statements from dozens of firefighters indicating that they all knew the building was near collapse.  Hell, they could see defects on the outside of the building (leaning, bulging, etc.).</p>

<p>As I said, kindly direct me to the peer reviewed simulation for controlled demolition, I&#39;m DYING to see it.</p>

<p>So, no explanation for the FDNY calling the collapse 2 hours ahead of time?</p>

<p>I watched the section of the video specifically dealing with that one detail because I was curious how they addressed it.</p>

<p>The maker of the video actually <em>accuses</em> the FDNY and NYPD of having been alerted to the controlled demolition ahead of time.  </p>

<p>Interesting that the FDNY and NYPD were OK participating in the conspiracy and coverup considering it killed hundreds of their buddies, don&#39;t you think?  Isn&#39;t that very notion completely idiotic?</p>

<p>The video also gives a master class in quote mining, selecting a few choice statements from FDNY officers and deceptively framing them in a certain way while ignoring <em>massive</em> reams of testimony from the FDNY indicating that the building was about to <em>collapse</em>, not be demolished.</p>

<p>NIST worked with Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers (SEI/ASCE); the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE); the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA); the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC); the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH); and the Structural Engineers Association of New York (SEAoNY) in putting that demo together.

<p>Here is an article from an architecture magazine describing how the loss of column 79 triggered the collapse, and it uses stills from the very video you guys constantly link to:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidently, that NIST report is easy to attack. Could it be <em>because</em> it is not very solid?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the NIST didn&#39;t even try to explain the collapse <em>per se</em>. It&#39;s telling us tall tales involving pancakes and that&#39;s the end of it. It start with the impact of the aircraft and stop at the moment of initiation of the collapse. You know it yourself. It&#39;s an hypothesis. It&#39;s not definitive. The statement: &quot;The NIST explanation makes the most sense and is the most plausible in concert with all the other available information.&quot; is an admission that it did not, and that you do not, have all the informations required to go beyond doubt and hypothesis and guess work and computer generated animations. You <em>decided to believe</em> it correct.</p>

<p>I know shredding doubt on and attempting to disprove an hypothesis by no means require presenting a better one. Not ever. Merely dismissing a model is good science in itself since by knowing what it <em>isn&#39;t</em>, we can narrow the realm of what <em>is</em> possible.</p>

<p>Because NIST is incomplete and possibly inaccurate, PLEASE, stop citing it as authoritative work. It&#39;s not helping anyone.</p>

<p>The point of this video is to present evidence and arguments to further our understanding of the events. To point fingers to the holes you get to know better. I am concerned much of this thread displays a concerned effort at stifling discussion. The blaring questions submitted by the video are glossed over in favour of parroting false answers to the same arguments that are in question in the first place. </p>

<p>This is not a correct way of argumenting.

<p>Absolutely not. But I do believe that they were passive participants, that what they were doing was just following orders. Such as &quot;tell your men to fall back, the building is going to blow&quot; and &quot;evacuate the area because the building is going to fall&quot;. They didn&#39;t have to know about any demolition, they only had to follow orders and make sure others were safe.</p>

<p>There are exactly 2 explanations for the WTC7 evacuation order.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The chiefs who ordered the evacuation were in on the controlled demolition and subsequent coverup, despite the plot killing 342 FDNY officers.</p></li>
<li><p>The chiefs who ordered the evacuation did so because they assessed the building was a significant collapse risk.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first version is a fucking farce.</p>

<p>The second version is backed up by reams of statements from FDNY officers who were <em>on the scene</em>, who <em>walked inside WTC7</em>, who <em>saw the visual defects in the building</em>, and who <em>heard the building creaking as it burned</em>, all of these indicating it was a significant risk of collapse.</p>

<p>I posted a video clip of an officer <em>on the scene that day</em> pointing out the building being structurally unsound and almost a certainty to collapse.  You thus far have no rebuttal for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a complete waste of time and I already told you that these are covered in the video.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The video insinuates that either the firemen were in on it, or they were simply acting under orders.  The video clip I posted shatters that explanation.  It&#39;s a fireman <em>on the scene</em> pointing out to bystanders that the building is structurally unsound, that it is <em>going to collapse</em>, and that there is no way for them to stop it.</p>

You have 0 evidence that proves any of what NIST claims, any evidence that proves that the airplanes that hit/crashed are the ones that we were told, you have nothing. Not even the FDR has the S/N that would tells us to which airplane it belonged to.</p>

<p>All you have is a pile of debris with no names on it, that is not evidence, that is anything you want it to be.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not even talking about how 14 of the 19 terrorists were actually from saudi arabia, osama even said he had nothing to do with it, yet the USA waged war with... yes, that&#39;s right, not saudi arabia. Sack of lies, disgusting and pathetic.</p>

<p>But I am amazed at you even though we are in the 4th year after the events of Sept 11th. Bush is still engaged in distortion, deception and hiding from you the real causes. And thus the reasons are still there for a repeat of what occurred. So I shall talk to you about the story behind those events and I shall tell you truthfully about the moments in which the decision was taken for you to consider. I say to you Allah knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the towers, but after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon it came to my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because prior to the new rules put in  place because of 9/11. Us air traffic controllers had hoops to jump through before we could declare that there was in fact a hijacking.</p>

<p>IIRC the rules and steps correctly.</p>

<p>1- ask point blank verify you are being hijacked.</p>

<p>2 - ask the aircraft to squawk 7500.</p>

<p>3 - verify you are intentionally squawking 7500.</p>

<p>4 - tell supervisor</p>

<p>5 - supervisor calls facility manager.</p>

<p>6 - facilty manager calls regional ops center</p>

<p>7 -ROC calls FAA HQ</p>

<p>8 - FAA leadership coordinates with military liason.</p>

<p>9 - liason makes calls to his higher ups.</p>

<p>10 - begin the trickle down of orders.</p>

<p>The whole process takes quite a while.</p>

<p>Now its &quot;fights on, fights on&quot; immediately, no verify this verify that crap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. They thought they had time. On 9/10/01 the way everyone was taught hijackings were usually from a lone person. If it was a group it was usually to fly the plane somewhere and have a hostage situation.</p>

<p>US airspace doesn&#39;t have a lot of hijacking. If you look at the history you&#39;ll notice about one every 10 years. That is just something that didn&#39;t happen here. Let alone do something on the scale of 9/11. We were complicit. Unprepared. </p>

<p>Controllers are people too. If I were working that day, and a single plane crashed into the towers. That would be a hell of a day. A day no one would forget. I would be trying to figure out what happened. I might not notice 175 coming into the sector right away because the unthinkable has just occurred. Then boom. 2nd plane. HOLY HELL. I wish I could explain to people to young to remember how unthinkable it was. I can only say that it was.</p>

<p>It is old hat to us.</p>

<p>But then, 4 planes? In one day? That is something in a work of fiction and if you pitched to movie execs they would be like, &quot;Too unrealistic&quot;. </p>

<p>Even after the 2nd plane hit. It was like far away. That is something happening in NY. A localized event.</p>

<p>That is why when the pentagon got hit, literally everyone was like, oh crap, it isn&#39;t just NY. That is really when all hell broke loose across the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even as someone who wasn&#39;t paid to be on top of these types of things I was thinking to myself after the second tower that more was to come. There was a lot of time between then and the final crash. These people may not have been thinking ahead but at that point I have to call them idiots. Hell as soon as I heard about the towers I knew who did it. I remember turning and stating Osama was behind it as soon as we got the news. Now I am not sure what happened but at that time my direct logic pointed to him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DC has more radar monitoring then any other city on the planet.  DC has a local Air Force base.  DC is protected by surface to air missiles and other anti air.  So why, an hour after NORAD was put on alert and a half hour after the second tower was hit, did they not have enough time to down 77?  Can you prove the military is not ALWAYS ready for attack and at standby?  Because I&#39;m pretty positive they are constantly flying around the borders, 24/7, with attack planes at the ready.  It is the exact reason the military exists.  Do you honestly think all the planes are tucked away and only taken out for special occasion?  Prove the airforce is not capable of having planes in the air, especially in the most protected portion of the US, in less then 5 minutes, let alone over one hour.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, DC is the most restrictive airspace in the world.  They clearly knew about 77 heading to DC for at least 20 mintutes ahead of impact and they knew we were under attack the second that the second tower got it.  I remember that day, and when tower 2 got hit, that is when everyone knew.  Not when the Pentagon got hit....  There are literally thousands of anti air batteries and missile posts protecting our nation&#39;s capitol.  Why wouldn&#39;t they shoot the plane down?  This wasn&#39;t the first plane, so there should have been no confusion as to 77&#39;s intent.  There are plenty of good reasons why you&#39;d want to allow a plane to take out the part of the Pentagon that housed those investigating the disappearance of 2.4 trillion dollars, but that&#39;s not proven fact and just my opinion.  I admit that.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like you to explain the particular flying maneuvers of flight 77.  I am not a pilot, but it does seem highly unlikely someone off the street could pull it off.  I&#39;d have doubts most human pilots could.  It does seemly oddly familiar with something you&#39;d expect someone remote flying could do though, since they are not dealing with the g forces.  </p>

People have asked you to discuss the videos, but you respond with hostility (I&#39;m attacking you? Please.....) and refuse to debate.  This makes me think that your videos do not have the &quot;irrefutable proof&quot; you claim they do, because if your video contained &quot;irrefutable proof&quot;, I&#39;m sure it would be easy to counterpoint, rather than just shouting &quot;Conjecture&quot; or watch the videos.<br/>

<p>That is where the problem lies. You overestimate the strength of the materials involved. You don&#39;t understand how something can be strong enough to stand, but weak enough to collapse. Your mind can&#39;t picture that because it is so unlike the everyday world you live in. </p>

<p>When a building is standing up, the beams act like your spine, and they stack on each other.  But when you slouch, you get back problems. The heat alone may not have been enough to drop the tower. The torque, by itself, probably wouldn&#39;t bring it down. But when you bend that and then soften the metal with a heat that intense, you&#39;re holding up tons of concrete with marshmallow </p>

<p>There&#39;s a list of buildings which have collapsed due to fire here: <a href="http://www.haifire.com/resources/presentations/Historical_Collapse_Survey.pdf">Historical Survey of Multi-Story Building Collapses Due to Fire</a>.
Scanning this document, to include only building which are made of steel (and not e.g. reinforced concrete), shows only two:</p>

<p><strong>Alexis Nihon Plaza Montreal, Canada</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Steel frame with composite steel beam and 
deck floors; fire resistive without sprinklers </li>
<li>15 floors, Office</li>
<li>Oct. 26, 1986, after 5 hour fire, which then 
continued for 13 hours </li>
<li>Partial 11th floor collapse </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>One New York Plaza New York, NY, 
USA</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Steel framing with reinforced concrete core,
fire resistive with no sprinklers. </li>
<li>50 floors, Office</li>
<li>August 5, 1970 </li>
<li>Connection bolts sheared during 
fire, causing several steel filler 
beams on the 33-34th
floors to fall 
and rest on the bottom flanges of 
their supporting girders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Can fire destroy steel?</h2>

<p>Photographs of structural steel deformed by fire are shown on page 3 of <a href="http://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/project/research/structures/strucfire/DataBase/References/Reinstatement_Fire_Damaged_Steel.pdf">The Reinstatement of Fire Damaged Steel and Iron Framed Structures</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.steelconstruction.info/Fire_damage_assessment_of_hot_rolled_structural_steelwork">Steel loses strength when it&#39;s heated</a>, and <a href="http://www.steelconstruction.info/Design_using_structural_fire_standards#Effect_of_load">eventually fails</a>, which is why it <a href="http://www.steelconstruction.info/Fire_protecting_structural_steelwork">needs protection</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.steelconstruction.info/Fire_testing#Other_standard_fire_tests">Fuel-based fires get hot unusually quickly</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.steelconstruction.info/Fire_testing#Limitations_of_the_standard_fire_test">Normal/natural fires usually spread slowly, and are limited by available ventilation</a>.</p>

<h1>What about the WTC specifically?</h1>

<p>There are two explanations of how/why fire caused the WTC collapse here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0112/eagar/eagar-0112.html">Why Did the World Trade Center Collapse? Science, Engineering, and Speculation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0711/banovic-0711.html">The Role of Metallurgy in the NIST Investigation 
of the World Trade Center Towers Collapse</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The latter reference contains an explanation for the collapse (in the side-bar, on the right):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, in the absence of structural and insulation damage, a conventional fire substantially similar to or less intense than the fires encountered on September 11, 2001 likely would not have led to the collapse of a WTC tower. Second, the towers likely would not have collapsed under the combined effects of aircraft impact and the subsequent multi-floor fires encountered on September 11, 2001 if the insulation had not been widely dislodged or had been only minimally dislodged by aircraft impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also says that they found no other causes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the investigation team neither found nor invoked any extraordinary events, beyond the terrorist attack that damaged the structure and removed the insulation, that led to the collapse of the towers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above (aircraft impact dislodging insulation) doesn&#39;t explain the collapse of Building 7. The <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/1376/2703">analysis of the Building 7 collapse</a> states that the failure of this building was more caused thermal expansion (steel changing size and shape): its fire-insulation wasn&#39;t affected by an airplane crash, but it failed in the 300°C-450°C temperature range, before it got hot enough (e.g. 650°C) for the steel to lose significant strength:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the WTC 7 collapse, the loss of steel strength or stiffness was not as important as the thermal expansion of steel structures caused by heat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are various ways in which the WTC buildings and the WTC fire were famously unusual or unique.</p>

<p>The authorities <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_collapse#Model_code_changes">learn from disasters and update the building codes and fire codes accordingly</a>: perhaps that&#39;s another explanation for why we may not see an event quite this like one again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if it&#39;s such an unbelievable circumstance, why hasn&#39;t the NIST report been peer reviewed?  Because it cannot stand the scrutiny.  Therefore, there is no scientific backing for the collapse of building 7.  None.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize it&#39;s not a common practice for that type of report to be peer reviewed right? The group itself investigates situations  they don&#39;t need another group to investigate groups that investigate the government. </p>

<p>But the main issue here is you&#39;ll be able to find a million things you read on infowars or some other stupid site (that aren&#39;t peer reviewed) and it&#39;ll take a long time to debunk  if I am able to you&#39;ll just have another thing but it won&#39;t stop you from believing the first thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the &quot;Clean Break&quot; report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by Richard Perle for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel&#39;s security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on &quot;Western values&quot;. <strong>It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. established in 1997 as a non-profit educational organization founded by William Kristol and Robert Kagan. The PNAC&#39;s stated goal is &quot;to promote American global leadership.&quot;Fundamental to the PNAC were the view that &quot;American leadership is both good for America and good for the world&quot; and support for &quot;a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity.&quot; <strong>With its members in numerous key administrative positions, the PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration&#39;s development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;New Pearl Harbor&quot;</p>

<p>Section V of Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses, entitled &quot;Creating Tomorrow&#39;s Dominant Force&quot;, includes the sentence: &quot;<strong>Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry though, although these are words and plans written by these people years before 9/11 and the Iraq war, which then got elected and then carried out the plans, it was made up by some conspiracy theorists on the internet and you&#39;re all crazy. /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realistically, yes. If you have the money, and obviously they do. you buy the same type of round to practice with that you would carry everyday.</p>

<p>While my weapon may cycle perfectly, not a single issue ever with full metal jacketed practice rounds, and then I load up some hollow points for defense and hit the streets, all of a sudden, I need to use my weapon, first round fires, second round jams, I clear it and again, jam.</p>

<p>Now assuming I live I find out that my weapon does not reliably cycle with the defensive rounds I have chosen.</p>

<p>This is just one reason, another would be knowing what to expect with your weapon and its rounds.</p>

<p>Yes of course, but not knowing how your primary round will perform in your weapon is foolish.</p>

<p>I lean to the &quot;getting ready to slay humans&quot; idea.</p>

<p>This is called bias.</p>

<p>That is because teaching requires skills, training, and intelligence.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Being a canuck I can forgive you for thinking the only reason for a hollow point is to kill people, a FMJ round will kill just as well, but may over penetrate where as a hollow point round has less chance of over penetration and much less chances if a shot is missed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off. You just said &quot;The report&quot; and people are upvoting you. What report?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s break down your quote for argument&#39;s sake:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A single U.S.-based institutional investor <strong>with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda</strong> purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;No conceivable ties&quot; sounds like a big claim to make about a world as big as ours where everything is conceivable. Also, why would the investor not having ties to al Qaeda make him suddenly innocent? </p>

<p><strong>Insider trading does not need to have any correlation with a gang of rebels in the Middle East to be a crime.</strong> Someone with pre-knowledge about the 9/11 attacks could have no connection whatsoever to al Qaeda, so I don&#39;t see what that is supposed to prove.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was <strong>traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9,</strong> which recommended these trades.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, how does this prove innocence? Who runs that &quot;specific US--based newsletter? And more importantly:</p>

<p><strong>Why did it run 2 days before the attacks recommending trades that perfectly correlated to the attacks?</strong></p>

<p>I really have no idea why you were upvoted beyond the fact that this post has surely reached beyond this subreddit and people are upvoting anything that allows them to continue feeling safe and secure in their ignorance.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> So the report he was referring to was the 9/11 Commission report. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_9/11_Commission">Here are some interesting counterpoints to the validity of that report.</a> Because a lot of people reference it to back-up claims that nothing about 9/11 was out of the ordinary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the 9/11 commission was 100% incorrect about everything? What happened to finding the truth? Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Attack the claim based on it&#39;s inaccuracy, not on who published it.</p>

<p>Or do you not believe inconsistencies should be investigated unless the outcome is consistent with what you expected? </p>

<p>I do not see this specific issue being listed on the wiki page you provided, nor have I seen anything that brings the put option investigation findings in question. Which by the way was conducted through collaboration with many individuals across many agencies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to reassess my opinion if you have something that can refute those specific findings. Pointing at the 9/11 commission isn&#39;t enough to dissuade a skeptic and you have to know that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s based on a flawed premise. If you had foreknowledge of the attack, you&#39;d be a complete idiot to carry out a blatantly obvious trade like the one described: sticks out like a sore thumb, and would be immediately and obviously subject to regulatory scrutiny. It&#39;d be like burning your house down after taking out an extra-large insurance policy. Anyone with half a brain can come up any number of better ways to take advantage of the situation. </p>

<p>Additionally, there are billions of trades made every day, and thousands of stock recommendations. This kind of thing inevitably happens, just like winning the Powerball. Just a couple of weeks ago, elsewhere on Reddit was a recommendation to bet on the first score at the Super Bowl being a safety. It happened. Doesn&#39;t mean the poster had any inside knowledge at all. </p>

<p>In the apparent complete absence of any supporting evidence to back the &quot;inside knowledge&quot; claim here, and the fact that the action <em>makes no sense</em>, the coincidence described in the report [sorry: I mean, the &quot;Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States&quot;...] simply makes the most sense. </p>

Life has way too many intricasies to make such assumptions. History has proven time and time again that people are not predictable.

    <div class="md"><p>The Silverstein Group bought the lease on the WTC site for $3.2 billion.  They then recovered $4.6 billion total from the insurance policies on all the buildings.  That net difference of $1.4 billion represented a windfall of sorts, but only if you imagine there were no costs to clearing the rubble and redeveloping the site (and having no rental income while those two processes dragged on).  Moreover, in 2006, $2.5 billion of that insurance recovery was paid out to the PA for redevelopment purposes.  So, even without all the aforementioned costs, it&#39;s hard to see how the Silverstein group came out ahead.</p>

<p>Given how long and expensive the redevelopment of the WTC has been, it&#39;s actually quite hard to imagine Silverstein Group will ever come out ahead during Larry Silverstein&#39;s lifetime.  Their only hope is in additional recovery from the airlines, but that case has been in limbo for over five years (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-18/wtc-damages-ruling-nears-in-silverstein-airlines-case.html)">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-18/wtc-damages-ruling-nears-in-silverstein-airlines-case.html)</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lease is a purchase of use of property.  You don&#39;t pay the purchase at once--the payment is structured over time--but you are still contracting to pay for the use the property.  This is a fundamental point of contract law and a simple economic reality, so I&#39;m straining to see why you think it is in contentious.</p>

<p>EDIT: Since your edit including the bolded text doesn&#39;t seem to get the point, I&#39;ll put it this way.</p>

<p>On September 10, 2001 what did Silverstein Group have in terms of assets &amp; liabilities re the WTC site?</p>

<p>--It had an asset of the future income flow of the property for the duration of the lease and a liability for the cost of the lease over that time.</p>

<p>On September 12, 2011 how did those assets and liabilities change?</p>

<p>--Its asset was gone, it still had the liability for the lease, it had a new liability to the extent it had to pay for redeveloping the site.</p>

<p>The insurance payout was a new asset.  But was it greater than the value of the asset destroyed and the redevelopment liability? It&#39;s not at all clear.  Silverstein Group lost rental income on several of the largest office buildings in one of the most in-demand locations in the world for over 12 years.  That is a huge loss by itself.  On top of that loss of revenue, it had a massive new liability: the cost of redeveloping the sites.  The question isn&#39;t whether the insurance payout was greater than the purchase price of the lease; the question is whether it was greater than the hypothetical value of the WTC site&#39;s rental revenue + the value necessary to redevelop the WTC after the attacks.  That is very doubtful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you watched the documentary you would be able to answer your own Q. All buildings under the WTC title, were not assets. They had a $15 BILLION asbestos abatement liability. </p>

<p>That is why the NY Port Authority could not sell them to Mr. Silverstein. When a 70 year old jew gets a 99 year lease (250+ acre feet of prime land...Bldg One 110 acres, Bldg Two 110 Acres, Building Seven 47 acres + all the parking) for $10 million per month, then signs insurance papers that pay a $3.2 Billion double indemnity in case of total destruction due to a terrorist act...you know that the building was marked for a target.</p>

<p>Mr. Silverstein wasn&#39;t going to live to be 169 years old and he knew none of his partners were going to survive after the 10 AM board meeting breakfast on floor 107 ( Windows on the World restaurant ).</p>

<p>He made sure everyone of his investors/partners showed up, then cancelled and was a no show...and his daughter who worked in WTC Bldg 7 was also a no show that day.</p>

<p>Since NY Port Authority owned the building and Larry owned the dbl indemnification terrorist policy but only leased the WTC brand, he was paid the full benefit of $6.4 Billion and tried to fight for double that amount claiming each incident was an independent terrorist act (IE: $6.4 Billion per building). </p>

<p>Silverstein was paid the money and had nothing to do with the NY Port Authority. The Port Authority owned the 16 acre footprint, the asbestos, clean up debt, and the rubble pile...which they immediately sold to China...while it was still smoldering.</p>

<p>Then why don&#39;t people say &quot;While I disagree with your conclusions, I too feel as though there should be more investigations into what DID happen on that day since we&#39;re obviously being fed SOME amount of horseshit?&quot;</p>

<p>Why do the skeptics only focus on destroying the stories of the conspiracy theorists instead of helping to destroy the story of the government? It&#39;s not like the conspiracy theorists are the ones with the guns killing foreigners and sending citizens off to their deaths.</p>

<p>I have no ironed-out stance on the issue either and sit in the &quot;Don&#39;t know but there&#39;s definitely some fishy shit in there&quot; camp so I find the &quot;irrefutable proof&quot; statements to be improper as well.

<p>So as long as you&#39;re also of the opinion of &quot;Get the government out of my ass&quot; go ahead and fire away at conspiracy theorists claiming to have irrefutable proof when all they really have are inconsistencies in the narrative and not a true narrative to replace the old one with.

<p>It just seems like a decent proportion of skeptics take up the &quot;defending the status quo&quot; side of the argument instead of calling bullshit on both sides of the narratives being fed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I keep making this point to no avail, but I&#39;ll give it another shot. Pointing out unexplained phenomena, or refuting evidence for a given theory, is not evidence of an alternative theory. </p>

<p>There is not one single point in all the clips above that provides evidence of an inside job. Not one. To change people&#39;s minds this movement requires a clear and concise alternate explanation for the events, and then evidence supporting that explanation that outweighs the evidence for the current consensus view. </p>

<p>Currently all that is presented is holes in the consensus view. Ignoring for a moment the fact that most of these &quot;holes&quot; aren&#39;t really problems at all, let&#39;s assume for the sake of argument that there are things that happened on 9/11 which are truly unexplained. That fact would in no way support the notion that there was an inside job (or any other alternative explanation for that matter). </p>

</blockquote>

<p>So what? Your line of reasoning is garbage.  We don&#39;t need evidence for any &#39;alternative theory&#39;. No alternate explanation is necessary or even desirable at this point. You can prove that x!=5 without saying what it&#39;s value actually is. You can also prove &#39;the government is lying&#39; without knowing what the truth is. You can&#39;t deal with step 1 so you want us to skip to step 2! Sorry, but the reason that you are getting nowhere is that your opponents are smarter than you and are avoiding the little trap you are setting.</p>

<p>Whether you know it or not what you are really doing by attempting to &#39;make this point&#39; is get your opponent to waste their efforts. You&#39;d send them out looking for ways to discredit themselves by connecting dots at random. It&#39;s either a decent ploy to defuse a thread, or a desperate attempt to preserve your own denial. Either way, no thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, this is exactly the problem. What are you saying? What is the assertion? I can&#39;t even begin to assess whether I believe what is being said until something clear and consistent is actually being said. Does the government lie? Absolutely, but that isn&#39;t evidence they are lying now. Could the government be lying? Sure, but that isn&#39;t evidence that they were involved in the attack. </p>

<p>What is your position? Whether you like it or not, this is absolutely a necessary step in making an argument about ANYTHING. If producing an alternative theory would be a &quot;waste (of) their efforts&quot;, this is because there is insufficient evidence to support their belief. Come back when you DO have sufficient evidence. </p>

<p>This is how making an argument works. If it is garbage to you, than your position is rife with logical fallacy. What I am requesting is very simple. Something happened on 9/11. If you do not accept the consensus explanation for what happened, than how do you explain it? Simply state what you think happened. It is impossible to assess the validity of a claim that has not been made (and you know this full well, which is exactly why you are so resistant to making a concise claim). You would prefer to dance around in a logical no-mans land that allows you to poke holes without making assertions. To the extent that you do this, you will be ignored. </p>

<p>Posters are always asking on this sub, &quot;how could anyone still disagree with us at this point?&quot; I have just explained how. It is not merely that you have provided insufficient evidence. It&#39;s that you haven&#39;t even proposed a hypothesis that could be proven or falsified. Your just playing word games with fragments of data to imply things but not state them. </p>

<p>You ask me to provide published articles to prove that dissent exists off record? Your request is ludicrous and my refusal to engage you on your biased arbitrary terms should also be predictable.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, my misunderstanding, you said off the record opinions. So let me get this straight. Your position has degenerated to the point where you are hypothesizing that a majority of scientists silently agree with you, but are either to afraid to publish or no magazine will do it. Aside from the fact that there would be no way falsify this, do you not see how absurd you are being? How weak this position is if you have gotten to this point? </p>

<p>Just to make sure I have this right; you&#39;re saying that first there were hundreds, if not thousands, of government officials who were necessary to commit the conspiracy in the first place (a position without a single piece of hard evidence directly connecting a single person to any single action that incriminates them, even after 13 years). But not only that, the dozens and dozens of scientists behind the NIST report are in on it to (without a single piece of evidence to back that up). But not only THAT, the entirety of the scientific establishment must be in on it because they are unwilling to publish the work of the MAJORITY of scientists who secretly agree with you (all without a single bit of evidence). Do I have that right? </p>

<p>So now we&#39;re talking about tens of thousands of government employees and private scientists who would have to be in on the conspiracy, and than millions of scientists who know the &quot;truth&quot; but are unwilling to write about it publicly. Without any evidence to prove these libellous claims whatsoever. Is that right? </p>

<p>And it&#39;s me who is displaying cognitive dissonance? Do you know what the words you are using mean? Are you perhaps mentally ill in some way that I was unaware of? You&#39;re about one mental step away from standing on the side of the road in rags with a megaphone screaming about the planet nibiru, while people try desperately to avoid eye contact with you, and toss you spare change. </p>

You say I must be delusional to imagine this scenario, but I haven&#39;t imagined anything. I am simply reporting to you the relatively small sample that I have been able to collect personally, and so far the data indicates that your assumptions are incorrect. Scientific consensus does not exist in support of the official story. You are the madman in this situation, are you not currently raving false delusions? From the evidence I&#39;ve seen it would appear that you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is actually your position which contains false assertions of academic rigor and scientific consensus, not mine! The only claim I&#39;ve really made is that the absence of alternative theories and academic papers shouldn&#39;t be interpreted as proof of scientific consensus to the contrary.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it simply does. The documentary <em>proves</em> the narrative is false. Considering this, it&#39;s safe to assume govt/military agents had at least foreknowledge of the attack or allowed it to happen or planned it themselves. You obviously have not seen the documentary.

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen the documentary, its a fucking joke to anyone who has any background in research or science. But regardless, my point still stands, and it&#39;s highlighted nicely in the little linguistic sidestep you just did by saying &quot;safe to assume&quot;. That is not a conclusion based on evidence. The consensus explanation could absolutely be false. That DOES NOT constitute evidence that the government perpetrated the attack. LET ME REPEAT SO YOU GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD: The falsehood of the consensus view DOES NOT constitute evidence that the government perpetrated the attack. Period, end of discussion. Come to me when you DO have such evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to take a jab at you, but how was it a joke if you have a background in research and science? It cites its references, shows why they came to each conclusion throughout the video, uses interviews from people architects and engineers, and they clearly spent a ton of time researching this. You make a good point before when you said this is not direct evidence that the government was the perpetrator, but the video pretty handily shows a ton of reasons why they are the most likely culprit. No this wouldn&#39;t hold up in court as it stands now, but I think the point its trying to make is that another investigation should be made into what happened, not just blindly start arresting politicians. This is the only video on the subject that I felt wasn&#39;t just wild speculation and full of out of context information like most conspiracy videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, here&#39;s what I find frustrating. It is impossible to have a productive conversation on this topic unless the theorist is willing/able to clearly outline what they are professing. But whenever I ask most theorists to do this, they squirm out of it. </p>

<p>So in the interest of being generous, let me say this. If someone is genuinely only saying that there are some inconsistencies, and that there should be another investigation, fine. That&#39;s at least a reasonable position. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary at this point, there have been multiple investigations now that have addressed the bulk of the issues in a satisfactory way to me, but hey, I can understand that. </p>

<p>If a theorists is submitting anything further than that, they really have no grounds for doing so at all. This video provides not a single piece of direct evidence to warrant claiming anything further. In fact, most of it is literally posing questions ominously and then implying an answer which is anything but a necessary conclusion. It&#39;s completely unscientific. Citing news reports on the day of the event are completely irrelevant. Scattered and cherry picked eye witness testimony is irrelevant, no matter what it means in court of law, eye witness testimony is the LOWEST form of evidence in the court of science. Then a bunch if it is just straight made up, or hypothesized from thin air. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s the problem. Most truthers imply or outright say the bigger assertions constantly. They claim that it&#39;s &quot;obvious&quot; the government was involved or whatever. But than if I press them for evidence, they retract back to the &quot;we&#39;re just asking questions, etc.&quot; position. Until they get worked up again and then they&#39;ll outright claim that Cheney is the one who pushed down the plunger on the towers destruction, or whatever claim they want. It&#39;s a mental game that they&#39;re playing on themselves. </p>

<p>No theory explains every possible detail. The theorists compile the little inconsistencies (which literally every theory ever has), and than concoct a half-baked theory with the pieces, without noticing the new half-theory is WAY less plausible than the original one. </p>

<p>If the &quot;official&quot; story has some holes in it. The inside job story has gaping voids in it from start to finish. Inconsistencies in the official story aren&#39;t evidence for an alternative theory, and the official story explains the vast majority of the issues perfectly well. </p>

<p>Lastly, most of the issues this video brings up have already been addressed and explained satisfactorily elsewhere, and those explanations are simply being ignored. The rest of the issues brought up simply aren&#39;t issues at all, they&#39;re just logical fallacies or historical inaccuracies. I mean, Christ, it&#39;s equating 9/11 to Pearl Harbour as though Pearl Harbour was an obvious conspiracy as well, when that isn&#39;t even a reasonable historical position, let alone an obvious one. It&#39;s just a pile of half-truths, lies/inaccuracies, and logical fallacies. I&#39;m not saying it didn&#39;t take a lot of time and effort to produce, and I think the producers truly believe what they&#39;re saying, but that doesn&#39;t make any of it valid. </p>

<p>Edit: Also, citing references doesn&#39;t help when the references cited are bogus. Or more often, when the fact cited doesn&#39;t necessitate the conclusion drawn. This is the most common issue, not that the facts themselves are wrong, but that the theorists think those facts mean something they don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Edit 2: As an illustration of the above edit, what many of this videos points amount to is for them to show something that happened on 9/11 and than basically just go &quot;look at that, that&#39;s pretty weird isn&#39;t it...&quot; And the majority of the time the answer to that is &quot;...no, actually, it&#39;s not weird. It&#39;s only weird because you don&#39;t know how that thing works.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>first off just wanna say I&#39;d rather not be called a &quot;truther&quot;, I know its typical to have people accuse skeptics as &quot;sheeple&quot; but I don&#39;t play like that because I think both make me cringe, so don&#39;t just start labeling cause it instantly belittles anything I write. Also if you look at my post history the only conspiracy theory I can be accused of is believing the Jets will be good next year (I really do but I&#39;ve believed that before...). I do agree that anytime I see a video online that&#39;s titled <em>Wake up</em> or <em>7 reasons why it was an inside job!</em> ,like a goddam buzzfeed article, it usually starts with some scary music followed by half-truths and misrepresentations. I believe any conspiracy theory is plagued with people like this and it gives anyone else who agrees with any part of the theory the &quot;tin foil hat&quot; label. I&#39;m a 23 year old guy, graduate of a respected university (Quinnipiac), held down many jobs ranging from cooking to an internship with  Merrill Lynch (I&#39;m not just saying this shit to be cocky I&#39;m trying to nail home a point), but as soon as I start thinking that Osama didn&#39;t actually plan 9/11 I&#39;m suddenly some paranoid mental patient whos opinion should be ignored. I&#39;m not saying you do this, but while we are airing our problems I thought I would contribute. </p>

<p>Now to the point of all this, I get what you are saying in general but this video does very little of what you are complaining about. His citations aren&#39;t <em>ConspiraciesTotallyHappen.com</em> they are articles from news sites like NBC or CNN, when getting technical he has interviews of people who would be considered qualified in the field that they are speaking of and many I would say are experts. I&#39;m sure there might be some citations that are less than reputable but that is probably cause this video is 6 straight hours of him fact checking and calling bullshit, its not a teenager making a 5 minute youtube video completely backed by only their opinion. For the cellphone part actually had a video of the guy proving that cellphones couldn&#39;t work anywhere near cruising altitude <em>while</em> being filmed, not just random speculation like a lot of videos do. He cites books on physics, engineering and other peer reviewed/proven/well respected sources for most of the video. There&#39;s a reason that people are saying you didn&#39;t see the video, because your saying things that literally don&#39;t fit with this guys video at all. </p>

<p>I understand there are plenty of conspiracy theories that aren&#39;t true, and I&#39;m not just talking about the ones about lizard people. But people on the other side should understand there are more proven conspiracy theories than you probably think. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061026155231/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proven_conspiracies">http://web.archive.org/web/20061026155231/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proven_conspiracies</a>  In the end both sides just want the truth, so instead of just getting angry people should try actually working with each other to get a more clear picture. To start you should say specifically what sources you don&#39;t like, what the video got wrong or exaggerated, why what your saying is a better perspective (cause right now that video has much better sources). I can&#39;t just defend the video in whole when I don&#39;t know what actual problem you had with it when you just say its lying and half true.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you just ignored everything I said and than pointed back to the things that the video does that don&#39;t matter. It&#39;s not that I haven&#39;t seen the video, it&#39;s that we clearly have different definitions of what constitutes evidence. </p>

<p>We&#39;re already going down the line of my very first point. So let me stop for a moment, and just ask you, what are YOU saying. What is the assertion. What happened on 9/11. If the planes weren&#39;t flown by terrorists, who flew them. What is the explanation that you are lending creedance to. You are the one making the claim here. You are the one saying the consensus explanation is wrong. Well, what is the explanation then? </p>

<p>I truly mean this sincerely. I can&#39;t even begin to address the topic until I know what you are claiming. I&#39;m done with this game of punching a shadows because people won&#39;t say what they mean. Make your claim, or nothing can move forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the only points where you said anything specific is about eye witness accounts aren&#39;t credible which is I&#39;m assuming talking about the eye witness accounts of people hearing and experiencing explosions and the part about Pearl Harbor (which I agree with, I don&#39;t pretend to know anything about what the conspiracy part is about that, I&#39;m not usually on the conspiracy side of arguments except a few). My point was that you had a problem with the video, if I&#39;m wrong correct me, because it doesn&#39;t provide any evidence, which in my opinion it has plenty of examples and sources that would be considered evidence. I would consider the sources behind debunking the &quot;official&quot; story of what happened on 9/11, I wasn&#39;t arguing that the evidence is proving who did it. I do believe it was the certain people in government but I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s anything more than my speculation (I&#39;m not an expert or someone who has the irrefutable evidence to convict someone so obviously that&#39;s just my opinion). I wasn&#39;t making a claim... please quote me from my above statements that says anywhere that I claim I know who did it. I was asking you what problem you had with the video (yes its narrative is leaning towards the government but it is mostly debunking the official report and asking for an investigation since there are clearly discrepancies, which is putting it lightly, in what they found). After rereading your right, you didn&#39;t call me a truther so I apologize. Your the one who claimed it was a joke if you had a background in research or science without backing this up, what part is unfounded in research or science? You are the only one claiming anything (except some the stuff I said that had nothing to do with 9/11, like my age and background and thinking that people should approach this subject with the same goal, a better understanding of what happened). </p>

<p>My point: what part of the video was stupid, throughout all these paragraphs you do not point out anything specific IN THE VIDEO, you just speak in generalities about other 9/11 conspiracy videos/theories. Just tell me a part and maybe I&#39;ll agree with you, its a theory with reasons that back it up, while all you&#39;ve said is that it&#39;s bullshit. Which it might but if you don&#39;t back it up why would I believe you? This isn&#39;t supposed to be bashing you, I&#39;m sure there are problems with this movie.  </p>

<p>This is totally disingenuous. If you make a ludicrous claim - for instance that you have an IQ of 300, I will argue that you are a liar (because there is no evidence of any human having an IQ of this level). There is no onus on me to prove what your IQ actually is - you are the one making the absurd claim.</p>

<p>The same thing goes with the official story of 9/11 - it is a ludicrous fiction, and those who pick it apart are not obliged to provide a rival explanation. We don&#39;t know for certain what happened on 9/11 - we just know that the official story is not credible, and in many cases not possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t. But it does mean that there is no more plausible explanation available. Inconsistencies in a theory do not &quot;disprove&quot; the theory. EVERY theory has inconsistencies. People can, and do, argue against the theory of evolution by doing exactly what this video does. Could the theory of evolution be incorrect? Sure. Why isn&#39;t it widely discounted in the face of these inconsistencies? Because it is by far the most plausible explanation for the phenomena being observed. </p>

<p>The question is which theory is more plausible. Which theory provides the most likely explanation. This is how theories work. This is how we move on from old theories and adopt new theories. You can call it disingenuous if you want, and kick and scream about how it&#39;s unfair, but this is how it works, in every occasion that a theory is dropped. </p>

<p>To the extent that the truther movement chooses to ignore this necessity, they will be ignored by the people who matter. Propose a concise and internally consistent theory of your own, or the existing theory remains the only plausible option. End of story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not talking about mere inconsistencies!</p>

<p>Taking your example of the &quot;planes being flown by terrorists&quot;, the likelihood that this is true has been demonstrated to be vanishingly unlikely, if not impossible. Not simply because there is no evidence to back up the assertion that these named individuals were even on the plane, but because those individuals were conspicuously incapable of flying even small cessna&#39;s, and because the aircraft were manoeuvred at such speeds (600mph) that they would have broken up before impact due to air resistance. </p>

<p>The official &quot;theory&quot; has been shown, time and again, to be work of fantasy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, so, just no. This has not been demonstrated at all. You have either been mislead, or you are being intentionally dishonest. This deals with all the bullshit about the pilots in depth: <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Flight_School_Dropouts">http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Flight_School_Dropouts</a></p>

<p>The second assertion is simply incoherent. The planes DIDN&#39;T break up before impact. That&#39;s all one needs to know to know that your statement doesn&#39;t even make sense. This assertion doesn&#39;t even have anything to do with who was flying the plane. This is exactly the sort of thing I&#39;m talking about. The statement that the planes &quot;were maneuvered at such speeds (600mph) that they would have broken up before impact due to air resistance&quot; implies a whole mess of necessary explanations that you aren&#39;t giving. </p>

<p>So, the most obvious point would be that...the planes didn&#39;t break up. So this statement is simply untrue. But say that your statement is true. Well what does that then require to also be true? What hit the buildings and the field? Where did the planes that were hijacked go, and the hundreds of people who are missing that were on them? How were those planes hidden from radar but these other UFO&#39;s, that travelled at speeds too high for planes, were picked up by radar and mistaken for the planes? How do we explain the fact that millions of people saw the planes crash into the towers, dozens saw the plane crash into the pentagon, etc? This is just off the top of my head. </p>

<p>When you &quot;poke a hole&quot; in the official story, you imply an alternative that then needs to be explored and have evidence to back it up if it is to be taken seriously. Truthers never take this into account. You seem somehow oblivious to what your own statements would have to mean. </p>

<p>Repeating that the consensus view has been shown to be a work of fantasy doesn&#39;t make it true, no matter how loudly or relentlessly you babble about it. </p>

<p>Edit: When you say it has been demonstrated as unlikely, you need to take into account the question &quot;unlikely compared to what?&quot; I agree that the entire fucking scenario was unlikely, that&#39;s why it&#39;s one of the most fascinating and amazing and impactful events in recent human history. That doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen. Stop saying it&#39;s unlikely without providing what would be a MORE likely explanation. Every proposal that counters the &quot;unlikely&quot; consensus account of events is WAY less likely itself! But you never seem bothered by that, because you aren&#39;t searching for the truth, you&#39;ve made up your mind that there is a shadowy elite controlling the world and holding us down. </p>

<p>Yet the (objectively determined) speed they were travelling would have made this AN INEVITABILITY if the planes were 767s (as per the official narrative). Therefore the planes were NOT 767s but some other type of aircraft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here we are presented with a choice. What is more likely? Is it more likely that the stat you have for the speed that would cause a 747 to break apart is incorrect, and that perhaps that is the guideline limit provided by the manufacturer for the sake of safety, but isn&#39;t the absolute physical limit (and suicidal terrorists aren&#39;t concerned with what&#39;s safe)? Or that all the other complicated things that would need to be explained that I mentioned before are the case? </p>

<p>Is it more likely that the planes are physically capable of flying that fast? Or that the real planes were switched out somehow and have disappeared along with all the people in them, that the flight controllers were all fooled by this and thought that this other hypothesized plane was in fact the original one, that the government engineered all of this to kill it&#39;s own citizens to get into a war at great risk to its reputation forever, and that none if the thousands of people who would have to have known about this massive switcheroo have come out to say it happened? </p>

<p>For reasonable people, the answer to this question is a no brainer. Why is it so challenging for you? </p>

<p>The documentary does not point fingers at anyone, which you would know if you actually saw the videos.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I do have a background in research and science, although common sense is perfectly sufficient for most people on this matter. </p>

<p>Your assumption is a result of poor critical thinking. Even if the official report is false, this does not mean we can assume this was done purposefully by the government to hide the fact that they were involved. It could mean any number of things. It could simply be that the committee got it wrong (at least on some points), this is perfectly possible. It could mean that they did intentionally lie about certain things for other reasons than that they were part of the attack, of which there are any number possible things they could want to hide. Perhaps how badly they screwed up on that day, or to conceal some other information that could be damaging to the country or themselves. It could even mean that they are intentionally lying and framing the terrorists after the fact because they wanted to use that as a means into war in the middle east, even that does not mean it was THEM who had to have committed the attacks. Or could it mean that they did it. </p>

<p>Any of these explanations are completely reasonable possibilities to speculate about (and this list isn&#39;t exhaustive). However, we don&#39;t have sufficient evidence to draw any conclusions as to which is the case. </p>

<p>So, if all you are trying to get me to admit is that there are elements of the official report that are wrong. I will absolutely admit that that is at least 100% possible, even likely. (I won&#39;t say it is beyond a shadow of a doubt, because that isn&#39;t the case with anything, and is simply manipulative language). If you are using the conclusions that parts of the official story are wrong to then conclude that the U.S. government was involved in committing the attacks, you have no grounds for doing so, it is unfounded speculation. If you are willing to admit that, than we are in agreement. If not, you are either delusional, or you are mistaken on the necessary steps of logic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your reasonable response. Let me say 2 things: 1) of course the government lies about things. They lie constantly about all sorts of things. However, this is not evidence that they committed the attacks, or let them happen, etc. </p>

<p>2) I don&#39;t think this could be kept secret if it were indeed a conspiracy. The number of people required would simply be too vast. I mean, thousands. Humans just don&#39;t work that way. Bill Clinton got a blowjob in his own office in the White House and it came out. And only 2 people knew about that! Imagine the level if secrecy required. </p>

<p>I appreciate your candour and honesty. The problem with most folks espousing a conspiracy theory is that they like to play it both ways. If you pin them down they&#39;ll say &quot;I&#39;m not saying I know who did it, I&#39;m just asking questions about the official story&quot;, but if you let them go for awhile talking about 9/11 they&#39;ll throw all kinds of shit in about who probably/maybe did it and why. Until you call them on that and they retreat again. It&#39;s a mental game that&#39;s being played, and they&#39;re playing it on themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am asking a question... I SAW a plane hit the WTC, I saw it happen on tv. That plane took off, it did not land. UA is missing a plane. We are missing people on the plane. If you are going to make a plane disappear and all the people on it... why would you use a drone..why not use the plane?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the answer would be: they don&#39;t have any pilots willing to kill themselves. </p>

<p>If you used a drone you could crash it, land the passenger plane somewhere else, kill the passengers and pretend it didn&#39;t exist. How the hell you cover that one up, I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that seems complicated... that is more likely than terrorists hijacking a plane?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about complexity though. The evidence put forward (and not saying there isn&#39;t more to counter the argument) show that the alleged pilots could NOT have piloted 747&#39;s into the towers and definitely not crashed into the Pentagon.</p>

<p>The only options therefore are:</p>

<p>It was a different plane.</p>

<p>It was a different pilot.</p>

<p>If it was a different plane then the US government has to be involved and the passengers have to have been bumped off or detained somewhere. There is evidence to support this theory.</p>

<p>If it was a different pilot then said pilot has to have had extensive training and have to have reason to kill himself. As yet there is no evidence to support this theory.</p>

<p>Of course it could be something different altogether.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well according to the video (which has sources, up to you if you trust them), aeroplanes have a max speed at which they can fly, that maximum drastically reduces the lower your altitude, all basic physics.</p>

<p>When you go over the max speed (called a VMO) the wings begin to wobble making the plane very difficult to fly straight, if you keep going over they will fracture and snap off, the body of the plane does the same thing. There are some great videos of aircraft going over their VMO&#39;s.</p>

<p>So basically they where going too fast to be 747&#39;s.</p>

<p>However the video did not offer up a source that explained how fast it would be going for the wings to shear off. So it does not prove that the wings may not simply have been wobbling as the plane crashed. At the speeds recorded though the experts in the video claim the feat to be impossible.</p>

<p>The second piece of evidence is the flight path. At those speeds flying a plane is very difficult (even more so with wings fluctuating), yet the completely novice pilots managed to perform some outstanding manoeuvres.</p>

<p>The most impressive being the Pentagon. Somehow the plane was flown around in a 360 loop at very high speed then ploughed into a tiny cement wall at ground level. Which means not only did a novice pilot managed to perform a perfect spiral downward at speed, he realigned perfectly, and at 500mph fly at street level into the exact piece of wall he needed to hit.</p>

<p>Again, I am not stupid enough to claim it as impossible, but there is some serious evidence there to suggest something else is at play. (If you believe the pilots, air traffic controllers and Boeing)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is evidence the US government issued the passports to the terrorists.. But planes did hit the WTC. It is perfectly possible for them too do so. Like I don&#39;t get what you are trying to say. You turn the plane toward a building and fly into it. The B25 managed to do it. It just makes so much more sense that a few planes were hijacked and crashed than a few planes made to disappear and replaced with drones that are the same size and shape of the aircraft. You are making the conspiracy too compliacted</p>

<p>I agree that they were legit airline planes that were, indeed, hijacked. I think one of the first points this video makes is the best. Where were the fighter get to shoot them down? Do they expect me to believe that the US military (biggest in the world by far) can&#39;t handle a couple of rogue passenger jets with no weapons? Right there shows that the &quot;Government is to blame&quot;. Benefit of the doubt, maybe they didn&#39;t know about it before hand, maybe it wasn&#39;t devious on their part.

    <div class="md"><p>The FOIA request for the gathered security footage was specific to footage that showed the impact of Flight 77.  The FBI reviewed all <del>80</del> 85 videos it had and determined that only one of them showed the plane.  The FBI thus disclosed only one video.</p>

<p>Now, people claim the FBI is lying about how many videos showed the plane.  And maybe they are.  But the way to prove that is easy: a broader FOIA request for all of the 85 videos gathered and analyzed, not just the ones that showed the plane.</p>

<p>I cannot think of a reason why conspiracy theorist groups have not made the broader request except for the possibility that they value being able to point to the &quot;unknowns&quot; about the other 84 videos.</p>

<p>When you take a moment to think about it, by the way, it makes sense that the vast majority of security cameras would not capture an incoming plane.  Security cameras are not often (1) aimed at the sky or (2) aimed inwardly towards buildings, and, even if a camera did theoretically have a vantage point to catch the plane&#39;s movement or impact, most cameras (especially in 2001) were not (3) suited to capturing something moving 500 mph.</p>

<p>EDIT: my memory was a little off on this.  Fixed my numbers.  Source: <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/FBI_hides_84_Pentagon_videos">http://www.911myths.com/index.php/FBI_hides_84_Pentagon_videos</a></p>

<p>I should also note that the FBI claims most of the videos in that 85 were not even from the pentagon or its immediate vicinity.  Many pertained to other parts of the FBI&#39;s 9-11 investigation and, as such, included video of the WTC and searches of locations linked to the suspected hijackers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as <a href="/u/TheChris916">/u/TheChris916</a> points out, the video the FBI released actually contains two vantage points of the impact, not just one.</p>

<p>In any case, if you believe the FBI is lying about any of the other video, there is nothing stopping you from submitting a FOIA request for it.  I remain very skeptical that there would be many cameras that could have captured it.  While it did approach ground level, that was only for a few fleeting seconds after it came down over the highway.  And it does not appear to me that it crossed over any parking lots, just a grass field and a small road.</p>

<p>there&#39;s nothing stopping me from submitting a FOIA. Aside, of course, from the fact that everyone else that has ever submitted a FOIA request for more security footage from the Pentagon has received the same excuses and been denied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where you are wrong.  I have seen zero evidence that any FOIA request for those videos was denied.  If such a request were denied, then there would have to be an official denial letter stating why.  That letter&#39;s decision would be appealable, first administratively and then, second, in federal court.  But there is no such letter because it seems no one bothered to actually request all the videos.</p>

<p>Again, the original FOIA request in question here was only for footage showing the impact of flight 77.  You can see the text of this request displayed in the OP&#39;s video during the discussion of the pentagon videos.  Pause the video 17:28 and read the text of the actual request.  Under the FOIA, the requestor controls the scope of their request, not the requestee.  They didn&#39;t get all the videos because of their narrowly worded request.  That doesn&#39;t mean the videos are unobtainable; it just means they were not requested.</p>

<p>As to why they didn&#39;t point the cameras in the air?  I don&#39;t believe anyone in the pentagon knew Flight 77 was going to hit the pentagon.  And, even if they somehow could have guessed that, they almost certainly could not predict its angle of attack.  Heck, they didn&#39;t even evacuate the section that was hit.  Who&#39;s response to thinking a hijacked plane might hit your building would be, &quot;ok, turn all the cameras to the sky so we can maybe record it hitting,&quot; anyhow?</p>

You can appeal denials administratively and ultimately to federal courts, but, even if you didn&#39;t appeal, you&#39;d have a much stronger argument about FBI malfeasance then, &quot;well, we assume they won&#39;t give them to us, so we won&#39;t bother asking.&quot;</p>

It showed security footage from the security gate entering the parking lot (I think?), in addition to another camera from a different location at the same check gate. The video went on to prove the angle of the two cameras was off and concluded the videos were edited, but the point I&#39;m trying to make is there was more than one camera view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not familiar with any other FOIA request for videos other than the one to which the Maguire Declaration responds.  But I was a bit off on my numbers re the number of videos the FBI reviewed (there were 85, not 80).  I have updated my post above accordingly and provided a link to info about the Maguire Declaration.</p>

<p>EDIT:  I reviewed the claims in the OP&#39;s video and the Maguire Declaration more closely and can provide a more satisfying response.  The Maguire Declaration often counts multiple videos from the same video system as a single video.  In the case of the two camera views that are in the OP video, both of them were disclosed as the &quot;one video&quot; provided by the FBI in response to the FOIA request.  You can see this as the last entry on the video list attached to the declaration: 1A-1A95013 One (1) CD-ROM <em>Images capture the impact of the plane into the Pentagon from two different cameras</em>.</p>

<p>Not necessarily.  As I&#39;ve told several posters, the FBI&#39;s determination re that video being the only one of the 85 to show the impact is not dispositive of what the other videos actually show.  If you doubt the FBI&#39;s determination, however, the most sensible thing to do would be to request the other videos.</p>

<p>I often see these concerns about these videos come up with a subtext that the FBI is withholding them, but that is not how FOIA requests work.  In this case, the request was very narrowly worded (see OP&#39;s video at 17:28 for the text of the request).  Once the FBI determined that only one video showed impact, per the wording of that request, that was the only one they were able to disclose.  To understand why, imagine FOIA responses in a world where the government agencies could bury requestors in troves of irrelevant documents.  We don&#39;t want that, so we give the requestor the power (subject to certain enumerated exemptions) to control the scope of his or her own request.  Here, the scope was very narrow.</p>

<p>Now that the FBI has provided its description of the other videos, however, it would be almost trivial to request and obtain them with a broader FOIA.  So it&#39;s puzzling to me that those who believe the FBI is lying have not done so, given that they believe those other videos would show to the world that the FBI is lying.  That those who doubt the FBI&#39;s claims have not requested the videos does not mean the FBI is being truthful, but it certainly precludes them from arguing the FBI is withholding the videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.  It was a tightly descending corkscrew turn at max speed, finally reaching an incredible airspeed of over 500 mph running just meters off the ground before striking the Pentagon. The NTSB flight data has been released and is public.</p>

<p>Pilots with a <em>lifetime</em> of experience flying commercial planes have taken the official NTSB flight path and tried to recreate the maneuver, at the same speed, in flight simulators. The really good pilots can recreate it after a few tries. Poor pilots cannot recreate it at all.</p>

<p>The air traffic controllers on duty that day thought that Flight 77 was a military jet because they had never in their lives seen a commercial airliner flown like that.</p>

<p>And the most incredible thing of all is that Flight 77 was pointed right at the Pentagon before the amazing turn. He could have just nosed down and plowed into the place, doing incredible damage. But instead, did a highly advanced, highly risky turn to come around and hit the place in the side.  The one side that happened to be fortified and half empty. Now that just seems like it&#39;s from a fairy tale to me, but it&#39;s the official story.</p>

<p>Yeah - down and to the left. That&#39;s what I said in less fancy words. I don&#39;t really get why you say I&#39;m wrong here.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this argument before, but actually the air traffic controller who made the comment goes on to say that it&#39;s because commercial airliners wouldn&#39;t fly so unsafely - not that commercial airliners <em>can&#39;t</em> do it, they just <em>wouldn&#39;t normally</em>, so they assumed it was military.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not even a very telling statement - how many US traffic controllers would have had experience dealing with a hijacked 747? I&#39;m betting none in the room at that time, so obviously they would have never seen a 747 performing such unnecessary, dangerous maneuvers before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said wrong in reference to the claim that it was an easy maneuver. Commercial pilots would disagree. They would tell you that&#39;s it not impossible, but risky and difficult. In particular, they would tell you that it would be difficult to actually hit the Pentagon from such a maneuver, because the high speeds make it very unforgiving so that if you don&#39;t execute the turn perfectly, you end up either flying over the Pentagon or plowing the ground.</p>

<p>The official 9/11 story tells us that a man, only trained on small planes and with maybe a bit of simulator time on big planes, a man who had failed out of flight schools, a man who could barely speak or read English, a man who was called a &quot;bad pilot,&quot; stepped into the cockpit of a 767 for the first time his life, and pulled off something that experienced pilots would not dream of doing, all instead of just simply crashing the plane normally?</p>

<p>That sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard &quot;risky&quot; before, but I&#39;ve yet to actually find any evidence coming from reputable sources that this was a particularly difficult move to perform. Do you have any source on this other than the misquoted air traffic controller? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Philip Marshall (deceased) was a commercial pilot who is one source who said it took him 5 tries in a simulator to hit the Pentagon. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Bamboozle-War-Terror/dp/1468094580">His book.</a></p>

<p>The documentary in question also has many other pilots giving their opinions to the nature of the flight: <a href="http://youtu.be/O1GCeuSr3Mk?t=1h3m5s">http://youtu.be/O1GCeuSr3Mk?t=1h3m5s</a></p>

<p>You can&#39;t watch that section without scratching your head. The danger one gets into here is that we have no idea what&#39;s fake and what&#39;s real. The hole in the Pentagon was real. Eyewitness saw &quot;a plane&quot; so there was probably &quot;a plane&quot; involved, but many other aspects could have easily been faked. Maybe the NTSB data is all bullshit? Who knows.</p>

<p>The definitive records would have been the flight data recorders. But those were conveniently &quot;destroyed&quot; in the crash. </p>

<p>The author of the documentary, later on, subscribes to a &quot;plane swap&quot; theory, where somewhere along the line, in all the confusion, the commercial planes were swapped with military decoys or even drones.  This answers all the &quot;problems&quot; with the official story, but multiplies the number of people who would have had to be &quot;in&quot; on the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Philip Marshall&#39;s theory was that the hijackers had secret training on 757s from the CIA at an airbase in Arizona, and were actually well trained to do the maneuvers they did. They were not trained on landing or take offs so people still thought they were bad pilots. I tend to like this a bit better because it means a much smaller conspiracy.</p>

<p>Either way, the official story is just not believable. What I have never seen is some debunker dragging a commercial pilot into a simulator to show how easy it is. I&#39;ve looked for it, and this simply does not exist to my knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be lacking some understanding of avionics. This is a matter of potential and kinetic energy. The plane was at a high altitude (potential energy) and had passed the point of doing a simple negative angle decent directly towards the pentagon. When you have high kinetic energy (airspeed) and high potential energy (altitude) its hard to just turn and go directly at something that you have already passed. This is hard because the second you start to nose-down you are going to tap into that potential energy(altitude) and it will start bleeding off into kinetic energy (airspeed). Now the angle that was supposedly done by the dudes with box cutters leaves basically zero room for error in the angle and decent path that the plane took. Otherwise the plane could would have ripped apart or simply put, missed the target.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand is why the U.S government didn&#39;t just say that these hijackers were expert pilots or had super terrorist training, as that would seem an easy way to shill away these claims, at least to the people drinking the koolade. There are just parts of the official story that seem like they didn&#39;t even try to make the it believable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Hard&quot; seems like a relative term here with no real base for context. It&#39;s may be hard<strong>er</strong> to turn so sharply when you are descending then if you weren&#39;t descending, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s necessarily &quot;hard&quot; in the eyes of a professional, or amateur pilot. </p>

<p>Hell, it could have been pushing the plane to the brink of tearing apart...I still don&#39;t know if that necessarily would mean that it&#39;s a difficult thing for the pilot to perform. </p>

<p>I&#39;d really like to see a professional pilot saying that it&#39;s difficult to do, and not just safely. </p>

<p>Are you telling me that you believe that either (1) the people who made the calls were lying to their families right before they died? or that (2) someone somehow got a bunch of voice doubles of flight passengers to call their family members to talk to them for the last time?</p>

<p>As I understand it, cell phone calls in the air at that time would have had limitations on their connectivity, but independent analysis has showed that the calls were possible.

One women specifically says that they&#39;re talking about crashing into the world trade center.  It just doesn&#39;t pass a straight faced test.  The cellphone connections themselves don&#39;t make any sense either.</p>

<p>Where is the cellphone triangulation from the tower telemetry?  In 2001 it was very common to loose connection jumping from one tower to the next on a highway, I&#39;d be interested to hear how it&#39;s explained it worked so well for these planes flying at speeds over 400mph.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm...  I&#39;m addressing the issues discussed in the videos. It makes zero sense to assume that these people didn&#39;t talk to their family members.  You are focused on the supposed lack of likelihood that the calls could be made.  But you&#39;re ignoring the most simple fact that the actual people whose family members died aren&#39;t just going to lie about having talked to them for the last time.  And I mean, we have recordings of some of those people who were on the planes.  You&#39;re ignoring strong evidence that doesn&#39;t suit your narrative.</p>

<p>More than this though, I think a lot of truthers don&#39;t think about obvious holes in their stories like these.  They come up with a conspiracy with holes in it and then when people point out the holes they come up with arguments to fill the holes that are outrageous.</p>

<p>The irony is that they believe that the official story is outrageously flawed but that they come up with alternative explanations that are at least equally questionable, if not more questionable than the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The documentary implies Pearl Harbor was a false flag using footage from a BBC documentary that is ripped apart <a href="http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/myths/myths/he-knew-of-pearl-harbour-attack">here.</a> The historical consensus is that FDR had no foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>However, its title is also of course a reference to the Project for a New American Century, which uses the phrase to mean another attack on American soil that could be used to galvanize the American people into supporting a previously unpopular war plan. Although it doesn&#39;t directly advocate a false flag operation, it hints that the administration should take advantage of any such attack to push a private agenda. There is no doubt this part of the plan was put into play with the invasion of Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9/11 and yet would have been politically impossible without it. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that FDR wanted war with Japan. There is no evidence he saw the McCollum memo, but it&#39;s certainly possible and the eight steps it listed were carried out, although they would have been prudent steps to prepare for a possible war, not just to provoke one.</p>

<p>The thing that is unsupported by the historical record is the assertion that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was a target of Japanese aggression or that he knew when they were planning to attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>see its this kind of willful ignorance we are talking about.  Your playing word games to sound smart.</p>

<p>A false flag operation is one perpetrated by a government against itself IN SECRET - ok so no claiming of credit, and it can be argued that america didn&#39;t own the bombing planes</p>

<p>However, that being said, you are nitpicking - the perpetration we are talking about in the pearl harbor incident and possibly in the 911 incident is the foreknowledge and the not preventing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so good to see that things are changing and that people are waking up to the truth and reality, no matter how painful it may be to consider, and no matter how much courage and perseverance it may require in the long run to effectively wrestle with and ultimately conquer and overcome as the next generation eventually comes to power to form the next &quot;relevant political community&quot; where it&#39;s safe to say that the present one is irrelevant already, although it might not realize it, yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;... if the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center had succeeded, the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to describe it. Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed even in American history. It could involve loss of life and property unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America&#39;s fundamental sense of security..Like Pearl Harbor, the event would divide our past and future into a before and after. The United States might respond with..&quot; </p>

<p>~ Philip Zelikow, pre-9/11, future Bush/Cheney appointed Chairman of the 9/11 Commission</p>

<p>&quot;An act of catastrophic terrorism that killed thousands or tens of thousands of people and/or disrupted the necessities of life for hundreds of thousands, or even millions, would be a watershed event in America&#39;s history. </p>

<p>It could involve loss of life and property unprecedented for peacetime and undermine Americans&#39; fundamental sense of security within their own borders in a manner akin to the 1949 Soviet atomic bomb test, or perhaps even worse. </p>

<p>Constitutional liberties would be challenged as the United States sought to protect itself from further attacks by </p>

<ul>
<li>pressing against allowable limits in surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects, and the use of deadly force. More violence would follow, either as other terrorists seek to imitate this great &quot;success&quot; or as the United States strikes out at those <em>considered</em> responsible. </li>
</ul>

<p>Like Pearl Harbor, such an event would divide our past and future into a &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after.&quot; </p>

<p>The effort and resources we devote to averting or containing this threat now, in the &quot;before&quot; period, will seem woeful, even pathetic, when compared to what will happen &quot;after.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While at Harvard he (Zelikow) worked with Ernest May and Richard Neustadt on the use, and misuse, of history in policymaking. They observed, as Zelikow noted in his own words, that &quot;contemporary&quot; history is &quot;defined functionally by those critical people and events that go into forming the public&#39;s presumptions about its immediate past. The idea of &#39;public presumption&#39;,&quot; he explained, &quot;is akin to William McNeill&#39;s notion of &#39;public myth&#39; but without the negative implication sometimes invoked by the word &#39;myth.&#39; Such presumptions are beliefs (1) thought to be true (although not necessarily known to be true with certainty), and (2) shared in common within the relevant political community.&quot; </p>

<p>Zelikow&#39;s focus was on what he calls &#39;searing&#39; or &#39;moulding&#39; events [that] take on &#39;transcendental&#39; importance and, therefore, retain their power even as the experience generation passes from the scene.&quot; </p>

<p>In Rise of the Vulcans (Viking, 2004), James Mann reports that when Richard Haass, a senior aide to Secretary of State Colin Powell and the director of policy planning at the State Department, drafted for the administration an overview of America’s national security strategy following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Dr. Rice, the national security advisor, &quot;ordered that the document be completely rewritten. She thought the Bush administration needed something bolder, something that would represent a more dramatic break with the ideas of the past. Rice turned the writing over to her old colleague, University of Virginia Professor Philip Zelikow.&quot; This document, issued on September 17, 2002, is generally recognized as a significant document in the War on Terrorism. </p>

<p>The idea of &#39;public presumption&#39;,&quot; he explained, &quot;is akin to [the] notion of &#39;public myth&#39; but without the negative implication sometimes invoked by the word &#39;myth.&#39; </p>

<p>Such presumptions are beliefs (1) thought to be true (although not necessarily known to be true with certainty), and (2) shared in common within the relevant political community.&quot;</p>

<p>Methinks the &quot;relevant political community&quot; has lost its relevance.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will volunteer as a layman expert on the findings of pilots for 9/11 truth as it relates to the totally mind blowing <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xlc96/911_proof_in_evidence_that_the_south_tower_plane/">excessive speed and performance of the south tower plane</a>, proving not only that it MUST have been a swapped and thus a remotely piloted drone with nothing and no one on board but advanced avionics and a whole plane load of incendiaries, but also prove that a novice &quot;pilot&quot; no better trained or experienced than Hani Hanjour of Pentagon flying fame, could ever fly a plane as observed as such speeds and exacting maneuvering and target aquisitioning. </p>

<p>That impact with the south tower was not merely a random fluke occurence by a &quot;lucky&quot; Islamist extremist party animal hijacker bent on wrecking destruction upon American society, and neither was the way those buildings basically exploded from top to bottom to within about three or four seconds of absolute freefall, but that&#39;s another issue, so i&#39;ll stick to the south tower plane exclusively, yet nevertheless pointing out the true nature of the underlying murderous hoax designed to take over human history and bring in a top down stratification of civilization amid the laying on of a techno security grid - or a power and money grab, nothing more. It sure didn&#39;t make the world a better and a &quot;safer&quot; place by the US Government&#39;s reaction and response to the event, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>And in it&#39;s entire wake - nothing but all corruption, now plainly obvious for all to see amid an implosion of public confidence in the government and the MSM, so we&#39;re at another turning point that Philip Zelikow could never have imagined in his wildest dream, or his worst nightmares. </p>

<p>9/11 is still relevant and it has much to say in regards to the type of people and system that we&#39;re dealing with, but they are very few and we are many as the up and coming generation, and we mean business, and if 9/11 is some sort of linchpin or historical fulcrum that they&#39;ve gone and handed over in the blatant BOTCHED nature (given how truly obvious it really is) of the event, while the placing themselves and that whole system in what i call a double-bind, by comparison, then so be it and all the more reason to identify and root out the evil tree at it&#39;s source and cast it into the abyss - by simply placing an entirely rational and objective light even as small as a mere candle on recent modern 21st century &quot;history&quot; (crap is more like it). </p>

<p>They tried to &quot;take over the world&quot;! </p>

<p>But it was a FAIL the whole damn thing, including and especially including the &quot;transformative and catastrophic, catalyzing event like a New Pearl Harbor (Philip D. Zelikow, December 1998!) itself. </p>

<p>Most certainly there&#39;s nothing now hidden by the cover up and false narrative that will not be made known and brought to light, and how can it not when it&#39;s already as plain as day?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a joke in this somewhere for the little man the downtrodden, yet again, you see, where perhaps it could be said yet again that &quot;it was the stone that was rejected by the builders that became the keystone&quot;, and that includes also our fellow citizens who were victimized and everyone else who was victimized, including the whole world and the average American citizen in the rape of liberty and the hijacking of their own nationalistic and patriotic sentiments and by God now they all know or are quickly coming to know, that the whole thing went straight to hell in a hand-basket. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t fool all the people all the time, and you don&#39;t mess with the American people, not in the long run. They KNOW. </p>

<p>In other words - we win, and i can prove it, backed by the collective findings and research of a group of about 300 professional pilots who&#39;ve dared to come forward, on the record, staking their entire career&#39;s reputation on the fact that a standard, unmodified, Boeing 767 simply CANNOT fly, nor accelerate under standard engine propulsion, while retaining perfect flight control and pulling G&#39;s, at close to 600mph (590mph or 510-515 knots) in the lower strata of the atmosphere. </p>

<p>So down goes the official story at nearly the rate of absolutely freefall, and it&#39;s all over. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what this documentary shows and which i can validate, using not Vmo/Mmo, but with Vd/Md. </p>

<p>Maybe a pilot might show and make an appearance though, i&#39;ll see what i can do in that regard.. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all over for their corrupt system. History is already rising up to stand in judgment of the crime of the century and the entire corrupt system of which was supposed to be the &quot;fulcrum&quot;, the linchpin, the juggernaut, but built right into the rendering of the actual event itself IS IT&#39;S OWN UNDOING. It was too brazen.. so another picture becomes apparent in the most stark and horrific way imaginable, but, in the willingness to face the truth of the matter, comes a newfound sense of healing and justice as we snatch away the historical fulcrum faster than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgP0719J1wU">Mathew Mills can snatch the microphone</a> from in front of the Superbowl MVP to ask us all to &quot;investigate 911&quot;, like a plea and a supreme hope.. that was epic, imo. </p>

<p>The truth is self evident. That&#39;s the thing, and the big elephant in the room isn&#39;t about to go away when so many unanswered questions remain, legitimate questions. </p>

<p>It&#39;s under the historical microscope and the rational eye of a discerning public, plus the internet is full of it being one of the most searched terms in Google history. Everyone&#39;s at least aware that it&#39;s out there this thing called &quot;911 truth&quot; - just waiting to be investigated objectively and rationally.</p>

<p>Some of those questions CAN be answered - so i&#39;ll take the south tower plane speed, i&#39;ve got that one down in my understanding of the work of pilots for 9/11 truth, and it&#39;s irrefutable and the kind of thing that just can&#39;t be ignored once it becomes plainly obvious or in plane site so to speak.</p>

<p>The truth will out and it&#39;s outing. </p>

<p>9/11 is leaking and there is nothing they can do to plug it and it&#39;s like a one way firehose, the evidence and a one way street for those who make the honest and rational, investigative inquiry, there&#39;s no going back once it&#39;s become obvious, which it already has, so like i said  - we win. They handed it over, and the devil in the system is already double bound by the chains of reason and logic and in the light of day where such evil no longer has any place to hide. They did it to themselves in the end, but long range history won&#39;t be fooled and neither will the American people be forever fooled either.</p>

<p>&quot;That which hurts, also instructs.&quot;
~ Ben Franklin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have seen the full docu (all three parts) two times and will propably watch it a third time with my brother and 1-2 more times alone on the side while playing a game or stuff.</p>

<p>Have to say it&#39;s a great documentary, one of my favourites and probably one of the very best when it comes to this topic.</p>

<p>I did have a few minor issues with some points but I would have to first rewatch the whole thing before I can point them out.
Would&#39;ve also liked to get into more detail on some points (like I feel Operation Northwoods deserves a bit more then a quick mention)</p>

<p>Still, great work of film.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I like that it&#39;s very matter of fact and not sensationalized with hysterical eye witnesses or lots of emotional manipulation.
It&#39;s also very grounded in reality, it doesn&#39;t require any too far-fetched methods. And it takes it time to really dissect each point and argument.</p>

<p>My other favourite 9/11 docu, which I can&#39;t find an english name for (it&#39;s called &quot;Das Mega Ritual&quot; in german) is also a lot of fun to watch but requires far more suspension of disbelief by claiming the planes never existed and were put in as part of video manipulation and stuff and how the whole WTC complex was one huge ritual with different buildings being the actors.</p>

<p>So yeah, 9/11 - Pearl Harbor is a lot less crazy than many other docus dealing with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. </p>

<p>South Tower Plane - Evidence:</p>

<p>Flight Envelope Limits</p>

<p>Boeing A1NM TYPE CERTIFICATE DATA SHEET <a href="http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/a8694be7b7ac6c178625731e006944bc/$FILE/A1NM%20Rev%2026.pdf">http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/a8694be7b7ac6c178625731e006944bc/$FILE/A1NM%20Rev%2026.pdf</a></p>

<p>Airspeed Limits: VD = 420 KCAS to 17,854 ft/.91M above 23,000 ft, linear variation between these points. VMO = 360 KCAS/.86M</p>

<p>Recorded Speed</p>

<p>Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_Study--UA175_AA11 NTSB NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/p4t/Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_Study--AA11,_UA175.pdf">http://pilotsfor911truth.org/p4t/Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_Study--AA11,_UA175.pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;For much of it&#39;s final descent, UAL175 maintained a descent rate between 4000 feet per minute and 8000 feet per minute. During the descent from 12,000 feet to 6000 feet, the aircraft groundspeed remained between 500 - 520 knots. As the aircraft made it&#39;s final descent to 1000 feet, it ACCELERATED and impacted Word Trade Center tower #2 at approximately 510 knots groundspeed.&quot;</p>

<p>510 knots = 587 MPH</p>

<p>Standard (unmodified) Boeing 767 design dive limit VD = 420 KCAS (knots calibrated airspeed).</p>

<p>Difference: NINETY KNOTS (104mph)</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m curious. Where does the 510 knot speed come from?&quot;</p>

<p>The NTSB used radar from JFK, EWR, LGA, HPN and the USAF RADES for their speed analysis. This is the same radar used in the NYC Terminal Area to assign speeds and vector aircraft arriving and departing the busy NYC Terminal area, as well as USAF radar which helps to protect our country (well, apparently not on 9/11). </p>

<p>Also worth noting is that groundspeed does not equal airspeed. To obtain airspeed with groundspeed, the windspeed vector must be added, which in this case, with a very light wind to the N/W gives an airspeed of approximately 515 knots = 592.6mph.</p>

<p>It should be noted that 515 knots is 95 knots over the Vd limit for that aircraft type, which represents an utterly impossible speed unless the plane was not flight 175, but a severely modified military variant of the Boeing 767 with hardened structure, including modified leading wing edges, as well as more powerful engines by a magnitude of 4-6 times greater than standard. </p>

<p>New York Times

A NATION CHALLENGED: THE TRADE CENTER CRASHES; First Tower to Fall Was Hit At Higher Speed, Study Finds </p>

<p>By ERIC LIPTON AND JAMES GLANZ </p>

<p>Researchers trying to explain why the World Trade Center&#39;s south tower fell first, though struck second, are focusing on new calculations showing that the passenger jet that hit the south tower had been flying as fast as 586 miles an hour, about 100 miles an hour faster than the other hijacked plane. </p>

<p>The speed of the two planes at impact has been painstakingly estimated using a mix of video, radar and even the recorded sounds of the planes passing overhead. </p>

<p>Two sets of estimates, by government and private scientists, have surfaced, but both show that the plane that hit the south tower at 9:02 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175, approached the trade center at extremely high speed, much faster than American Airlines Flight 11, which hit the north tower at 8:46 a.m. </p>

<p>In fact, the United plane was moving so fast that it was at risk of breaking up in midair as it made a final turn toward the south tower, traveling at a speed far exceeding the 767-200 design limit for that altitude, a Boeing official said. </p>

<p>&#39;&#39;These guys exceeded even the emergency dive speed,&#39;&#39; said Liz Verdier, a Boeing spokeswoman. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s off the chart.&#39;&#39;</p>

<hr/>

<p>586 mph = 509.2 knots, so they were very close, but the Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_Study, is more accurate for the reasons stated in the post above.</p>

<p>Hope that helps answer your question, at least as it applies to the south tower plane (can&#39;t really call it &quot;flight 175&quot;, any more)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those of you who, after watching the documentary, might have felt moved to some sort of activism, don&#39;t forget that you can buy the DVD set at Amazon and then have the right, awarded by the film maker, to then re-distribute and copy freely, however much you wish</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/September-11-The-Pearl-Harbor/dp/B00F12IRSO">http://www.amazon.com/September-11-The-Pearl-Harbor/dp/B00F12IRSO</a></p>

<p>Then maybe get a hold of a really good DVD replicating machine and a label making process (to make it look fancy and original and compelling to want to watch) and hand them out all over the place like Johnny Appleseed on a mission. You could make prints for DVD jackets or holders as well if you want for special people you want to make a good impression with and to make sure that they take the time to watch it. </p>

<p>Forget Youtube, this is the way to spread the film, and fire away at will - it makes a difference, don&#39;t let the naysayers try to tell you otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, this is awesome. I consider this movie one of the best 9/11 documentaries. Loose Change gets a lot more shit than it deserves but it still has a lot of good stuff in it. I think people go after loose change because Dylan Avery is young so the media and the Debunkers treat him like a stupid kid that can&#39;t possibly know more than them. But I like the way this documentary is laid out, addressing each aspect of 9/11. I really appreciate you making this post. I will direct the Debunkers (u/defiantshill) to the appropriate section of this post from now on.</p>

<p>Currently we are arguing the Pentagon No Plane theory. This and Barbara Honneger&#39;s testimony I think are the strongest evidence for why the official conspiracy theory is false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Big Lie&quot; </p>

<p>All this was inspired by the principle - which is quite true in itself - that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. </p>

<p>Flight 175: The United Airlines Flight 175 aircraft was a Boeing 767-222 that had been built in 1983, registration number N612UA. So it was an older aircraft, certainly not capable of exceeding it&#39;s Vd limit of 420KCAS by 90 knots, and it&#39;s Vmo by 150 knots or 173 mph, in level flight, near sea level, while maneuvering deftly and pulling g&#39;s in the order of 2.5g.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I think happened:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Either a drone or a missile hit the Pentagon. The area hit was conveniently &quot;under renovation&quot;. It would be easy to place parts of a dismembered aircraft into the targeted area. Once the missile/drone hit, it also set off charges that were rigged around the impact area to resemble airplane damage and would launch the wreckage into the grassy area (that&#39;s why there were so few parts, they could not fit a whole plane into that area inside the Pentagon). Out of the 51 (plus 5 hijackers), the official report could only account for 5 bodies in the wreckage, which were most likely corpses strapped on chairs beforehand. The bodies were never ID&#39;d to prove they were the actual passengers on the flight. The light poles were also rigged beforehand to fall over at the specified time to simulate an airplane at ground level. There will never be a video because it will show nothing hitting those light poles and most likely falling over by themselves.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, that was off-topic as I was trying to point to the South Tower Plane&#39;s excessive speed. </p>

<p>The Pentagon involves what i call a &quot;honey pot&quot; and is thus best left alone by the 9/11 truth movement, while demanding the release of the videos of the plane on approach to impact. </p>

<p>&quot;A honey pot, in intelligence jargon, is a tempting source of information or &#39;dangle&#39; that is set out to lure intended victims into a trap. Ultimately the honey pot is violently and maliciously discredited so as to destroy the credibility of anything stuck to it by association” – Michael Ruppert, &quot;Crossing the Rubicon,&quot; p. 184</p>

<p>Jim Hoffman of 9/11 Research:
“The idea that no 757 crashed at the Pentagon is easily the most controversial and divisive issue among researchers of the 9/11/01 attacks. Effectively promoted since early 2002, this idea has enjoyed an increasing acceptance in the 9/11 Truth Movement, despite its blatant incompatibility with the extensive body of eyewitness evidence that a 757-like twin-engine jetliner flew into the Pentagon and exploded.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there was a flyover, you&#39;d think there would have been witnesses to that because the highway goes right around the Pentagon, with Reagan Int&#39;l airport right near by - so low flying planes are a very normal occurance, if the Boeing, which WAS at the scene, overflew the Pentagon wall coupled with explosives made to look like a Boeing hit, yet never shown on any of the cameras and there is it - but it&#39;s still speculation - something we must remain disciplined about not doing or if offering a hypothesis to make the distinction very clear that the onus is on the government to release the videos, of which they must be at least 80 or so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It left the U.S. west coast, pacific islands and allies extremely exposed. What if there had been an invasion force with the Japanese fleet? What if the carrier fleet got hit as well? </p></li>
<li><p>The USN&#39;s strategic fuel reserves were located in Hawaii and if the Japanese had attacked the fuel storage as well, it would have crippled US fleet operations in the pacific for a very long time. No rational military planner would countenance that risk that the loss of that fuel supply represented.</p></li>
<li><p>While there were some naval officers that saw the strength of the carrier, fleets were based around battleships and they wouldn&#39;t be traded away.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if it was a ruse to get the U.S. into the war (which it was not), why let the Japanese steam away after the attack? Why not let them pull a sneak attack and then sink their fleet?</p></li>

<p>The event would need to be very big, one small raid followed by the immediate destruction of the Japanese fleet would not convince the entirety of the US to join one of the most destructive wars of all time.</p>

<p>For your first point many ships where removed from the harbour before the attack, if it was known about then precautions would have been taken to ensure the &#39;ifs&#39; didn&#39;t occur. Which they didn&#39;t.</p>

Hard to believe something as important as the Pentagon just had a couple of security cameras pointing to the outside, or that giant skyscrapers can just fall down under their own weight.  There was no buckling of steel or the tops of the WTC falling one way or another, just straight down.  That never made any sense to me, along with all the variables it undertook to cause such an event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, you&#39;re ignoring a significant amount of the evidence. Yes, there are always crazy conspiracy theorists and whatnot, but you are completely overlooking the fact that  A. the engines were made of titanium and steel, both of which have melting points too high (and were in abundance such that) to have been completely vaporized on impact or during the ensuing fire. Also, the evidence of shaped charges having been used on the support pillars and the explosion that happened 2 seconds before the first tower went down. Also, you saying You think they can take down the towers in the middle of our biggest city and kill thousands of people but for some reason they can&#39;t get to you? Seriously...this is borderline magical thinking at this point.&quot; shows just how much you don&#39;t understand why this was done. It wasn&#39;t to kill specific people. The people who died were supposed to be innocent civilians because it was supposed to be tragic enough that the American public would support going to war with the &quot;terrorists&quot; that did it. Don&#39;t just bash the theory as soon as you hear it because you find it hard to believe or you don&#39;t want to believe it. Ignorance and denial are why governments are able to carry out things like this before the general public realizes it or wants to recognize the reality.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are very good at describing yourself.  You are the one avoiding subject matter, as I specifically provided you with an example of Dimensions post and how you ignored/passed up the opportunity to discuss/debate what he offered.
I tried to be somewhat civil in calling you out on being incredibly biased and unwilling to have a real discussion whilst trying to shove your opinions and sources down everyone elses throats.  But you know what, I&#39;m done with that.  You my friend are a jagoff.  I call you that because I can tell that you are not stupid, your post alone proves that you are skillful and intelligent when putting your mind to a specific topic, BUT your replies to counter sources and counter evidence proves you to be a selfish petty one sided closed minded jagoff.
I never once claimed your evidence was wrong, I never once tried to &quot;deflect&quot; anything as you put it because I do not disagree with some of your post.  What I do disagree with is your petty attitude and self righteousness.  You assume anyone painting anything you do in a negative light is automatically calling you a liar or saying what you posted is untrue.  You need to learn to separate topics of discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Refute what? The movie doesn&#39;t assert anything.  It cites a lot of individual opinions with basically nothing to back those opinions up, but nothing that resembles a compelling argument in any way that is based on any actual science or numbers. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of foolish animation and mindless speculation, but no engineering-driven models that answer for any of the behaviors claimed.  </p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;m not going to go off refuting people when they make shit up, because who am I to interfere with people&#39;s imaginations.  </p>

<p>At the end of the day, conspiracy theorists want to believe that a conspiracy exists, and frankly there isn&#39;t enough information gathered from any event ever to fully reconstruct exactly what happened at every second.  I have zero interest in disabusing people of their fantastical notions - it&#39;s simply a waste of time.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll go further and say that conspiracy theories are /inherently/ stupid when long since washed away by the currents of time.   What actually happened in most events in history doesn&#39;t matter, what does matter is how the world has changed since.  Most of the world we live in is a product of society&#39;s collective imagination, and our daily lives require buying into it. By contrast, nosing heavily into conspiracy theories does nothing for anybody, as if anybody that mattered could have been convinced of it, we&#39;d have seen real effects long since.  </p>

<p>On this note, I&#39;ll ask the open question - if your conspiracy theory of choice is true, so what? What can you do about it? Why does it matter?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you know what evidence is.  </p>

<p>Take the whole &quot;where are the hat trusses&quot; thing.  </p>

<p>You are talking about a steel structure that fell the distance of one of the tallest buildings ever constructed.  These people expect them to be recognizably intact and distinguishable among the ruins of an entire steel and reinforced concrete structure? Are you serious?  Its a unshielded skeletal steel structure falling at near terminal velocity, it&#39;s going to be in tiny ass pieces, not recognizable sections.  </p>

<p>Now, my argument here is just as baseless as the assertion that it should be intact made in the movie.  Neither of us have science, engineering, or any sort of model or testing backing this up.  But because it&#39;s in a movie spoken by an authoritative-sounding voiceover, it&#39;s suddenly &#39;evidence&#39; now.  </p>

<p>The entire structural argument carries on just like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, this is all really compelling but let&#39;s be clear: it&#39;s propaganda. It&#39;s propaganda made by 9/11 Truthers that simply doesn&#39;t give a fully accurate view of the events.</p>

<p>And before you yell at me, let me say that I enjoyed the film and plan on watching it again.</p>

<p>It makes a decent argument with lots of evidence, but it&#39;s propaganda that works identically to the ever-hated corporate news agencies.</p>

<p>It plays your emotions with very highly constructed segments using music, sound bites, and grief empathy, with no context other than narrated, scripted ideas.</p>

<p>It cherry picks pieces of the &quot;official story&quot; that it claims are soooo fabricated, but doesn&#39;t talk about the other parts. Is the whole Official Report a lie? What parts of the official story are true? The rest of it? Can we acknowledge those parts?</p>

<p>There are definitely odd parts of the story, coincidences and unexplained phenomenon. Coupled with the fact that the Government is refusing to release a lot of seemingly benign evidence.</p>

<p>But Jesus Fucking Christ just because you have a few mildly interesting unanswered questions that are not fully explained, it DOESN&#39;T give evidence towards a global conspiracy.</p>

<p>Asking questions is good. It&#39;s great, even.</p>

<p>Making claims intertwined with the questions is idiotic unless you have official documentation literally proving your claim. And adding ominous, sad, or otherwise emotionally charged music, selective evidence and slick editing is a choice by the filmmaker to obscure truth.</p>

<p>All of the anecdotal evidence is just that: what one person said. How&#39;s that different from what the President said? The report said?</p>

<p>Can we all just acknowledge that we don&#39;t know what happened on 9/11 without instantly concluding every single plot hole proves THE SAME conspiracy?</p>

<p>TL;DR - This film is just one collection of ideas. It is subjective and he has an agenda. Don&#39;t lose your heads and jump to conclusions. Digest the information and then read more, think more, verify the info if you can. Most importantly entertain other explanations for the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this phone call was a part I liked in the film since it&#39;s direct evidence uncut. Very compelling stuff, but let&#39;s use a skeptical alternative explanation as an exercise.</p>

<p>Her delivery is undeniably calm and together, but I don&#39;t know her. Is this odd for her normal behavior? And even if it was, people handle situations differently. Shock and confusion act on people differently.</p>

<p>Hearing &quot;it&#39;s a frame&quot; is subjective. I had to listen a few times to catch it, and it&#39;s very chilling - but I also already had the idea primed and was looking for it. I would not have heard it otherwise. This is also how evidence for things like ghosts on Electronic Voice Phenomena is explained.</p>

<p>This is my personal interpretation given my current understanding. Once again we have a case of anecdotal evidence, and need to verify our ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Do you have any evidence that supports the official conspiracy theory involving 19 radical muslims? </p>

<p>Im always surprised to see people accept the official story without much evidence, but then reject lots of evidence that refutes the official story.</p>

<p>Is there some kind of bias toward <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzT10MSgKtU">bubble-headed-bleach-blonde- bimbos on TV news</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still digesting all the ideas presented. I&#39;m about an hour into the second viewing.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t want to make a decision based on the slanted presentation of a single film.</p>

<p>Gotta be honest, back in high school I believed in the 9/11 conspiracy hook, line and sinker. Similar arguments were made back then (10ish years ago) and they&#39;ve just been tweaked over the years.</p>

<p>The flimsiest evidence has been dropped (thermite, missile striking the Pentagon, etc), but the same ideas are repeated. Cell phones, drones, planned demolition, and so on. I&#39;ve heard it before.</p>

<p>I made a huge rejection of conspiracies in college when I learned more about the US&#39;s provable crimes against humanity across the globe for the past centuries. Verifiable coups (Iran, Vietnam, Guatemala, etc) and economic slavery are all very compelling and feasible, but staging a live, worldwide, mass media event with hundreds of moving parts timed down to the minute is just on an entirely different scale.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying conspiracy is impossible, or that the Official Report is all true.</p>

<p>I have doubts about everything, and that tells me to reserve claims.</p>

<p>Except none of the &quot;skeptics&quot; has a better explanation for things like why molten metal burned under the WTC wreckage for like 8 weeks, or how a dude that couldn&#39;t fly a cessna by himself could perform a perfect hit on the Pentagon that a seasoned pilot simply could never do.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because it&#39;s not what happened. You might as well bring out the old chestnut &quot;EVERYONE WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE IN ON IT&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most compelling story against the &quot;inside job&quot; is just how logistically impossible wiring the buildings would be.  I read analysis that it would take a team of the best demotion people 6 months to a year to properly wire up the Twin Towers, in excess of maybe 1000 people in total.  They&#39;d have to do it at night, and in such a way that they left zero evidence in the morning or where seen at night.  Then, none of those 1000&#39;s of people could have remorse after seeing the firemen and police die, and all the innocents, and come clean.  Not one.  It&#39;s just so implausible.  People who believe this are like kids who don&#39;t understand the complexities of large projects.

<p>You had me till this.  Plea to authority is bullshit.  People with &quot;valid authority&quot; are those selected as &quot;proper&quot; by the people that accept their views.  A &quot;valid authority&quot; almost always has something you can challenge in their history to discount their view.  Which is why a call to authority is pointless. </p>

<p>I feel there&#39;s quite a lot of evidence to the contrary of that report, and it greatly deserves the criticism and skepticism it has and will hopefully continue to receive. </p>

<p>See what I did there? Not a fact, because as much as I&#39;d like to think so, we really don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>That being said, I love watching the kinds of videos posted in the OP; they&#39;re great for getting the right kinds of information (the kind that helps expose the discrepancies in the &quot;official&quot; report) out there. That doesn&#39;t mean that I wouldn&#39;t watch a similar video from the opposing side with any less interest. </p>

<p>No. We do know. 503 firefighters showed up to testify on the day of the eyewitness hearings. They were forcibly removed and their testimony was intentionally left out: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwQa5eokieY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwQa5eokieY</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s a lie of omission. Is it not?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are right about listening to both sides though. For a really long time I thought all these &quot;truthers&quot; were fucking nut bags. After a few friends and family members kept on me about it, I decided I needed to prove them wrong. I would sit down, read the 911 Commission Report, and then be able to debunk all of their bullshit. But when I sat down and started to read the report, my heart sank. I knew it was all lies. The whole thing was a fucking fraud. And now I know the truth.</p>

<p>But, yes, everyone should be able to have a rational debate and hear each other out without being crazy. Here&#39;s a pretty good one: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARVeKNasLXw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARVeKNasLXw</a></p>

<p>Judging from your most recent edit to the OP, I doubt you&#39;ve read my other posts in this thread, and that&#39;s fine, why should you?</p>

<p>Just understand. I&#39;m not claiming anything in your list is incorrect or correct. I&#39;m simply pointing out that anyone on either side of this argument who calls their POV &quot;irrefutable&quot; is in the wrong no matter what. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not about to google facts to disprove your OP, because I agree with a solid 60% of them, I just want to point out that your title in the OP comes across as saying &quot;I&#39;m right, you&#39;re wrong lalalalala&quot; while sticking your fingers in your ears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indestructible as much as the Titanic is unsinkable. You can google about them and read about it. They are designed to survive, but it isn&#39;t impossible to be destroyed either.</p>

<p>Flight 77 and 93 were found.</p>

<p>Flight 11 and 175 in the towers, were probably still in the building when it collapsed. </p>

<p>Generally the best place to survive a plane crash, a conventional one that crashes into the ground, the tail usually survives. Cuz it is in the back and it works like the crumple zone in your car. Everything in front, including squishy people cushion it. </p>

<p>Things pilots generally do when they know they are about to crash:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the pilots slow down</p></li>
<li><p>they do everything they can to stay in the air</p></li>
<li><p>they try not to hit the ground very hard</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So there are usually large parts left over.</p>

<p>Terrorists on the other hand, fly maximum power into things. So smaller pieces. Things do survive, but they aren&#39;t very large. There are personal effects of passengers(credit cards, wallets, jewelry, even a paper wedding invitation) that survived too. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they had the collapse of a 110 story building in mind when they designed the blackbox. </p>

No one even knew we were under attack until the second plane hit.  Afterwards, there were reports of many supposed hijackings as the skies were closed and planes were attempting to land.  The military was &quot;intercepting&quot; a plane which had already crashed into the WTC at one point.  </p>

I, however, don&#39;t believe they collapsed at all. These towers got turned into dust in mid air and laid down a 3 INCH thick layer of dust over Manhattan from river to river.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the towers didn&#39;t collapsed at all. They got obliterated.</p>

After years of fighting with Insurance companies and spending millions on lawyers he finally was able to eek out a couple million more in insurance than he had paid for the buildings a few months before the attacks.  Now consider what 13+ years of rent in two of the most valuable commercial properties in the world are worth. Billions.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not even that they have 85 tapes that match the query of the FOIA request; it&#39;s that they had 85 tapes that potentially matched the query request.  The query request was very narrow: only videos showing the impact of Flight 77 at the Pentagon were requested.</p>

<p>What the FBI did was review the 85 tapes that might potentially contain such footage and determine that only one video (the security gate system that contained two cameras) showed the impact.  The FBI thus disclosed only one tape.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorists simply wrote their FOIA request too narrowly to get the 85 tapes.  And now no one can explain to me why they do not write a broader FOIA request since they have had years to review the list in the Maguire Declaration.  Instead, they blame the FBI for giving them only what they requested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it simply does. The documentary <em>proves</em> the narrative is false. Considering this, it&#39;s safe to assume govt/military agents had at least foreknowledge of the attack or allowed it to happen or planned it themselves. You obviously have not seen the documentary.

<p>Intercepting Payne Stewart&#39;s Leer-Jet took 35 minutes. At 9:33 am (EDT) the air traffic controller attempted unsuccessfully to contact Payne Stewart&#39;s Lear jet. &quot;Pentagon officials said the military began its pursuit of the ghostly civilian aircraft at 10:08 am.&quot; In total, 10 military jets and one refueling tanker were sent up to escort Stewart&#39;s jet to crash in a sparsely populated area of the country. In the last 30 years there have been 682 hijackings in the US which have been responded to in accordance with appropriate FAA procedures. In the calendar year prior to 9/11, fighter aircraft were successfully scrambled on 56 occasions in response to such emergencies within minutes.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t. But it does mean that there is no more plausible explanation available. Inconsistencies in a theory do not &quot;disprove&quot; the theory. EVERY theory has inconsistencies. People can, and do, argue against the theory of evolution by doing exactly what this video does. Could the theory of evolution be incorrect? Sure. Why isn&#39;t it widely discounted in the face of these inconsistencies? Because it is by far the most plausible explanation for the phenomena being observed. </p>

<p>The question is which theory is more plausible. Which theory provides the most likely explanation. This is how theories work. This is how we move on from old theories and adopt new theories. You can call it disingenuous if you want, and kick and scream about how it&#39;s unfair, but this is how it works, in every occasion that a theory is dropped. </p>

<p>To the extent that the truther movement chooses to ignore this necessity, they will be ignored by the people who matter. Propose a concise and internally consistent theory of your own, or the existing theory remains the only plausible option. End of story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said in another post. Reaction time since 9/11 has drastically changed. As has the identification of a hijacked aircraft.</p>

<p>No longer is it a chain of 10+ individuals at an FAA facility before it reaches FAA HQ. Only to be disseminated to the military liaison and ran ttlhrough another 10+ people before the orders to scramble are given to the Alert pilots. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Nowadays its quick. One air traffic controllers <em>suspects</em> a hijacking and DC is notified. Alert jets scrambled within ~8min.</p>

<hr/>

<p>JB Andrews, the base you speak of in DC, is a cargo base whose primary airframes are to move high level brass (leerjets, citations,  boeing bbj). The F16 squadron there is air national guard and not on manned 24/7.</p>

<p>The next closest base to DC is Dover AFB... they have C17s and C5s... no fighters...</p>

<p>From Mass. To DC is 270nm straightline. The f15 will cruise at 750kts low level (below FL250)... so 20mins ish to get there.</p>

<hr/>

<p>And those 24 jets are always ready to go. From the time the order comes to scramble (iirc) theyre to be airborn within 4minutes. Not each of the 24, but regionally, why scramble CA jets for an eastern seaboard thing makes no sense...</p>

<p>The pilots change out every 8hrs or so, and there is always a maintenance and ammo team with each jet. </p>
