<p>1)Who upvoted this?</p>

<p>2) Why don&#39;t you upvote actual conspiracy posts, such as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xghku/new_snowden_leak_british_government_shills_pose/">this one about British Government shills?</a> (serious question. I&#39;m just wondering why leaked documents proving government shills posing as hackers and honey traps isn&#39;t interesting to the people here.)</p>

<p>3) What are the odds that somebody is fucking with the votes here in order to routinely, almost on a daily basis, discredit this sub? The top comment in that shitty top post debunks the post. This happens all the time with the top post, especially if it&#39;s an image. Could it be that someone used a program with a bunch of fake accounts to keep that shit post up there for a while so we can all &quot;see how shitty this sub is?&quot; That goes to the front page of every subscriber...200,000 people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I dont hide it. I brows both, though I almost never vote on either. I think that is only fair. It&#39;s better to see both sides of a sub. I tend to focus more on comments than posts.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say for sure for sure that there is no form of brigading, but I can say there is no way it is on a large enough scale to bring it to the front page.</p>

<p>Frankly, I dont think either of the the subs are very good. They are both diluted, with pretty standard internet crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said it was a government agent. It could be a pissed off troll or a pissed off Israeli. We talk a lot of shit about Israel and we&#39;ve had a ton of attacks before, including one that was publicly admitted to. </p>

<p>But we could talk about the possibility of a government agent messing with this sub. Would you say government agents are on big subs like r/worldnews? What do they do when they don&#39;t have much work? Perhaps they mess with this sub as well, especially considering the content. This isn&#39;t a small group of people. The comments, yes. But the top post gets fed to 200,000 people. All I&#39;m talking about is a guy using a program to jump a shit post to the top of our sub everyday. It would take a minute to completely ruin this sub every day. Is that financially worth it to spread propaganda to 200,000 people using 1 minute of paid labor?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see.  Elaboration:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="/u/IgnoreTheShill">/u/IgnoreTheShill</a> and <a href="/u/serfonomics">/u/serfonomics</a> have the same insane writing style.  You&#39;ve slightly toned it down, so congrats on that I guess, but you still have some of the same habits.</p></li>
<li><p>Your name is <a href="/u/serfnomics">/u/serfnomics</a>.  I won&#39;t insult you with describing the coincidence between <a href="/u/serfonomics">/u/serfonomics</a> and your name.</p></li>
<li><p>You just brought up a two month old posting and comment thread using the same argument that <a href="/u/IgnoreTheShill">/u/IgnoreTheShill</a> used.</p></li>
<li><p>Your account is only a month old, and you mainly post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Proof?  We both know I can&#39;t prove it; I can only look at the facts and happy little coincidences and draw my own conclusions from there.</p>

<p>That does not say &quot;The point of being in those subs is to brigade other subs.&quot; </p>

<p>Get it? We are in those subs to get away from a massive influx of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> members flooding in to specific threads, like this one.

<p>The point of me being here is to provide a counter-point to the issue being presented. But I&#39;m labeled as a shill because I disagree.</p>

<p>Take for example the post about the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xezgn/a_chemtrail_activists_facebook_account_has_been/">&quot;chemtrail activist&#39;s Facebook Page being frozen&quot;</a> for posting an image that allegedly showed the inside of a chemtrail aircraft. It was proven in the comments that this was not the case, but the post still made the front page and the comment providing the truth was downvoted. This was followed by several people ignoring the information and instead switching to ad hominem to go after the person that commented outside of the accepted group narrative. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xezgn/a_chemtrail_activists_facebook_account_has_been/cfawny4">Example.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xezgn/a_chemtrail_activists_facebook_account_has_been/cfasr8v">Example.</a></p>

<p>If you want to hang out in subs that have no opposing viewpoint where someone posts some anti-government rhetoric and the rest of the group upvotes him for his efforts, that&#39;s fine. But if you have a public forum like this one, you have to expect that there is going to be someone that disagrees with your position and they should be free to comment on it without being labeled and chastised incessantly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten into this debate before, but honestly a lot of people don&#39;t browse sub specific.  They browse in mass, if they see something they like they don&#39;t bother to check the sub usually and just upvote it.</p>

<p>You can post gore to aww and it&#39;d get upvotes from most of the people that subsribe to wtf and the likes not bothering to check it&#39;s not in the appropiate sub and just assuming that if its not deleted it&#39;s in the appropiate sub.</p>

<hr/>

<p>What you&#39;ve done is create a scapegoat. </p>

<p>This sub, like most others will have terrible, awful submissions hit the front page. It&#39;s just how Reddit is - But to blame the scapegoat without any proof that a vote manipulation is going on... Is just silly. </p>

<p>Rather than accept the fact that this sub and its members are not special, you seem to have decided to believe that this sub is divine, its members heavenly and any submission to your disliking is from a malicious source. Which again, is silly. </p>

<p>If you have proof of vote manipulation then go wild, otherwise try to face the fact that this sub is fundamentally no different than most of the other subs out there. </p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<p>If you look at various subreddits that have had cross-sub drama: <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>, <a href="/r/shitredditsays">/r/shitredditsays</a>, <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a>, <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, <a href="/r/pcmasterrace">/r/pcmasterrace</a>, <a href="/r/MensRights">/r/MensRights</a>, <a href="/r/cringe">/r/cringe</a>, <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> etc. etc. You consistently see the theme of downvotes being used as a form of attack. </p>

<p>There has yet to be a clear case of a trollpost being submitted that has hit the front page, which has received overwhelming opposition by the subs members - Without this proof or any examples, I see no reason yet to believe upvotes are being used to discredit a subreddit. </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s been some really stupid things upvoted here in the past, but that doesn&#39;t mean the upvotes are from a malicious source just because I disagree with it. </p>

<p>Conspiracies are usually built around a backup plan which is to claim incompetence if caught. I used to work at a local pub and my manager instructed me to use cheap beer kegs at the end of the night to replace the expensive beer. The bartender didn&#39;t even know.

<p>But anyway lets go with it, where is the proof that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> upvoted that submission? (Linking to is not evidence alone of vote manipulation)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, why are you in a subreddit that is about theories... asking for proof? You might want to check <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> or something, troll. You&#39;re lost. </p>

<p>That link showed <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> brigading the post in r/conspiracy. It has like 180 ups, which is pretty consistent with the number of members in r/conspiratard, if you accept that a large portion of those ups were from your sub. </p>

<p>The fact that I had to explain this to you proves to me that you are either a troll, or severely retarded. Obviously some of that is fuzzing, but not all of it (not consistent with other posts at net 40). So you can estimate that around 50-100 votes came form r/conspiratard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if someone catches fish, I should not call them a catcher of fish, or even perhaps a fisherman?  Though that would be factually correct in every way?  The truth, in this case, is offensive?</p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t understand.  If someone says &quot;I deny the holocaust&quot; then why would it be considered offensive for me to say &quot;you deny the holocaust&quot;?  I&#39;m literally saying the exact same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re trying to be derogatory and I&#39;m not going to debate this with you.</p>

<p>Firstly I am being called a Holocaust denier simply for suggesting that certain Holocaust lore has been exaggerated, I&#39;m not denying the Holocaust.  And if we were in a social setting where being a fisherman by profession was looked down upon, then it could very well be inappropriate to call someone a fisherman in an attempt to ridicule them.</p>

<p>This debate is over.</p>

They are running out of resources. It&#39;s a lot cheaper to have a bunch of shills to make dis-info than to keep trying and failing to start World War 3.

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re adding more and more material to your reply and not addressing my question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To better explain my objection. And I did address your question. </p>

<p>I used historical tendency and absent proof as why I think vote manipulation to discredit is of the down, not up variety. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but overusing a quote as a basically mandatory response to every conspiracy theory makes it just an annoying string of words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you should instead be considering why it&#39;s used so often, as opposed to being annoyed at its use. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He always said if we were caught, just say you made a mistake. That is why your quote sucks. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Repeat offences like that would not adequately be explained through stupidity, the quote still stands. </p>

<p>Do you have any examples or proof of repeated malicious upvoting, to overcome the adequate possibility of stupidity? </p>
