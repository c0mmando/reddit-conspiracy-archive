       Here's the story. My dad works in Luna County. While he was talking with my mom on the phone at about 10:30 PM MST last night, they heard something like a bump going off on his end. Immediately, the entirety of Luna County went dark. The regular power wasn't the only thing affected; train signals, emergency backup lighting, landline telephones, and AM/FM radio signals were also affected. My dad heard sirens outside, which means the police were mobilized. He got into his truck and rode around. Apparently, there were no cars on the interstate, which is a very strange occurrence. While riding around, my dad saw not only police officers, but also SWAT teams, ambulance crews, Border Patrol officers, and U.S. Army soldiers in field gear, who seemed to be active duty rather than Guardsmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       At about 3:00 AM MST, the power outage ended. The official story was that a transformer blew in the city of Deming. My dad doubts that, as his reasoning is that a blown transformer would only take out a couple of streets, not the entirety of Luna County. His theory is that the military was moving something secret, and they were using the power outage to move it without attracting attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       What could be a possible explanation for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Changed Luna Valley to Luna County. Thanks,

       Sounds like they are training to invade domestic cities. Cut the power and communication And come in strong with force. No one will have time to react or warn neighbouring cities.

       Honestly, that doesn't seem likely. Mobile phones still worked. If they really wanted to invade a city, they would turn off cell towers.

       For the 13 downvotes, y'all need to learn critical thinking skills. Not everything is black &amp; white, not every act of the US government is nefarious. Y'all complain about sheeple and the hivemind, but never question your own bias?! You do see that hypocrisy, no?! No....

       I agree to an extent, there is always two sides to a story whether it be, govermental depopulation, or
 chemtrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is fucked up run by equally fucked up people.
But there is also good, it isn't an black/white contrast sure in some situations but not always.
Not saying you should trust your goverment fully.
Just absorb everything and be open to a couple of scenarios.

       I am confused as to why the dad was the only civilian driving around on the interstate.  If the police/Border Patrol/USA Army were up to something, would they not have stopped him?  Doesn't make sense.

       Stuff like this happens quite often actually in my town, except for the power outages and heavy military presence, but there's been numerous time where the part of the interstate has been blocked off late at night, always in the same spot, with police and military presence forcing me to drive around it in town. I've also seen big green military cargo trucks drive around the city, and on the interstate even in the day. Obviously it didn't make the news, and i searched up yours, nothing there either, but that's the point. This could be happening all around the us and nobody knows about it because it's not being made public by the media. I want to go out and investigate this next time it happens and maybe get a few pics.. just one good picture could make a huge difference.

       Who knows what technology is in these latest models. My HD camera on my cell causes sinus pressure?! My theory is it's 3D mapping every image, so items can be easily edited. Every thing auto backups to the cloud, which could easily analyze, edit and then replace the original, without most users even being aware of it. Plus, geolocation identification.

       Interesting stuff. Was it reported in the local news? Also, do you have a local subreddit where you can ask about it? Or a local webforum?

       I've searched Google, the local news for Deming, and the Facebook page for the Deming Headlight. Nothing. In fact, I can barely find anything about Deming itself, except for the recent anal probing case.

       You need to better understand how to constructively act with other people. I didn't say I was an EMP genius - and neither are you, so quit the cock-measuring contest and provide your own conclusion to the OPs question.

       If they really are moving "fourple top secret stuff", you may want to avoid asking too many questions about it.  It could draw the wrong kind of attention from officialdom.

       Honestly, that doesn't seem likely. Mobile phones still worked. If they really wanted to invade a city, they would turn off cell towers.
