        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s the story. My dad works in Luna County. While he was talking with my mom on the phone at about 10:30 PM MST last night, they heard something like a bump going off on his end. Immediately, the entirety of Luna County went dark. The regular power wasn&#39;t the only thing affected; train signals, emergency backup lighting, landline telephones, and AM/FM radio signals were also affected. My dad heard sirens outside, which means the police were mobilized. He got into his truck and rode around. Apparently, there were no cars on the interstate, which is a very strange occurrence. While riding around, my dad saw not only police officers, but also SWAT teams, ambulance crews, Border Patrol officers, and U.S. Army soldiers in field gear, who seemed to be active duty rather than Guardsmen.</p>

<p>At about 3:00 AM MST, the power outage ended. The official story was that a transformer blew in the city of Deming. My dad doubts that, as his reasoning is that a blown transformer would only take out a couple of streets, not the entirety of Luna County. His theory is that the military was moving something secret, and they were using the power outage to move it without attracting attention.</p>

<p>What could be a possible explanation for this?</p>

<p>EDIT: Changed Luna Valley to Luna County. Thanks, <a href="/u/StoneTheKrow">/u/StoneTheKrow</a>!</p>

<p>The world is fucked up run by equally fucked up people.

    <div class="md"><p>Stuff like this happens quite often actually in my town, except for the power outages and heavy military presence, but there&#39;s been numerous time where the part of the interstate has been blocked off late at night, always in the same spot, with police and military presence forcing me to drive around it in town. I&#39;ve also seen big green military cargo trucks drive around the city, and on the interstate even in the day. Obviously it didn&#39;t make the news, and i searched up yours, nothing there either, but that&#39;s the point. This could be happening all around the us and nobody knows about it because it&#39;s not being made public by the media. I want to go out and investigate this next time it happens and maybe get a few pics.. just one good picture could make a huge difference.</p>
