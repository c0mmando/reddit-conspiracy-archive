    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin offers an escape plan of sorts from crashing the economy.   Also a money launderer&#39;s dream.  </p>

<p>The inception of bitcoin was through an unknown person.   he left the scene when he handed it over to one &#39;Gavin&#39; who we know met with CIA.  </p>

<p>Also, some suspect that bitcoin mining is in reality crowd-sourced hacking of encryption keys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want Bitcoin to work but it never will.</p>

<p>• Bankers can and will crush it by the same ways they manipulate the market and crush opposition </p>

<p>• Multiple times, vast quantities of Bitcoins have been stolen with no legal recourse and no way of knowing if the exchanges orchestrated the theft themselves </p>

<p>• Companies excepting Bitcoin are only doing so to increase sales because of the buzz around it</p>

<p>• It wildy fluctuates making it a gamble to make a big investment in</p>

<p>All of these things can be put down to psychology surrounding the sort of Anarchist wish to rebel by buying Bitcoins and the easy potential for it to manipulated. I understand the legitimate uses for Bitcoin but you&#39;d be naive to think it will flourish and make a true opposition on the global banks monopoly on currency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Care to elaborate? I&#39;m pretty heavily involved in the crypto community and if you are talking about the frequency in which new alternate currencies are being released, it has really spiked since DOGE was released. There are a plethora of coins being released each week, the only negative thing about it, in my opinion, is the lack of innovation and application ( real world potential ) for around 99 percent of the coins being released each day/week. I&#39;m a big advocate of cryptocurrencies and I believe that there is a lot of future in it. If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer. Regards </p>
