       My uncle's a nice guy, but he gets off on these rants about different things.  I'm not the type of guy to say something is wrong unless I know for a fact, but I would like more insight. My uncle sometimes talks about a philosophy called "the children of 64", and "folding numbers into binary"...he talks about a secret group called the "black codes", and is convinced he has "decoded the dead sea scrolls into a transmittable frequency called the voice of God"...which one day will "end life as we know it." I also should add that when he was younger he had a fridge fall on him and destroyed his spine....could that be effecting the way he thinks?   The real thing I want to know if you've ever heard of theses groups, and if anything he says makes sense to you. Thanks for the help in advance.

       64 would have to be code for a particular frequency
I think children would mean that these beings are progeny of this "frequency" or different state of being
Folding numbers into binary might allude to the sexes or opposing energies..
      </p>
      <p>
       black codes is "hidden/magic" "frequencies/states" so that's pretty straight forward.

       Honestly, I've been fooling around with something for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this hub bub? This destruction? This confoundment of the past?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is all related to our evolution and our inherent "divinity" (spirituality, capabilities, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been finding more and more conspiracies seemingly linked to the idea that TPTB do not want humanity to transcend humanity NATURALLY nor SPIRITUALLY. They want us to feel we are trapped, that we have no hope. They want us to think all will be destroyed and that it is inevitable. That they are more powerful. I know that nothing is further from the truth.

       Yes, and the confoundment of the religions/spiritualities of the world, as well as an erasure of history around the globe. Tell me you have SOME idea how much history we may have lost.

       Between the burning of the library in alexandria, egypt, the burning of the sacred texts of the meso americans by the conquistadores, the holy crusades of the knights templar, council of nicea, and the raiding of modern ljbraries in mali and iraq... Id say i have an idea of how much history has been lost. Its truely sad. However, i have a feeling that this knowledge is kept secret by TPTB, and is the reasons for their ulterior motives, or at least implicitly responsible for their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Book burning is quite possibly one of the worst crimes against humanity, amongst other in my opinion.

       I also should add that he mentions the black codes but as a group...a physical organization of people....if that helps...but the voice of God thing is what I really want to know about...one minute he studies the bible like it contains every secret in the world, the next he denounces Christianity saying it's all bullshit...I'd love for that to be explained to me a little further as well.

       A lot of Christians themselves believe that the bible contains hidden codes in the patterns of words
       <a href="http://carm.org/what-biblical-numerology">
        http://carm.org/what-biblical-numerology
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the mainstream numerologists focus on the latin and especially the aramaic and hebrew texts, but there's a lot more opportunity to put out secret codes in THE TRANSLATED TEXT ITSELF - it would be pretty feasible, as a lot of Bibles even have thousands of footnotes, glossaries, inspirational anecdotes, random poems, pictures that seem to look like nothing and everything all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see how with such a mass of different kinds of text in one place it would be easy to slip in secret messages based on counting number patterns, it could be these that your Uncle has been searching for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, there could even be encrypted binary information (like computer programs) hidden in there - check this out, binary data can be encoded in
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">
        Base64
       </a>
       , which can be represented with just numbers (chapter and vera), letters of the alphabet and two other characters (like a comma or a period).Could be your uncle is looking for a message or some other secret data.
      </p>
      <p>
       That makes a lot of sense with some of the other ramblings he's been going on about (children of
       <em>
        64
       </em>
       , folding
       <em>
        numbers
       </em>
       into
       <em>
        binary
       </em>
       and so forth).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible for Christianity to be bullshit, and there still be secret codes in Bibles, in fact you've got to ask your self - if Christianity WERE bullshit, it's MORE likely that there are hidden codes and secret societies.

       Thanks this is very insightful...I actually looked in the Base64 earlier today...I just googled the number 64.  And what you're saying makes plenty of sense...I mean the bible is the most read book around, that's the perfect scenario for a translator who wants to put his own twist on things. The problem I guess is I can't see MY uncle doing all of this.  He's heavily medicated all of the time, makes up words that sound "scientific" , and claims to have all the knowledge in the world of computers, but can't manage to operate one without getting frustrated.

       Hey, remember - it's just a theory made up by a stranger on the internet. :) But it might give you some clues about where to look for the real reasons! The trick is to never stop thinking of things in a different way, and give yourself the freedom to make mistakes and believe wrong things just to see if you can.

       I'm an occult person. I can figure out the symbolism for pretty much anything. I responded to you because I found the symbolism odd and familiar -- it is the same sort of things I use, personally. Euphemisms for frequencies, progeny, etc

       I understood the black codes to be an organization of people, already. I feel that if it is real then perhaps your father knows something about "ETs" being advanced non-terrestrial or extra dimensional beings with ties to earth. This would explain why he sees the book as a clue but the institution of religion bs.

       Wow...very interesting, yeah he's really big on Extra-terrestrials as well, I never thought of including them in this, but if there's any truth in what he talks about then this would be it.  Thanks tons.  If you can recall anything about the black codes I'd love to know more.

       I don't know how much of a Christian or Christianity buff your guy is but Black Codes as an organization or euphemism in religion may actually have to do with the books left out of the bible. Things like the Book of Enoch are very telling of what may have actually been occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: there's evidence that there's been a modern erasure of a "race" of beings who "seeded" the planet -- but they're actually "black" people. Literally. Look up the Global African Presence and Kemetic Science.

       I can see that, the thing is my uncle isn't much on Christianity, or I should say he's always flippy floppy...on one hand he has invested so much time into believing in christ, and on the other hand he denounces judaism and christianity...he's also a very racist person, so I think by black codes he may mean something else because he speaks highly of "them."(the black codes group)

       For what it's worth that's actually BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal), where each digit is encoded as four bits. 0110 = 6, 0100 = 4.

       How did you reach that number?  I only know BCD, so I am curious.

       Interesting enough there are 64 hidden caves with treasure in them mapped out by the dead sea scrolls. Perhaps that is what he is alluding to.

       Yeah, I actually do remember him talking about that...he's very invested in his Dead Sea Scrolls theory, he mentions the "types of metals" the scrolls were printed on, and how they each have a numeric value, well I automatically thought of atomic number, but I wouldn't know for sure.  He actually mentioned something a long the lines of "if you wanted to keep the dead sea scrolls preserved you'd disguise them as something else."  I do know that what he meant by that was that he believes the treasure is a lie used to keep the actual scrolls preserved.  He believes the real value of the scrolls is that they hold a frequency(he actually drew this out...it's like 20 pages long taped together)...he says that frequency can be transmitted and heard by God.

       So far what I've put together is the The Children of 64 could possibly just be another name for the Essenes?  The group of Jews who wrote the Scrolls.

       I've also looked around a bit...around the time before the Dead Sea Scrolls hellenism was spreading through Jerusalem, and I've learned that the Essenes writing shows hellenistic influence.  I also learned that the Essenes practice Exegesis.... Is it possible that the Dead Sea Scrolls are actually a commentary on something from a hellenistic(greek/roman) point of view?    This may be a little off topic but, I hope to tie it in later on down the road.
