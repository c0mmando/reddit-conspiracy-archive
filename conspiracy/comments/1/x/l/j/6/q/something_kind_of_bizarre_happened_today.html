I was asking the Freemason guy doing the AMA some questions while researching online and such. I half jokingly messaged my wife and said &quot;let&#39;s become Freemasons!!&quot; 
Shit you not - this morning her first customer was an old man wearing a hat with Freemason logo on it. She inquired and he talked to her at length about it when she mentioned I was interested. He suggested we join and wants us to come up to his lodge. </p>

<p>What a weird coincidence eh?</p>

They are not a &quot;religion&quot; but they are far far two religious for me - the initiation ceremonies creep me out and I would totally tell my wife every weird thing that happened. I&#39;ll just read a book or something on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A word on religion: our rituals use allegory to teach moral lessons. Those allegories are based in Abrahamic scripture, but we&#39;re not preaching a particular religion. Our members are Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists,  and every other established religion. We&#39;re also members of non-dogmatic faiths like deism (I&#39;m a deist, in fact).</p>

<p>So, don&#39;t read the religious references in our rituals as anything more than  allegorical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, so I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen an appendix describing the cultures and religions that surrounded the early Israelites in other bibles as well. Not shocking.

    <div class="md"><p>It is not a standard KJV bible, period. You can&#39;t tell me the books are the same. They aren&#39;t, and you can clearly see this by comparing the two. The masonic bible has history of freemasonry in it and quotes certain passages of the bible that apparently relate to freemasonry. So it offers a masonic interpretation of the bible, which means it&#39;s not a standard KJV. </p>

<p>The sky is not red, sir. I can clearly see it is blue. The Masonic bible is not the same as a KJV. You would be better off saying the Masonic bible is a masonic interpretation of the KJV, or it is a KJV with added masonic texts and interpretations. Those are more accurate. </p>

<p>As for your reply, history of the Israelites would be a benign addition to the bible, so it wouldn&#39;t really be a different &quot;version.&quot; The Freemasons don&#39;t really have any place in the bible since they come much later. </p>

<p>Imagine another group of people, like furries or some international circus clown union decided to print a KJV bible with their history of their organizations/groups and quoted passages out of the bible and explained those passages and how they relate to clowns or furries. You&#39;re telling me this would be a &quot;standard KJV?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, I really can. The ones I&#39;ve seen (they&#39;re not very popular anymore, as it turns out, and I&#39;ve never seen one in my Lodge) are standard KJV Bibles in terms of the books of the Bible. Every KJV publication I&#39;ve run across has some sort of extra appendices, usually including maps, cultural details, etc. The Masonic KJV is no different in this respect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So it offers a masonic interpretation of the bible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all! Freemasonry has no interest in interpreting anyone&#39;s religion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine another group of people, like furries or some international circus clown union...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would this be a problem? As long as they don&#39;t alter the text, it&#39;s still the KJV. You might not like the group in question, but arguing that because you don&#39;t like them, that their printing of the Bible is somehow a modified version when it&#39;s not is silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freemasonary is a &quot;Society with Secrets&quot; and not a &quot;Secret Society&quot;. The fact remains that unfortunately most lodges are more interested in navel-gazing, cronyism, and performing their &quot;rituals&quot;, instead of their 19th early-20th cent. reformist agenda and philanthropy.</p>

<p>You are obliged to attend their assemblies (usually monthly if I&#39;m correct), and specially in the beginning you are obliged to have a high attendency-rate / commitment.</p>

<p>To radically over-simplify: if your goal is to teach a system of morality, you have to deal with the fact that slightly fewer than half of all human beings are inclined toward dominance displays and violence, even if they successfully subdue those passions. This makes a one-size-fits-all system of morality impractical.</p>

<p>I love the idea of coed and all-female variations on Freemasonry&#39;s approach, but they do not address the same need for me as mainstream Freemasonry.</p>
