       Hear me out: there's a lot this many people can do. If we can just AGREE on a cause and a way to battle that specific cause (petition, fundraising, ect) then we can make a difference rather than arguing about which conspiracy is the best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally: I feel that saving the Earth is the most important thing, because without it, we don't survive. So the unveiling/declassification of all technologies that the US gov't is hiding would be where I draw my line. That includes pointing out all the scientists whom are complicit in oppressing this information.
      </p>

       Any takers?

       Count me in. Personally, I feel the current situation in america is getting worse, and that bad things could happen by the start of summer. America needs not to start a rebellion, but a revolution. I hope more people get involved in this because i do want to see all of us having a nice, clean debate on what we should ultimately battle. I just don't want to see a bunch of arguments on how someones opinion is stupid. You're right there is alot of us, we could make a difference in whatever we decide on. We need to come together.

       It's not a platitude. How about you read what I said: there are multiple ways to unearth this information. We can attack the governments for classifying it. We can call out the complicit institutions and scientists. We can stop giving a shit that organizations/individuals have bought the patents on technologies that can save the world and we can start MAKING THEM. There are those among us -- and in numbers -- who are capable of moving this forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       With numbers, much is possible. That is no platitude, that's a fact. It's the weak wills of this world that make it harder.

       If all of Tesla's confiscated blueprints were made public, I'm willing to bet the world could be changed in a week's time. What billionaire wouldn't want to fund anti-gravity (not confirmed, but it's Tesla we're talking about) or wireless energy distribution?
      </p>
      <p>
       Billionaires are willing to donate some huge percentage of their wealth to charity, why not invest in world-changing tech for future generations? That sounds way more philanthropic.

       The world woukd definately be a changed place in no time at all, if all of teslas technologies were to be revealed. Btw, the free energy distribution, thats a thing now. I meam, tesla proved it, beyond a doubt, but it took unitl just recently for someone else to do something with it. Albeit, i dont think they gotten far at all when it comes to offering this to the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, as for the billionaires, i woukdnt say they give a large percentage of their wealth to chairty. Theybgive a lot, but even ten million dollars is just one percent of one billion, which is not a large percentage by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue is that someone somewhere has to want to capitalize on these sorts of technologies. The fact that they dont tells me someone is paying them more money than they woukd make with the new technologies, to not capitalize on the new technokogies. Look at the free energy thing. All the energy companies, big oil, big coal, the nuclear guys, etc., they all might be paying dividends to younger entrepeneurs who need money and are close to offering this as a viable source for the public. Yet, before they succeed, the money might be coming in, the money theyve needed for a long time, and the only thing they have to do is stop. I admit im speculating here. But it seems reasonable as an explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all about money. About returns on investments. nothing philanthropic about that. But i agrer with you, should one nix the paradigm and actually finish something they believe in, maybe offer a few tens of millions to thisbsort of research, maybe we wont even need teslas blueprints. Regardless, it would be a better place.

       The billionaire thing I was referring to was related to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Pledge">
        The Giving Pledge
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Huffington Post reported in April 2012 that "81 billionaires committed to giving at least half of their fortunes to charity". As of February 2014, 122 billionaire individuals, couples and one family group have signed the pledge.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I do believe also that new inventors are being paid to stop their research. I just imagine that BIll Gates might just halt the malaria thing and maybe help provide something needed to give those people access the technology to better their lives which in return would help the malaria problem as a consequence and not be the objective itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The investing part can be argued, since Tesla's patents would be public domain, there would be too much competition to turn a viable profit, or the cost of the tech would be significantly cheaper due to massive competition among the producers of the new technology.
      </p>

       About the billionairre thing: forgive me for my ignorance. This pledge is news to me. That certainlh restores just a little bit more faith in the wealthy for me. Even if its just a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, tesla. Even if there was a great deal of competition amongst investors, i feel it is still the way to go. Hell, if the government woukd jump aboard the tesla train, they coukd subsidize the technologies instead of subsidizing nonrenewable resources, and could maybe install a sort of temporary cap (on the low end) to make sure the technologies are successful during the transition of paradigms between todays technologies and teslas. Once a sizable portion of the population has adopted the new paradigm, and his technologies become commonplace, the mere fact that it would be the demand would allow investors to stay afloat, even amongst great competition. (Id like to reference the fast food industry, great competition, yet they all still make it work, though this is in decline due to the great recession, apparantly).
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, everyone would have to work together on this. Ditch the whole climate change bullshit (not saying it is or isnt real, im talking about the bullshit in how to "fix" it, i.e. carbon tax and carbon credits and whatnot...).

       I also believe the transition from the old to the new would still rub some leaders of industry the wrong way. The dispute between oil and electric is a good example. The auto industry would have to invest massively to make the switch with no outlook on returns since it's a new enterprise. So it's better to resist than invest.
      </p>
      <p>
       What could change this is adoption on a massive scale, something the release of the patents would definitely bring about.

       Yes, I have watched this subreddit from a variety of view points. I have been a believer, a non-believer, a skeptic, a nihilist. Time and time again the lack of imagination and willfulness in these matters disappoints me. I am no longer confused by it. I believe we are (or have been seeing) the beginning of a split in humanity.

       So by being tired from waking up and saying I had brain fog I acted as if I had smoked weed. You are pulling things straight out your ass to impose your opinion which IMO is shit. Also I don't know how I inferred I am here to save the world? lol

       Very shilly statement, and let me tell you why: there has to be a transitional period from one era to the next. We are not going to go from everyone working with currency to suddenly free energy for everyone. There are systems that work. We need to use all of them, capitalism or not. There are ways to be "for the next step" without dragging all the dung in behind us.

       That's not going to work. Don't act like humanity hasn't accumulated skills and knowledge that can get us out of this situation.

       You know we aren't focused on that because it's your people who switch people's attention.
