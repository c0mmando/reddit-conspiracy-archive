    <div class="md"><p>Many don&#39;t understand the importance of what you posted so I will do a TL;DR to help your cause and add another 911 &quot;proof&quot; and some bonuses of my own.</p>

<p>First; This all means that the speeds that the airplane achieved would have destroyed the airplane if it really was the one that we were told, but not a military airplane that is built to withstand higher forces.</p>

<p>Second, here is my 911 &quot;proof&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rdi34/i_know_911_is_old_news_but_here_is_a_vid_taken/cdm9g10">Explosion flashes were caught on camera before and during the first WTC collapse.</a></p>

<p>Third, here are my bonuses:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7mDXHn_byA&amp;amp;t=1109">Pentagon security cameras were tampered with to either hide or show a faked(?) airplane.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pvksy/what_conspiracy_turned_you_into_a_conspiracy/cd6m422">Flight 93 was completely destroyed, somehow there were still 2 calls on that airplane that remained connected for hours.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://911blogger.com/node/13272">Turner Construction company &quot;upgraded&quot; the almost exact floor levels where the airplanes hit and where the collapse initated.</a></p>

<p>That same company <a href="http://www.stadium.org/news/171.asp">helped plan and oversee</a> a <strong>top down demolition</strong> of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJQRK0JjH70">Seattle Kingdome in 2000</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Construction_Company#Major_projects">And that same company also participated in the collection and disposal of the WTC wreckage.</a></p>

<p>Hope this is enough.</p>

<p>It&#39;s grade ten level physics, and less, both the towers&#39; destruction as well as this plane during it&#39;s approach through impact with the south tower and both of them taken together are absolutely devastating to the official story narrative compliments of Philip D. Zelikow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What i meant was this is another set of grade 10 level physics, which, when taken together with the grade 10 level physics for the observations involved in the destruction of the twin towers and building 7, forms a viable alternative hypothesis in terms of effects from causes. </p>

<p>CD of the buildings doesn&#39;t really make sense in the context of the original planes successfully hijacked and then flown by the hijackers and is highly suggestive, even emphatically so, of the idea that those planes really were planes-as-missiles. What this evidence provides, is absolute incontrovertible and unequivocal proof that this was the case.</p>

<p>The debunkers are also skeptics, many of them, which requires serious skepticism and scrutiny of ALL information, which cannot begin with only one fundamental presumption, namely that the official story is true, if it really isn&#39;t and cannot be believed in light of all information and phenomenon according to the proper use of Occam&#39;s Razor. I mean they could try to throw up sand in everyone&#39;s faces, but it won&#39;t work for very long since we&#39;re only dealing in facts here, both in regards to the planes as well as in regards to the explosive demolition of the buildings themselves, which is really self evident where MOST (not all) people can clearly see it for themselves and i have faith in that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is it is physically possible. The argument about all these standards for speed were made with normal operation in mind. Not that they couldn&#39;t handle it at all. </p>

<p>Flying that fast makes the components fail faster, not that it would disintegrate the plane if it reached those speeds.</p>

<p>In normal operation parts are changed out every x amount of miles. If you went past those speeds talked about, they would wear faster. So that would be why it would be inherently dangerous. Reaching those speeds for a short amount of time doesn&#39;t mean you would not tear the wings off. It means you would stress the plane beyond those normal flying limits. </p>

<p>Not that it is impossible for the plane to stay in the air past those speeds.</p>

<p>I see Occam&#39;s razor referenced constantly, SO much so that I have come to strongly suspect that many people do not understand what it is and when to apply it. Occam&#39;s razor is not equivalent to the idea that &quot;perfection is simplicity&quot;. In the scientific method, Occam&#39;s razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic, and certainly not a scientific result, nor is it a method by which we derive scientific facts themselves. Occam&#39;s Razor is not intended to be a definitive proof or methodology. Rather, all it says is that there is a tendency where often, the less complicated explanations are generally the right ones.  <strong><em>It is not a substitute for research, nor is it a reliable way to make decisions</em></strong>, in and of itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you need your eyes checked you can clearly see the debris falling faster.</p>

<p>&quot;the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards. Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon.&quot;</p>

<p>But again things falling down will push air out sideways as its the path of least resistance the air cannot go through the floor below</p>

<p>&quot;As stated in Section 6.14.4 of NIST NCSTAR 1, <strong>the falling mass of the building compressed the air ahead of it</strong>—much like the action of a piston—forcing smoke and debris out the windows as the stories below failed sequentially.
These puffs were observed at many locations as the towers collapsed. In all cases, they had the appearance of jets of gas being pushed from the building through windows or between columns on the mechanical floors. Such jets are expected since the air inside the building is compressed as the tower falls and must flow somewhere as the pressure builds. It is significant that similar “puffs” were observed numerous times on the fire floors in both towers prior to their collapses, perhaps due to falling walls or portions of a floor. Puffs from WTC 1 were even observed when WTC 2 was struck by the aircraft. These observations confirm that even minor overpressures were transmitted through the towers and forced smoke and debris from the building.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Video evidence also showed unambiguously that the collapse progressed from the top to the bottom, and there was no evidence (collected by NIST or by the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority Police Department, or the Fire Department of New York) of any blast or explosions in the region below the impact and fire floors as the top building sections (including and above the 98th floor in WTC 1 and the 82nd floor in WTC 2) began their downward movement upon collapse initiation. 
In summary, NIST found no corroborating evidence for alternative hypotheses suggesting that the WTC towers were brought down by controlled demolition using explosives. NIST also did not find any evidence that missiles were fired at or hit the towers. Instead, photographs and videos from several angles clearly show that the collapse initiated at the fire and impact floors and that the collapse progressed from the initiating floors downward until the dust clouds obscured the view.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The capability to conduct rigorous simulations of the aircraft impact, the growth and spread of the ensuing fires, and the effects of fires on the structure is a recent development. Since the approach to structural modeling was developed for the NIST WTC investigation, the technical capability available to the PANYNJ and its consultants and contactors to perform such analyses in the 1960s would have been quite limited in comparison to the capabilities brought to bear in the NIST investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>What about wtc7? That one also didn&#39;t achieve free-fall speeds, right? </p>

<p>&quot;oh, that one did BUT it&#39;s ok because NIST said it was compatible with their  faked model&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT: The user above felt it was a good thing to add a shit ton more information long after I had already replied so here is my reply to that addition:</p>

<p>Quoting NIST on an unproved and &quot;looks like the real thing&quot; model is not by any means a good form of argumentation. Just because it is in a book doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, they didn&#39;t even tested wether the floors could cause the &quot;squibs&quot;. Not even NIST dared to explain why did the buildings completely collapsed, for fucks sakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Physics! The upper portions of the towers didn&#39;t have enough weight/energy/inertia to collapse the bottom two-thirds/three-quarters of the unharmed/untouched towers. It&#39;s just that simple. Energy from the top portions will be absorbed by the remaining unharmed portions as it drops and when that energy has met the resistance of the bottom portions the falling section should have tumbled off the remaining, still standing lower sections. You could probably experiment with this at home. Also gigantic portions of steel structure weighing thousands of pounds are found embedded in buildings hundreds of feet away. Physics has an answer for how those heavy structures ended up where they did. Research, but do it with an open mind. The truth does hurt sometimes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t weigh anywhere close to the bottom portion, remember as the top falls energy is transferred to the lower portion. The energy is transferred through the entire structure right down to the foundation (which is set atop bedrock). The lower section is essentially pushing up against the falling section (every action has an equal and opposite reaction~Newton&#39;s third law of motion) thus the top portion&#39;s energy will be opposed and dissipated by the lower portion within the same or less amount of floors of the top section. 
Remember, as the top section falls into the lower section it is already losing energy. So that brings us to the only logical answer, the bottom sections had to have been weakened  somehow in order for the upper section to fall through each and every floor WITHOUT RESISTANCE!!</p>

<p>Would you or any other 767 pilot dive the plane at 650 (low-balling) knots? Do you think all the control surfaces would function properly, if at all, at that dive speed on a 767?</p>

<p>Heres a case for Lauda Air B767, with PW4000 engines. I&#39;m assuming its the same engine that was in the 911 event, but I&#39;m unsure. - <a href="http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de/publications/Incidents/DOCS/ComAndRep/LaudaAir/LaudaRPT.html">http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de/publications/Incidents/DOCS/ComAndRep/LaudaAir/LaudaRPT.html</a></p>

<p>2.2.1 and 2.2.2 are the relevant sections. Further down in section 3.1 describes findings (point 5) due to engine thrust reversal deployment EEC memory showed a jump in airpseed from mach 0.78 to 0.99. (Point 6) Verbatim - &quot;The scatter of wreckage indicated that the airplane experienced in-flight breakup at a steep descent angle and low altitude.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: From what I can gather from the report is the engine thrust reversal was deployed midflight (due to a crazy set of mechanical circumstances) while accelerating and climbing. This caused the aircraft to dive and reach speeds close to mach1, at which point the airframe failed. Is this reasonable?</p>

 This is a EAS of 443 knots and is 23 knots above Vd for the 767.
Going that fast, pulling that G with severe twisting moments being applied to the tail section, the aircraft DID NOT break up in flight.
The NTSB report is very clear on that. To say otherwise is going directly against the NTSB report and ignores the fact that after the CVR and FDR shutdown due to loss of electrical power, EA990 was observed on radar climbing to 25,000 feet before commencing it terminal dive.
The 767 is a very strong design. While this data does not prove that an EAS of 510 knots was achievable, it does set the benchmark for what a 767 can survive without structural failure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other thing to remember is that VD is not the physical structural limit speed. It is a number based on FAA/JAA test requirements specifically a percentage over the cruising speed of the aircraft in question. Test pilots are not required to fly to VD, but instead must fly to a speed usually half-way between VMO and VD, called Vdf or Max demonstrated speed. Whether or not Boeings tests pilots actually flew to VD... I cannot find that answer, but they did on the 747. Read Handling the Big Jets by D.P. Davies for an account of that. </p>

<p>To sum up, VD speed comes from certification rules. It is not a structural limit. Above that speed has not been cleared by test pilots during the certification process, so normal flight characteristics are not guaranteed.</p>

<p>I fly the A330. It has a VMO of 330 knots. Finding the VD/MD is difficult but I have found a reference that quotes it at 365 CAS/M.93 which gels with the Certification requirements. </p>

<p>In the A330 flight manual however, it talks of reversions of flight laws at extreme values. One of those values is an airspeed above 440 knots, which is 75 knots above VD. Clearly Airbus don&#39;t believe that VD is a structural limit. Neither should anyone else.</p>

<p>Below I reproduce the FAR part 25 reference which discusses how VD is derived, specifically FAR part 25.335 (b) which states:</p>

<p>(b) Design dive speed, VD. VD must be selected so that VC/ MC is not greater than 0.8 VD/ MD,or so that the minimum speed margin between VC/MC and VD/MD is the greater of the following values:</p>

<p>(1) From an initial condition of stabilized flight at VC/ MC,the airplane is upset, flown for 20 seconds along a flight path 7.5° below the initial path, and then pulled up at a load factor of 1.5 g (0.5 g acceleration increment). The speed increase occurring in this maneuver may be calculated if reliable or conservative aerodynamic data is used. Power as specified in §25.175(b)(1)(iv) is assumed until the pullup is initiated, at which time power reduction and the use of pilot controlled drag devices may be assumed;</p>

<p>(2) The minimum speed margin must be enough to provide for atmospheric variations (such as horizontal gusts, and penetration of jet streams and cold fronts) and for instrument errors and airframe production variations. These factors may be considered on a probability basis. The margin at altitude where MC is limited by compressibility effects must not less than 0.07M unless a lower margin is determined using a rational analysis that includes the effects of any automatic systems. In any case, the margin may not be reduced to less than 0.05M.</p>

<p>Is a way of saying, &#39;If you fly it this fast things may (or may not) fall off, the structure may (or may not) fail the plane may (or may not) suffer damage.  If you fly slower then that (inside the enevolope) NONE OF THOSE THINGS WILL HAPEN.&#39;.</p>

<p>And the thing is, the joke really, is that the pilot didn&#39;t give a rats ass about the envelope because he was just gonna slam it into the side of a building anyways.</p>

<p>Something else, you talked about controlling a Cessna.
Anyone can fly a plane of any type straight and level.  Performing a coordinated turn really isn&#39;t that much higher skill wise then flying straight and level.
If you have a GPS, you just follow what it tells you to do.  There are not even roads or ramps to worry about.  If it wants you to turn left, you turn left.</p>

<p>I mean, this isn&#39;t how you are taught, but it would work.
You are badly overestimating the amount of skill these guys needed in order to do this.</p>

<p>Remember: they had flight training.  They had simulator training.</p>

<p>Except that at least one of them was considered unfit to even fly a cessna solo, let alone a 60ton comercial airplane, which according to the official story, he did.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s also the aspect of all 4 airplanes being hijacked because the terrorists pointed box cutters. Box cutters, for christ sake, were enough to get the pilots off the commands. Pilots, that know very well what means handing the airplane to terrorists and would rather let the crew be killed than allowing their airplane be turned into a killing machine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same thing as hijacking an airplane with a pointy pen.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think that, but not yet, I am curious to know what the VMO of that aircraft is. Because it is one thing to say that even the NASA shuttle can break sound barrier, another is saying that it went past 100mph of it&#39;s maximum resistance limit.</p>

<p>In the case of TWA 841, the NTSB Report states that the airplane reached a max speed of .96 Mach at 31,800 feet, exceeding it&#39;s Mmo of .90 Mach by .06 Mach or about 30 knots over it&#39;s Vmo/Mmo. </p>

<p>For the following airspeed calculation, please note the EAS or Equivalent Airspeed.. (near sea level) </p>

NSTB report 
<a href="http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR81-08.pdf">http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR81-08.pdf</a></p>

<p>EAS is sea level airspeed. As a factoral expression of the equivalent dynamic pressures on an airframe at low vs. high altitude, because the air is so much thicker at sea level, there is an airspeed appropriately titled &quot;Equivalent Airspeed&quot; or EAS. 
The air is thinner at higher altitudes so the aircraft will need to go faster to match the amount of air hitting the airframe at low altitudes, in thick air. </p>

<p>EAS is defined as: 
EAS is the airspeed at sea level which produces the same dynamic pressure acting on the airframe as a True Airspeed at higher altitudes. It is used for determining aircraft performance, structural integrity.. .etc. The Vd limit is expressed in an EAS. In other words, to be more specific, 510 knots at sea level (EAS) would produce the same dynamic pressure as 722 knots True Airspeed (TAS) at 22,000 feet. </p>

<p>All of the above, the ones that you completely ignored while attacking the &quot;Vmo premise&quot;.</p>

<p>Plus, NIST only has a theory, nothing else, without any evidence at all to even prove one of their claims.</p>

<p>We, however, have all the demolitions and the history of...wait a second, I already told someone this. Yeah, here it is:</p>

You, being such an expert on airplane piloting and what can and cannot be possible, know that the &quot;terrorists&quot; that couldn&#39;t even fly a cessna managed to hit with <a href="http://911blogger.com/sites/default/files/Correlation2-thumb.jpg">absolute precision the floors that were &quot;upgraded&quot;</a> months before?

    <div class="md"><p>You make it sound like I am suggesting that at 1 or 2 knots over the Vd design dive limit, which btw can only be achieved for such aircraft types, in a dive, that the plane will explode in midair, although that said, there is no single precedent in the history of aviation of an unmodified aircraft of that type, exceeding it&#39;s Vd limit by more than 5 knots and surviving - whereas what we have in this case is a plane retaining perfect flight control with deft maneuvering while travelling at NINETY knots over that limit. </p>

<p>This is without precedent in the history of aviation. That&#39;s a fact. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it&#39;s an issue as much of flight control, as it is structural failure, and on that note, an issue of successful piloting whereby at that airspeed the control surfaces and the controls in the cabin become unmanageable. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not only impossible, unless severely modified for the plane to fly in perfect flight control at that airspeed, but to be piloted by a pilot no more skilled or experienced than Hani Hanjour who allegedly flew the Pentagon plane, at 80 knots over Vd while pulling something like 3 g&#39;s, without making so much as a mark on the grass all the way up to the ground floor impact area where at that speed, the entire Pentagon wall is like a small sliver of a target.</p>

<p>On some commercial airliners there&#39;s literally a big circle with wings and a little circle on a screen with your horizons and alt/speeds up in the corners.

<p>Even without the HUD, the hard part is doing the math to figure out your route. After that it&#39;s just watching the dials to stay on the heading, alt, and airspeed you decided on.</p>

<p>Pilots with 1000&#39;s of hours of flight time on other aircraft types who were training on the UA simulator were unable to hit the target at speeds approaching the Vmo (not the Vd), and could not do so until they slowed down to near approach speeds.</p>

<p>• Two weeks before the Sept. 11 attack, Davis said, FBI agents returned to Norman seeking information about another Airman student, a French-Moroccan dropout who had entered the country on a visa sponsored by the flight school. The man, Zacarias Moussaoui, had been detained in Eagan, Minn., on an immigration violation after he tried to purchase time on a jet simulator -- even though he had never flown solo in a single-engine aircraft.</p>

Turning off the autopilot.
Turning off the transponder.
Operating the radio. 
Flying straight and level, changing altitudes, course corrections and using a GPS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so to clarify on my model (P51D - I like WW2 birds) Over certain speeds, my ailerons lose functionality. Due to a whole bunch of aerodynamic control surface area math I don&#39;t fully understand, or make a claim to. I still have rudder and elevator, but ailerons get muddy. It being RC I can easily increase the throw of the ailerons which does help. I don&#39;t imagine its easy or even common practice to do that on 767s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With RC planes (and smaller planes too) you develop a pocket of dead air on the leading edge of your aircraft the faster you go. The faster you go, the bigger the pocket.</p>

<p>This becomes a HUGE problem on straight wing aircraft such as cessnas and your P51. The wing surface is very small and it takes very little to make that pocket extend PAST the trailing edge of the wings where the ailerons are.</p>

<p>Youll notice that large craft dont have this issue due to much larger wings, and small fast aircraft (like fighter jets) either have ailerons close to the fuselage where pockets develop more slowly, or they have wing designs that put ailerons further from the leading edge of the plane (high taper, swept wings, delta wings)</p>

<p>The tradeoff is that straighter wings like on your P51 allow for MUCH better maneuvering at slower speeds, where as swept wing ls and delta wings ( like on airliners and fighter craft) allow for better handling at higher speeds.</p>

<p>Flying a small cessna at higher speeds is difficult, dangerous, and much more difficult than steering a large aircraft like a 747 at high speeds.</p>

<p>For example if you look at the A-10. It is meant to be very slow, but very agile at those speeds. It has long, straight wigs that crate good lift and stability at slower speeds. At high speeds it is essentially a rocket and fairly unreliable. You start to lose aileron control and there is intense buffeting on the wings.</p>

<p>Commercial airliners typically go hundreds of miles per hour faster than a10s. And rarely will you see an a10 go over 400kn. Where a boeing 737-300 cruises at nearly 500kn, with an approved safe top speed of around 550kn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so the aircraft exceeded Vne (Velocity never exceed) and was still flying. </p>

<p>There have been many incidents of aircraft over speeds and over stresses occurring. </p>

<p>In the 90&#39;s a 747-SP had an inflight upset and during the recovery the airframe sustained a load of almost 5g, which was substantially beyond its design limits......it stayed together, but was damaged. </p>

<p>767 is a strong aircraft. Its a mistake to think that the wings will fall off at Vne. Sure 100 knots faster is hard to fathom, but the airframe may have been bent but still able to stay together. </p>

<p>I have to declare that I do find it hard to accept that these guys were able to hit the towers, and I do have quite a bit of flying experience. </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean I think the aircraft would fall apart at these speeds. Flutter is a whole different matter, but as far as I am aware the data isnt there to either confirm or deny this.</p>

<p>I know that the Israelis took another strong Boeing product (747) and took it to transonic speeds. There was some airframe strengthening, but you can&#39;t replace control surface locations etc. The ailerons and elevators would have all been in the same place boeing intended them to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It did not reach Mach 1.0 that&#39;s false</p>

<p>In the case of TWA 841, the NTSB Report states that the airplane reached a max speed of .96 Mach at 31,800 feet, exceeding it&#39;s Mmo of .90 Mach by .06 Mach or about 30 knots over it&#39;s Mmo. </p>

<p>For the following airspeed calculation, please note the EAS or Equivalent Airspeed.. (near sea level) = 332 knots or a 358 KCAS. So it was actually under it&#39;s Vd limit by 62 knots KCAS (knots calibrated airspeed). </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at this another way - that aircraft withstood a 5.8g pull out. As I am also sure you are aware, that also exceeds the design loads of the jet by a huge margin. </p>

<p>If Boeing build jets that can withstand g loads far beyond their published limits, why would you not think that would equally apply to aerodynamic loads?</p>

<p>Look, I have no doubt that there was some flutter going on, and the airframes involved were probably considerably damaged in these over speeds, but that doesn&#39;t mean I think the airframe is going to break up .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As i pointed it, it never went supersonic, that was false, and at it&#39;s maximum speed in an uncontrolled dive, while experiencing structural failure as a result of both g loads and aerodynamic pressure, it&#39;s EAS was around 332 knots, and it&#39;s CAS 358 knots, as shown. </p>

<p>I think you are deluded somewhat however to try to hold to the idea that the south tower plane was good &#39;ol flight 175, and i&#39;m not only referring to flutter but tight flight control at that speed, as well as the issue of piloting at such an airspeed, as observed</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tywMLqVcBO4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tywMLqVcBO4</a></p>

<p>The south tower plane was also pulling g&#39;s in the neighborhood of about 2.5g</p>

<p>As to the DC-8, which i myself referenced in another post, as the ONLY other sort of comparable precedent in the entire history of aviation, that  plane was modified (leading wing edges) and did it&#39;s dive at 45,000 to 35,000 feet or thereabouts, meaning that it&#39;s EAS or equivalent airspeed, near sea level, would have been somewhere around 425-430 EAS and 460-465 CAS. </p>

<p>The point here isn&#39;t merely whether the plane would rip apart, but how it could possibly maintain such tight flight control piloted by someone with very limited training and skill level who&#39;d never flown the real thing in his entire life. </p>

<p>Do you have any idea what that kind of airspeed does to the control surfaces and the controls that control them? </p>

<p>What you are proposing, just isn&#39;t believable on it&#39;s face, but especially so when we start to consider all the physical evidence that the twin towers did not really &quot;collapse&quot; as a result of the plane impacts and fire which was obviously employed as a fake causal mechanism to create a suspension  of disbelief to &quot;sell&quot; the observing world public the reason for their destruction about an hour and an hour and a half later, first the south tower, although hit second hit lower down, across multiple floors and at a higher rate of speed, and then the north tower, from the 95 floor level, doing the exact same thing a half hour later. </p>

<p>In other words the targeting of the south tower can be seen to have been, in hindsight, of a very high precision nature, and not some just sort of random fluke by a &quot;lucky&quot; crack Boeing pilot hijacker. Surely you can see that, and discuss it without having to resort to calling me a &quot;truther&quot; (although it&#39;s better than &quot;liar&quot;). </p>

<p>You yourself must admit that it&#39;s you who are stretching and straining the limits of credulity here, not I. </p>

<p>SPEED LIMITATIONS </p>

<p>MAXIMUM OPERATING SPEED – VMO/MMO </p>

<p>35,000’ - 310 KIAS .90 MACH </p>

<p>30,000’ - 345 KIAS .90 MACH </p>

<p>15,000’ - 403 KIAS </p>

<p><a href="http://www.pprune.org/965445-post6.html">http://www.pprune.org/965445-post6.html</a></p>

<p>P.S. IAS is no longer used on commercial airliners and hasn&#39;t been since the 60&#39;s. </p>

<p>Instead they now use CAS (calibrated airspeed)</p>

<p>TAS is CAS corrected for non-standard temp and pressure. </p>

<p>In other words, at sea level, TAS is pretty much equal to CAS. </p>

<p>As you climb, TAS increases, which is why EAS and CAS needs to be considered when understanding dynamic pressure based on altitude. </p>

<p>The Vd limit is expressed as 420KCAS</p>

<p>The Vd/Md limit is not published anywhere for the 727, which it could be calculated in theory from the Vmo/Mmo, which is not less than 90% of Vd/Md</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To make this crystal clear, regarding these airspeeds, what you need to understand, and apparently have not as of yet.. is that an EAS or equivalent airspeed of 425 knots (near sea level) represents the same dynamic pressures on the airframe as .99 mach at 22,000 feet, which is the point at which the FDR stopped recording for EgyptAir990 during it&#39;s plummet. </p>

<p>That&#39;s 85-90 knots LESS than &quot;flight 175&quot; was travelling. </p>

<p>So it really is an issue as much of structural integrity, as it is flight control (and piloting). </p>

<p>Furthermore, the Vd/Md limit of 420KCAS/.91M represents the outer flight envelope beyond which structural failure due to flutter becomes imminent, which makes perfect sense since it&#39;s also the EAS for an equivalent airspeed just 5 or so knots shy of the .99-1.0 mach airspeed at altitude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can certainly expect damage to an aircraft that exceeds its recommended top speed by that amount. What we can&#39;t expect is for it to just fall out of the sky.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <strong>none of the incidents you linked to were actually <em>caused</em> by excessive airspeed,</strong> though two of the flights provide pretty clear examples of incidents where craft suffering damage in-flight due to a combination of excessive speed during freefall and g-forces and air resistance on recovery were able to continue flying and land safely.</p>

<p>I see no reason why flight 175 couldn&#39;t have been flying well above its recommended top airspeed in the last minutes or seconds before impact, despite any damage this may or may not have caused to the craft.</p>

<p>For TWA 841: &quot;The Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the isolation of the No. 7 leading edge slat in the fully or partially extended position after an extension of the Nos. 2, 3, 6, and 7 leading edge slats and the subsequent retraction of the Nos. 2, 3, and 6 slats, and the captain&#39;s untimely flight control inputs to counter the roll resulting from the slat asymmetry.&quot; The craft was in freefall for 10,000 feet but the crew regained control despite the damage and the plane made a safe landing with no fatalities.</p>

<p>For EgyptAir 990 there are two theories, one from American and one from Egyptian authorities. The Americans think the copilot just wanted to die. The Egyptians say there must have been a mechanical failure in the elevator (the up-down flappy bits on the tail) control system. Either way, the craft mostly broke up when it hit the ocean. An engine fell off during the last few hundred feet but this is not a comparable situation because all the engines of the EgyptAir flight were turned off. When a jet engine is turned off, it becomes a huge center of drag as all the air that would normally be drawn through it just keeps bashing up against the front of it.</p>

<p>China Air 006 experienced an engine failure during a zero visibility situation high in the clouds. The crew thought the attitude indicator (the bit that shows if you&#39;re level with the ground) was malfunctioning and ended up in a nose dive, just like the TWA flight. The aircraft experienced significant damage while recovering from the dive but also made a safe landing with only minor injuries to passengers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TWA 841 - &quot;The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the accident and established after eliminating all individual and combined sources of mechanical failure, that the extension of the slats was due to the flight crew manipulating the flap/slat controls[4] in an inappropriate manner. The rumor was that 727 pilots were setting the trailing edge flaps (which were normally only deployed at low speeds along with leading edge slats) to two degrees during high altitude cruise, while at the same time pulling the circuit breaker for the slats so that they would not activate. This configuration was rumored to result in increased lift with no increase in drag, thus allowing more speed, higher elevation, or decreased fuel consumption.[5]</p>

<p>The crew, Capt. Harvey &quot;Hoot&quot; Gibson, first officer Jess Kennedy, and flight engineer Garry Banks, denied that their actions had been the cause.</p>

<pre><code>At no time prior to the incident did I take any action within the cockpit either intentionally or inadvertently, that would have caused the extension of the leading edge slats or trailing edge flaps. Nor did I observe any other crew member take any action within the cockpit, either intentional or inadvertent, which would have caused the extension.
—Capt. Gibson, April 12, 1979
</code></pre>

<p>[6][7]</p>

<p>The crew suggested instead that an actuator on the #7 slat had failed, causing its inadvertent deployment. The NTSB rejected this as improbable and attributed the extension of the flaps to the deliberate actions of the crew. The crew claimed that such failures had happened on other 727s[8] prior and subsequent to this incident. The NTSB report notes seven such cases.[3]</p>

<p>&lt;An average speed of 774 mph on a descent from 25,000 feet to below 1,000 feet, covering a distance of sixty miles directly towards target in just over 4.5 minutes, represents a totally impossible achievement, on multiple levels, for a mid-size wide-body twinjet airliner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I read the whole article. That discrepancy isn&#39;t really relevant to this analysis. What matters is that some sort of mechanical failure with slat 7 caused the plane to enter into a dive, from which the crew recovered, despite damage to the craft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s always an expensive and lengthy case when there&#39;s an Aircraft Upset incident. A lot of people have their careers riding on the way the report turns out so a degree of contention is to be expected, but this case was something special due to the implication that the flight crew may have covered up evidence.</p>

<p>If you read a bit farther down, though, you&#39;ll see that the NTSB does suggest that a mechanical failure occurred. What they ruled out was the idea that a mechanical failure extended the flaps in the first place, instead suggesting that #7 failed to retract after it had been extended by the pilots in an unsanctioned practice of flying with flaps at 2 degrees to gain extra lift and save fuel.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way that the crew could have just accidentally ended up in a random dive while cruising without some kind of equipment failure. The point of contention is whether unapproved practices on their part led to a situation which made the mechanical failure possible.</p>

<p>My father got on the 72 for another carrier just a few years later so I heard a lot about it at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch a few videos of similar aircraft flying nearer to sea level, or simply observe flying commercial airliners, as a compare - they appear to crawl, not zoom like a fighter jet. Then you&#39;ll be able to tell. 
Nevertheless, there&#39;s the recorded speed determined both by radar and observation pegging the airspeed at 90 knots over the Vd design dive limit, which is unheard of and without precedent in the history of aviation, let alone such speed in controlled flight and under self propulsion in level flight in near sea level air density, so it&#39;s an issue as much of structural integrity as it is controlled flight, and piloting at such speed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The loss of flight control was not caused by airspeed on the TWA or China Air flights, but rather by mechanical failures of the flaps and engine, respectively. There is no evidence indicating a loss of flight control in the Egypt Air case.</p>

<p>I need to run an errand for the next few hours but when I get back I&#39;ll do some research on exceeding the Vne in modern aviation.</p>

<p>I have a counter-invitation though: Find a case of a commercial airliner experiencing loss of control or structural damage from exceeding the Vne in the absence of other emergency circumstances.</p>

<p>Both of the surviving flights you cited experienced damage while recovering from steep dives (you&#39;ll notice on your own graph that they&#39;re outside the envelope on the g-force axis, not the velocity axis) and went on to land safely, while flight 175 is supposed to have cruised more or less straight ahead after attaining its extreme speed.</p>

<p>EA990, which lost an engine at just above the envelope for velocity, suffered this damage because the engine was turned off. If it were powered on with air flowing through it instead of sitting there like a giant airbrake, the plane probably would have still been more or less intact when it hit the water a few seconds later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed the point. During their out of control dives in plummeting to the earth under the force of gravity, they experienced plenty of structural failure due to both g-force and airspeed (flutter), just take a look at the damage to ChinaAir006 to see. Meanwhile, even during these dives at their maximum speed, while experiencing structural failure, they were travelling at equivalent airspeeds over 100 knots <em>LESS</em> than flight 175 was during controlled flight and without experiencing such failure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re missing my point that the g-force and air resistance related to pulling out of those dives is a huuge factor that didn&#39;t exist for flight 175 and makes analogy between the flights next to useless. It&#39;s not that these other flights were going so fast that caused the damage, it was the stress of pulling out of the dives.</p>

<p>If you just take a look at OP&#39;s graph, you&#39;ll see that CA006 and the TWA flight were outside the envelope on the Y-axis, which represents G-force, and well within it on the X-axis, which represents velocity. It wasn&#39;t their speed that caused the damage. It was the rapid change in direction as they pulled out of the dive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll get back to you on this this evening, but you&#39;re mistaken that the structural damage was due almost exclusively to G-forces, or that the damage only took place from pulling out of the dive. That contention is somewhat misleading on your part..</p>

<p>In the interim feel free to look up and read the NTSB Reports for CA006, TWA841 and EgyptAir990. </p>

<p>Then, take a look at what I&#39;ve posted in regards to EAS, to better understand the magnitude by which the south tower plane exceeded even the highest airspeeds achieved by those aircraft during their out of control, plummeting dives, while experiencing structural failure throughout those dives. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right though that they do not represent ideal analogues, but they are the best and the only ones available as far as near Vd/Md or outer flight envelop incursions and have generally been the favorites used by so-called &quot;debunkers&quot; to try to refute the notion that a standard Boeing commercial airliner would have any major difficulty retaining structural integrity at the recorded airspeed of 510 knots, near sea level, although they don&#39;t really address, within that context, the issue of perfect flight control, engine performance issues, nor that of piloting at such speeds by novice pilots.</p>

<p>This also raises the issue of engine performance in level flight in near sea level air density, since to reach the Vd limit (of 420KCAS/.91M) test pilots must take the plane into a dive because the aerodynamic drag exceeds thrust capacity, whereas &quot;flight 175&quot; <em>accelerated</em> post-dive during level flight to retain it&#39;s speed of 510 knots, 90 knots over it&#39;s Vd limit, as an expression of EAS (equivalent airspeed) the equivalent aerodynamic pressures on the airframe. at 22,000 ft., of 722 knots or 1.19M. </p>

<p>So perhaps the real point here is that there is no precedent of any kind in the whole history of aviation either before, or after September 11th, 2001, either during flight flutter testing, to establish the Vd/Md flight envelope limit, or during out of control, diving aircraft hurtling to the earth under nothing but the force of gravity, whereby the south tower plane surpassed the equivalent airspeed of Egypt Air 990, which experienced structural failure of varying kinds through it&#39;s descent, by 85-90 knots.. </p>

<p>The closest precedent on record is a DC-8 test flight, diving, at an equivalent dive angle to the s tower plane from 45,000-35,000 feet alt, with an EAS (near sea level equivalent airspeed) approaching something in the order of 465 knots for 16 seconds, although it was a modified aircraft (w leading wing edges). </p>

<p>The south tower plane otoh, maintained the 510-520 knot airspeed for well over a minute, while retaining perfect flight control, and even accelerating after leveling out during level flight in near sea level air density, to retain the 510 knots speed, a feat that would require engine performance anywhere from 4-6 times greater than standard. </p>

<p>It simply cannot have been flight 175, no matter how much some people want to believe the official story about what happened on 9/11, or find the alternative explanation to be unthinkable (that it was some kind of military operation, from within ie: a very sophisticated and complex, high precision engineered - false flag attack, with the patsy hijacker cover story to create the OS narrative as per the official 9/11 Commission Report).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok i&#39;m back. </p>

<p>It looks like you might be off in more ways than one, both in terms of when all the damage occurred, for all three precedents offered, something requiring further research but i&#39;ve covered this ground before and when you look into it, it turns out that all three, 1) TWA841, 2) ChinaAir006 and 3) EgyptAir990, incurred structural damage throughout their diving ascent, and, that although G-force played a major role in the damage in cases 1 and 2, it was by a combination of airspeed as well as G-forces, in all 3 cases, whereby the damage tended to occur during the highest dive speeds with the combination of both G-force and aerodynamic pressure were at the highest peak - not simply during the pullout, that&#39;s not entirely true at all, even potentially misleading.</p>

<p>You also need to bear in mind that G-forces have a 150% stress limit, whereas airspeed is a much harder and faster limit when it comes to the flight envelop performance, with no more than a 5-10 knots margin, max beyond Vd, during which structural failure <em>typically</em> becomes imminent. </p>

<p>Please watch this video (you can skip to 3:45) to understand it better, what we&#39;re really looking at here in regards to the X &amp; Y axis of the graph.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>510 knots near sea level while retaining perfect flight control and no loss of structural integrity
- represents an absolutely unprecedented airspeed 
for <em>the entire history of modern aviation</em> for that aircraft type (commercial airliner), before and after September 11, 2001, where even in the case of out of control, diving, spinning, plummeting aircraft, the south tower plane exceeded their equivalent airspeed by a full 85 knots as in the case of Egypt Air which failed at an EAS of 425knots/.99m at 22,000 ft. alt. and MORE in the case of China Air 006 which only just reached it&#39;s Vmo/Mmo, or with TWA 841 never exceeding it&#39;s Vd/Md limit, although in the case of ChinaAir0006 and TWA841, as seen on the graph, they suffered as much from excessive g-forces as they did excessive airspeed. Nevertheless it&#39;s usually as a primary result of excessive airspeed that both loss of control and structural failure due to flutter, occurs.</p>

<p><a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/do52cdf0f5.jpg">http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/do52cdf0f5.jpg</a></p>

<p>The only other precedent in the history of aviation, is that of a modified DC-8 (leading wing edges), which achieved, at 45,000 to 35,000 ft alt in a controlled dive without loss of control or structural failyure, a speed of Mach 1.0 to 1.01 for 16 seconds before recovering from the dive. That&#39;s at high altitude, however, for which the EAS or equivalent airspeed near sea level (same dynamic pressures that lead to flutter), would equate to about 425-430 knots EAS, max, whereas the south tower plane was clocked at..</p>

<p>510 knots, and even higher (up to 520) during it&#39;s final ascent, leveling off and target acquisitioning - or 90-100 knots beyond it&#39;s Vd design dive limit (see precedents, above for what typically happens once Vd is exceeded by anything more than FIVE knots over its Vd/Md), and for well over a minute, and while pulling about 2.5 g&#39;s during it&#39;s final turning maneuver, which some described as the &quot;hijacker&quot; pilot almost missing the building but what i would describe as absolute (evil) perfection if you wanted to hit the building lower down, across multiple floors while at the same time plowing diagonally through the corner of the building in order to produce that absolutely GARGANTUAN fireball, shock and awe display, which created a suspension of disbelief and a type of credibility as to the causal mechanism of the buildings, with the one hit lower down and across multiple floors &quot;collapsing&quot; first, which in turn sold the reason for the second tower to do the exact same thing about a half hour later.</p>

<p>Unlike a few years ago however,  the balance of power is slowly shifting. </p>

<p>Just like conspiracies of the past, the truth won&#39;t come to light right away. This would be disastrous for a corrupt government. Slowly,  year after year,  more truth and fact begins to trickle out. What was once a bunch of people who will die by the word of government, making fun of truth seekers for being crazy people, now seems to be the other way around.

<p>I believe they saw a plane. I&#39;m not convinced it was the plane that the government&#39;s conspiracy theory tells us about. However, a few of the eyewitnesses claimed to have seen some of the passengers through the windows because they were that low to the ground and so close to the eyewitnesses.

<p>it delves into every aspect of 911, the part about the pentagon is both facsinating and definitive.  A lot of people claim to have seen a much much smaller plane, like a gulfstream.</p>

<p>Then the structural analysis of the pentagon hole and damage is even better.</p>

<p>I like this doc because he doesn&#39;t just claim stuff, almost 100% of it is backed up by newspaper articles, television broadcasts, and expert testimony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to see the picture you mentioned. Also, as I understand it, the wings are the most structurally strong part of the craft. The fuselage would crumple like a tin can long before the wings would. That they would be made out of a weaker material doesn&#39;t make structural sense. If I am wrong, I would like a source so that I may be correct in the future. </p>

<p>My source for the wings being strong is this video series

<p>I believe it is in part 2 but it might be one of the others </p>

<p>Edit -  I realize that structural strength and flammability are 2 different things. If the wings are flammable, I&#39;d still like a source on it. </p>

<hr/>

<p>They were trying to hit the WTC in the UA sim the very next day.. on Sept 12, 2001, so while they were aware the plane was travelling at high speed, obviously he would not know what the actual recorded speeds were yet. </p>

<p>They were flying the simulator for a Boeing 737, a smaller and much more maneuverable aircraft, within the Vmo limit, or under 360 knots - he mentions the figure of 300 knots, which is considered at that altitude to be very fast, particularly as it relates to controlled flight and maneuvering/piloting in near sea level air density. As for the forces involved, which include both aerodynamic pressures due to airspeed and g-forces due to maneuvering, Dan mentions in the interview that they were &quot;fighting the crash logic&quot; when making the attempt at the &quot;higher speeds&quot; because it simulates the forces involved, and very accurately in fact. </p>

<p>In other words, he and his pilots were trying to hit the WTC South Tower at Vmo or perhaps a bit above.. or 300-400 knots, max, and from what he said, closer to 300 and well within with the Vmo limit (360 knots) </p>

<p>They couldn&#39;t go faster than that, past Vd (420), because the sim will then freeze and the screen will turn red due to the crash logic, which would require re-setting the simulator. </p>

<p>Again, as far as controlled flight and maneuvering, and piloting goes, they were flying a 737, a smaller and much more maneuverable aircraft, at around Vmo (and less) and were unable to hit the target (south tower) unless and until they reduced the airspeed to near approach level speeds, which for a Boeing 767-200ER is around 142 knots and for a Boeing 737, around 130 knots. </p>

<p>These were very experienced pilots with 1000&#39;s of hours of flight time in other aircraft types. </p>

<p>After they tried it about 10 times, Dan himself was finally able to do it (fly the dive and final approach at the high speed of 300 knots and hit the target WTC South Tower), although he didn&#39;t say how many times he tried it before finally getting it just right with wing tips within the building perimeter (think of it like parking in or going through a separate garage in your car at full speed out of a turn, but harder, because you&#39;re flying and susceptible to &quot;dutch roll&quot; and all kinds of other phenomenon).</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;I flew the two actual aircraft which were involved in 9/11; the Fight number 175 and Flight 93, the 757 that allegedly went down in Shanksville and Flight 175 is the aircraft that&#39;s alleged to have hit the South Tower. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s possible for, like I said, for a terrorist, a so-called terrorist to train on a [Cessna] 172, then jump in a cockpit of a 757-767 class cockpit, and vertical navigate the aircraft, lateral navigate the aircraft, and fly the airplane at speeds exceeding it&#39;s design limit speed by 100 knots, make high-speed high-banked turns, exceeding -- pulling G&#39;s.  And the aircraft would literally fall out of the sky.  I couldn&#39;t do it and I&#39;m absolutely positive they couldn&#39;t do it.&quot;</p>

<p>alleged flight 77
Article 7/17/05</p>

<p>&quot;The government story they handed us about 9/11 is total B.S. plain and simple.&quot; … Wittenberg convincingly argued there was absolutely no possibility that Flight 77 could have &quot;descended 7,000 feet in two minutes, all the while performing a steep 280 degree banked turn before crashing into the Pentagon&#39;s first floor wall without touching the lawn.&quot;…  </p>

<p>&quot;For a guy to just jump into the cockpit and fly like an ace is impossible - there is not one chance in a thousand,&quot; said Wittenberg, recalling that when he made the jump from Boeing 727&#39;s to the highly sophisticated computerized characteristics of the 737&#39;s through 767&#39;s it took him considerable time to feel comfortable flying.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Equivalent Airspeed - EAS (this should drive the point home for anyone who hasn&#39;t yet grasped the significance of the data presented in the OP)</p>

<p>EAS is sea level airspeed. As a factoral expression of the equivalent dynamic pressures on an airframe at low vs. high altitude, because the air is so much thicker at sea level (2/3rds thicker than at 30,000 ft), there is an airspeed appropriately titled &quot;Equivalent Airspeed&quot; or EAS. </p>

<p>At higher altitudes, the air is thinner so the aircraft will need to go faster to match the amount of air hitting the airframe at low altitudes, in thick air, which is what allows the aircraft to achieve much higher speeds at higher altitude, and is taken advantage of to achieve a max cruising speed at 35,000 feet of almost 500 knots TAS.</p>

<p><a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/np52c12a03.jpg">Max cruising speed - Parameters: Screenshot</a></p>

<p>EAS is defined as: </p>

<p>EAS is the airspeed at sea level which produces the same dynamic pressure acting on the airframe as a True Airspeed at higher altitudes. It is used for determining aircraft performance, structural integrity.. .etc. </p>

<p>In other words, to be more specific, 510 knots at sea level (EAS) would produce the same dynamic pressure as 722 knots True Airspeed (TAS), at 22,000 feet.</p>

<p>For example, the Vmo/Mmo or max operating limit for a standard 767 is 360/0.86M, where the split (/) defines the difference between low vs. high altitude, measured in knots for the Vmo below 17,854 feet, and as a mach # at and above 23,000 ft or 360knots/.86m.</p>

<p>See this screenshot for Vmo/Mmo to understand with perfect clarify how EAS fits into this picture</p>

<p><a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/jf52c128c0.JPG">http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/jf52c128c0.JPG</a></p>

<p>To clarify still further let&#39;s take a look at EAS in relation to the Max cruising speed of .86M at 35,000 feet, whereby the EAS (near sea level equivalent airspeed) is 275 knots and KCAS (knots calibrated airspeed) is 294 knots. Closer to sea level, EAS, CAS and TAS become increasingly closer together, but at higher elevations, beyond 23,000 ft, the TAS as an expression of the same TAS at the lower altitude, now EAS, will be much higher allowing the plane to travel as high as 500knots as a max cruising speed at a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet (499 to be precise)</p>

<p><a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/np52c12a03.jpg">See- Parameters</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.luizmonteiro.com/Altimetry.aspx#EquivalentAirspeed">Here is the caculator</a></p>

<p>Thus an EAS of 510 knots = 722 knots or Mach 1.19, at 22,000 feet, and at still higher altitude, 915 knots or 1.38 Mach, at 35,000 feet, and reaching Mach 1.39 at about 38,000 ft. </p>

<p>An unmodified 767-222 cannot do it, it&#39;s an utterly impossible airspeed unless the aircraft were seriously modified, and impossible to control and maneuver at such airspeed, particularly for an untrained pilot with limited training, and skill level, and zero airtime in the the genuine article. It&#39;s just not possible and it cannot be believed, not in light of the facts in evidence before us. </p>

<p>Again, 510 knots is the groundspeed claimed for &quot;UA175&quot;, by radar.. (as an airspeed, with the groundspeed and windspeed vectors added together, because the wind was light heading N/W, it would be about 515 knots).</p>

<p>So, dearest reader, consider that those who believe a standard 767 can fly at 510 knots near sea level and remain stable/controllable, MUST also accept that the same airplane could fly in a controlled fashion, even in a dive, </p>

<ul>
<li>at 722 knots at 22,000 feet... or Mach 1.19, and 915 knots at 35,000 feet...or Mach 1.38 heading for 1.39 at 38,000 ft. </li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s absurd. </p>

<p>510 knots is NINETY knots over Vd of 420 (measured as KCAS), and 85 knots OVER 425, which is itself an equivalent airspeed at 22,000 feet of .99 Mach and 85 knots past the equivalent EAS for Mach 1.0. at an altitude of 23,000 feet and above. 425 EAS is also the same speed, and altitude, at which a diving EgyptAir990&#39;s FDR stopped recording, while revealing the occurrence of structural damage taking place throughout it&#39;s entire ordeal, before losing finally losing an engine and plunging into the sea while flying apart. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s 85-90 knots LESS than the airspeed of alleged &quot;flight 175&quot;. </p>

<p>This is all totally fact checked, I&#39;m not making this shit up, just trying to explain it so that it&#39;s clear to people what the true significance is of the data under analysis.</p>

<p>There is no precedent in the history of aviation, either before or after September 11th, 2001, for controlled flight without loss of structural integrity for this aircraft type (commercial airliner) occurring at such an airspeed, including those aircraft that entered into uncontrolled dives while suffering structural failure, whether they barely managed to land or not isn&#39;t the point, but instead that &quot;flight 175&quot; exceeded those dive speeds in perfect control and without suffering any structural failure at an airspeed of 85-100+ knots FASTER than those out-of-control diving, plummeting planes.</p>

<p>Therefore the plane was and must have been highly modified, including a hardened structure along with more powerful engines, because, as per the Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_Study, the plane <em>accelerated</em> post-dive, in level flight, to retain an airspeed of just over 510 knots through to impact, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tywMLqVcBO4">as seen in the video</a>, which itself would require engine performance more powerful by orders of magnitude (3-6 times greater) than that which could be achieved by standard engines, in near sea level air density. </p>

<p>Again the plane can fly just within it&#39;s flight envelop or Vmo/Mmo of .86m at 23,000 feet but that&#39;s 360 EAS as well as CAS (calibrated airspeed - which has replaced &quot;indicated airspeed&quot; or IAS in Jet Aircraft where TAS is CAS corrected for non-standard temp, and pressure). The Vd/Md limit, or outer flight envelope, is a very hard limit to within 5 knots, because again, at 425 knots (EAS) we&#39;re looking at .99M at 22,000 ft alt. So it makes sense as an airspeed limitation once this is clearly understood. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Is it any wonder then that celebrated airman John Lear of Lear Jet fame, and who has more FAA certifications than any other pilot in the whole word, has managed to convinced himself, that there could be no plane there, at all, which is of course utterly absurd, but how and why the most certified pilot on the planet would arrive at such a ridiculous conclusion is rather telling as it relates to this issue, is it not?  </p>

<p>and note, if you will, the EAS or equivalent airspeed (near sea level airspeed) - of 322 knots.., which is 38 knots, nearer to sea level below the Vmo/Mmo of 360 knots and 98 knots or 112.7mph LESS than the outer flight envelope Vd design dive limit of 420KCAS, as presented in the TCDS or Type Certification Data Sheet presented in the OP.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.luizmonteiro.com/Altimetry.aspx#EquivalentAirspeed">Caculator</a> </p>

<p>And that&#39;s .96M at 31,800 feet, which is appropriate for that Airbus flight test, because that&#39;s near the floor of the elevation they were using AND it also just so happens to be the fastest speed reached by TWA841 in it&#39;s out of control harrowing dive amid severe structural damage, to give you an idea as to the equivalent airspeed, although g-forces played a significant role in that case, yet remained within the 150% limit at 5.5G or thereabouts. Speed limitation isn&#39;t typically as forgiving around the 425k/.99m airspeed however.</p>

<p>Now are you starting to get the picture, when we consider the airspeed of 510-520 knots throughout the latter part of a steady dive and in level flight while accelerating to retain said airspeed as described by the NTSB Radar Data Speed Impact Study?</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that celebrated airman John Lear of Lear Jet fame has managed to convince himself that there could be no plane there, at all, which is of course absurd, but how and why the most certified pilot on the planet would arrive at such a conclusion is very telling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Lear&#39;s affidavit, 2008 </p>

<p>&quot;The alleged NIST speed of 443 mph (385 kts,) for American Airlines Flight 11 would be technically achievable. However the NIST speed of 542 mph (470 kts) for United Airlines Flight 175 which is 50 kts. above VD is not commensurate with and/or possible, considering: </p>

<p>(1) the power available,*** </p>

<p>(2) parasite drag (NAVAIR 00-80T-80 Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators)</p>

<p>(3) parasite power (NAVAIR 00-80T-80 Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators)</p>

<p>(4) the controllability by a pilot with limited experience. 14 CFR Part 25.253 (a)(B) </p>

<p>Therefore the speed of the aircraft, that hit the World Trade Center, as represented by NIST, particularly that of United Airlines Flight 175 is fraudulent and could not have occurred.&quot; </p>

<hr/>

<p>Although he was a little off on the actual recorded speed, using the estimate of NIST instead of the NTSB Radar Data Report, which might not have been released at that time, he makes the point. </p>

<p>Just to clarify, John Lear is a &quot;no planer&quot; who cannot accept that any such aircraft could travel in control at that speed and altitude. He is joined by ex Bush Admin official, Morgan Reynolds, who claims that no such aircraft could possibly have penetrated the exterior steel columned curtain wall of the twin towers, as observed. I know, nuts. </p>

<p>The problems they raise could be resolved however if they were to deduce that the plane was, to begin with, um, cough..real, and was a highly modified 767 type aircraft with hardened structure and modifications to the leading wing edges while travelling at a sufficient speed to get the job done, as observed.</p>

<p>This however, as what really happened, is not &quot;faked&quot; or &quot;fakery&quot; as they like to call it, with the plane either CGI&#39;d and/or the object a hologram, the impact fireball, and impact damage presumably generated by other means or simply CGI&#39;d, which is absurd in the face of the entire video and photographic record and what about the impact damage, was that faked also? The building actually swayed a little bit on impact, I suppose that was CGI&#39;d,  also.. </p>

<p>So the &quot;no plane&quot; (at the WTC) hypothesis must also be dismissed as not credible or believable and so in the end</p>

<p>all we&#39;re left with is military drone 767-like aircraft with hardened structure, upgraded avionics and remote (drone) piloting capability, leading wing edge modifications, both for increased speed and hardness at impact with the steel curtain wall. Also Bigger Engines x3+ (to achieve acceleration at 500+ knots in near sea level air density) - and a paint job and that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>Now play the tape back through in terms of the approach, target acquisitioning and the actual impact itself in the case of the south tower, a fireball the magnitude of both buildings and everything in between - WAY out of proportion to the North Tower impact and, what would be expected for a fully wing-loaded fuel tank for a cross-continental flight from Boston to LA. The fireball was too big as well - might as well point it out.</p>

<p>Fireball (from across the Hudson River) <a href="http://911research.com/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/mdf50846.jpg">http://911research.com/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/mdf50846.jpg</a> </p>

<p>But it happened, and no that doesn&#39;t mean it happened the way we were led to believe that it happened, but it certainly doesn&#39;t mean that real planes were not involved. Just to be clear on the NRPT (no real plane theory).  </p>

<p>Come around John Lear when you read this, for the love of God and everything that&#39;s sane and consider how that aircraft must have been modified, to be what it was and to do what it actually did do, and speed is an essential element for the required impact physics to there again, do what actually happened. </p>

<p>Steel can break (and in so doing can be pushed) with sufficient momentum and kinetic energy, at impact. </p>

<p>That&#39;s WHY so fast.. </p>

<p>Plane wasn&#39;t filled with seats though because i can guarantee you it was filled, not with people, but with fuel and incendiary, like a <a href="http://911research.com/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/mdf50846.jpg">giant fuel air bomb</a>. </p>

<p>The pyrotechnic shock and awe display, was of course needed to create an awe inspiring (however horrific and incomprehensible) suspension of disbelief, as to the cause of subsequent complete annihilation of both buildings in the same manner, first the one hit lower down, and across multiple floors and a higher rate of speed, and then the other from the 95 of 110 stories, doing the exact same thing about a half hour later, to within maybe 3 seconds of absolute free fall for any freely dropped object from the same height, i should add. </p>

<p>It&#39;s self evident, both the buildings, and the planes, when we look to the south tower plane, recorded from every angle and perspective since by that time all eyes were trained on tne New York City WTC Twin Tower complex, the north tower smoking already from the first impact, captured in only one video (Naudet Brothers Fireman Video) and with no good still photos, because nothing was expected at that point, except by <a href="http://www.another19.com/index.html/styled/index.html">George Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Pearl, Paul Wolfowitz, L. Paul Bremmer, among others</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the no-planer hypothesis can only be a honey pot of disinfo intended to obfuscate, corrupt, and above all set up to discredit and be discredited, and thus a controlled opposition, whether knowingly or unwittingly it makes no difference in the final analysis, the general effect and impact to blunt the truth at the heart of the matter to render the &quot;9/11 truth movement&quot; crazy and out of touch with reality, is the very same in either case. </p>

<p>It&#39;s what i call feeding the honey pot and it&#39;s a terrible thing to do, it&#39;s bad enough to be actively involved in unwittingly, but quite another to do so with conscious awareness, like taking marching orders from the honey pot of the planning of the operation itself, and playing out the role of &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, in this case right out there in far left field and not even in the stadium at all by suggesting that there was no plane there, no real plane, at all (at the WTC) - a sound making hologram, at best. </p>

<p>That&#39;s absurd, and I&#39;m calling it out right here and now, but I mean no ill will by that towards John Lear, Morgan Reynolds, and Jim Fetzer. I&#39;m just imploring them to look again and get real based on what actually took place in reality. </p>

<p>There can be no real truth or justice otherwise, if it&#39;s not real to begin with or based in reality and physics. </p>

<p>That&#39;s called shooting ourselves in the foot, I&#39;m pretty sure, and actually doing the enemies bidding when you really stop and think it all the way through as if taking marching orders from the operational design of the events itself, with everything outside the official story narrative being in the domain of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, and the more the merrier, but it&#39;s the weird ones about space beams and holograms which really do the devil&#39;s bidding - because then the &quot;honey pot&quot; which was set within the plan itself, is fed, and out of it emanates outlandish and unbelievable and incredible and outrageous conspiracy theories, that of themselves cannot be believed or accepted - which are then employed like strawmen to discredit the rest of the 9/11 conspiracy information, no matter what else is offered that&#39;s perfectly sane and reasonable, which gives the OS believers the only excuse they need to dismiss it out of hand. </p>

<p>If one were discover themselves a worker operating actively from within of the honey pot of impossibility, handed out in the rendering of the events themselves, one would think that they would do a double take and maybe rethink their whole premise and focus of activity - if the arrow of inquiry was pointed in the wrong direction, and not at the very crux of the official story and the argument that it cannot be believed by any sane, rational or scientifically minded person. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like working the wrong side of the fence, in the domain of the same cause, and that&#39;s a disinfo or misinfo agent plain and simple, whether you know it or not. </p>

<p>Why go there, when all we need do it to show that THE plane was not and cannot have been UA175, but a military remote piloted drone, beefed up 767 hybrid filled with fuel AND incendiaries, set up like a fuel air bomb flame thrower, along with near instantaneous detonation within the confines of the building, so as not to give away the plane&#39;s identity - a miss would of course spell absolute doom for the operation. &quot;Must, hit, steel.&quot; </p>

<p>But it was perfect - according to the detail. </p>

<p>Hit at the right level, at the right angle, and also diagonal to the building&#39;s overall perimeter so as to maximize the magnitude of the <a href="http://911research.com/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/mdf50846.jpg">pyrotechnic fireball</a>. </p>

<p>Best Regards, to all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is old but... Great explanation.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but what I&#39;ve taken from this is that essentially a watered down version of the  presidential aircraft was used and probably preprogrammed with an exact flight path for an autopilot to maneuver it into position and there is almost zero possibility for anything else to have occurred on the first approach, even with an experienced pilot.</p>

<p>With regard to the Pentagon, I thought the plane thing was horse pucky while I was watching it the day it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, for the positive feedback.</p>

<p>The south tower plane must have been remotely piloted by a very skilled pilot, because on final approach can be seen the most subtle and precise <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tywMLqVcBO4">finger-touch control</a>, so it wasn&#39;t pre-programmed but hand flown (just not from within the plane itself of course, because such a pilot wouldn&#39;t be a kamikaze). </p>

<p>Additionally, the structure must have been strengthened, almost certainly including leading wing edge modifications, and the engines replaced with something at least 3 orders of magnitude more powerful than standard. </p>

<p>I call it &quot;monster-plane-as-missile&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what it was in effect.</p>

<p>What is was NOT and could not have been was &quot;UA175&quot;. There&#39;s just no way on earth that it was what they would have us believe. It could not have been, and most definitely not as flown by Marwan al-Shehhi. </p>

<p>As with the twin towers, physics and the physics of controlled flight prohibits the official story from being true, and some day, no matter how &quot;old&quot; this info might be - future historians looking back are going to get it right or mostly right, and the &quot;911 truthers&quot; will be vindicated, in the fullness of time and history, can&#39;t not. </p>

<p>And as to the nature fo the destruction of the twin towers, future grade 10 physics students, armed with nothing but a stopwatch and a few basic equations including the three laws of motion, and some youtube videos, will prove, time and time again, that those buildings can only have been blown up with explosive demolition bombs which were riddled throughout the building, in advance. There&#39;s no other way to account for the physical occurrence of the destruction of those buildings. They did not just &quot;collapse&quot; in some sort of accordion-like pancaking collapse, that&#39;s not at all what really happened. </p>

<p>Both phenomenon, the plane, and the way the buildings exploded and fell to within mere seconds of absolute free-fall, according to the official story explanation simply cannot be believed by any sane, rational and scientifically minded person. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the saddest truth in the history of the world, plane as day, so to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something else that goes unnoticed more often than not is the melting point of the materials used to construct the buildings.  Not only does jet fuel nor burn hot enough long enough to cause that kind of structural damage on the few floors it directly affected, but, having a background in metallurgy, I know those I beams cannot break the way they did due to their crystalline structure.  It&#39;s not possible for them to even break without deformation due to the elasticity of steel, without even accounting for the rest of the building.</p>

<p>The building itself also wouldn&#39;t burn the way it did without help. I understand there&#39;s a lot of flammable and combustible materials involved, but it went up relatively instantly. My thought was that there was more on the plane then what the fuel tanks would hold, whether it be more fuel or other explosives.</p>

<p>As far as the other planes, I remember watching the news while everything was happening and seeing a female reporter from a smaller news group.  She was speaking about an extra plane that was not forced down. She stated that it was shoot down and her feed went to static about 3 seconds later.</p>

<p>I still cannot believe that most of America still thinks it was who everyone says it was.  The entire world believes it was our own government with the exception of us as a whole. Too many anomalies exist to dismiss it as a foreign attack.</p>

<p>On another note... Years ago a similar thing happened with an air show over seas.  Two planes crashed on video and killed a large part of the crowd. Problem... The pilots never ejected and were unscathed.  They were also charged with murder and sentenced to life  imprisonment.  I watched the video over and over but couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on what was wrong with it. I died the poster what I was missing and he stated that I should look at all of the pictures of the people that died.  Then I should look at the crowd very closely and specifically between two points in the video.  What I noticed was that there were no bodies, which I had assumed were obliterated, and that the video had twitches in it like it was edited.  When I scrolled frame by frame I realized that the entire video was not twitching, bit only certain elements.  They would freeze for 1 to 4 frames and you&#39;d never notice it if you just watched the chaos at fill speed.  My conclusion was that those were added to the video.  Basically, the people that died didn&#39;t exist, or weren&#39;t there and no longer exist to the public. The firefighters were putting out the fires that were in an intact cockpit. The entire video was faked. I never figured out why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue with the videos of the south tower plane, in that case involves speed issues where there weren&#39;t quite enough video frames in the allotted timeframe to capture enough information and therefore there were strange effects here and there, which would be expected, and there&#39;s too much in the video and photographic record for there to be any &quot;video fakery&quot; regarding the events of 9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was thinking but there was zero gore and it wasn&#39;t cut for long periods of time. I used to edit videos for a website so I&#39;m somewhat familiar with it although by far not an expert. Think of this... you&#39;re watching video and the camera has a bit of shake to it like someone is walking around.  Back then, only really high end cameras had the stabilization so shakey video was commonplace.  You see people walking around, talking and laughing, eating hotdogs and drinking soda. Your eyes are telling you something is strange but you can&#39;t see what it is.  Then something dawns on you.  There&#39;s a burning plane with firefighters teeing to put out the fire around it and these people are just walking around like it&#39;s another Tuesday. The video never actually breaks, it&#39;s literally a 15 minute video without scene changes. It still didn&#39;t look right but the quality isn&#39;t fantastic and you can&#39;t quite out your finger on it.  While scrubbing through frame by frame, the video seems to glitch like a computer or video game.  Perhaps it&#39;s just a cheap camera.  As you scrub more, you notice that the camera is moving but sometimes the elements in the video stay for two or three frames.  That could be another processing issue.  What really got me was the people would randomly stop moving... All of them sometimes.  There was zero gore anywhere in the entire thing despite all the people walking around.</p>

<p>What I got from it is that there were at least two videos layered on top of one another.  The reason I think there were more is because sometimes not all of the elements would stop at the same time. Perhaps some of the people would stop this time for five frames but not as many as before.  A vehicle driving would do the same.  What never stopped was the fire and the firefighters.</p>

<p>Later in the video, portraits were shown of each person that died, one by one. Then, the pictures of the two pilots that collided were shown.  They were sentenced for murder.  In the beginning of the video, the camera person caught the actual crash. There were no ejections but the pilots weren&#39;t even hospitalized.  I read up on the crash because I didn&#39;t think think there was anything wrong with the video aside from the fact that it had no sound.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the video and everything is legit. I&#39;m willing to keep am open mind about that along with everything else.  This happened before downloading videos and banning videos was commonplace, so I unfortunately don&#39;t have a copy. I showed the video to people that had more experience with videography and it baffled them.  Only one person game me any kind of conclusion and he said that he&#39;d love to get the raw footage directly from the camera, if it exists. Being professionals, they didn&#39;t want it known they had watched such a provocative video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks and  good advice. Some day when i have the time i&#39;ll make a blog on it, and spread it that way if the NSA doesn&#39;t send a kill order in the interim that is.. jk, i hope. </p>

<p>But once it&#39;s out there and circling then it&#39;s too late. </p>

<p>Small starts friend, big outcomes. It doesn&#39;t matter where or how it&#39;s discovered and validated, we all matter even everyone here at r/conspiracy and it&#39;s up to each person to make their own choices. </p>

<p>I could see how a lot of people might resent this information and evidence, because they don&#39;t want to be told how to look at the world when it&#39;s totally different from the way they might have previously seen it (through the msm lens of official storydome). </p>

<p>What this evidence does i think is it severs the false hoax-linkage and hijacking of Occam&#39;s Razor for the <em>apparent</em> causal mechanism of the subsequent destruction of the towers, or in other words that it wasn&#39;t just a great fluke and lucky stroke of flying genius on the part of the hijackers, but by design, with the south tower hit lower, across multiple floors and a high rater of speed, to account for the reason that it &quot;collapsed&quot; 1st although hit second, with the north tower then doing the same damn thing from the 95th floor, about a half hour later. </p>

<p>When you put the evidence of CD together with THIS evidence as well, then there&#39;s a causal chain that&#39;s capable of placing a double bind on the very beast that did this horrific and dastardly deed in the first place, because when the FAKE linkage is totally severed in the light of scientific truth,  then a new chain of reason and logic and truth envelopes and squeezes the life out of the Big Lie, and hey that&#39;s a good thing, no matter how painful it might be to look at and consider you know the horrific item under scientific observation or what i call simply &quot;the murderous hoax&quot; and psy-op, of 9/11. </p>

<p>The reverse psy-op, otoh, based on nothing but truth and reality, although it might appear to start very small, as a light in darkness is still a light in the darkness, lighting it up. </p>

<p>One at a time, and one more is all we need...</p>

I know enough about this now as a layman that i&#39;m in a position to even describe how the flight envelope works in terms of EAS, TAS, CAS and Mach# within the context of ascending and descending altitude. It&#39;s valid and the data points are correct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, No thank you. You know I woke up and I was thinking about this. Most of my well thought out and well researched comments have gone unnoticed or down-voted. Not just here but all of reddit. I thought maybe there&#39;s a conspiracy there, shills working to keep people from thinking. But ultimately, The quick one-liner is funny, thinking is not. People don&#39;t even want to hear someone say 9/11, the MSM has us all trained to be far too comfortable. My dad is a nonbeliever, well he&#39;s about as bad as it get&#39;s in terms of being &quot;I&#39;m american damnit, The govt knows what we need even if we don&#39;t&quot;. But one time I was telling about why I thought 9/11 was a hoax, he was telling me to shut up but then he said something I didn&#39;t expect. I didn&#39;t know what he meant until now. He said &quot;What if it is true? Then what? Where do we go from there?&quot;</p>

<p>I think a lot of the public has seen some evidence and been scared by it. If that is true, what else is true. What happens when the whole world finds out that the tyranny in america is all real world knowledge. There would be changes, riots, uncomfortable ways of life for the middle class and higher. (I use the term middle class very lightly) I think there is a large, large majority of this country that if MSM reported 9/11 was a false flag, would deny it. Or worse, just not care. Sure the people directly effected (survivors and families) would be in outrage, but how many others would be? Is that too much? Then JFK was an inside job, could pearl harbor be prevented, who killed those kids at sandy hook?</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest that at least some of the downvoters are more than capable of &quot;handling this type of information&quot; but have some serious qualms with the way you&#39;re presenting evidence from aircraft incidents that are in no way analogous to the incident with flight 175.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s very little else to compare, that&#39;s the problem, and what precedents there are show us that such aircraft typically cannot exceed their Vd limit by anything over a few notes or five max and even in those case, when diving and hurtling to the earth, they not only lose control but experience structural failure. They just are not made to achieve equivalent airspeeds which, at altitude, reach or exceed mach 1.0 and which represent, near sea level something in the order of 425-430 knots. </p>

<p>In controlled flight without any structural failure, it&#39;s absolutely without precedent, either before, or after September 11th, 2001.</p>

1.37:30 - What happened to the passengers?
1.38:35 - The cellphone calls</p>

<p>To hone in on the relevant part, i invite you to check out the recording left by CeeCee Lyles on her husbands answering machine, which can be found smack dab in the middle of the public record. </p>

<p>Just to go Wikipedia&#39;s flight 93 page and scroll about half way down the right side in search of the player under the name of CeeCee Lyles</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93</a></p>

<p>And when you find it, put on your headphones, turn UP the volume and then listen to her entire delivery very very carefully, it&#39;s right there in that final whisper.. </p>

<p>Listen to every nuance of the context of the whole call as well, in light of the entire cell phone record which proves that those calls when taken together can only have been made from the ground, where, although that call was allegedly made from an airphone, her later call to him was from her cellphone, while travelling at over 5,000 feet at over 400mph, a sustained call, with them praying together etc. and no dropping of that call. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is good you included TWA 841, cause it demonstrates my point about the envolopes:</p>

<p>On April 4, 1979, a Boeing 727-31 (tail number N840TW) operating as TWA Flight 841 took off from John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, en route to Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in Minneapolis, Minnesota. At around 9:48 p. m. local time, over Saginaw, Michigan, while the plane was cruising at 39,000 feet (11,887 m) and Mach 0.816, it began a sharp roll to the right. The roll continued despite the corrective measures taken by the autopilot and the human pilot. The aircraft went into a spiral dive, losing about 34,000 feet (10,363 m) in 63 seconds. During the course of the dive, the plane rolled through 360 degrees twice, and crossed the Mach limit for the 727 airframe. Control was regained at about 5,000 feet (1,524 m) after the first officer, with the captain in agreement, extended the landing gear in an attempt to slow the aircraft,[1][2] and following the loss of the #7 slat from right wing. The plane suffered substantial structural damage</p>

<p>The plane was damaged, but it was flyable and landable.</p>

<p>Flying outside of the envelopes does NOT gaurentee any outcome.  It simply increases the odds something bad is going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is more broad then that.
The OP is making the statement that it is impossible for the planes to fly outside of the envelope.</p>

<p>This is not the case.  The truth is that you can very well fly outside of the envelope.
The 841 flight I quoted is an example of a plane flying outside of the envelope - sustaining damage - then being brought under control and landing anyways.</p>

<p>To say that one of the planes couldn&#39;t be a passenger plane because it would have had to fly outside its envelope is a demonstrably false statement.</p>

<p><a href="http://theflyingengineer.com/tag/airbus-a380/">http://theflyingengineer.com/tag/airbus-a380/</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, there isn&#39;t a single precedent in the history of aviation, except on 9/11 where a commercial airliner, even in a totally out of control, hurtling, plummeting dive, exceeded that limit by more than 5 knots, whereas the south tower plane did so while retaining perfect flight control, by 90 knots over it&#39;s Vd limit and 150 knots over it&#39;s Vmo, even accelerating post dive during level flight to retain that airspeed, which is itself utterly impossible unless the plane in question had more powerful engines by at least 3 orders of magnitude,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. The Lauda Air 767 went it to a steep dive at close to mach1 and broke in to pieces. The report states all the control surfaces had massive damage because the pilots were trying to regain control, but it was physically impossible at that speed for a 767. It states the dive started at 24,700 ft. where the air density would be less than trying to pull the same maneuver at sea-level. </p>

<p>For a point of reference, i refer you to the peak speed reached by an out of control diving, spiraling TWA841</p>

<p>In the case of TWA 841, the NTSB Report states that the airplane reached a max speed of .96 Mach at 31,800 feet, exceeding it&#39;s Mmo of .90 Mach by .06 Mach or about 30 knots over it&#39;s Mmo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t remember which 9/11 video I saw it in, it was a while back, before reddit even. Anyways, they discussed the fact that commercial airliners have a software hard-limit that prevents them from doing maneuvers in excess of 1g. Mostly for safety reasons, despite the fact that the airframe of these planes can handle several G&#39;s. The only way to push one of these airliners in a maneuver above 1G is via remote control @ NORAD. The maneuvers the planes used to hit their respective buildings required &gt;1G turn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking at a plane crash in my home town and would like some feedback.</p>

<p>Colgan Air Flight 3407 is the one I am referring to (where is wiki bot when you need it). This was all over the news here with plenty of pictures along with live feed.  It was a DISASTER area. Does anyone know how similar this plane was and the planes that hit either in Shanksville or the Pentagon?</p>

<p>It looked like a plane dropped in Amherst, but when I see pictures from the two 9/11 sites, it looks like a crash site in a B movie.  I listened to audio (pictures as well), I believe it was on the Loose Change doc, and they said that when crews got to the Shanksville site that there was nothing really there but a hole in the ground. Did they ever recover any bodies from these flights, because I know they did here?</p>

<p>Just a question and if it can be explained let me know because if the planes are similar then I would expect the crash sites to be similar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an expert, but my whole family&#39;s in aviation so I could try to outline some of the differences for you based on info I can find on wikipedia. My analysis is based on the government&#39;s account of the united 93 crash, which some here have their doubts about, but OP here wanted to hear about what could account for the differences and I can&#39;t really answer that question from the perspective of &quot;flight 93 never existed&quot;.</p>

<p>The plane that crashed in Amherst was a Dash-8, a midsize propeller plane. It&#39;s smaller and slower than most jet airliners but not by too much. The 757 that&#39;s supposed to have crashed in Shanksville was significantly faster and much larger.</p>

<p>The biggest difference in situation is that Colgan 3407 was on approach to land, at low altitude, with flaps extended and significant ice buildup when it stalled out. Their last reported airspeed was 130 knots, a dangerously low speed. Flight 93 still had active throttle with no flap extension and was aimed towards the ground. It was reported as having an airspeed of around 500 knots and an attitude of 40 degrees below horizon. It&#39;s supposed to have left a ten foot deep, 30-50 foot wide crater at the impact site. Few pieces of significant size remained intact.</p>

<p>The difference between the incidents is roughly the difference between 1: losing control of your car while braking on ice and 2: crashing your car head on into a concrete barrier at a speed higher than you&#39;d ever normally be going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right, and i was very pleased to see how they dealt with the very same issue we&#39;re looking at here. </p>

<p>In that case they used the max operating speed limit or Vmo/Mmo while expressing that in terms of miles per hour, whereas here we&#39;re using the outer OUTER flight envelop Vd/Md design dive limit expressed in knots and as established by wind tunnel and in flight flutter testing by pilots in Orange Jumpsuits (so they&#39;re easy to find just in case...) while wearing parachutes although well aware that if the plane breaks and goes into an out of control dive during flutter testing that the odds of making it out of the diving aircraft amid those g forces would be slim or in short, while almost crapping their pants. It&#39;s a real limit in terms of airspeed, beyond which loss of control and structural failure is indeed typically imminent unless the plane were seriously modified.</p>

<p>Beyond Vd/Md, well there&#39;s nothing at all to use as an example for high precision controlled flight anywhere past 5 knots over Vd EXCEPT alleged &quot;flight 175&quot;, as well as &quot;77&quot; which was flown with high precision (by Hani Hanjour?) at 80 knots over Vd, while pulling even more g&#39;s yet never so much as touching the grass all the way up to the wall of the ground floor impact. 
At that speed the whole WALL of the Pentagon is itself nothing but a sliver.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the only difference where Vmo/Mmo represents the beginning of the outer flight envelop and Vd/Md it&#39;s outermost limit. </p>

<p>The Vmo/Mmo is 360(under 17854 fit alt)/.86m(above 23,000 ft alt)</p>

<p>Therefore, in knots, the plane was 150 knots over it&#39;s Vmo, or 173mph OVER that aircraft type&#39;s max operating limit beyond which loss of control, as well as structural failure becomes imminent, unless seriously modified. </p>

<p>Engine performance is also an issue, because the plane actually accelerated in level flight near sea level during it&#39;s final approach, in order to maintain, at the lower altitude a groundspeed of 510 knots (with the winspeed vector added, for a very light wind to the N/W, about 515 knots, airspeed).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that&#39;s true. </p>

<p>From the Airbus a380 flutter test cited in the OP</p>

<p>The dive speed (Vd) is the absolute maximum speed above which the aircraft must not fly. Typically, to achieve this speed, the aircraft must enter a dive (steep descent), as the engines cannot produce sufficient thrust to overcome aerodynamic drag in level flight. At the dive speed, excessive aircraft vibrations develop which put the aircraft structural integrity at stake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All it takes is a quick glance at the facts of the other cases OP linked to see that they&#39;re not really comparable situations and don&#39;t really back up the theory.</p>

<p>The closest analogue was the EgyptAir flight, as it involved a sustained descent into the ocean speculated to be a pilot suicide. An engine came off of that flight at much lower speeds than flight 175 which seems at face value to be supportive of OP&#39;s theories, but if you look a bit closer the analogy falls apart. The engines on the EgyptAir flight were turned off, meaning that instead of acting as &quot;tunnels&quot; for air to flow through or vacuums sucking air in, they were acting as giant, heavy air-brakes. It&#39;s easy to see why a turned-off engine would separate from the craft at a far lower speed than a properly operating one.</p>

<p>The other two flights involved planes sustaining relatively minor g-force damage while recovering from free-fall and still managed to land with no fatalities. A craft moving straight ahead with no unusual g-force could be moving much faster and still suffer from less damage than a plane making a recovery from free-fall like that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like 175 couldn&#39;t have sustained some damage in the last few minutes before impact anyway. I doubt whoever was in control would give two shits about dropping a few nuts and bolts on their way in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EA 990, from the FDR data achieved at 01:50:31 a CAS of 463 knots at 17152 ft. It was pulling about 2.1 G&#39;s at the time. The left and right elevators were split as the Captain and FO fought on the controls.</p>

<p>This is a EAS of 443 knots and is 23 knots above Vd for the 767.</p>

<p>Going that fast, pulling that G with severe twisting moments being applied to the tail section, the aircraft DID NOT break up in flight.</p>

<p>The NTSB report is very clear on that. To say otherwise is going directly against the NTSB report and ignores the fact that after the CVR and FDR shutdown due to loss of electrical power, EA990 was observed on radar climbing to 25,000 feet before commencing it terminal dive.</p>

<p>The 767 is a very strong design. While this data does not prove that an EAS of 510 knots was achievable, it does set the benchmark for what a 767 can survive without structural failure.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding that it&#39;s highest speed recorded during it&#39;s dive was .99M or 425 knots EAS. </p>

<p>It also experienced structural failure throughout it&#39;s descent, and eventually lost it&#39;s engine while breaking up and plummeting into the sea. </p>

<p>As to damage, it wasn&#39;t only the left/right elevators split, or the engine which was torn off..</p>

<p>From the NTSB report - </p>

<p>&quot;including portions of two wing panels, fuselage skin, horizontal stabilizer skin,and the majority of the nose landing gear assembly&quot; </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the report
<a href="http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2002/aab0201.pdf">http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2002/aab0201.pdf</a></p>

<p>As to the electrical power cutoff.. if you are arguing that the FDR stopped recording and the transponder not working due to the engines being shut off, this is false.</p>

<p>The 767 has a Ram Air Turbine (or.. RAT).. .so that if the airplane loses electrical power from the engines, a RAT will deploy out of the fuselage and start spinning... creating electrical power which will power the ATC Transponder. Since this did not happen, the only conclusion can be that the airplane was broken at this time. This is all covered in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZrpNK4lJVc">9/11: World Trade Center Attack</a>, sourcing pages from the 767 Aircraft Flight Manual.</p>

<p>This is what the RAT looks like on a 757...

<p>And to be clear.. .the radar returns showing a second &quot;climb and dive&quot;, could have been the radar bouncing off pieces of the airplane which were flipping through the air, giving false altitude data. </p>

<p>Could you please offer a cite as to where you&#39;re getting the 463KCAS number at 17152 ft. - will look back through the NTSB crash report myself to see where you got that from.</p>

<p>But just to be clear that plane suffered structural damage throughout it&#39;s high speed descent, did not survive and broke apart which only further illustrates the central point made in the OP and throughout the thread, since the south tower plane was recorded at about 510-520 knots airspeed, including a g-force of up to 2.5g&#39;s while accelerating in level flight, post dive, but without any loss of flight control, and without incurring structural failure, while allegedly piloted, by an absolute novice, where that airspeed was maintained for well over a minute and not just for a few seconds. </p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t make any sense and cannot be believed for a standard, unmodified Boeing 767, and as pointed out it&#39;s without precedent as an in-control airspeed without experiencing structural failure, for a commercial airliner, in the entire history of aviation, either before or after September 11, 2001. </p>

 The 463 knots at 17152 feet is from the CSV data from the FDR and occurs at the data point I mentioned. The EAS at that point is 443 knots. 
The damage you are quoting did not happen at that point, once again selective quoting. </p>

<p>At what point(s) ie: altitude, airspeed - did the damage that I quoted, take place? Curious..</p>

<p>One of it&#39;s engines did fall off prior to impact, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of that, and that other damage did occur, which you made no mention of whatsoever, while implying that the only damage to take place was the left and right elevators split as a result of the Captain and FO fighting over the controls. Um..isn&#39;t that &quot;cherry picking&quot;..?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll read the report again and check back, because I had no intention to mislead, but let&#39;s hope that you haven&#39;t done so, yourself, we&#39;ll see.. </p>

<p>P.S. Again, could you please provide the link, as requested before, for the CSV data file from the FDR you used, for verification on that 463KCAS at 17152 ft? Thanks. Not that i don&#39;t trust you but i&#39;d just like to see it for myself because that&#39;s quite a bit higher than the 425 EAS as per the #2 diagram ref&#39;d in the OP.</p>

<p>The research I&#39;ve presented here isn&#39;t my own but comes from a group called &quot;Pilots for 9/11 Truth&quot; that i&#39;ve come to understand as a layman, and if any of it&#39;s in error I would very much like to know precisely where and how, and by how much they might have erred because i&#39;m committed to the truth nothing more nothing less. Thanks again. </p>

<p>Loss of an entire engine prior to impact with the ocean would qualify as a &quot;breaking up&quot; though, wouldn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>I have some more research to do on this, because we can&#39;t both be right, and you&#39;ve indicated that I&#39;ve been making false assertions unsupported by evidence, but that&#39;s just not my thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can approximate it from the FDR readout data on the NTSB report. If you want the CSV data, I will need an email address.</p>

<p>One question for you however, the crux of your argument is that Vd/Md is a structural limit, correct? 
I have posted above in the thread how these speeds are obtained from FAR Part 25. Perhaps you should read that. They are the limits to where the test program has cleared the flight envelope, nothing more. </p>

<p>From the original post, you quoted a speed of .99M. That is 0.08 Mach above Md. The aircraft did not break up at that point either. So obviously Md is not a structural limit.</p>

<p>The RAT is a small propeller device that gets dumped into the airstream as a result of loss of electrical power. No argument there. In answer to why is didn&#39;t power the transponder, I suggest dumping it into a 443 knot airstream rendered it unusable, or blew it off the airframe. It wasn&#39;t designed for those air loads. That is supposition on my part, but seven radar sites tracked the aircraft climbing up to 25,000 feet and then descending again.</p>

<p>The debris field was found where their tracking indicated it would be and the entire debris field was only 1200 feet long.</p>

<p>If you deduce what the TAS was of the aircraft at 17000 feet it comes to approx 550 knots ( I am guessing on the OAT, I don&#39;t have it handy). At 550 knots the aircraft was covering over 900 feet per second. The claim that an aircraft breaking up at that speed and altitude, flying horizontally, (from the FDR trace) would have a debris field of only 1200 feet in length is not credible. AF447 descended vertically in a stall and had a debris field larger than that.
I haven&#39;t accused you of anything. But perhaps you shouldn&#39;t take everything from P4T as gospel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Further to my last, the RAT on the 767 only supplies hydraulic pressure. There is no electric generator connected to it. EA990 would have had a HMG (Hydraulic Motor Generator) which would have supplied some electric power once the two AC generators in the engines stopped functioning after the engines were shutdown. Whether the transponder was connected to a bus being powered by this generator, I don&#39;t know. My sources suggest its output, without the centre Hyd system being powered by the AC system, would be about what you would expect from the battery. Its output is DC, so the transponder would have to be connected to a DC emergency bus. I still say however that the RAT wasn&#39;t designed to handle those air loads, and it was never recovered from the wreckage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Cobra1959 - </p>

<p>I thought you were going to come to debate us on our forum? But after reading your many false replies above, I can see why you haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>You may want to check the EA990 report from the NTSB again...specifically this part...</p>

<p>&quot;It is apparent that the left engine and some small pieces of wreckage
separated from the airplane at some point before water impact because they were located in the western debris field about 1,200 feet from the eastern debris field.&quot;</p>

<p>Your claim that &quot;seven sites&quot; recorded the second climb and dive is also false. Seven RETURNS were recorded, and they were primary returns subject to potentially large errors as pointed out by the NTSB. The same type of data shows &quot;AA77&quot; at nearly 60,000 feet along points of its flight path. This all was pointed out to you when we debated on YT, but apparently you chose to ignore it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rob, the size of the debris field says it all. There is no way an aircraft breaking up at 17000 feet doing that sort of TAS would have a debris field of 400 yards.</p>

<p>Why do you quote some of the NTSB report yet ignore the part that says; </p>

<p>&quot;The results of the Safety Boardís examination of CVR, FDR, radar, airplane maintenance history, wreckage, trajectory study, and debris field information were not consistent with any portion of the airplane (including any part of the longitudinal flight controls) separating throughout the initial dive and subsequent climb to about 25,000 feet mean sea level (msl).&quot; ?? </p>

<p>Regarding the radar tracking, we are both wrong.</p>

<p>NTSB report states; </p>

<p>&quot;Information about the remainder of the flight came from the airplane ís two debris fields and recorded primary radar data from long-range radar sites at Riverhead, New York, and North Truro, Massachusetts, and the short-range radar site at Nantucket. The height estimates based on primary radar data from the joint use FAA/U.S. Air Force (USAF) radar sites indicated that the airplane ís descent stopped about 0150:38 and that the airplane subsequently climbed to about 25,000 feet msl and changed heading from 80º to 140º before it started a second descent, which continued until the airplane impacted the ocean.&quot; </p>

<p>While I cannot discount there may be errors in the altitude information, I&#39;d be interested in your explanation as to how debris, tracked by four radar sites, executes a 60 degree turn before it commences descent? </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say I was going to your forum to debate this. I reserve the option to do so however..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mike, </p>

<p>The debris &quot;field&quot; were two distinct debris fields (&quot;distinct&quot; word used by the NTSB) which lead the NTSB to conclude the aircraft broke apart prior to impact with the water. You claimed &quot;The NTSB report clearly states the aircraft did not break up&quot;, you were wrong.</p>

<p>You claimed there were seven radar sites tracking the aircraft during the &quot;second climb and dive&quot;. You were wrong. There were Seven radar &quot;RETURN ESTIMATES&quot; (which the NTSB claims were subject to potentially large errors). </p>

<p>I never claimed how many sites were tracking. </p>

<p>You are also wrong that it was four sites. Only three sites tracked the targets (Riverhead, North Truro, and Nantucket), and they were tracking primary targets (no Mode C) which also included &quot;clutter&quot;, which means it was metal, which means it could have been debris from the airplane flopping in the air in all types of directions, bouncing all types of erroneous/faulty radar information. Have you ever worked with RADES primary altitude data? I have, altitude estimates are all over the place compared to Mode C. Read the Egyptian reply to the NTSB report. The Egyptians point out many errors made by the NTSB which caused the NTSB to revise their reports many times, including complaints of limited access to analysis and incomplete analysis. One which stands out is that Boeing refused to do wind tunnel testing.</p>

<p>You are also wrong with regard to establishing Vd/Md. Vd/Md is established in the wind tunnel based on the onset of flutter or other control issues. Vc is then established (which in turn sets Vmo) through margin of Safety Calculations. Then test pilots go out and see if they can really fly to Vd. If they are unable to reach Vd due to the onset of the factors described, they either lower Vd thereby lowering Vc/Vmo.... or they modify the airplane to achieve Vd. The A380 video was an excellent example of this. They actually broke something on the airplane prior to reaching Vd. They had to abort the test and modify the airplane to reach Vd.</p>

<p>Bottom line, EA990 suffered in flight structural failure. The NTSB states the peak speed reached was .99 Mach which is 425 KEAS. After we received the csv files, we found out 443 KEAS is higher of the two as it relates to EAS, but only by 18 knots. You still have another 67-80 knots to go to compare to &quot;UA175&quot;. Also keep in mind &quot;UA175&quot; performed 2.5 - 3G&#39;s pulling out of the dive for a much longer duration than any of the peak G&#39;s seen with EA990, then rolling on G&#39;s (which reduces structural G limits) to turn into the WTC South tower. All this supposedly done by a pilot with zero time in type, and less experience than one who could not control a 172 at 65 knots.</p>

<p>&quot;UA175&quot; data is far beyond the performance of EA990 which in fact suffered in flight structural failure, or any other aircraft which suffered structural failure or loss of control.</p>

<p>Please let us know when you find one aircraft which is POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED to have maintained control and stability at Vmo+150, Va+220 --and pulling 2.5 - 3G&#39;s-- out of a 10,000+ foot dive, while rolling on G&#39;s cranking into a 38 degree bank...</p>

<p>Please let us also know when you have any type of evidence for your argument other than opinion or &quot;Because the govt told me so...&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s correct however that it&#39;s absolutely without precedent in the history of aviation for commercial jet aircraft, including EA990, by 67-80 knots. It&#39;s also true that 510 knots KEAS (near sea level) = 722 knots / 1.19m, at 22,000 feet, which would be over Md by .28m which is a far cry from .08 over .91, and a difference of .2 Mach faster, or in short </p>

<p>90 knots / .28m OVER the Vd/Md limit, as established by the methodology he described (wind tunnel and flutter testing). </p>

<p>in perfect flight control..</p>

<p>ACCELERATING, after coming out of a 10,000 ft dive the majority of which occurred at a sustained speed of 510-520 knots groundspeed (just slightly higher with wind vector added), in level flight <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tywMLqVcBO4">as observered</a></p>

<p>This would be utterly impossible for the standard engine, whose capacity for thrust is already exceeded at that airspeed, even at altitude, forcing the aircraft to enter into a dive to achieve such speeds, typically. </p>

<p>But ACCELERATING at that speed, in level flight after the dive, in order to retain such speed in near sea level air density, is unheard of and not possible for standard engines. </p>

<p>More research needs to be done in this regard (required engine performance to fly and accelerate, in near sea level air density @ 515 knots airspeed).</p>

<hr/>

<p>The dive speed is the absolute maximum speed above which the aircraft must not fly. Typically, to achieve this speed, the aircraft must enter a dive (steep descent), as the engines cannot produce sufficient thrust to overcome aerodynamic drag in level flight. At the dive speed, excessive aircraft vibrations develop which put the aircraft structural integrity at stake.</p>

<p>On the Airbus fly by wire aircraft, it is not possible to reach the dive speed, due to the flight envelope protections available in normal law. If the sidestick is maintained full forward, and the airspeed crosses VMO/MMO, the pitch nose-down authority smoothly reduces to zero at approximately VMO +16 / MMO + 0.04. This however, does not guarantee the airspeed stabilizing at this speed.</p>

<p><a href="http://theflyingengineer.com/tag/airbus-a380/">http://theflyingengineer.com/tag/airbus-a380/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>You&#39;ll note above that the controls start doing certain things automatically to fight against the pilots ability to reach and achieve such speeds. The control surfaces at such speeds also start doing very funny things (which Rob and other pilots would be well aware of), so there&#39;s just no way yes a NOVICE pilot, with limited time (if any) in the UA simulator and with zero time in the real thing, who&#39;s comparable skills and experience was considered no better than Hani Hanjour by the 9/11 Commission &quot;Investigation&quot; could be flying the plane even if it could achieve such an airspeed while retaining perfect flight control, and while executing a deft g-pulling maneuver all at the same time. </p>

<p>Experienced pilots could not do it in the UA simulator at UNDER Vmo/Mmo, even when trying it again and again, only able to hit the target by reducing speed to near approach level speeds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just not believable. </p>

<p>So Rob&#39;s right to say - show us a precedent. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t any. </p>

<p>Why such speed..? </p>

<p>That&#39;s the question we ought to be asking ourselves at this point, not whether it could have been flight 175 piloted by Marwan al-Shehhi, ex room mate of Hani Hanjour, fellow crack Boeing Pilot. </p>

<p>Why so fast and why did it hit the south tower where it did and in the way it did? </p>

<p>And what really happened to the twin towers (and building 7)? </p>

<p>In the report it states that for a -400 Vd is 400 knots and Md is M.89.</p>

<p>This aircraft broke up at Vd+90 (490KCAS) and Md+0.036 (M0.926). It was pulling between 3 and 5 G at the time.</p>

<p>The break-up was recorded at approx 13000 feet which yields a EAS of 473 KEAS so lets adjust that to Vd+73 at 3G-5G.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What i find interesting about that, is this. </p>

<p>Given that it&#39;s (the airspeed) absolutely without precedent, for controlled flight with deft maneuvering even while pulling g&#39;s and rolling on g&#39;s, setting aside even the issue of successful piloting at that speed and maneuvering, as well as engine power and performance at that speed and altitude - while employing as points of comparison diving, out of control planes hurtling to the earth under nothing but the force of gravity..</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my question:</p>

<p>Why is it that, in light of and in the face of all the evidence, data, information and phenomenon - we are supposed to consider that the official story, namely that this was flight 175 piloted by Marwan al-Shehhi as being entirely &quot;self evident&quot;, and perfectly credible, as the best and seemingly only <em>permitted</em> explanation according to Occam&#39;s Razor? That&#39;s the territory of ignorance which begins with one and only one possible conclusion, simply because in this case the alternative is &quot;unthinkable&quot; including evidence of precision engineered CD of the twin towers and building 7. </p>

<p>It ignores all evidence, while suggesting that the official story about what happened there MUST be accepted even in spite of all evidence to the contrary..! </p>

<p>Why then is the OS considered fact, and that which is in alignment with reality and truth, nothing but &quot;theory&quot;? Because it&#39;s the generally accepted POV? That we should all believe it because the majority of people believe it, while ignoring all evidence to the contrary? </p>

<p>That&#39;s absurd!</p>

<p>That&#39;s not scientific at all, nor the least bit objective. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a farce really, nothing but a ruse first expressed in the murderous hoax itself and then in actively covering it up in all manner of aiding and abetting seemingly for no other reason than the nature of The Big Lie when placed under the lens of scientific inquiry, and historical analysis as well with all of it pointing in one and only one direction, and it isn&#39;t towards the validity or even the believably of the official story and public myth regarding what happened. It isn&#39;t credible, not because of irrational incredulity, but based on the real facts in evidence, and the truth at the heart of the matter - that the plane wasn&#39;t and could not have been flight 175.</p>

<p>Therefore for anyone to knowingly cover it up is a type of crime in and of itself, knowingly being the operative word.</p>

<p>The uninformed can be forgiven in their ignorance, but not the fully informed. </p>

<p>Therefore i have to support you P4T in your condemnation of Cobra for his efforts, even though i don&#39;t adopt a style of ridicule and mockery. It&#39;s worse than that. </p>

<p>Some people ought to step back and really think this through and think twice about their loyalties and allegiances and what it is they are trying to support, guard and protect, and by that i don&#39;t mean you. </p>

<p>This is serious business and i&#39;m sure more pilots will be along to inspect the data for themselves, some day.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not saying that didn&#39;t happen, but there&#39;s no way it could have happened the way we were led to believe and have since been told to believe. </p>

<p>It can&#39;t have been flight 175 and you damn well know it. </p>

<p>There is not one other single precedent of controlled flight at such an airspeed in the history of aviation for a commercial airliner, ever, even in the midst of any and every precedent you can come up with of diving, out of control planes hurtling to the earth under nothing but the force of gravity. </p>

<p>This plane outperformed them all. </p>

<p>Are you nuts? </p>

<p>It was a  military variant painted with the UA livery. No scientifically objective rational observer can honestly deduce otherwise, and most especially, if they themselves happen to be a pilot. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not believable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It did, but it wasn&#39;t a 767, and it was pulling 3-5 g in a spiral dive at the time. So it is a different case. A 737-400 has a VMO and a Vd 20 knots below a 767 and UA175 hit 510 knots in the last seconds before impact.</p>

<p>That was misleading, and you know it. Now i can see what Rob was talking about. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_Study--UA175 </p>

<h2>&quot;For much of it&#39;s final descent, UAL175 maintained a descent rate between 4000 feet per minute and 8000 feet per minute. During the descent from 12,000 feet to 6000 feet, the aircraft groundspeed remained between 500 - 520 knots. As the aircraft made it&#39;s final descent to 1000 feet, it ACCELERATED and impacted Word Trade Center tower #2 at approximately 510 knots groundspeed.&quot;</h2>

<p>So not only did it maintain 510 knots, for well over a minute, but it accelerated, post dive, to retain a 510+ knot airspeed (approx 515 adding the windspeed vector), and it did this in near sea level air density. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can tell you are not a pilot. You haven&#39;t factored in the changes in TAS during descent. 510 knots TAS, say at 10,000 feet is 438 EAS. Since this discussion is centred around EAS, lets keep it at that.</p>

<p>Here is the the Speed/Alt Data and an airspeed calculator. Note the airspeed is GROUNDSPEED.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.metabunk.org/sk/Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_StudyAA11_UA175_1.pdf">https://www.metabunk.org/sk/Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_StudyAA11_UA175_1.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.hochwarth.com/misc/AviationCalculator.html">http://www.hochwarth.com/misc/AviationCalculator.html</a></p>

<p>You can do the calculations yourself. At 5000 feet for example, the EAS is 454,  Vd + 34. That is done using nil wind and hence Groundspeed equals TAS. If you have access to any lowel level wind reports from the day, (I don&#39;t) you can convert the GS to an accurate TAS and therefore an accurate EAS.</p>

<p>With 20 seconds to go to impact the EAS was approx 461 or Vd +41. The aircraft accelerated from there. Remember that the Easyjet 737 landed safely after exceeding VD+60. UA175 didn&#39;t exceed VD+60 till about 12 seconds before impact.</p>

<p>And was the Easyjet in perfect flight control, as observed with &quot;UA175&quot;? </p>

<p>Also, airspeed can be calculated by simply adding the wind speed vector, which was very light and to the N/W as seen by the drifting smoke from the north tower, which adds just slightly to the ground speed for an airspeed aka TAS of 515kn, and of course you are well aware of what happens in terms of dynamic pressure due to the air density increase as a plane descends down into the lower strata of the atmosphere - so how was it able to accelerate after coming out of it&#39;s dive in near level flight, near sea level, to retain an airspeed exceeding 510 knots, and while executing the entire maneuver with what i would suggest was absolute perfection in regards to target acquisitioning and final orientation upon impact. It didn&#39;t &quot;almost miss&quot; and that final maneuver not not evidence of a &quot;loss of control&quot; but you of all people would know that, as a pilot, one would think..</p>

<p>No, it was not. In fact it lost more than 10,000 feet during the upset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He implied &quot;UA175&quot; was NOT in &quot;perfect&quot; control because of that final turning maneuver to remain on target, by suggesting that it &quot;almost missed&quot;..</p>

<p>However, when we play the tape back through in regards to the way and manner in which the buildings were destroyed by precision engineered CD, what we see, looking back in hindsight, is that the hit was rendered absolutely perfectly in the sense that the building hit lower down, <em>across multiple floors</em>, and at the higher rate of speed, &quot;fell&quot; first, with the &quot;collapses&quot; initiated around the impact areas, first the south tower, then the north in exactly same manner about a half hour later whereby the south tower destruction &quot;sells&quot; the north even though it &quot;fell&quot; from around the 95th floor to within a mere two or three seconds of absolute free fall for any freely dropped object in nothing but air alone, or in other words violating the laws of motion including conservation of momentum, if the official story is to be believed. It&#39;s what i call &quot;the foot of God hypothesis&quot; absent the use of precision timed explosives to bring the buildings down, as observed and as it actually occurred in reality, something that the NIST Report hardly addresses, if at all, calling what occurred simply &quot;inevitable&quot; once the conditions for a hypothetical collapse initiation point were reached (which they were not and couldn&#39;t have been, given the temperatures present and fire conditions), thereafter with the remaining intact structure offering practically &quot;no resistance&quot; and thus &quot;freefall&quot; (admitted to by NIST) &quot;as seen on TV&quot;. That&#39;s absurd, right there, by it&#39;s self evident nature, making of the plane impact and behavior of the plane worthy of close inspection, and lo and behold what do we see? </p>

<p>So it&#39;s not an argument of incredulity relative to what we might have been led to believe and have been told to believe and accept, but actual physical evidence under the lens of scientific analysis and deductive reasoning and logic, rendering the event itself as it occurred nothing but a murderous hoax of the very worst kind.</p>

<p>And then within this context, there&#39;s also the fireball magnitude (suspension of disbelief as to the causal mechanism of destruction), for the south tower impact, best achieved by a slightly diagonal impact, yet with the wingtips remaining within the horizontal width of the building, and on an angle hitting across multiple floors for maximal damage - quite the feat! eh?</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t <em>almost</em> miss, at all, and it was in perfect flight control with deft maneuvering, in order so that, the plane would hit on an angle, across multiple floors, and on a diagonal through the building producing that absolutely GARGANTUAN fireball. </p>

<p>Fireball (from across the Hudson River) <a href="http://911research.com/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/mdf50846.jpg">http://911research.com/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/mdf50846.jpg</a></p>

<p>Which is certainly by many orders of magnitude larger by far than it ought to have been and by that i am not referring simply to a dead-on instead of a slightly diagonal hit through the building.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re suggesting is that the plane never experienced any structural failure until it hit the ocean, and that there is only one debris field, with no separation and no loss of structural integrity prior to impact. and, that .99m at 22,000 ft (which equals 425 knots EAS) was not the fastest speed recorded, but that instead it was 463 KCAS at 17152 feet for an EAS of 443 knots - to show that a 767 can withstand all that punishment and hold together, all the way to it&#39;s final ocean impact. </p>

<p>I guess we&#39;re going to find out soon enough since anyone and everyone can read the NSTB crash report for themselves..</p>

<p>If so, you&#39;ve manged to move the benchmark up a few notches - even though it&#39;s still 67 knots less than flight 175 was recorded flying, while accelerating, post-dive in near sea level air density (ie: self propelled) to retain the 510 knot airspeed through to impact, and while executing about a 2.5g turning maneuver and PILOTED BY A COMPLETE NOVICE who was considered no better trained or skilled than Hani Hanjour of Pentagon Plane flying fame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Robert, lets analyse your techniques here.</p>

<p>You are adept at the Strawman argument... unless the person you are arguing with is aware of it. Which I am. You also seem to have great difficulty admitting errors.</p>

<p>First point. I did say that because that is what the report says. Refute that: It is what the report says before anything else. </p>

<p>Read my lips.. The NTSB report states categorically that there is no evidence to suggest that EA990 suffered any structural failure during the first dive, where it achieved VD+23 and MD+0.08, true or false?</p>

<p>Second point: You take out of context and is directly associated with the above claim. Read the first point and instead of trying to attack me.. address the claim.</p>

<p>Point 3: The benchmark referred to is 443 knots EAS. You gave me the CSV data yourself yet obviously didn&#39;t run it through your airspeed calculator. Your own FDR data unequivocally supports the max EAS of 443 knots. Correct or not?</p>

<p>Point 4. The debris field referred to by me included the reference to the two different fields, 1200 feet apart. To say otherwise is dissembling. Are you seriously suggesting an aircraft breaking up in level flight at 17000 feet, with a TAS of ~550 knots would have a debris field of 400 yards?</p>

<p>Point 5. You ignore how a debris field can change course by 60 degrees, indicating that it was an intact airframe being manoeuvered. Address that issue instead of the ad hominem attacks.</p>

<p>When you can cease the strawman, ad hominem and appeals to authority styles of argument, and can address the solid facts, then I might consider going to your forum. Until then it is a waste of my time.</p>

<p>People can read, &quot;Cobra&quot;. I won&#39;t even bother to get into your initial claims of a &quot;debris field&quot;, while you now backpedal after I corrected you on the word &quot;distinct&quot; used by the NTSB.</p>

<p>Again, people can read.</p>

<p>Your posts are misleading, twisting the words of the NTSB, while omitting the full details.</p>

<p>When and if you wish to learn about RADES data used by the NTSB, and why you have been so wrong on your first &quot;Seven sites&quot;, and then &quot;four sites&quot;... I will then teach you why and how the NTSB might think the airplane climbed nearly 10,000 feet without engine power.</p>

<p>It is a name I registered at ATS since the CEO of ATS has banned virtually anyone who posts information from P4T. In Fact, the CEO of ATS has accused us of shutting down his whole 9/11 Forum, while he moved threads to his &quot;Hoax&quot; forum based on a post in which some anonymous member posted a 767 manual created by Microsoft Flight Sim enthusiasts. (The CEO of ATS, in fact, lost a lot of support for such a decision... from both &quot;debunkers&quot; and &quot;truthers&quot; alike)</p>

<p>If you know anything about Pilots, or have ever visited a pilot forum, such as flightinfo.com, you will find many pilots who have porn star avatars and/or screenames. But considering you were born 1959, it is clear you are not as sharp as you perhaps once were with regard to the industry.</p>

<p>However...f you know anything about the cockpit, you might have encountered hidden porn?</p>

<p>Well, maybe not you.. .but many of the rest of real pilots have...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quick question: Do you acknowledge that an EAS near sea level of 510 knots represents the same dynamic pressure as 722 knots TAS or 1.19m at 22,000 ft alt? Isn&#39;t that a big problem in regards to over Vd/Md limits?</p>

<p>Also, since the south tower plane accelerated, post-dive, in level flight, to retain the 510 knot groundspeed (515 knots airspeed adjusted to include the windspeed vector, for a light wind to the N/W), don&#39;t we then have an issue or a big problem in regards to engine power and performance ie: to avoid compression stalling at such speed in near sea level air density? </p>

<p>I should point out that earlier, you seemed to be trying to give the impression that there was only one debris field, and no breakup of the aircraft prior to impact.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the RAT is deployed when there&#39;s a loss of engine power, with the plane presumably entering into a rather harrowing dive, it&#39;s design would almost certainly be strong enough to handle just such a circumstance and airflow, so i don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to assume that the moment it was &quot;dumped&quot; into the airstream, that it broke right off instantly or as the dive continued. Therefore i think it&#39;s fair to assume that something rather drastic had happened to the plane, even in the event that engines were restarted, with a second climb. And if in the first instance it was an intentional &quot;in control&quot; dive, then why are we to assume that the second one would be faster than the first? </p>

<p>The plane broke at .99M, doesn&#39;t mean it was all over, yet, but that&#39;s when the plane started breaking, when the FDR and transponder stopped. </p>

<p>Funny how, on the one hand you have the plane intact, never breaking up prior to ocean impact, with all damage occurring only during the second ascent, of unknown speed, but the moment that a RAT pops out to provide power to the FDR and FTC (is that the right acronym for the transponder beacon circuit?), you have it snapping off in the excessive airspeed...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point NAM.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that many jet aircraft/engines still produce electrical power even when the engines are in the &quot;cut-off&quot; position during flight. The Engine is still &quot;windmilling&quot; due to airspeed, which means the Alternator/Generators are also turning. Anyone who knows anything about Alternators/Generators knows that they produce electrical power when turning. They do not need jet fuel.</p>

<p>With that said, I do not claim to be a 767 pilot. But I can find out pretty quickly. &quot;Cobra1959&quot; claims to have flown the 767. </p>

<p>So I ask Cobra since he is here, do the engines on a 767 produce electrical power while windmilling? </p>

<p>In other words, does the engine &quot;cut-off&quot; switches also &quot;cut-off&quot; electrical power being supplied? </p>

<p>In every aircraft I have flown from piston to turbo-props to jet aircraft, the &quot;cut-off&quot; switches only inhibit fuel flow. There are separate switches for alternators/generators. Which means if the engines are windmilling, the engines are producing electrical power, regardless of the &quot;cut-off&quot; position.</p>

<p>In fact, you can start engines in flight from pure windmilling due to forward speed.</p>

<p>So what does it say in your &quot;manuals&quot;, Cobra1959?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what the electrics on your bugsmasher did, Robert, the GCU on the 767 monitors the current coming from the generator for undervoltage, overvoltage and correct amperage. When those values go out of range, it cuts off the supply.</p>

<p>This is because the generator supplies an AC bus that has many different systems on it, which are intolerant of those conditions and it usually has a backup source in either the other generator or the APU generator. When an engine is shut down, the bus ties open, letting the other IDG power the AC bus. When both are shut down, and the APU is shut down, there is no AC power available.  </p>

<p>It can power the AC bus, and is designed to do just that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just a layman, but that&#39;s what it does, providing power to the FDR and the transponder circuit the FTC i think it&#39;s called. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just a layman, but it seems to me that the plane must have broke, and that it wasn&#39;t simply a case of an engine shutdown, and if you&#39;re saying that the plane, after diving, with the accumulated dive speed re-ascended 10,000 feet WITHOUT ENGINE POWER, then i don&#39;t give a damn if you are a heavy pilot - that&#39;s just not possible. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re really stretching the bounds of credulity, in a whole host of ways, which I suppose is the reason that Rob&#39;s like a mongoose to your cobra, because of what you are trying to represent, and to promote, even to cover up, or mislead, with understanding and knowledge that that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing. Is it because you cannot believe that the alternative hypothesis could not possibility be true, or, did you come from the JREF &quot;truther&quot; haters, or do you REALLY believe it - that that aircraft was being flown like that at that speed by Marwan al-Shehhi..?! </p>

<p>That&#39;s disturbing, if you really are a Boeing certified active pilot, imho. </p>

<p>If you were NOT a pilot, but just an anti-truther person, then that would be understandable. </p>

<p>You really believe it? If so, then fair enough because everyone&#39;s entitled to believe in whatever they like, but to be honest it appears as if you are only concerned here in this thread with raising a &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; as if performing a duty. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the south tower plane accelerated in near sea level air density, to maintain a 510+ knots airspeed while doing what it did, with perfection, especially if one rolls the tape back through from self evident proof of CD of the twin towers (and building 7).</p>

<p>In other words it was perfection, and not a random fluke by a very lucky novice pilot who seemed to think that such speed was somehow vital to the mission, when the truth of the matter is that it&#39;s the other way around. </p>

<p>And you can&#39;t say that it just got away from him and that he was not in control, if you can even put the pilot there to begin within in light of the evidence.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with the testimony of Russ Wittenburg posted elsewhere in this thread? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t deflect here now - how you respond will tell much.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t reply to my other question about engine performance either, and that was rather conspicuous how you skipped right over that.</p>

<p>The 10000 ft climb. They checked it in the simulator. Read the report. It is there. I am just quoting the report. Do you realise the amount of momentum a 767 travelling at 550 TAS has? </p>

<p>I currently fly the Airbus A330, my last flight in the 767 was 9 years ago, however I have 6000 hours on it. Rob has my details, any doubts he express are street theatre for the audience because he realises the threat people like me are to his bogus video business.</p>

<p>Your argument style is called an argument from incredulity. You don&#39;t believe it could happen a certain way. That is not proof. It is just disbelief. Up to yesterday you were convinced that no aircraft had survived past Vd +5,  till I showed you that EA 990 certainly survived Vd+23 and the Easyjet 737 survived Vd +60 and landed safely.  So maybe you should examine a few more beliefs? One belief is that UA175 flew perfectly into the south tower. It didn&#39;t. It almost missed due to the crosswind .that was the reason for the split arsed turn at the last minute.</p>

<p>The engine performance... Show me the science behind the claim. Then I will address it. Turbofans regularly propel aircraft to supersonic speeds, 510 knots should not be a problem.</p>

<p>As I said, I may have access to a 767 sim in the next few weeks and should be able to fly and film the profile.  I will let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>How much of a lack of bleed air is there when 767 engines are windmilling at more than 400 knots?</p>

<p>You have failed to answer this question time and time again. Why is that?</p>

The 737 rudder anomalies was dealt with, in my airline anyway, by a Vref addition of something like 20 knots. I have never been on the fleet so can&#39;t comment much more than that. We don&#39;t fly the MD-80 so my knowledge of that accident comes from the usual literature.</p>

<p>And was the Easyjet in perfect flight control, as observed with &quot;UA175&quot;? </p>

<p>Also, airspeed can be calculated by simply adding the wind speed vector, which was very light and to the N/W as seen by the drifting smoke from the north tower, which adds just slightly to the ground speed for an airspeed aka TAS of 515kn, and of course you are well aware of what happens in terms of dynamic pressure due to the air density increase as a plane descends down into the lower strata of the atmosphere - so how was it able to accelerate after coming out of it&#39;s dive in near level flight, near sea level, to retain an airspeed exceeding 510 knots, and while executing the entire maneuver with what i would suggest was absolute perfection in regards to target acquisitioning and final orientation upon impact. It didn&#39;t &quot;almost miss&quot; and that final maneuver not not evidence of a &quot;loss of control&quot; but you of all people would know that, as a pilot, one would think..</p>

<p>However, when we play the tape back through in regards to the way and manner in which the buildings were destroyed by precision engineered CD, what we see, looking back in hindsight, is that the hit was rendered absolutely perfectly in the sense that the building hit lower down, <em>across multiple floors</em>, and at the higher rate of speed, &quot;fell&quot; first, with the &quot;collapses&quot; initiated around the impact areas, first the south tower, then the north in exactly same manner about a half hour later whereby the south tower destruction &quot;sells&quot; the north even though it &quot;fell&quot; from around the 95th floor to within a mere two or three seconds of absolute free fall for any freely dropped object in nothing but air alone, or in other words violating the laws of motion including conservation of momentum, if the official story is to be believed. It&#39;s what i call &quot;the foot of God hypothesis&quot; absent the use of precision timed explosives to bring the buildings down, as observed and as it actually occurred in reality, something that the NIST Report hardly addresses, if at all, calling what occurred simply &quot;inevitable&quot; once the conditions for a hypothetical collapse initiation point were reached (which they were not and couldn&#39;t have been, given the temperatures present and fire conditions), thereafter with the remaining intact structure offering practically &quot;no resistance&quot; and thus &quot;freefall&quot; (admitted to by NIST) &quot;as seen on TV&quot;. That&#39;s absurd, right there, by it&#39;s self evident nature, making of the plane impact and behavior of the plane worthy of close inspection, and lo and behold what do we see? </p>

<p>So it&#39;s not an argument of incredulity relative to what we might have been led to believe and have been told to believe and accept, but actual physical evidence under the lens of scientific analysis and deductive reasoning and logic, rendering the event itself as it occurred nothing but a murderous hoax of the very worst kind.</p>

<p>And then within this context, there&#39;s also the fireball magnitude (suspension of disbelief as to the causal mechanism of destruction), for the south tower impact, best achieved by a slightly diagonal impact, yet with the wingtips remaining within the horizontal width of the building, and on an angle hitting across multiple floors for maximal damage - quite the feat! eh?</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t <em>almost</em> miss, at all, and it was in perfect flight control with deft maneuvering, in order so that, the plane would hit on an angle, across multiple floors, and on a diagonal through the building producing that absolutely GARGANTUAN fireball. </p>

<p>Which is certainly by many orders of magnitude larger by far than it ought to have been and by that i am not referring simply to a dead-on instead of a slightly diagonal hit through the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was thinking but there was zero gore and it wasn&#39;t cut for long periods of time. I used to edit videos for a website so I&#39;m somewhat familiar with it although by far not an expert. Think of this... you&#39;re watching video and the camera has a bit of shake to it like someone is walking around.  Back then, only really high end cameras had the stabilization so shakey video was commonplace.  You see people walking around, talking and laughing, eating hotdogs and drinking soda. Your eyes are telling you something is strange but you can&#39;t see what it is.  Then something dawns on you.  There&#39;s a burning plane with firefighters teeing to put out the fire around it and these people are just walking around like it&#39;s another Tuesday. The video never actually breaks, it&#39;s literally a 15 minute video without scene changes. It still didn&#39;t look right but the quality isn&#39;t fantastic and you can&#39;t quite out your finger on it.  While scrubbing through frame by frame, the video seems to glitch like a computer or video game.  Perhaps it&#39;s just a cheap camera.  As you scrub more, you notice that the camera is moving but sometimes the elements in the video stay for two or three frames.  That could be another processing issue.  What really got me was the people would randomly stop moving... All of them sometimes.  There was zero gore anywhere in the entire thing despite all the people walking around.</p>

<p>What I got from it is that there were at least two videos layered on top of one another.  The reason I think there were more is because sometimes not all of the elements would stop at the same time. Perhaps some of the people would stop this time for five frames but not as many as before.  A vehicle driving would do the same.  What never stopped was the fire and the firefighters.</p>

<p>Later in the video, portraits were shown of each person that died, one by one. Then, the pictures of the two pilots that collided were shown.  They were sentenced for murder.  In the beginning of the video, the camera person caught the actual crash. There were no ejections but the pilots weren&#39;t even hospitalized.  I read up on the crash because I didn&#39;t think think there was anything wrong with the video aside from the fact that it had no sound.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the video and everything is legit. I&#39;m willing to keep am open mind about that along with everything else.  This happened before downloading videos and banning videos was commonplace, so I unfortunately don&#39;t have a copy. I showed the video to people that had more experience with videography and it baffled them.  Only one person game me any kind of conclusion and he said that he&#39;d love to get the raw footage directly from the camera, if it exists. Being professionals, they didn&#39;t want it known they had watched such a provocative video.</p>
