       It is psychopaths/sociopaths that is the problem.

       What do Nazis and Zionists have in common? They each have psychopathic characteristics.

       The we are the master race/God's chosen people, and all others are but cattle.

       I think it's genetic. There's no proof of this yet, but I'm convinced that psychopathy has nothing to do with upbringing.

       I disagree. I believe it is a result from environment....  But here is some evidence that you could look at from either your perspective or mine.

       Good question. I think the Holocaust was meant to kill off Jews with their wealth transferring to European leaders.  The Queen of England's husband went to a Nazi camp as a youth.  America's wealthiest businessmen supported Europe's fascist movements.  Sadly the Nazi's had a lot of outside support for their fascism and antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Nazi's lost, the world powers were forced to change strategies and made Jewish people their allies.  The people of Israel are used as a pawn to further the rest of the world's corporate interests in the Middle East.  Every Israeli citizen is required to be in the military.  This creates a mindset conducive to the West's military interests in the region.  Israel supports the West colonizing the Middle East because it would make them safer than countries being ruled by Muslim governments. Israel is essentially a military outpost for the Western world.  I don't think Israel knows they are more pawn than ally to the United States.

       I could not agree more.
      </p>
      <p>
       H do you feel about the role of the united state's creation in this game? Was it not the same version back in 1776, or so? Sure, not all the parallels are there. But as you point out the strategy must be adapted for the situation and I do not think the technology of the time necessitated the identical militaristic structure of Israel.

       Follow the money that backs both of those sides. Zionists are not true Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why its hilarious that there's a Rothschild Blvd in Tel Aviv. The Rothschilds funded Hitler to exterminate real Jews while fake jews took over Israel. There's a difference between Ashkenazi and Sephardic jews.

       People seem to forget that there was a mass exodus of rich Jewish people out of Russia &amp; Germany leaving poor Jewish people behind. Rich Jewish families didn't suffer at all they just packed up and moved all of their assets out. It's the poor Jewish people that suffered. Rich people usually get rich because they maintain a flexible morality and without remorse. It's not because they are such hard workers.

       I think it's misleading to call Moses Hess the first German National Socialist. In fact, I don't think that's true at all. Hess was a German who was a socialist, and a proto-zionist. There's a big difference between a German who was a socialist and a German National Socialist.

       National Socialist is synonymous with Nazi:

       Hess died in 1875. German "National Socialism" wasn't created until 1919. Pointing to a Jewish guy who was German, and a socialist, isn't identifying "the first German National Socialist" at all.

       No. Nazi=National Socialist. National Socialism didn't exist as an ideology when Hess was alive. Karl Marx was also a German who was a socialist. Karl Marx was not "one of the first Nazis" or a National Socialist, as, again, national socialism is different than socialism and one didn't exist in Marx's, or Hess', lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up "National Socialism" - read about its creation in 1919 and its tenets. Then do the same for "Socialism"- they are distinct ideologies.

      <p>
       National Socialism is an ideology that did not exist when Hess existed. I thought you were confused and thought that Socialism and National Socialism were the same thing. Apparently, you understand that as you recognize that Marx, who was also a German Socialist, wasn't a National Socialist. The tenets that Hess espoused are different from those of National Socialism, which did not exist when Hess did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hess was not "the first Nazi." The Nazis, and national socialism, did not exist concurrent with Hess. Therefore, Hess could not have been a National Socialist. It's really very simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, look up National Socialism. It is synonymous with Nazism. You may wish to dispute that, but you'd be arguing against encyclopedias and accepted historical fact.

       This is what Wikipedia says about it. It appears to me that Nazis
       <strong>
        sometimes

       , at least, referred to themselves as Nazis, and that it was considered an insult by some in Austria.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The term Nazi derives from the first two syllables of Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP, Nazi Party).[18] The German term Nazi parallels the term Sozi (pronounced /zoːtsi/), an abbreviation of Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (Social Democratic Party of Germany).[19][20]
        <strong>
         Members of the NSDAP referred to themselves as Nationalsozialisten (National Socialists), rarely as Nazis
        </strong>
        . In 1933, when Adolf Hitler assumed power of the German government, usage of the term Nazi diminished in Germany, although Austrian anti-Nazis continued to use the term as an insult.[20]

       This is what I really take exception with. I don't believe that Hess promoted an ideology that was a form of fascism that incorporated

       Hess was a socialist. He was a proto-zionist. It's inaccurate to describe him as a proto-National Socialist, as that ideology specifically involves things he, himself, did not promote.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be making the argument that this Jewish man was promoting a strong Jewish nationalist agenda that was fascist and anti-Jewish. It doesn't make sense and it isn't true.

      <p>
       Proto-Zionist, yes, absolutely. Proto-antisemtic Nazi (National Socialist)? Of course not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume we agree that Hess, in his promotion of Jewish Nationalism, wasn't also promoting an ideology, National Socialism, that, by definition, is characterized by antisemitism.

       No bad faith at all. I've been looking into it earnestly. I've even found claims that Moses Hess coined the term "National Socialist"- unfortunately, these claims are all made solely on racist websites that also feature, literally, men in KKK robes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racist websites make the claim that he coined the term in "Rome and Jerusalem," and, from the, admittedly, little I've read of this, I can't find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I look at what Hess actually wrote, it is inarguable that the tenets he promoted are not congruous with what is the accepted definition of National Socialism- Nazism.

      <p>
       Advocating Socialism and advocating Jewish Nationalism don't equate with having anything to do with Nazism. We should be able to concur on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as much of a stretch as saying Marx was the proto-National Socialist if he had also argued for Jewish Nationalism. Is that all it takes in your mind? A German Socialist who was a proto-zionist is, somehow, automatically, "one of the first Nazis"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely, there must be more criteria to fit "being one of the first Nazis" then being a German socialist proto-zionist, right??
      </p>
      <p>
       National Socialism is defined as Nazism. I know you understand this, because you, literally, referred to Hess as "one of the first Nazis." Come on, now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hess wrote about his appreciation for the ideals of the French revolution, for democracy, and for the rights of the people. He wasn't a proto-National Socialist who promoted ideas of fascism, and he certainly wasn't a Jew who loathed other Jews.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No, the NSDAP was characterized by anti-semitism (as Jews were seen as outsiders attempting to subvert German national interests), specifically, not the entire ideology of National Socialism (as evidenced by your own citation, which contains a typo). Socialism is abhorrent in all its forms, though there is no need to lie about fundamental aspects of one iteration or another, in order to elicit a negative emotional response.
       </p>

       The NSDAP
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       National Socialism. You're speaking as if there was National Socialism as it was put into effect under Hitler, and National Socialism as we know it under Regime X.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are synonymous. Nazism
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       National Socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be interesting to me to know if Hess actually coined the term, but, even if he had, what he wrote about is not at all what Hitler put into effect. Look at some of the excerpts of what he wrote- prophetic, yes, but not consistent with Nazism. Calling him "one of the first Nazis" is beneath your intellect, I believe.
      </p>
