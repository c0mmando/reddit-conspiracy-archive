          This screenshot was taken when this thread was mostly dead in r/conspiracy, but number 1 in r/conspiratard. The rest of this thread is just extra evidence like screenshots of the rank to prove nobody from

       I want to first mention that every comment I made was upvoted. Some were at plus 3, some plus 9, etc. Then conspiratard linked to it, and I only captured the screenshot when most of my comments were beginning to be negative. So the normal trajectory of my comments was on the positive side, then this thread slid far down the ranks (meaning nobody from conspiracy would be in there), and my comments suddenly became downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thread as it is right now:

       Here's the brigade thread:

       Here is a second brigade link, but it is in the comments of another post in r/conspiratard

       I asked one of the commenters how they found the thread, they said they found it in r/conspiratard, clicked the link, then posted in that thread. You can also check how many of the people in there are conspiratard users. The thread is full of them.

       I think part of the problem with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , which was what the OP in the "huddle" thread was getting at, is that people won't monitor the new queue and simply vote up or down.  Everything ends up with this big mess of meta-content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another part, is that we feed every troll that comes along in the comments. Very seldom do I see a "whatever dude" response followed by silence.  We call them a shill and then respond to each one of their 20 responses.

       I definitely agree. But that's not going to stop them from linking to specific threads and manipulating the votes around by up to 25 points each comment and then upvoting each other as well so we all have to read their troll posts.

       They brigade all kinds of subs who don't care about them. They even brigade r/bitcoin. That's just what they do. If we ignore it, they will just blatantly brigade all day long. If ignoring them will make them go away, then why are they brigading other subs who ignore them?

       I honestly think that you are doing the right thing by reporting it to the admins.  If the
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       members are brigading then those members need to held accountable, and the admins are the only people who can actually adjudicate.

       I would like to ask if you could change the links external to our sub that you used in your submission into "no participation" links.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g. "
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/somepost">
        www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/somepost
       </a>
       " into "np.reddit.com
       <a href="/r/conspiratard/somepost">
        /r/conspiratard/somepost
       </a>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this might be easily bypassed but let's not go that way; they don't care if they started first or we did it, they will always point out that we are the ones that brigade, even though they are the ones that are constantly xposting our own threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you guys can't ignore them at least don't give them more reasons to annoy us even more.

       has ever legitimately called for a vote brigade.  At least I've never seen someone say "hey everyone go over here and upvote/downvote."  That's not the point of

       It's pretty obvious r/conspiratard finds some r/conspiracy posts funny, and when they get to the front page of r/conspiratard their users find it and vote as they please. There is no dark plan, it's just natural.

       The internet points matter when you're trying to have a discussion and everything you guys don't like gets buried. This isn't r/conspiratard, so I'm not sure why you're trying to make it an extension of your sub by having all of these troll bridges over here, participating in those threads, and voting the way you guys see fit.
      </p>

       You guys obviously brigaded that thread, so I guess your last defense would be to make it sound funny and pathetic.

       You gotta know that no one ever calls for brigading over in
       <a href="/r/conpiratard">
        /r/conpiratard
       </a>
       .  It's a bannable offense per the rules of the subreddit in the sidebar.  Users will do what they will though and it's not really possible or desirable to police the voting habits of all of
       <a href="/r/conpiratard">
        /r/conpiratard
       </a>
       or reddit in general.  You also really need to consider that the bulk of the people that are seeing your little meltdowns are subscribers to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  If you're way in the negatives, it means that (for sure) the people viewing your paranoia aren't at least upvoting to keep shit even.  Either they're A) not supporting you or B) adding to the downvote count.

       <a href="/r/conspiratard">

       Right, and a few people from your sub were banned a couple weeks ago for participating in a vote brigade, and they all made a post claiming they didn't brigade. One was

       What I'm saying is get a fucking life. If you  people disagree with the views of this sub then why do you care what goes on in it? The entire point of Conspiratard is to act better than others. It's childish bullshit. If you have to sit and discuss how others are stupid and how much better you are than them to feel good about yourself then you need to reexamine yourself as a person.

       I think you just succinctly summed up the problem of all subreddits dedicated to complaining about other subreddits.

      <p>
       Why people simply can't do whatever the hell interests them and leave others to do whatever the hell interests
       <em>
        them

       is beyond me.

       Yea, they get banned and then make new accounts. And lately, you guys have been posting a lot of direct links (not .np), which wouldn't really matter anyways as this post shows. Even if you use .np, your buddies over there still decide to replace it with www and vote. That's just pathetic. You guys really care that much about the votes in this sub?

       Hi conspiratard :)
      </p>
      <p>
       See, I can't vote right now because I clicked a link over there, then came here to respond. I'm not going to be a pathetic troll and delete the np and replace with www so that my vote can count.

       It's very clear that once a post is linked in the tard sub, users immediately jump to this sub and start downvoting in not insignificant numbers. Are you really still trying to debate that?

       I think the naivete of that argument speaks volumes to the general perspective over there.

       or even the admins handing out blanket bans or whatever.  I mean, you personally seem privy to the numbers and you're not a mod or an admin right?  They must have even more information than you and yet here we are.

       You guys moan about getting banned all the time. I'm really not that interested in the drama, I just wanted to point out that the argument you're posing had no relevance in reality.

       It's as simple as crosspost from that sub severely influence the voting and discussion here.  If you're just being a contrarian by arguing that point, fine.  But if you believe that it's not true, there's an issue with the critical thinking process.

       You gotta know that no one ever calls for brigading over in
       <a href="/r/conpiratard">
        /r/conpiratard
       </a>
       .  It's a bannable offense per the rules of the subreddit in the sidebar.  Users will do what they will though and it's not really possible or desirable to police the voting habits of all of
       <a href="/r/conpiratard">
        /r/conpiratard
       </a>
       or reddit in general.  You also really need to consider that the bulk of the people that are seeing your little meltdowns are subscribers to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  If you're way in the negatives, it means that (for sure) the people viewing your paranoia aren't at least upvoting to keep shit even.  Either they're A) not supporting you or B) adding to the downvote count.
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       is all about things that are funny and pathetic.  That's literally the whole point of the subreddit.  Have an upvote, on me!
