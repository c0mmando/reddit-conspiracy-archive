       Wouldn't that just be easier/less complex to overthrow? Also if we're all members of the

       Go to any supermarket and you'l see an anarchic society in action. No self-appointed ruler is demanding that anyone do anything. If someone wants to quit they may do so without punishment of prison or death. If someone doesn't want to buy something they may do so without fear of prison or death. Laws are imaginary. If you think that your friends and family will start raping and burning just because an imaginary thing is shown to be imaginary I think you should hang out with better people.

       This is disgusting oversimplification of the issue.

       Sugar has been shown to be addictive, so no, not everyone has a choice in what they purchase at the grocery.

       Many people work minimum wage jobs in the grocery store because nothing else is available at the moment or it's the only viable occupation for them at that point in their lives.

       .  That is a complete misunderstanding of what the majority of anarchism stands for.  Granted there are varying flavors.  But that is an incredible fallacy.  Slippery slope is the name.  It could be argued that the state is the source of violence.  Needing control from the barrel of a gun.

       So Muslims killing Muslims is genocide?  Is that really Muslim related or skin color related and happens to be done by Muslims?  23% of the world follows Islam.  Are you trying to claim that due to the acts of a small minority is representative of about 1.6 billion humans?  We could say the same thing.  Or we could call it "religious growing pains" since Islam is younger than Christianity and Judaism and they as countries have worked that out of their system.  But I bet you just hate Muslims

Governments are really good at poorly redistributing riches, applying unnecessary laws, spying on people, cultivating ignorance and repressing knowledge.

       Its about the ratio of representation. When a small group of people represent a very large group of people, it is impossible to achieve reprrsentation of everyones voice. When the ratio is more even, i.e., when a bigger group of people represent a larger (but smaller than in the first example) group, then it is much more efficient at representing the voices of the individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it is about control and power. When a handful of people control the voice of a much larger population, they hold much more power than an individual within that population. Thats why tyranny is looked down upon, all the power rests in the hands of one person, while the voices of the rest are stifled. This leads to abuse of power and corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, extrapolate this to a global scale.

       You see a one-world government is playing directly into the hands of us Anarchists because you're forcing us to act, forcing our hand so to speak. But it also unites us, paradoxically since we no longer have to argue about which national super-power is the worst and whom should be destroyed first. We will have one target and we will be able to direct the proletariat to destroying it because we will inherit powers we have never known before upon the manifestation of our worst enemy.
