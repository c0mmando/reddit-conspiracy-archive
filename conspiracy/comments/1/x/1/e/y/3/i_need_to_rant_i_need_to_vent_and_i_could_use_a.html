        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tldr: I&#39;m full of anxiety living in a world that is so fuckerd and I&#39;d like to know how to deal.</p>

<p>My cousins had a Christmas party during a Chicago Blackhawks game. I&#39;m a die hard fan. For those not familiar with Blackhawk games we cheer and yell during the national anthem. My uncle said he wished our fans would shut up during the national anthem. I said why shouldn&#39;t we be excited and exuberant during our country&#39;s anthem? My brother chimed in with the veterans that stand next to the guy singing the anthem line up to do it.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s bothering me is I can&#39;t wrap my head around why anyone would have this line of thought when our rights are visibly being destroyed? Why would a veterans opinion be be more valid than mine? How is enlisting magically make you a better person than those who don&#39;t? How can one support the troops in a system that doesn&#39;t? When 140 people control pretty much everything? When r/news and r/conspiracy look exactly the same?</p>

<p>How do you deal? The world eels like it&#39;s closing in around me and I would like help on how to deal with it. I want to shut off my all my news feeds and hide from what&#39;s going on but what good would that do?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna add a tldr at the top. That was a lot of words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest you turn your attention away from the outside world and turn it inward.  </p>

<p>Take it from a former crazy, anxiety filled conspiracy theorist.   When shit on the outside is affecting you, you need to focus on yourself.   Don&#39;t let the world win.  I shit you not, Bob Marley and dwelving into the rastafari movement got me thinking on an inner level.   After this brief stage I moved into studying other spiritual and religious texts,mentally I&#39;m calmer and balanced.  Physically I am in the best shape of my life at the age of 29.  </p>

<p>Yes, the world Is fucked up. Stay strong.  You&#39;re not the only one who doesn&#39;t worship todays Roman soldiers or their anthems.</p>

<p>Be thankful you woke up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One aspect of waking up is to realize that organized sports are a deliberate control mechanism used by the elite to keep the people in a passive, accepting condition. Stop watching all professional sports. Just stop it, it is a waste of your time and the wrong use for all your emotion and passion. Direct that passion toward something that really matters, not whether some steroid junkie can carry a fucking ball over a line on the ground.</p>

<p>Evidence that voting is very important and still counts.<br/>
The continuous and constant efforts to prevent people from voting. </p>

<p>If you surrender to hopelessness, they win.  My advise to the young adults in my circle of family friends, stay hopeful, focus on clawing out some kind of life and stay focused on going forward.  Do not submit to feelings of despair.  </p>
