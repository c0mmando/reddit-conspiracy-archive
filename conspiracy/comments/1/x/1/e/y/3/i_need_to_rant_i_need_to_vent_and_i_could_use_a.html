       Tldr: I'm full of anxiety living in a world that is so fuckerd and I'd like to know how to deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       My cousins had a Christmas party during a Chicago Blackhawks game. I'm a die hard fan. For those not familiar with Blackhawk games we cheer and yell during the national anthem. My uncle said he wished our fans would shut up during the national anthem. I said why shouldn't we be excited and exuberant during our country's anthem? My brother chimed in with the veterans that stand next to the guy singing the anthem line up to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's bothering me is I can't wrap my head around why anyone would have this line of thought when our rights are visibly being destroyed? Why would a veterans opinion be be more valid than mine? How is enlisting magically make you a better person than those who don't? How can one support the troops in a system that doesn't? When 140 people control pretty much everything? When r/news and r/conspiracy look exactly the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you deal? The world eels like it's closing in around me and I would like help on how to deal with it. I want to shut off my all my news feeds and hide from what's going on but what good would that do?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gonna add a tldr at the top. That was a lot of words.

       I suggest you turn your attention away from the outside world and turn it inward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take it from a former crazy, anxiety filled conspiracy theorist.   When shit on the outside is affecting you, you need to focus on yourself.   Don't let the world win.  I shit you not, Bob Marley and dwelving into the rastafari movement got me thinking on an inner level.   After this brief stage I moved into studying other spiritual and religious texts,mentally I'm calmer and balanced.  Physically I am in the best shape of my life at the age of 29.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the world Is fucked up. Stay strong.  You're not the only one who doesn't worship todays Roman soldiers or their anthems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be thankful you woke up.

       One aspect of waking up is to realize that organized sports are a deliberate control mechanism used by the elite to keep the people in a passive, accepting condition. Stop watching all professional sports. Just stop it, it is a waste of your time and the wrong use for all your emotion and passion. Direct that passion toward something that really matters, not whether some steroid junkie can carry a fucking ball over a line on the ground.

       We're already serfs working for the banks. It's crushing, and I don't know what to do. R/politics and r/news would suggest voting and getting involved, but to me it looks like the system is too broke to operate with in the system.

       Anxiety is a thing.  You're not gonna change the world in the short term, so all you can do is change your reaction to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact:  there are a lot of good, amazing, wonderful things out there to focus on.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I understand, you've gotta train yourself 1) to recognize when you are having a physical reaction to mental anxiety, and 2) to look the away from situations you can't immediately change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way through is to focus on the meta, on what you can change.

       To everyone on this thread who is advising not voting, that is the goal, to get you to surrender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that voting is very important and still counts.
       <br/>
       The continuous and constant efforts to prevent people from voting.

      <p>
       If you surrender to hopelessness, they win.  My advise to the young adults in my circle of family friends, stay hopeful, focus on clawing out some kind of life and stay focused on going forward.  Do not submit to feelings of despair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make fun of the increasingly ridiculous methods used to get us to quit and surrender.

       I vote. Almost religiously, and every time I do I feel that I've done nothing. I vote 3rd party that never wins or I vote for the least of shit. When can we win?

       The voting system is honestly a big joke, think a car that has only two options left or right... we go in circles, never forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Awoken votes are scattered thin to whatever causes are left over after the left right circle car burns all the other votes.

       That is your view, it is a view created and injected into the dialog because the conservatives/Republicans have no record to run on, the only tactic is to claim they are the same.

       I'm just saying whatever true votes are left are scattered among the wind, thrown at other causes that eventually fall apart, when will we be able to outvote the zombie herd?

       You slow down your personal shit and find some basic respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you pulled this in other places your entire family might be wiped out. North Korea, China, India...
      </p>
      <p>
       You find a personal moment between yourself, your Uncle to 'shoot the shit'.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an 'elder', an parent, of two kids that served, of their own volition, you're not wrong, nor are you right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calm your anxious rant, right here, right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's real what they're enduring and your position is legitimate too!
      </p>
      <p>
       Go take a walk, where you are, if you're safe to do so and really take it all in!
      </p>
      <p>
       Look! 
Listen!

       Anxiety is a thing.  You're not gonna change the world in the short term, so all you can do is change your reaction to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact:  there are a lot of good, amazing, wonderful things out there to focus on.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I understand, you've gotta train yourself 1) to recognize when you are having a physical reaction to mental anxiety, and 2) to look the away from situations you can't immediately change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way through is to focus on the meta, on what you can change.
