       Good question, difficult answers.  It is hard to say what is "fact"- I'd start Googling the event and read "official" stories. Watch the "official" videos from the AP and the major media and news. Then, start to read smaller independent news sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't go straight to "conspiracy theory videos"-  you want to make up your own mind on this. And unfortunately, there isn't a good concise place for facts that I've found.. Yet. If I do, I'll share immediately.

       Are you saying a family member of a lottery representative won the lottery twice?  WTF!!!!!  Have you sent this information to the Connecticut Lottery Commission? Super illegal - Surprised this hasn't got more attention.

       For the big ones, this is quite common.  It's very likely that most state lotteries are poor people taxes for a rigged game of chance.

       I don't mind fact gathering, but reporting loosely gathered information like that isn't a place I feel comfortable or safe sticking my nose. If it pertained to an injured person, or something more solid, or more egregious, I would not hesitate to report it instantly.

       I wonder how much money the person invested into the lottery.  It is possible that he is just a lottery fanatic and spent a lot of money to boost his chances.  Still interesting though.

       Statistically speaking, even buying thousands of tickets does not drastically raise your chances.  Were talking million to one odds or far greater.  Hitting twice, then being involved in an obvious state false flag is not just highly suspicious, but further proof of lies.

       So, the name Zygmont- is what..... 3 brothers who have a genetic affinity for gambling?

      <p>
       Edit: Not saying Zygmont has anything to do with Sandy Hook- saying that something is up with a Lottery system where multiple families, rare names, win multiple times within a short time period. Further statistical anomalies.

       I'm not even saying it is a "bad rig"-  maybe the Lotto gives to families in need "secretly"-- who knows.

       Is it sad that I don't even know you, and you certainly don't know me, and that actually hurt my feelings.... not for me so much as for those people you speak to this way- so much anger- and, for what purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am intelligent, and I am college educated, just started PhD work, and I've had a very good career so far in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       This topic of "conspiracy" is fascinating, interesting, confusing, a little weird, and sometimes it's fun. The Sandy Hook issues stick out to me as an absolute list of anomalies; and no on can say it is not a worthy topic to investigate. It is a tragedy no matter what the truth is about it. I don't put the type of time and care into posts on Reddit that I would put into this if I were at work conducting an investigation and writing a report, no. And so sometimes I simply don't feel like compiling a well thought out argument/response, or my kids yelling for something in the other room, or there's laundry to be done, and shoveling and life.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no- sometimes, I just toss my hands up here and don't plan out a very well thought out response. You're absolutely right. But telling me to "shut the fuck up unless I know what I'm talking about" is just quite rude and unnecessary. You're a rather angry little person, aren't you?

       That is a fair response. And you're completely right on the first part. If this is a cut and dried, straight issue- if everything the media and police reported on was just how it happened (and all the errors, inconsistencies etc were complete coincidences and shoddy work etc) and there is NO conspiracy here, then I am at fault, and that is sad.

       Because of the sheer size of the zoning district for the school. There are many, many streets that would (according to where the other 66% of victims are from) that are from a not TOO concentrated area. The other victims also are from streets with either one other victim, or someone "significant" to the investigation, or who interjected themselves into Associated Press interviews.
      </p>

       I don't know what it means. I keep saying this guys. All I'm saying is it is unusual.

       I totally see your point, and about this list- I did this as well. And I didn't see much there, until I started to think..... if there were a shooting in this small town I live in, comparable to Sandy Hook, and 3 victims were from the same street- sure not a large #, and it is a large street etc etc-- but it would still be noteworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, for example-- Yogananda = 1 victim BUT Yogananda also = Nancy&amp;Adam Lanza's address.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know....
       <em>
        sigh
       </em>
       ....I kind of just noticed all of these anomalies, and yes- each one, on its own,  not a huge deal. Many things are easy to dismiss, brush off.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this whole thing about how
       <em>
        MANY
       </em>
       people on Berkshire have victims, relatives, or something to do with the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Sigh again
       </em>
       .... I don't know.  I just
       <em>
        KNOW
       </em>
       something is wrong here. There are many conspiracy theories I don't "buy into", and this was one of them for awhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't take this lightly, but in my heart, I just know something is wrong with this.

       The lottery thing is odd to me (not related to the shooting) but the addresses don't raise any suspicion, in my opinion. I agree that there are a whole list of anomalies but I don't think this is one of them.

       You're acting like it's all done.  Mission accomplished?  No, this is simply a step in their slow roll forward infringing on the god given rights of man.  These are not constitutional guarantees, but inherent rights that will always exist.  Unless we give them up willingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about this deeper.  It's very sad your depth of knowledge of history is so poor as to not see this clearly.

       The theory is that these people are not who they appear to be and that they are black ops agents who play whatever roll serves TPTB. A fake lottery winning would be a convenient way to pay the person "off the books"
