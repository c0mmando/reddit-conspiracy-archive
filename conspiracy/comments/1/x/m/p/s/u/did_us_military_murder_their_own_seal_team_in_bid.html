    <div class="md"><p>The reason the SEALs were telling their families to wipe social sites was due to Obozos team breaking protocol to take take credit by telling the world that SEAL team 6 killed Bin Laden.  You do not do that..ever..unless you are a power hungry prog libby piece of shit like Obozo/Clinton.  The president basically painted a target on the families of all SEAL&#39;s for petty political points.</p>

<p>Read it again. Just about every soldier already has wills prepared. Not talking about the SEALs being noobs. FFS. It is not odd behaviour. Their commanders would have reminded them again to every now and then update your wills. They may have been going on another high-risk mission perhaps? So, just another friendly reminder to make sure your will is up to date. </p>

<p>Every now and then those SEAL soldiers would need to get their wills updated...every since they entered military. Hello, they&#39;re human, everyone should have a will and when assets change you update it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they&#39;ve been in the military long enough to make it to seal team 6 and they&#39;re just considering a will all of a sudden? You might be right but when the parents mention it as odd behaviour I don&#39;t think you can just write it off as typical military stuff. Especially considering the fact that these were not people new to the military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well maybe being anxious and stressed of a newer high-risk mission coupled with wanting to update will again was seen as odd, but not will-updates alone. </p>

<p>Updating will is pretty normal standard behaviour for most people, especially those in high risk careers. </p>

<p>I guess all the ones brought down by enemy fire were secretly done by US Stinger missiles to cover up raids and lies the US wants no one to know... Are you guys seriously upvoting a guy to the top post that I can debunk within seconds? <strong>THAT&#39;S</strong> what conspiracy is about? Making up a claim, with 0 evidence, and everyone jumps on the bandwagon like it&#39;s fucking gospel? Fuck, this is why no one can take this sub seriously anymore...</p>

<p>The Taliban even stated to reporters they knew the exact flight path the helo would take, because Afghanistan is, well, mountainous. Helos tend to fly through the same valleys repeatedly, due to the risk of flying high enough to clear the mountains. Helos can only operate safely below a certain level above sea level, and the winds coming across a mountain would reak havoc on controlling the helo. </p>

<p>Maybe some of the guys from DEVGRU dying in that crash <strong>IS</strong> suspicious, but you&#39;re blatantly lying and making up facts to support your own view. You don&#39;t need to lie and deny facts, in order for the events of that day to be suspicious.</p>

Those are just ones I pulled from memory with zero research. Do you actually want me to research more? Hell we had a fucking STEALTH aircraft shot down by a bunch of rebel serbs in Bosnia. Sometimes people get a lucky shot in</p>

<p>Published: July 11, 2002 </p>

<p>PARIS — Osama bin Laden is dead. The news first came from sources in Afghanistan and Pakistan almost six months ago: the fugitive died in December and was buried in the mountains of southeast Afghanistan. Pakistan&#39;s president, Pervez Musharraf, echoed the information. The remnants of Osama&#39;s gang, however, have mostly stayed silent, either to keep Osama&#39;s ghost alive or because they have no means of communication.</p>

<p>With an ego the size of Mount Everest, Osama bin Laden would not have, could not have, remained silent for so long if he were still alive. He always liked to take credit even for things he had nothing to do with. Would he remain silent for nine months and not trumpet his own survival?</p>

<p>Also, it may be the biggest single event to cause this many deaths, but that could be a single coincidence. You should also know that not every soldier in Seal Team Six are on one helicopter...and not all of them neccesarily participated in the killing of Osama Bin Laden.</p>

<p>What are the names of the people involved in the OBL raid?</p>

<p>Unless you have that information this is a deliberately misleading line IMO as it cannot be determined one way or another.
I think there are quite a few strange things surrounding this incident that need to be looked into and the least compelling one of them is the idea that there could have been OBL raid members on board.</p>

<p>The assertion I <em>do</em> want to make is that just because ST6 was involved in both the OBL raid and the shootdown does <em>not</em> mean that the OBL raiders were the ones who were killed. It&#39;s an assumption that I don&#39;t find very credible - and based on your comment about that theory being &quot;the least compelling,&quot; I suspect that we&#39;re probably on the same page there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah cheers, I think we&#39;re mostly on board.</p>

<p>I guess the bin laden angle is what gave this story traction so it&#39;s still there, but like you, I&#39;d like to see some sort of verification that these were the same people involved in the OBL raid. (even if it&#39;s just the families reporting it which is a start)
The stuff uncovered by the families certainly raises some eye brows though. I hope more comes out as they keep digging.</p>

<p>Bullshit.  CTs would simply move the goal post on what it would take to convince them.  &quot;Oh you think that&#39;s his real body? It&#39;s clearly a body made to look like him.&quot; or &quot;Obviously his body was frozen and they thawed it out when they needed it.&quot;</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t the show the photograph? They didn&#39;t want to incite any extra unneeded retaliation against our military overseas. I remember you saying &quot;What about Sadam&quot; First off he wasn&#39;t the face of insurgency in Iraq at the time, he was hated by them also. Second the US wasn&#39;t the one who filmed and released that video. So I don&#39;t think you even know what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Of course the government lies, but making shit up about the government without evidence doesn&#39;t mean shit. What is your evidence man? I have yet to hear a single thing from you that proves your point.</p>

The more interesting part of this is that they had just completed a &quot;high risk&quot; mission if the had indeed killed Osama. Normally they would have been immediately taken out of country to be debriefed. Not flying around in Afghanistan.

<p>First, neither of those. Second, the MH-47 Chinooks used in these types of operations (SOCOM) are equipped with a variety of equipment you can&#39;t pack onto smaller birds - electronics equipment, deployment equipment or, most importantly, sheer capacity for range. An HH-60 Blackhawk can&#39;t even remotely match the range of a Chinook or its carrying capacity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched and read a bunch of stuff on this. The families were told that the taliban shot their chopper down with a lucky shot from an RPG. Which was an old 60&#39;s era refurbished chinook. Then the chopper subsequently blew up three different times. Once on impact of rocket, again in mid air, and then again when it hit the ground. The families were told everyone was cremated. Problem is the families were also given autopsy photos before the cremation that showed no signs of being hit with an explosive, no burns, hair intact, etc. Instead his left ankle was all fucked up and his hand was in the position of holding a pistol while firing. One of the family members does some digging and seems to think they were shot down by 100 taliban men who surrounded the chopper as it was landing as a QRF that was planned that very day. The seals knew what was coming..</p>

<p>edit: the dad who did a lot of the research also went through all the records of the mission that he had and afterwards in navy documentation found that a muslim prayer was put over them before cremation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again this is coming from the dad who&#39;s son was one of the seal team 6 guys that was most definitely part of the Osama Bin Laden incident. While listening to it though it does seem like some things are almost just trumped up. Who knows? maybe the dad is putting in disinfo with actual real content to keep from being assassinated? </p>

<p>it should be noted that all the info he has, none of the other families could access because when they were given the cd with data on it, they were all corrupted and came loaded with key loggers and viruses. He had to have a computer tech who retired from the Navy decrypt everything and make then make use of all the data that was in with the viruses and key logger&#39;s. So who knows at this point? all I know is some extremely shady stuff happened surrounding the crash of this chinook carrying 24 spec ops navy seal team 6 operators and 7 afghan troops who at the last minute changed places with 7 other afghan troops that were never logged into the passenger manifest. It should also be noted that the general who commanded over everything at the time said that they couldn&#39;t find the flight data recorder or cockpit recorder because it was washed away due to flash floods. Like I said a very eerie situation. In my mind they were set up to die from the second they took part in the psyops bin laden mission. What did they know before they were taken out that they couldn&#39;t talk about? or that was obviously classified? could you imagine?</p>

<p>If he did all the research, he&#39;d know that RPG have taken out helicopters several times.</p>

<p>Also, how exactly would a father have access to a classified mission? Sounds like bullshit.  People lie about being Navy Seals and this would be the first crackpot to claim he has access to stuff he&#39;d never get access to.  The only way he&#39;d see any death photos is if the Taliban took them.</p>

<p>Death is very weird and contrary to popular belief, people aren&#39;t consumed in fireball explosion most of the time. It&#39;s the blunt force trauma and they are ripped apart by the force and the shrapnel. It&#39;s the fire afterwards that can consume the body and cause burns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there was an actual investigation into the crash. </p>

<p>The families were pissed that ST6 members were sent in 1 refurbished chinook as a QRF. Anyone who knows anything about U.S. special operations missions knows that you never send seal teams on a mission in 1 helicopter much less a chinook with no apaches running point. That&#39;s just plain stupid or it&#39;s an inside job. (see the stupidity of Operation Red Wing)</p>

<p>According to the photos his son&#39;s hair wasn&#39;t scorched. None of his skin was scorched. His eye lashes were still in tact. That is definitely not inline with what happens if you are in the middle of an explosion. I agree you&#39;re body SOMETIMES remains in tact. But if in fact there were multiple explosions his body would not be in tact. No fucking way. Just look at the boson bombing and the guy missing his legs for an example on what happens when something blows up near you. </p>

<p>Now if a chinook is hit with an RPG and then blows up two more times. I guarantee you there wouldn&#39;t be eye lashes. There wouldn&#39;t be hair. The bodies would be in pieces.</p>

<p>Read this. It fills in a lot of holes in some of the questions you have.  There was support aircraft. Most of the bodies were thrown clear of the wreckage.</p>

<p>Because you keep saying things that are incorrect.  You stated there were no support vehicles. That is not the case.  You state there is no way they bodies wouldn&#39;t be burnt, that isn&#39;t the case.  You also say the family thinks the US was somehow involved. That is also not the case.</p>

<p>You said there were 20+ navy seal team 6 members, that is not the case.  There were five of them.  It&#39;s also not called &quot;Seal Team 6&quot; it&#39;s called DEVGRU and has been for years.</p>

<p>really? only 5 seals killed? you sure about that? it says here there were 17 killed</p>

<p>After Gen. Colt’s report became public in September 2011, the military arranged for him to brief next of kin Oct. 12 in Little Creek, Va., home to Naval Special Warfare Development Group, popularly called SEAL Team 6. The crash took the lives of 17 SEALs and five special warfare development group operators, making it the worst one-day loss in the history of U.S. naval special operations.</p>

<p>This is where your sloppy references cause the problems. There were a total of 17 Navy Seals killed. Of those, only 5 were part of DEVGRU. It&#39;s quire clear in the article you just referenced and is in the quote.</p>

<p>&quot;The crash took the lives of 17 SEALs and <strong>five special warfare development group operators</strong>, making it the worst one-day loss in the history of U.S. naval special operations.&quot;</p>

<p>Special Warfare Development Group = Seal Team 6. You keep mixing all these people up in your statements like in this statement of yours from an earlier post:</p>

<p><em>all I know is some extremely shady stuff happened surrounding the crash of this chinook carrying 24 spec ops navy seal team 6 operators</em></p>

<p>You keep throwing out inaccurate comments and statements all over the place. It&#39;s really hard to give any of your arguments and real consideration. If you want to talk about truth, you have to start by making sure you aren&#39;t confusing even the basic facts that are known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold on, there are some conclusions made that are just inaccurate. </p>

<p>First off, DEVGRU is a larger group than most people realize. While the exact size is classified, there are 6 platoons in every other SEAL team. There are 5 squadrons in DEVRRU  Not all were killed on that helicopter. SOME were killed on that helicopter.  There are still plenty of DEVGRU members that are still active or even stateside and inactive. Most importantly, the guy who is given credit for pulling the trigger on UBL is still alive and well.</p>

<p><em>This is the only time the Taliban have managed to shoot down a US aircraft</em></p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>In 2002 a Chinook was taken down by RPG and small arms fire.  In 2005 a Chinook was taken down by the same. In &#39;06 a Little Bird was shot out of the sky.</p>

<p>Those are JUST the deaths by SOAR, which is usually the air support crew for special operations.  These are all easily found online with simple searches.</p>

<p>You can talk about the raid and whether it actually happened, but these conclusions are just lazy.</p>

<p>Do you need any more links? Or do you think that helicopters are magical and can&#39;t get damaged by a rocket. We lost two Chinooks at the battle of Takur Ghar. Two Blackhawks in Somalia. Those are just ones I pulled from memory with zero research. Do you actually want me to research more? Hell we had a fucking STEALTH aircraft shot down by a bunch of rebel serbs in Bosnia. Sometimes people get a lucky shot in</p>

<p>Updating will is pretty normal standard behaviour for most people, especially those in high risk careers. </p>
