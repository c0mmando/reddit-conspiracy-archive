       These people are certainly traitors.

       They have sold out their country for power and a few miserable bucks from people that are also traitors for money and personal power.

       A complete pack of lies - the government story on the NSA Mass Surveillance programs

       The REAL purpose of NSA Mass Surveillance is to undermine democracy in America &amp; the West to promote the interests of large crony Corporations

       NSA Mass Spying has stopped zero terror plots so why has the Senate voted to continue to fund it?

      <p>
       Apart from the NSA Mass Surveillance programs making every American LESS safe, it also makes them poorer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence budgets have been increased to ~$85bn a year, 70% of which goes to private spy companies. This is a huge waste of money and just enriches the owners and CEO's of the private spy companies.

       The NSA surveillance programs will also make Americans poorer because there will be fewer well paid jobs in American tech companies, lower GDP growth and higher unemployment.

       Also, contrary to what the media and politicians have been saying, NSA backdoors are not
       <em>
        MAGICAL
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They make security weaker to
       <em>
        any attacker
       </em>
       not just the NSA. Ergo, NSA is committing treason by actively sabotaging security.

       Good point.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have also deliberately sabotaged security by making the random number generation in internet encryption methods weaker than it would otherwise be by collaboration with RSA.

       Thanks for the article, it concisely summarizes a number of the known and important points about NSA operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is LOADS more that has yet to be revealed to over 95% of the population in America and the Rest of the World, as to the scope, activities, purpose and effects of the NSA Mass Surveillance and spy programs.

       many estimate that 70% of the military/intelligence workers go from the USG to private companies in the revolving door...
      </p>
      <p>
       also important to note that GHW Bush has Carlyle Group connections--and is said to have been at a Wash, DC hotel on 9/11...(one of the bin Ladens was also there)

       here is the cryptome link which shows Booz Allen receiving 390K in Sept, 2001

       The various connections and activities of the Carlyle Group needs an entire article on it's own - Bush's, Saudi's, Bin Laden's, arms companies, previous Secretaries of Defense &amp; State etc.

       Great idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why doesn't somebody do just that?
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't take that much effort for someone with digital design / photoshopping skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush's playing cards showing members of Saddam's regime proved very popular and images are much stronger than mere words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stick the picture on the front and a summary of the crimes on the back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Packs of such playing cards could then be left in public places, public transportation, sports bars etc. Or a few of the cards could just be spread around a specific location.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. Someone else I convo'd with today was buying up cheap second hand copies of 1984 and leaving them on public buses.
