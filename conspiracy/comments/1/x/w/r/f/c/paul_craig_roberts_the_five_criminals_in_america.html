<p>These people are certainly traitors.</p>

<p>They have sold out their country for power and a few miserable bucks from people that are also traitors for money and personal power.</p>

<p>A complete pack of lies - the government story on the NSA Mass Surveillance programs <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/09/a-complete-pack-of-lies-government.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/09/a-complete-pack-of-lies-government.html</a></p>

<p>The REAL purpose of NSA Mass Surveillance is to undermine democracy in America &amp; the West to promote the interests of large crony Corporations <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-primary-purpose-of-nsas-mass.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-primary-purpose-of-nsas-mass.html</a></p>

<p>Booz Allen Hamilton - A tale of high level corruption in both parties <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/06/booze-allen-hamilton-what-you-dont-know.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/06/booze-allen-hamilton-what-you-dont-know.html</a></p>

<p>NSA Mass Spying has stopped zero terror plots so why has the Senate voted to continue to fund it? <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/11/as-keith-alexander-has-already-admitted.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/11/as-keith-alexander-has-already-admitted.html</a></p>

<p>Apart from the NSA Mass Surveillance programs making every American LESS safe, it also makes them poorer.</p>

<p>The intelligence budgets have been increased to ~$85bn a year, 70% of which goes to private spy companies. This is a huge waste of money and just enriches the owners and CEO&#39;s of the private spy companies.</p>

<p>Michael Hayden is a common Mafia Hood running a protection racket for the Chertoff Group <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/michael-chertoff-is-common-mafia-hood.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/michael-chertoff-is-common-mafia-hood.html</a></p>

<p>The NSA surveillance programs will also make Americans poorer because there will be fewer well paid jobs in American tech companies, lower GDP growth and higher unemployment.</p>

<p>It is time to put the spurious arguments of the supporters of the NSA&#39;s Mass Surveillance to bed <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/it-is-time-to-put-spurious-arguments-of.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/it-is-time-to-put-spurious-arguments-of.html</a></p>

<p>They make security weaker to <em>any attacker</em> not just the NSA. Ergo, NSA is committing treason by actively sabotaging security.</p>

<p>They have also deliberately sabotaged security by making the random number generation in internet encryption methods weaker than it would otherwise be by collaboration with RSA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the article, it concisely summarizes a number of the known and important points about NSA operations. </p>

<p>There is LOADS more that has yet to be revealed to over 95% of the population in America and the Rest of the World, as to the scope, activities, purpose and effects of the NSA Mass Surveillance and spy programs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>many estimate that 70% of the military/intelligence workers go from the USG to private companies in the revolving door...</p>

<p>also important to note that GHW Bush has Carlyle Group connections--and is said to have been at a Wash, DC hotel on 9/11...(one of the bin Ladens was also there)</p>

<p>here is the cryptome link which shows Booz Allen receiving 390K in Sept, 2001</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great idea. </p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t somebody do just that? </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t take that much effort for someone with digital design / photoshopping skills.</p>

<p>Bush&#39;s playing cards showing members of Saddam&#39;s regime proved very popular and images are much stronger than mere words.   </p>

<p>Stick the picture on the front and a summary of the crimes on the back.</p>

<p>Packs of such playing cards could then be left in public places, public transportation, sports bars etc. Or a few of the cards could just be spread around a specific location.</p>

<p>P.S. Someone else I convo&#39;d with today was buying up cheap second hand copies of 1984 and leaving them on public buses.</p>
