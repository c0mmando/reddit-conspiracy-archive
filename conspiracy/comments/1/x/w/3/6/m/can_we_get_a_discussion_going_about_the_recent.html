    <div class="md"><p>A few reasons I can think of for that, just to play Devil&#39;s Advocate.</p>

<p>First of all, SH was a lot smaller scale than 9/11 which took place in the middle of one of the biggest cities on Earth and certainly in America while SH took place basically in the middle of nowhere.  9/11 was also the catalyst that got the public to support (or at least accept) the &quot;war on terror&quot;.  All of this to say (in my opinion) more people were exposed to the details of 9/11 (and, thus, the many anomalies, coincidences, and lies) than to SH.  How many people have actually taken the time to look at the details of the case (relative to 9/11)?</p>

<p>The other thing to note is that even suggesting the idea that the children at SH &quot;didn&#39;t exist&quot; or &quot;weren&#39;t actually murdered&quot; or any other theory is completely blasphemous and unfathomable to most people, I would argue even more so than the idea that our government was in some way responsible or complicit in 9/11.  &quot;But the children&quot;, &quot;How dare you not respect those grieving families&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m getting at is that SH hasn&#39;t reached the point where it&#39;s &quot;socially acceptable&quot; to question the events to the extent that 9/11 has.  It also was a less significant event in terms of affecting our daily lives and freedoms than 9/11 was (which arguably has had a bigger impact on my generation than any other world event).</p>

<p>As far as actual research goes, I&#39;d start here if you&#39;ve never seen this before <a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/2013/01/06/sandy-hook-school-massacre-timeline/">http://memoryholeblog.com/2013/01/06/sandy-hook-school-massacre-timeline/</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a user on reddit, <a href="/u/Mindsequalone">/u/Mindsequalone</a>, who&#39;s done a great job researching this event and finding quite a few peculiarities regarding fishy lottery winnings of the families, among other things.</p>

<p>I think there is enough out there to <em>at least</em> be very, very skeptical of the official narrative.  We have certainly not been told the whole story.</p>

<p>The officials who know the truth about Sandy Hook also know that their families&#39; lives would be snuffed out if they tried to go public. </p>

<p>And frankly, who would they &quot;go public&quot; to - the mainstream media who printed the ludicrous official lies about Sandy Hook in the first place? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone recall that strange occurrence last year where JP Morgan&#39;s vault supposedly caught fire? &quot;BANK VAULT FIRE in the basement level of JP Morgan&#39;s original Chase Headquarters.The FDNY has confirmed via tweet that they were responding to a COMMERCIAL VAULT FIRE IN THE BASEMENT of JPM&#39;s headquarters at 15 Broad St.&quot; This was shortly after some news that stuff was missing. This news seems to have come and gone, without any real hype... but in retrospect this may have been a bigger event than we knew. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that these are assassinations. Seems like there are a million other ways that they could keep bankers quiet without drawing so much attention to themselves. If these people are capable of murdering bankers and framing it like a suicide, surely they could just find some other angle... like using threats to family as leverage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they&#39;re sending a message with the &quot;suicides&quot;.  Another option is that maybe these people were about to &quot;blow the whistle&quot; or expose some type of fraud or something and there just wasn&#39;t any time to plan and execute an elaborate assassination made to look like an accident.</p>

<p>When I see that a guy supposedly committed suicide with multiple nail gun wounds and another guy thrown from the 33rd floor of a building (how&#39;d they know it was the 33rd floor he jumped from if there weren&#39;t any witnesses?), it at least makes me raise an eyebrow and think, &quot;Hmm.. there might be something more to this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He died on Feb. 3 at his Stamford, Connecticut, home, according to the website of Leo P. Gallagher &amp; Son Funeral Home in Greenwich, Connecticut. The cause of death will be determined when a toxicology report is completed in about six weeks, said a spokeswoman for the state’s chief medical examiner.&quot;</p>

<p>Death unknown at this time </p>

<p>How many nurses killed them selves how many people from other professions? It&#39;s easy to take information out of context and see patterns </p>

<p>An average of one person dies by suicide every 16.2 minutes. (CDC, AAS)</p>

<p>There are four male suicides for every female suicide. (CDC, AAS)</p>

<p>4 Bankers in 2 months is not unusual</p>
