    <div class="md"><p>Without a doubt, there are plenty of Masonic conspiracy theories. But the general gist of them are always unfounded. Freemasons don&#39;t secretly run the world, or drink the blood of newborns, or worship satan, etc. What Freemasons do is try to improve themselves and their community. This is done in many different ways, and varies from lodge to lodge.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First, let me address the implied assertion that there&#39;s some sort of hierarchy to Freemasons. There&#39;s this strange view that outsiders have that Freemasonry is it&#39;s governing bodies. As a Freemason, I find that idea absurd. We are a democratic  organization with strictly limited governing bodies. The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, for example, because that&#39;s where I live, is entirely autonomous. If they tried to tell any other Grand Lodge what to do, they would be ignored.</p>

<p>Grand Lodges have one and only one source of power outside of their own borders: recognition. They can choose not to recognize another Grand Lodge as a Masonic body. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Second, there&#39;s the idea of the &quot;real meaning&quot; of our symbols. We&#39;ve been around for 300+ years. In that time, every secret we&#39;ve had has been leaked by <em>someone</em> at some point. You can look up the details of everything we do online. Everything in Freemasonry has a reason and those reasons are definitely taught to everyone who becomes a Master Mason. Now there are other bodies that have other views (for example, the Knights Templar are an organization that take a distinctly Christian view of the Fraternity) but those aren&#39;t the &quot;true meanings,&quot; they&#39;re just the take that those particular people come away from the symbolism with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said no such thing. Freemasons are people, just like you and me, some are good at hiding their bad side, just like in any other social club. There may be instances of &quot;a crony system&quot;. But as soon as you break the law, or help to cover up someone that broke the law, you are no longer acting Masonically. If found out you will be suspended or expelled depending on the offence. If you have a whole lodge become a &quot;crony system&quot; it is likely that that lodge will lose it&#39;s charter.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard non-Masons referred as anything except non-Masons.<br/>
 You would report a Mason the same way you would report anyone else. They wouldn&#39;t get off just because they are both Masons, especially if it was something big or felonious, quite the opposite. Committing a crime goes against Masonic values, it would be unmasonic to commit a crime, it would be unmasonic to ask a brother to help cover it up, and it would be unmasonic to cover the crime up.<br/>
Can it happen? sure, Does it happen? probably no more often than when a police chief does a favor for a friend. You may be able to get out of a traffic ticket, but a good brother wouldn&#39;t ask, and a good brother wouldn&#39;t comply. Murder or something serious, you aren&#39;t getting out of that.  </p>

<p>So a freemason fraternity is not, has never been, and cannot ever be, a crony system of like minded individuals?</p>

<p>That phrase can describe any social organization. Freemasonry just happens to be the oldest social organization going. Cronyism has been a problem in every human institution, but Freemasons aren&#39;t particularly susceptible to such problems, any more than any other social organization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are currently and throughout history have existed as a benevolent community club, in every instance. That is your thesis. That&#39;s what you have asserted. Is that accurate?</p>

<p>If I don&#39;t submit to the unprovable, I am an egomaniac and a lesser person than a mason. Since a &quot;better man&quot; necessarily <em>believes</em> that he is not lord and commander of his earthly vessel, am I a lesser man if I do not subscribe the same idea? The implication is yes. </p>

<p>That is a division between a masons view of himself and a masons view of me. He is better. That is a division not unlike religion in any way. </p>

<p>A point: while these may have been the views of the particular Freemason who taught you, they are not the views of the Fraternity, which respects all establishments of religion. This is why what he did is not considered valid within the Fraternity. It&#39;s not that we care that you know the modes of recognition, but that you didn&#39;t learn them along with an understanding of what the Fraternity really is.</p>

<p>Have you considered joining a Lodge so that you can get the whole picture?</p>
