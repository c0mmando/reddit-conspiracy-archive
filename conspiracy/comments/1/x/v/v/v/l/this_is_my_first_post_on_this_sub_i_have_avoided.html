        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Opium is used in the majority of the major selling pharm drugs. Monsanto owns a large stake in the pharm business. Afghanistan has the largest Opium crops in the world. Monsanto is one of Obama&#39;s biggest campaign contributors. Hillary Clinton worked as Monsanto&#39;s lawyer. The first thing Afghanistan did when the USA attacked was shut down all the opium fields. The first thing our government did after invading Afghanistan was seize control of the opium fields. Obama just extended our occupancy of Afghanistan to 2024. Afganistan would&#39;ve never been invaded if not for 9/11</p>

<p>Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, yet after 9/11 we invaded Iraq. Iraq had tons of oil that the United States couldn&#39;t get their hands on. The first thing the people of Iraq did when the US invaded was try to burn the oil fields. The first thing the United States did after invading Iraq was take control of the 6 major oil fields. Halliburton won subcontracts for drilling on 3 of the major oil fields. Baker Hughes (American) and Schlumberger (A French company, but based in Houston, TX) both won subcontracts for two of the major oil fields. The locally owned Iraqi Drilling Co. earned a subcontract to 1 of the oil fields. </p>

<p>The Holocaust is talked about all the time, and anytime anything negative is said about Israel or the &quot;jews&quot; people are called anti-semitic. While the holocaust was horrible, it was not the worst thing that happened during the 20th century. There were over 27 million soviets killed during ww2, and nearly 7.5 million Ukranians were killed in a starvation extermination called Holodomor in the 30&#39;s. In 1965 nearly 500,000 Indonesian communists were exterminated by the paramilitary. Israel and the United States are currently Exterminating Palestinians and calling it a war on terror. Anyone who claims to be anti-israel is call an anti-semite and the holocaust inevitably makes its way into the conversation. 9/11 allowed the U.S. to help Israel kill &quot;Al Queda&quot; aka any Palestinians they can find in any country they run to. Israel is putting Palestinians  who aren&#39;t fighting into shanty towns, and forcing them into extreme poverty. They are killing off the rest. All in the name of religion. 9/11 makes these acts acceptable because the Palestinians are the so called &quot;terrorists&quot; who were supposedly responsible for 9/11. </p>

<p>War has always been a racket for the United States, but Israel cares more about killing Palestine and having complete control of Jerusalem than they do about money. My personal belief (and this is pure speculation based on the facts listed above) is that Israel was responsible for 9/11 and Clinton and Bush knew they were going to do it. What are your thoughts r/conspiracy?</p>

<p>I have written at length about the US-Israel relationship regarding 9/11 in this post:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/1uucwq/my_pet_theory_on_the_neoconzionist_relationship/">http://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/1uucwq/my_pet_theory_on_the_neoconzionist_relationship/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve concluded that, while the US government allowed Israel to carry out 9/11, they were not informed of the full scope of the operation. Now that they are complicit, it is too late to point fingers.</p>

<p>Whilst the dirty work might have been exclusively Israeli (although I doubt this), 9/11 would not have been possible without the active participation of Cheney and Rumsfeld, in particular, and the acquiescence of the White House. The conspiracy goes right to the top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any answers for the how or the why, but it sure seems like that&#39;s why we invaded Afghanistan. Another very interesting thing that&#39;s happening right now. Read this link. <a href="http://www.hightimes.com/read/fda-no-medical-marijuana-yes-%E2%80%9Csuper-vicodin%E2%80%9D">http://www.hightimes.com/read/fda-no-medical-marijuana-yes-%E2%80%9Csuper-vicodin%E2%80%9D</a></p>

<p>The scariest part is that Obamacare is going to pay for all of this with tax payer dollars. It&#39;s literally stealing from the poor and giving to the rich, and yet his campaign promises the opposite. American politics at its finest. The only bright spot is that none of this is anything new. Hopefully we can remedy these corruptions sooner than later, so we can move on to addressing the next form of corruption that comes up. </p>
