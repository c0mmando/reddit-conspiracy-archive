        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi, everyone. First, I would like to make it clear that what I am about to say is not an attack, it is simply a conspiracy theory. By stating this theory I am not attacking any users or mods, any more than I am attacking the United States when I question their actions. </p>

<p>First, I would like to start with this- <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wqz40/the_solidwhetstone_conspiracy/">The SolidWhetStone Conspiracy theory</a> as put forth by <a href="/u/serfnomics">/u/serfnomics</a> who unfortunately won&#39;t be joining me due to a ban he received today after he called out someone who many in this sub think is a shill. Speaking of which, did you know that posts are being removed simply for having the word &quot;shill&quot; in them? <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xpqfh/warning_shills_may_be_attempting_to_hijack_the/cfdsn8k?context=3">It&#39;s true,</a> in much the same way that it is antisemitic to call out Israel&#39;s atrocities, it is now against our rules to use the word &quot;shill&quot;. You don&#39;t even have to direct it to anyone. Another word that will get your posts removed is &quot;brigade&quot;. Here we are screaming against censorship on a sub that is being censored. </p>

<p>Anyway, back to the theory... What if <a href="/u/serfonomics">/u/serfonomics</a> was right?? After the SolidWhetStone fiasco was over, there was entire new mod team brought in. Elected by us, of course, much like President Bush was elected in 2000. I will admit, I have been a huge supporter of Flytape, our newly elected mod team and our old mod team as well, so forgive me my hypocrisy. But like I said earlier, this is only a conspiracy theory for our sub, not an attack.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that there is a good chance that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the largest gathering of conspiracy theorists in the world. If not it&#39;s certainly got to be at the top of the lists. We know what governments, corporations, and people will do to make up the peoples minds. So why should we expect anything less here, one of the largest voices against them in the world? What say you <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? Have we lost our sub? </p>

<p>EDIT- I forgot to add, it wouldn&#39;t have to be all of our mods being against us to accomplish what they need. Just a couple would be enough, especially if they were high enough up. And I would be more inclined to believe that their accounts were breached than that they converted to the dark side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally am not surprised by Flytape, he made some issues blow out of proportion and got called out by the entire sub at some point. He learned, and does a great job now.</p>

<p>I fucking love this sub, don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m on here daily. I have seen a big impact on the amount of <em>OK</em> material coming out lately; slim to none, basically. The amount of downvotes dosen&#39;t make any sense half the time.</p>

<p>The worst is seeing an insult in a thread not even an hour old, with something like 10|1 votes. If the word brigade can&#39;t be used to talk about that, well I&#39;ll shut up one more time.</p>

<p>Last point; I spent hours on /r/ <em>conspifuckers</em> tagging the mass. People that seemed to be &quot;part of it&quot; and had something to say. Well, they are showing up here on a daily bases. Don&#39;t believe it? If you are a mod reading this, and you think you do your job right, you don&#39;t... and it&#39;s obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more likely that a group of people are out to destabilize the sub while creating drama and argument through obfuscation. I&#39;ve mentioned this before but remember <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>&#39;s fall from grace? That happened due to posts like this one. It turned into a giant circle jerk while solving absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Why do you need to use the word &quot;shill&quot; to make a point? There&#39;s thousands of words and word combinations that can be used to describe a situation that shills are involved. Use those words instead.</p>

<p>Be creative and explain exactly what you believe to be happening. I&#39;m sure this would be a lot more beneficial to your argument as well as to your listeners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to believe this. I have always had faith in our mods and I would like that faith to continue. However, many threads have been posted about the events in the last few days and the only ban I know of was one of our regular users. Meanwhile, the person who he had called out (who by the way has been the subject of many accusations by a large number of this sub and who had been warned on at least 2 other occasions) is still here as far as I know.</p>

<p>On the subject of the word shill. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever used it before today, as I too have always found it annoying. However, I am using it in this instance because it&#39;s simply an easy word to type and everyone will know what I am referring to when I say it. It is a simple, non-harmful word to describe &quot;the bad guy&quot;. </p>

<p>we&#39;re essentially trying to have open conversation about, say, the history and actions of the Cartels on an anonymous forum that relies heavily on the honor system and selective moderation by people who are also only known to us only by the honor system and comment history. i just don&#39;t see how we should expect that to work at all in this field. it&#39;s bollocks. </p>

<p><a href="/u/serfnomics">/u/serfnomics</a> who unfortunately won&#39;t be joining me due to a ban he received today after he called out someone who many in this sub think is a shill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a lot more to it than that. He was warned of Rule 10 violations and continued the same pattern <em>after</em> being warned.</p>

<p>Edit: As for the rest, I personally think the currently group of mods are the best we&#39;ve ever had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% undeniable trolls get banned way more than you may think. We&#39;ve got about 1,000 names on the banned list. They simply create new accounts.  It then takes a while for them to become recognizable (if they keep within the rules) and then the process starts over. It&#39;s just impossible to keep them all out.</p>
