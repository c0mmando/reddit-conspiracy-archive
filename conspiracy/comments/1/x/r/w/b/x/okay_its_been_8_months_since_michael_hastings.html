       Breaks my fucking heart to say, but no one cares, no one even knows his name.  Theyve gotten so goddamn good at keeping people in the dark.  Snowden, Manning, Hastings...these names get me nothing but blank stares from almost literally 100% of people.  Breaks my heart in two.

       Im sorry you feel that way but keep faith.  I thought the same thing for a long time until one day while smoking with my friends I decided 'fuck it' and just broke open about all the crazy theories I've read on here.  To my surprise, ALL of my friends had been thinking the EXACT same thing.  This subreddit is much more popular than you think it is.

       Thanks man.  All the people I smoke and kick it with are so busy with work they dont know about any of this stuff. Of course there is the rare exception, but that is few and far between.  it just sucks so bad that someone so brave and awesome like Hastings could be murdered so openly, and no one cares.  I know more of us are out there.  I will keep the faith, thanks for the encouragement

       No problem dude.  I always try to remember that public opinion is shaped by individuals not organizations.  CNN not reporting on something doesn't mean that no one cares, it only means that CNN doesn't care or doesn't want others to know.

       I don't know how old you are, but I can promise you one thing.  College  kids ALL OVER the place are extremely pissed off about this shit.  Most are waiting for the chance to do something.

       Right on man.  I'm 22 and fresh out of college. It seemed to me like everybody my age was too busy worrying about getting drunk and laid to be angry about the injustice of it all.  Once I got drunk and laid enough, I dropped some acid and that is how I realized I need to focus on what really matters.  I desperately hope youre right though, and I do everything I can all the time to wake up our generation.  I'm always talking about this stuff.  I say give it a while, i dont want to be pessimistic but maybe a decade or two, and then we will see massive changes.  For now i'm just planting seeds :)

       And then the chance you speak of will come, and we will hit the streets like a fucking hurricane.  See you there

       I was actually talking about LSD last night - I am somewhat convinced that one thing missing from modern society is the 'self-realization' sort of battle.  Like when Luke Skywalker encountered Darth Vader during his training with Yoda and found out that it was himself under the mask - he experienced his greatest fears and realized them. Understood them. Eventually conquered them (and became them, but thats a later story).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, Lucas worked closely with Joseph Campbell and if you haven't seen or read any of his works, you most definitely should. 'The Hero's Journey" is a fantastic read and makes how our brains work and evolution of society sort of make more sense from a long term standpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relevancy: we don't have the inner battle fight as a part of our modern society. I think LSD, under the correct set and setting can be used to elicit those feelings and make a person stronger.
      </p>

       my friends think im nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I talk too much, I started off a few years ago with Food Inc and agri-business, then 911, then the FED stuff, and most recently I found out and believe that Sandyhook was fake .. I havn't talked about that one yet though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend all the docs, but they all think I should just live life.  One guy sorta believes 911 was an inside job but thats as far as he will go.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the financial collapse coming, he thinks it will be at least 50 years.  Im pretty sure there won't be a USA in 50 years.

       Dude my 50 year old mom thinks he was assassinated for the same reasons any sane person would, because of where the engine was in relation to the car, it's impossible that it was due to the collision, the car must have sustained an explosion before the impact in order for the engine to be where it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of people like myself and many others here who refuse to shut up about this stuff, a lot of people are starting to wake up, especially because of how generally shitty everything has become for people.

       Yeap. Also, one thing mainstream media
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       covered in the past year or so is the persecution/prosecution of whistleblowers and journalists critical of the administration. James Rosen, James Risen, Sharyl Atkisson's computer being hacked while she was working on Benghazi stories, the Justice Dept's seizing of AP phone records, Greenwald's spouse being detained, the IRS's special-negative-treatment for conservative groups, and so on.

       Good, I wish my mom would even give this stuff a minute of her time. Shes to into the bible.  Im down with the bible, but she refuses to devote even a second to considering whether or not our government isnt a bunch of fucking saints.  Tell your mom to help us by opening some of her peers' eyes

       Oh she's an educator and many of her peers do realize a lot of these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your mom knows her bible then she should be receptive to these things as the bible states how corrupt man is, she should assume the government is corrupt really, because time and time again the bible reveals how insanely corrupt people are, especially when placed in government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Murder, lies, deception, conspiracy, all throughout the bible, which is why I find it so absurd that other Christians are hostile to the idea that their own government is corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes sense though when you realize "oh yeah, the older generation (35 and up really) have all been extremely heavily brainwashed.".

       THANK YOU!!!  She doesnt get this, nobody gets this.  My favorite bible story is when jesus goes in his fathers house with a whip and flips over the corrupt merchant peoples' tables and shit.  i try and explain all the time how questioning government is as christian as it fucking gets.  Another unfortunate side effect of the psy-op known as 9/11 (imo), it entrenched "our side""christianity" with the american government in a lot of weak minds.

       Yup.

       It's no wonder the church is in such a state of ruin and decay when a majority of it's congregation is brainwashed baby boomers.

       It's scary because when you debate them in person you can see in their eyes and on their faces and in their bodies when they're confronted with something that doesn't fit with their beliefs. Instantly you can see this reaction and their display is that of an almost instant jump to defensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell when they're gonna chime in by listening to how they're breathing and be able to know when they're going to respond with hostility, or disbelief, or denial.

      <p>
       Psychologically conditioned people have no idea how easy it is to predict them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes a lot of effort to shed yourself of societal psychological conditioning, but once you accomplish this you become far harder to direct and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Active Neutrality gains you an advantage in that you don't let people have the ability to modify their behavior nor do you give them the ability to guide your responses or mold your answer through suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are crafty as hell ( to which many are bound sadly ), you have to always keep your guard up, even with friends because even though at times they may have good intentions, even they go too far in trying to change you.

       Active Neutrality is just that, actively retaining a position which doesn't allow people to force your decisions/behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Common practices include responding to peoples statements with vague non-agreements such as "Ok".
      </p>
      <p>
       I work a retail job and they constantly are telling me "You have to talk up gift cards, gift cards are a great gift blah blah blah blah" and all I say to that shit is "Ok" for a multitude of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reason one being that gift cards are a fucking scam so businesses can ensure money through the hopes that customers lose/forget about their gift cards and never spend that money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, they're a fucking awful gift. Wow, thanks for the money I can only spend at this one place. Why did you not just give me the fucking money?
      </p>
      <p>
       In remaining actively neutral towards what they present me with, I retain my own individual thoughts and beliefs, while still being able to carry out what is asked of me ( I don't like to do it but it takes 3 seconds to say "any gift cards today?" and they really only push this so hard when there are holidays like the hallmark bullshit that happened yesterday. )

       The police have said that no foul play was involved.

      <p>
       Hastings family had flown into town for an intervention for his drug habit.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a history of drug abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coronor's report says drugs were in his system (but did not contribute to the accident)
      </p>
      <p>
       He had a history of crashing his car.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was overly paranoid about the government watching him and was trying to borrow his friends car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eyewitnesses see him bottom his car out on the crest of the intersection just before he crashed. (sparks and flames flying out from under the car - not a bomb)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is video showing him flying past a stringer's camera at an intersection a couple of blocks before he crashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment is a loaded question. What evidence do you have that suggests he was assassinated?

       Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard Clarke said that what is known about the crash is "consistent with a car cyber attack." He was quoted as saying "There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers -- including the United States -- know how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber attack on [Hastings'] car -- and I'm not saying there was, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it."

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       on one of his last TV appearances, he openly called another journalist a tame copy/paster for the PTB, jaws dropped on that show.
      </p>
      <p>
       he was clearly stressed from working, on that TV show, no doubt he got played like a fish, somebody did something to his car, then they drew him through that (regular!) route and closed the trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       its telling that the Loudlabs arrival video shows all the vehicles at the scene on a cleared street. the parked up tow-truck, the ADT vehicle at the north end of the crash scene, the other parked up car, the distant moving car with flashing lights way down the street south, that moves off as LL car arrives.
      </p>
      <p>
       there was four vehicles at the scene when the camera car arrived in hot pursuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       the HD version of the dashcam video clearly shows the south vehicle with flashing white/orange lights in the distance, the south blocking car, the ADT one was the north blocking car.
      </p>
      <p>
       the pizza store CCTV video, short and edited tho it is, it almost shows a speeding car going past a stationary car by the tree, there seems to be a hint of a sideways wreck illuminated by the first big explosion, not enough frames/time for a real crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael Hastings, a young eager and ambitious investigative journalist, a 'loose canon', not a 'team player', many wanted him to disappear or not exist any more.

      <p>
       As far as I heard the LAPD have kept all the records on the investigation private, which was over in a few weeks I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The LAPD does this shit all the time. At first I thought they'd try to cover it up better but honestly I think it's just a message. If you have important information and are going to publish, keep your mouth fucking shut or we'll kill you. No one talks about it but anyone with half a brain in the journalism world has probably noticed.

       I agree with you I thought that myself while posting this. But I'm a bad conspiracy theorist. I am not good at researching questionable events, I'm not good at finding the articles you guys find, but I do know that in time, this post would be filled with the information I didn't have. I'm a bad fact finder. But I'm good at deducing real information from what you guys fact check. So I said that because I rely on you guys for information, I subscribe to r/conspiracy to stay informed and to stay skeptical. And I love this sub because of the people in it, the people that appreciate truth.

       the latest Mercedes commercials on TV openly talk about crash safety, they took notice of Michael Hastings
       <em>
        'crash'

       and how it made their cars look.

       I think Mercedes was the only indenpendant party that could have analylized the data from their car. If anything was left. I don't think they did anything though.

       I remember his neighbor saying he had asked her to borrow her car because he thought his was tampered with. I bet that neighbor feels bad now.

       I always thought there was a very high possibility that, if there was a conspiracy (and I believe there was, if only because there's so little data and none of it makes sense; also weird that he stopped tweeting 5 days before the accident, which was out-of-character - that guy was reallllly active on the twitters), that she was part of it. They were living across the country from each other and she's got some interesting connections. (As does he, if you really dig into it. I don't know what I believe, though, everything's upside down - I get the feeling lately that a lot of our counterculture "heroes" are agents themselves.)

       Guess his neighbor gal also had some odd connections. That she was in close contact with him and was fully aware that his car might have been tampered with, she loaned him hers... he then jumps in his, late at night and it

       It haunts me, actually. I can't get over that he was murdered and no one seems to be seeking the truth. I know that L.A is a very very corrupt place, and that whisteblowers can get murdered and no one has the guts to do anything about it. The majority of the public doesn't seem to have a clue as to how sinister things have become.

       The truth is as obvious as it is staggeringly sad and shameful and frightening.
We need not forget d.casalaro.promis software.
Yes we do appear to have kill teams. Very dark kill teams,busy right now with those pesky bankers but the kill shot on Hastings was a clear message  to the free world.

       I recall something in 2009, that there was a coalition of whistleblowers ready to talk about all the things they'd witnessed go down behind the scenes in the Bush Administration. And right as that story started to pick up steam, there was a very big name article that got play about Cheney's "stay behind" teams planted throughout Washington.

       AGAIN- You people are TRYING to make a "conspiracy" where there is not one.

       Think about how fking crazy what you propose sounds.

      <p>
       SO what you are saying, is that a guy that is having problems with DRUGS, stress and lack of sleep and may have been having a "manic" episode decides to drive like an idiot and ends up crashing his car into a tree doesn't make as much sense as an evil govt spooky black ops assassin team ordered by Stanley McChrystal tampered with the guys car, then took control of it remotely and crashed it into a tree in a revenge killing over political embarrassment?
      </p>
      <p>
       A guy that is having a "moment" accidently kills himself vs. secret black ops govt assassins using high tech to take control of a car and then drive it into a tree in a revenge killing.

      <p>

       It's not so "high tech" or as impossible as you make it sound.
Look into Washington State University experiment where they prooved that just about every car made in the last ten years or so is easily susceptible to having their connections through OnStar/GPS/Radio intercepted.  They used this interception to access the electrical control system and were able to do anything from controlling the speed to brakes to even the locks.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things may seem impossible but if you put the time in to learn how they work it can be quite eye opening.

       YOU ARE REEEEEACHING.
THERE IS NOTHING THERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok...lets say it isn't so "high tech".
      </p>
      <p>
       STILL - it would be easier to just shoot the guy in the face and make it look like  robbery. Happens all the time around here. Make it look like a drug deal gone bad. Happens all the time.
You can keep down the number of people involved. No evidence to get rid of. Its done and nobody knows a thing. 
Why not simply make him disappear? That's pretty easy for our govt to do. He goes to take leak while watching some hockey with his boys and POOF he disappears.  He takes the dog for a walk around the neighborhood and never comes back. Easy.
Why not make it look like an OD? He was a drug user. Easy as shit to set him up for that. Just another sad story about a drug user ODing. End of story.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no. Somebody "hacks" this guys car. Without any sort of evidence or any sort prior incident to fall back on...THEY - the internet - claims it was a high tech murdering using his own Mercedes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claiming that a shadowy govt organization hell bent on getting revenge used this method to kill a guy is just silly. ALL of the evidence points to a RATIONAL conclusion that he was driving fast - REAL FAST - went out of control and hit a tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you guys discount the brother? He was really the last guy to spend any time with him. Knew him better than anybody. Actually flew out here just to stay with him because he know that Hastings was using again. He said that Hastings wasn't sleeping. Was under stress. The words he used to describe what happened to Hastings was "having manic incident". In other words, he was freaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU GUYS have even tried to tell me that his brother wasn't to be trusted and could be a govt "plant" or was forced to say that stuff by the govt or face being killed himself. WTF???
      </p>
      <p>
       All the signs are there. There is NOTHING that would point, in the smallest way, to General McChrystal and a band of secret Blackwater assassins or CIA hitmen using technology to "hack" this guys car. Just internet nonsense. Murdering an American citizen on American soil to get revenge because Hastings embarrassed them? Or that Hastings future work might be able to embarrass them?
      </p>
      <p>
       WHEN has ANYTHING like that ever happened before? In the movies? TV shows? It hasn't happened in real life. There are no prior incidents of this sort of thing  to look back on and say - THAT is what probably happened to Hastings. Its pure paranoia and silly conspiracy. It was just "made up" by the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU/THEY are looking to find conspiracy where there isn't and coming up very short and looking silly.

       I explained to you that the possibility of wirelessly accessing a vehicle control system is within the bounds of common reality.  Doing so creates the illusion that this journalist crashed his car, despite the fact that he was going over 80mph in a neighborhood with ZERO alcohol in his system.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you then fabricate a rumor that he was using drugs you can gain enough traction through hearsay to have people seriously questioning his character, thus ignoring his history and strange death by accepting the fact that he deserved it somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The email he sent right before he died literally said he was on to a big story.  If you look it up or remember it said he found something big and might need to lay low for a while, or something along those lines but seriously look it up and read it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take into account his history with exposing large government mistakes, and you can entertain the idea that extreme measures would be taken to deceive the public if such an assassination were to occur, then I think you would realize that his death at least warrants an investigation.

       After the death, it was widely reported that his last book would be published soon, a tell-all about Brennan.  Now, there has been some backstepping and his book that will come out soon is a novel called The Last Magazine, about his time at newsweek. 
definitely killed.  one would have to be sooooo dumb to believe the official story.  I have a shred of hope though... what if he faked his own death?

       Hastings was not killed in a revenge murder plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       His car was not "hacked" and driven into a tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was under a lot of stress, not having much sleep and was back on drugs in a big way.
      </p>
      <p>
       His OWN BROTHER, the last person to speak with him, who had flown to LA specifically to check on Hastings as he was using a lot of drugs- again, HAS SAID that most of what was reported was media nonsense. Most of the "facts" are internet bullshit.

       That does not mean, that like HIS BROTHER says, ya know...the last guy that was actually with him...that he feels Hastings was having a "manic episode" due to heavy drug use, stress and lack of sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because at the time he didn't have anything "heavy" in his system (keep in mind, badly badly charred body) does not mean that he wasn't incapacitated.

       What? You can eat 2 poppy seed bagels and come up positive for opiates. So yeah it does matter. He was maniac, but from drug use and anyone who actually read about the story knows thats hogwash. Disagree? Prove it. You seem like a man who cares about facts and researches everything, so why dont you enlighten me on his toxicology report and prove your point rather than hollow statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       His whole family was very adament about his death being more than an accident for some time. And to be ruled an accident within hours after it happened? Yeah right.

       No, it's because you're a fucking moron.

      <p>
       You're saying he didn't have anything in his system but it doesn't mean he wasn't incapacitated.  You are looking for a reason to make him seem unstable.

       The man is dead now and you are actively trying to taint his legacy by making shit up about him.  You are a fucking coward seriously you are.

       Bullshit.

      <p>
       I am the one trying to "taint his legacy"?
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU are the one that is saying a shadowy govt organization secretly tampered with his car, then took over control of it and forced it into a tree at high speed.
YOU are saying that this was done as a revenge killing because he embarrassed General McChrystal, or they wanted to murder him to prevent further embarrassment because he was writing a new book or a new article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you fucking serious? Seen too many movies have you?
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT is not "tainting" his legacy? Are you out of your fucking mind? I suppose you think that his brother, the guy who knew him more than anybody, is "tainting his legacy"? Go ahead. SAY IT. Tell us that his brother is "tainting his legacy". Because HE is the one that was saying these things, that I can rationally and logically agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But the govt may be threatening his brother also..." - Shut the fuck up stupid...
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU are trying to create a "conspiracy" where there isn't. YOU are the one "tainting his legacy". Stop being a drama queen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sorry that I try to keep my opinions about most things firmly and rationally rooted in reality and not some twisted internet fantasy world based around an evil cat petting James Bond character who sought out revenge on a reporter and used technology to control the guys car and murder him.
