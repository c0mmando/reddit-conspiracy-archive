       4 of the 9 conspiratard mods have been banned by the admins of reddit for manipulation of the voting system.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I thought they didn't vote brigade!  Bah ha ha ha!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a friendly reminder that a lot of what we are doing is worthwhile even if the votes seem to say otherwise.  Please remember that this does NOT mean that everyone who participates at conspiratard is a vote gamer, but it surely does reflect on their credibility when almost half of their mods get banned overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I hope this shows everyone here that vote gaming doesn't pay off.  I know some of you probably operate multiple accounts and the temptation to pad your stats is there.  Wouldn't the world be a better place if everyone was honest?

       What are you talking about? Someone doxed the olive garden OP and shared the findings with the mods. Turned out to be absolutely true. I saw the newspaper article about the house burning down and the OP's FB page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it's free publicity for OG, but there was nothing false about it. What happened was what the OP said happened, and it happened to him (it was his father's house, they did get their meal comped.)

       Uhh, what? Very confused where you got it from that I was being condescending.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a definition says "especially" this or that, it's saying in many or most cases, but not all cases. Thus it's not the case that the word 'conspiracy' inherently implies secrecy. Yes, it literally says "especially secretly", which automatically implies that there are times when secrecy is not involved. And, again, it's only a few of the many definitions that even mention secrecy, so this shows even further that it's not inherent in a conspiracy that it be secret. Two people can 'conspire' to make a cake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Etymologically 'conspire' is from Old French conspirer (14c.), from Latin conspirare "to agree, unite, plot," literally "to breathe together" or perhaps the notion is "to blow together" musical instruments, i.e., "To sound in unison." (
       <a href="http://www.etymonline.com">
        www.etymonline.com
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       I was not under any impression about your attitude regarding "rhetorical questions" so I have no idea where you got that from.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, the evidence you're asking about is not only in this very topic thread, it's also found in many places around reddit. Encouraging people to do a thing and then having them actually go and execute that action = conspiracy, whether or not it's a "bunch of immature redditors" doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect you divined from my post that I was being 'condescending' because of some inherent insecurity, because I literally said nothing which was condescendingly put to you. In fact I apologized at the very beginning of my post:

       I understand that, but that's not how the word is commonly used.. If you were to hear the word "conspiracy" do you think about two people conspiring to make a cake? There's a reason when you google the word,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is one of the first things to come up.

       You said by definition it includes secrecy. It doesn't
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       imply secrecy in all definitions of the word according to dictionary.com. There are multiple definitions which do not include secrecy. How is this hard to understand?

      <p>
       Yeah, the common usage implies conspiracy. But you appealed to definition originally, not common usage.
      </p>
      <p>
       In common usage, the phrase "begging the question" is used to say "with this piece of evidence, the question then becomes so and so". But this is not,
       <em>
        by definition

        You said by definition it includes secrecy. It doesn't necessarily imply secrecy in all definitions of the word according to dictionary.com. There are multiple definitions which do not include secrecy. How is this hard to understand?

       And when people use the phrase "begging the question", they are commonly using it incorrectly. So yeah, in common usage it implies secrecy. That doesn't mean secrecy is inherent to the definition. But I see it was just an issue of semantics. Common usage is different from definition/common definition. Begging the question doesn't mean "the next question in light of evidence" yet commonly it is used that way. It's still incorrect.

      <p>
       Yeah, I see that now. I honestly wasn't aware there was another definition of conspiracy that was similar to the main definition, but without using secrecy in the definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are plenty of expressions used incorrectly, English is incredibly hard to learn (I still consider myself at about a 3 out of 10 in terms of understanding this language) I just wasn't defending my initial point, once you pointed out the definition thing, I was on board with what you were saying.

       So in English, the more common usage isn't considered the 'main' definition  of the word?

      <p>
       I've been in America for a little bit, and they teach English in primary and secondary, just it's not really a main focus. The language is brutal to learn, so I tend to ask a lot of questions so I can really understand a concept.

       I guess some people would say that. I wouldn't say that. I was never taught that there was a "main" definition that I can remember. I'm philosophically minded so I tend to demand definitions because they're generally very elusive unless someone lays it out clearly and distinctly. There's nothing more frustrating than talking to people for hours and seeing that they think we agree about something, but knowing in my heart and mind that we don't agree because we were just speaking nonsense to each other since all our definitions were not aligned.

       "Potential evidence". Are you for real? Saying there is "potential" evidence is like saying "I guess there could be evidence for that, then again I don't have any and I'm so comfortable with my preformed opinions that neither do I want nor do I search for it."

       Okay, but a lot people in this sub do the same kind of things. Harassing people who dare to question a conspiracy theory instead of taking it as an undeniable truth... Even if there's no proof, do the mods of

       A recent example of blatant vote-gaming/trolling condoned by that group:

       Follow the link and check out the voting. It's so obvious. That whole subreddit needs to be banned, not just the mods.

       The core members of conspiratard have a long history and many observers have agreed over decades that the core people are paid, ever since they Digg days running brigades to influence the public view. Otherwise, they would have to be insane fanatics to spend so much time over so long running that kind of operation in support of the neocons and Israel. Although the key core people ARE sociopaths.

       Well, it is common knowledge that the US Military uses sockpuppets to influence discussions and spread pro-US propaganda on foreign social media sites. I don't think anybody has
       <em>
        officially
       </em>
       admitted that this technology is used domestically, but it isn't that much of a stretch to think that private organizations would.

       The better question is: why do you think political campaigns would admit to gaming social media?

       Anyway there are plenty of services out there that specifically game reddit. Head over to

       I don't understand your point or how it's relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       They questioned science as something controlled by political agendas, but in science results are published, regardless of agenda, unless your science is unsound and fails peer review processes. Never have I heard of some results being buried for some political reason outside of the conspiracy crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also definitely in science, considering I'm a biologist, but you're free to assume what you'd like about me, just as I'm free to assume whatever I'd like about you.

       You should read the book. Bryson is far from the "conspiracy crowd". The scientific community and ever-shifting science orthodoxy is definitely political to a fault.

       Isn't that a contradiction?  You can argue that they're wrong because their claims change or that they're wrong because their claims don't change, but you can hardly say both things at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why are you generalizing all scientists as though they had a single coordinated agenda?  Even further, suggesting that science is a single body of dogmatic "because I said so" claims is more than a little silly.

       At least they weren't involved in banning users from their sub who disagreed with their ideas and asked for proof..  That is something you were quite active in when you and some other users w/out open minds started a conspiracy sub.  The number of hypocrites in the conspiracy community is outrageous...

       I'm not sure which is worse..  Having someone ignorant chime in from time to time / downvote ridiculous theories, or MODs who ban users that disagree with the narrative being discussed..
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno about you, but I can tolerate a few trolls..  What I can't stand are mods(a few from this sub) create another sub, invite everyone, then ban those who question their theories.  In my opinion MODs like that are much doing more damage than the conspiritards..  Sad thing is the MODs I am referring to are still mods here in r/conspiracy.  There needs to be a new election process here at r/conspiracy so we can get rid of the MODs who are shills.

       How is crossposting gaming the votes? The subreddit specifically links the craziest, least evidence based stuff that you guys post (which applies to almost everything here, now that I think about it). There's no asking people to downvote things, just pointing out some of the more hilariously ignorant and uninformed posts from the subreddit (and around the internet in general).

       That people are going to the subreddit and then voting of their own free will? I fail to see how it's vote brigading to link a post to like minded individuals (kind of like how every post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a post for like minded individuals). Sure they might go out and vote negatively because they generally feel the same way about conspiratorial subjects, but that doesn't mean that someone is going out and telling them to downvote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use the subreddit and downvote posts whenever the content is incredibly misinformed (I've seen tons of blatantly incorrect biology, for example, which bothers me as a biologist) or is exceptionally racist/anti-semetic (you have to admit, your sub harbors a ton of what basically amounts to Nazis). Those are all of my free will. When someone posts some stupid shit about "911 truth" sure I disagree and think its a load of shit, but I don't downvote that because I don't care about it. Everything I downvote is because I want to downvote it, not because I'm somehow being told to downvote your posts or upvote "friends" (I don't actually use the sub enough to know any usernames anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds to me like you're jumping to conclusions without knowing the evidence (go figure). Maybe some people are brigading, maybe they aren't, but it seems silly and overly authoritarian to ban anyone who makes a crosspost.

       Unfortunately a goodly number of the subscribers at conspiratard aren't like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       See you just composed a normal civil response to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the traffic coming from conspiratard fails to make a point, they just call people names and click the down vote button.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but I would rather talk to a polite Nazi than I would a shit spewing troll.  And I don't like Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only more people from conspiratard would compose themselves like YOU just did, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.  When you create an environment that breeds hate toward a group of people you end up with the circle jerk of hate that is conspiratard.  Just look at titles of the posts there, its rooted in hate.  If you replaced the word conspiratards with "niggers" you guys would be indistinguishable from

       You disagree?

       So you have a polite Nazi who you can talk to and he/she will respond with a reasoned reply that is on topic even though  biased with national-socialist leanings.

       Are fine though right? Don't act like your shit doesn't stink when this cesspool of a subreddit caters to some of the most offensive stuff I've heard people say, not in the least the snarky 'enlightened' attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I've been subscribed to /conspiritard for a while now. I've never been urged nor inclined to downvote something other than my own free will and when I have joined the discourse here, I've been met with downvotes due to holding a contrarian viewpoint and have been called a shill multiple times. Let's not forget the whole downvote bot rigamarole - that shit hit me too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Alright, bit too ragey but my points stand, albeit a little crassly. I lied about the never been urged to downvote anything too -

       edit:  When you started that joke of a sub called
       <a href="/r/conspiracyV2">
        /r/conspiracyV2
       </a>
       (before you made it private) you made a thread saying you had "PROOF" that the Boston Bombings were staged.  That there were actors, and make-up artists setting up the scene.  I posted saying if that were the case, both bomb areas would have had to been blocked off to civilians..  Thus making each person have credentials to be in the "blast zone" to do the make-up/act.  Your proof was a montage of military drills using amputee actors..  Mind you shows ZERO proof of the Boston Bombing being staged.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO, I proceed to ask you for a source to what you were proposing.  You didn't provide the source, but you did ban me from the sub.  I honestly wasn't surprised.  The best part is on the right your sub said some thing like "A place for open discussion" which was clearly bullshit.  A place for open discussion as long as they are agreeing with what you believe, lol.

       You were actually inviting people to come over to the sub, so one could only assume you were apart of it's conception.  You also had "r/conspiracyV2" in your flair for a short period after it's birth.  Anyway, you were the author of the thread I am referring to..  Maybe you were just posting whatever you could to start discussions, but you were the author.  I was also banned after I asked for the source..    Maybe you didn't ban me, but I only assume it was you cause we were having the discussion on one of the 8+ threads you had posted.

       No, no, no. You're the same as the last flock of people calling for a mod change again which isn't needed. We don't want any people infiltrating the modship here like what's happened on several other subs on Reddit. The mods removed people from
       <a href="/r/conspiritard">
        /r/conspiritard
       </a>
       posting bullshit here not for discussion but to undermine this place. A few well placed calls for mod change followed those posts but you could smell it from a mile away.

       I may not understand the extreme conspiritards, but having MODs like 9000sins and Flytape is just as bad as the trolls that visit from r/conspiritard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've honestly only visited conspiritard sub once or twice and that was because someone linked it in a thread here in r/conspiracy.  I don't know how extreme they can be, but I honestly just ignore trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think there are some GREAT mods here at r/conspiracy, but a couple of them have rubbed me the wrong way just for challenging their theory..

       What game are you talking about?  If you're trying to say I am from conspiratard, then I'm afraid you're mistaken.  I've maybe been there twice in my entire reddit career.  One of those few visits came from seeing this thread in r/conspiracy.  Check my post history and you will see.  Good job looking ill-informed.

       But I see jcm267 got cleared. Just like 9000sins was reinstated with all his buddies after shitting around the sub and bitching about getting spanked for trying to rule like a dictator. I think it's a valid point about how mods who get fingered for wrong doing still end up in the system. Sounds the same as government, don't it?

       The mods had agreed to try a new tactic for combating the troll infestation, ahem the mods who actually participated in this subreddit.

      <p>
       What you did was vandalism, plain and simple.  It was painfully obvious after the vandalism when hordes of trolls were running through the sub shouting pointless obscenities and circlejerking freely.

       was great and worked great for a long time and would continue to be great because of THE VOTING SYSTEM! I know its bullshit and can be gamed like everything but in reality it made this little corner of internet IMHO just a little different and therefore better. Now just like every fucking other site we have a few dumbass kids who have enough time to stick their nose in everything and fuck it up. Just let it be.

       I think their reasoning is that they were brand names and could use that to establish authority. I.e. using it to help crush newbie opposition. Plus some of them have narcissistic personality disorder together with their antisocial personality disorder, these often run in parallel. The shell becomes a symbol of their power. Which is why Josh crows his longevity so much.

       Since I have no comment history for perusal, I offer a brief introduction of myself as a prelude to my comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was an active participant in this subreddit (r/conspiracy) for the better part of 3 years before I finally broke my reddit addiction. I maintain a couple of my old usernames (you only have one? you're an exception to the rule, then), but only on a periodic basis to prevent forfeiture of a subreddit I [don't] moderate. Under previous usernames, I have been very critical of some of the mods here, but have also been very aware of the NoLibs, r/conspiratard, and r/SRD invasions of this subreddit - in fact, I've made top of the front page of BOTH r/conspiratard and r/SRD at least once if not more than once.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm here, now, posting this comment as my tribute to members of this community who befriended me in my early days (some of whom are now inactive as well) and allowed me to get my "sea legs" (so to speak) on reddit. You, friends, will recognize my voice and hear the clarity of my perspective (untarnished by any of the immediacy of the current drama).
      </p>
      <p>
       We've known about these people for a long time. Prior to the revamp(s) of the moderation of this subreddit which began a little over a year and a half ago, we dealt with them ... all of them... on a per comment basis. This was an unregulated, unmoderated battleground for truth - it was THE battleground. And, as much as we battled "those guys", we also battled our own inner demons (anyone remember the infamous Johnny_Cash?)... again, on a per comment basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the moderator selections last spring, this subreddit changed, due in large part to one particular moderator's participation in r/conspiratard - yes, I'm talking about 9000sins. He goes there and establishes mildly taunting dialogue with those cretins, which has the direct result of drawing more of their attention to this subreddit. And, it has been a very vicious, repetitive cycle of inter-subreddit drama ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I appreciate the fact that the admins are seriously looking into this issue (gaming the vote), I also hold one moderator of THIS subreddit accountable for the current state of affairs in this inter-subreddit relationship. 9000sins fed the trolls on a very regular basis. And, not only did he feed them here in r/conspiracy, he actually went to their home turf (thus out of sight of most of the members of this sub) to keep them well-fed... to keep the drama ("waaa. they're downvoting me!") flowing. ("let's make rules based on the behavior I'm eliciting from r/conspratard! a whole long list of them!")
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: While you may want to revel in the demise (or at least intense scrutiny) of the r/conspiratard-ians, take care that you don't overlook the big picture of what's been going on in BOTH of these subreddits, by members of BOTH moderation teams.

       Very well said.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, before I was a mod, I didn't pay too much attention to subjects I wasn't personally interested in.  So I honestly didn't read 95% of the shit here.  After I becamea mod i started to read a lot of shit here that I don't personally think holds any water.  And I started keeping up with certain users who had a tendency to get overly emotional about things and even bully people.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a few months of REALLY paying attention in here, I started to notice patterns.  Little cliques of people who migrate around the comments sections and even a few cliques who always argued with the same people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am half convinced that there are people who argue with themselves under multiple accounts.

       I think it is pretty interesting as well. Despite having almost 150k subscribers, I really feel like I am talking to the same 20 or 30 people in most of the comment threads. Especially when you start to lean towards the more unrealistic side of the kind of stuff that gets posted here.

       I can't help but ask, but did you have a hand in the banning of those mods at all? If you're able to talk about it, anyways.

       tl;dr: Get 9000Sins. He is bad and should not be moderator.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally totally disagree with these ceaseless tries to discredit 9000Sins and take away his moderator rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       His actions were transparent and democratic. He opened a number of self posts asking for advice on how to handle the downvote brigades from

        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       .

      <p>
       But of course there will be always people with the motive, to bring 9000Sins down. But it's on everyone to decide for himself, what game you really are playing.

       It's good to know the history behind the conspiratard rage. I doubt it's something as simple as a friendly "forum war" though. Personally I think some of those shills are
       <strong>
        paid
       </strong>
       very, very well by corporate and political interests.

       I'm not sure you can pin blame on a single person.  The simple fact is reddit grew and so did conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy was "pure" years ago, a hidden gem with some of the most intelligent discussion held here.  This fact alone, is what caused the "crash".  A forum
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>
       exist in a pure state without attracting the attention of some 'gate keepers'.  The method to destroy knowledge is
       <em>
        always the same
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Divide - find gray areas in rules and exploit them.  Force people to chose a 'side'.
       </li>
       <li>
        Taint the well - add meaningless discussion, crazy theories to tarnish the legitimate ones.
       </li>
       <li>
        Antagonize - incite &amp; encourage violence, create enemies among friends.
       </li>
       <li>
        Derogate - lower the moral by associating the group with as many negative affiliated 'pre-packaged names'.  (truther, etc)
       </li>
       <li>
        Get Inside - Once the target site is in shambles, a white knight will appear with all the solutions and make a plea for 'modship/leadership'
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

       You explicitly suggested that there are false flag posts making up extreme theories in order to make the subreddit look bad. Have you considered that it may actually just be people who believe those insane things (9/11 inside job, reptiles, global Zionist conspiracy, anything Alex Jones says)?

       (I don't, it isn't funny) if the mods censored things they didn't find funny and only let the funny stuff through. Sure I wouldn't get the whole picture, but maybe I subscribed because the censoring mods share my sense of humor (just as the mods of
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">

       Their side of the story? Really? The mods of conspiratard are nothing more than trolls and haters. They disagree with other people's perspectives so they make a point to invade places like this with their self-rightgeous bullshit. I've dealt with a few of those guys before and they are as aggressive as they are narrow-minded. They are all that is wrong with reddit.

       They disagree with conspiratorial thinking.  They do not "invade," they show up.  You are on a public forum and they are also using that forum to point of very real flaws in what's being posted/discussed.  They might be crass, or even mean at times, but welcome to Reddit.  That doesn't make them guilty of vote rigging.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in a forum that is host to literal Nazis, if you think the conspiratard mods are what's wrong with reddit I can see why they'd be "aggressive."

       Alright son, "invade" or "show up" it makes no difference. I'm no stranger to conspiratard. It is a sub that is a dedicated counterpoint circlejerk to r/conspiracy. they don't point out real flaws when they do post here, they just post the same tiresome refrain of "ermahgerd j00 guys are teh retards because dat shit didnt hap3n, j00 biteches are st00pid tr00ther asses bring on teh d0wnv0tes!". They rarely bring up valid counterpoints, they never post sources. They just ride up in here cry bullshit, downvote with their sockpuppet accounts, then ride back to their home subreddit to slap each other on the back and tell each other how right they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm not saying they can't do that, they are clearly within their rights, but that doesn't make their actions defensible. They are not martyrs to the cause of truth, they are socially retarded fucking children. As far as the vote rigging thing goes: I can't say for sure, but as I said before, they are children and I wouldn't put it past them. Especially considering on how a few of them were allegedly apart of the problem that caused the downfall of Digg (like that ghost of nolibs faghat).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as there being a nazi or two here. Well, I don't like that jew hater either but to be honest you're gonna attract people like that with a sub like this (which has also gone way downhill over the last year or so).
      </p>

       And while I respect your defense of those dick tips, your energy is misplaced.

       In all fairness there's a good amount of stuff that gets posted here that doesn't deserve a serious response.  Yes, recent things about Monsanto, GMO's, or other grey-ish areas should be backed up with evidence on both sides but anti-Judaism (opps, I mean "anti-zionism"), Alex Jones parroting, and endless accusations of false-flags really don't deserve more than the most base dismissal.  Once one has swollowed thoes lines, it becomes a trial to even get them to acknowledge the existence of evidence proving them wrong. Sometimes it's best just to call them stupid and move along.

       Indeed, and I agree with you on most every point. Like I said before, this subreddit has lost its moxy and a lot of the shit posted here is just that. But just because one believes Mormon doctrine is full on hogwash doesn't mean one should march to the Tabernacle and and jeer at everyone there. It serves no purpose except maybe to inflate an already bloated sense of self-worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's exactly what the folks at conspiratard do. See my above comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       One more thing, there is a clear distinction between anti-zionism and anti-judaism just as there is a difference between zionism and judaism. The whole "lol if you hate israel you hate jews therefore youre a nazi" argument is so fucking played out. Sorry, that's just a pet peeve.

       Umm... the fact that you are so obsessed with them as to keep track of every off-color thing they say is kinda creepy to say the least.  And now that I've remembered that at least one of our mods has a subreddit dedicated to stalking them I can't help but wonder where these accusations of "vote rigging" might have come from.  How's that for a conspiracy theory?

       You must also think other watchdog groups are "creepy", like the ADL for example? You think they are "stalking" antisemites? Or are you just being biased? Something tells me it's the latter.

       While I don't agree with all of their positions, I do think they are at least attempt to stop groups of people who have histories of genuine and real violence driven by bigotry.

       You can imagine that your dear subreddit is harmless all you want, doesn't change the well documented fact that the people who created and run it are heartless bigots and warmongers. They are openly trying to harm people psychologically, and in some cases they do appear to
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/16kxk0/jcm267_posts_detailed_personal_information_on/">

       So what proof of this, exactly, do you have? There was ONE mod there who said that he got banned for upvoting his friends' posts, but that's it. The other user profiles that don't exist anymore have given no such indication that this has happened, nor is there any other evidence to suggest as much, from what I've seen. Even if they did, they aren't getting banned for doing anything that actually is related to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that this can get so many upvotes with little evidence, and none actually in the self post, is why
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       makes fun of this sub. Most of the time, the people here pick which parts they want to read into and end up with a very narrow picture of the real thing because they want everything to support the narrative they've chosen to believe, as is the case here with the supposed "vote gaming."

       The common misconception with this subreddit, and i think one of the major driving forced behind the existence of
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       , is that people think upvotes, or regurgitation of the information, means we believe it. Which isnt true--at least if we do believe certain things its after extensive research, not one-off articles or posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We upvote or regurgitate to get more information and spread the discussion. No one here denies that many of the things here are obscure, understudied, and sometimes blatantly wrong. Because of this we upvote and circulate to get the truth, to encourage discussion, To get people into the threads to debunk or support the claims. Most everyone here takes everything they read—whether its here or anywhere, whether it supports or refutes their beliefs—with a grain of salt, and most abhor that someone would just believe something because someone said it. If that wasn't the case—that we take in
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       and draw our on conclusions—we'd all be out there parroting the official stories.  Those who dont encourage critical thinking or think critically themselves are not helping any kind of truth movement—trusting
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or any 'alternative' news network or forum is just as detrimental as trusting CNN, The FDA, or a religious doctrine without question. If you think we believe everything we read here, based solely on the individual articles, i can assure you that that is not the case, at least with the overwhelming majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now of course, that's not to say everyone who has seen some evidence of one or more "conspiracies" and has become convinced—often on far too little evidence—thinks this way.
       <em>
        And
       </em>
       that's not the say that the majority of people who beieve in one or more conspiracies think this way—I honestly couldn't tell you what the ratio is, however it'd probably be safe to assume that, like the rest of America, the majority just regurgiate what they hear as fact; it's simply a change of source from the mainstream to the alternative.
       <em>
        But
       </em>
       those of us who
       <em>
        study
       </em>
       these things, and are constantly on a quest for knowledge, almost exclusively go about things in this way. Also it's important to note, just because 'stupid' people believe something doesn't make it untrue and just because smarter people believe somethings doesn't make it true (something rarely considered by much of the scientifically literate community).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying  you should believe anything here to be truth. I have my own convictions about certain content here but I would never want you to just believe them because I said so, or because
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       said so. in fact I am specifically advocating that you remain skeptical and questioning, but please do it
       <em>
        evenly
       </em>
       and back it up with research—questioning the motives of both those in power
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       those without, not simply being skeptical of things which frighten the stability of your world view (easier said than done of course)— and not just googling "[conspiracy theory] debunked" and believing that it's false just because there is a page "debunking" it. As is the case for anyone who has
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       looked at both sides of JFK or 9/11  or other thoroughly-documented-but-still not-ackowledged-as-fact 'conspiracies', you will see not only the often times flaws in logic of these 'debunking' sites but an ubiquitous lack of the whole story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to give a little example of
       <strong>
        one piece of one 
theory
       </strong>
       , 9/11, the 'conspiracy theory' I am most well versed in: the "debunking" sites, at least the ones I've read,  don't even address 10% of the 'evidence' for the 'theory', and not to mention most of 'our' evidence is 'mainstream accepted'—yet little known to most of the public. All we did was connect the dots that are already considered by to be fact. Of course, there is far more information about 9/11 in both directions, but for something which has so much concrete evidence, reading one article from a mega corporation whose main motive is profits and
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/en/news-section/41-articles/604-debunking-the-real-911-myths-why-popular-mechanics-cant-face-up-to-reality-part-1.html">
        whose logic on the matter has serious evidence of being fundamentally flawed
       </a>
       , or believing a government funded report  which you never read and was never even peer reviewed, and just saying STUPID CONSPIRACY THEORISTS is all sorts of detrimental to you, and our nation. If we're wrong, we're wrong, but is there really so much wrong with being a check and balance to the government that no longer exists as a result of corporate control and media censorship?  As a community, just like the rest of society, we're not perfect; we have our idiots, our racists, our fear-mongers, etc but that doesn't mean what we do here is useless. (see:

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, those who most need to read this, are too hopped up on how great it makes them feel to be
       <em>
        smarter than those stupid conspiratards, they'll believe anything fucking tin foil hat wearing nut bags!
       </em>
       but my job is to inform, not convince.

       It is the reddit system itself.  Notice how you can't talk about reddit in
       <a href="/r/theoryofreddit">
        /r/theoryofreddit
       </a>
       anymore?  Reddit, Inc. makes a lot of money for Advance Publications now and they don't want that to change.  If we are actually allowed free reign of the place we would quickly turn it into a cooperatively owned site, which is exactly what we were discussing a year and a half ago when Advance Publications took reddit.com away from Condé Nast Digital and formed Reddit, Inc.  Because we were self-organizing.

       Reddit destroys history, I don't have the links anymore.  I should spend a day google-fooing and find some of the threads.  They are linked to from other places, but reddit's publicly searchable history is now archived from that far back.
      </p>
      <p>
       For reference, I believe it was between December 2010 and March 2011 that Reddit, Inc. was founded.

       It is funny when you mention credibility, for those who are still Reddit, wake the fuck up, it is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The voting system in Reddit and Reddit Inc. itself encourage karma whoring and votes gaming. i.e. It doesn't work as a forum, this is a goddamn market of opinions or ads.

       That's because we don't continually create sockpuppets to invade Conspiratard.  Seriously.  A huge percentage of the subscription base here has been created just for the purpose of disruption.

       And even if I were a suckpoppet account, how is that evidence for the claim that people "continually (!) create sockpuppets" and that they make up "a huge (!) percentage of the subscription base" here? And where is your evidence on the intentionality you presuppose, i.e. "the purpose of disruption"?

       Whatever.  Disagree with me.  I really don't give a fuck.  I presented an idea that will never be going to court, so I don't need to prove it. Not to you, not to anyone.  Those that have been paying attention can clearly see the truth in what I say.  They are the ones I am addressing.

       I admitted none of the words you tried to ascribe to me.  Give it up, dude.  I admitted you don't have a clue what i am talking about OR you are willfully ignorant of the relevant details, such as your very stats themselves, which you ignored.  Go try to bait someone else.

       May I sum up? I asked you (multiple times) for evidence on the claim that a "huge percentage" of the accounts subscribed to this subreddit are sockpuppet accounts "created for the purpose of disruption."
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't provide any evidence for that claim. You said you don't "need to prove it" because we aren't in court (fucking lol). Again, I asked whether you have evidence or not. Your response: "Which part of no was confusing to you?". I wouldn't know what else this could be adressing other than the question I asked you. Yet you still seem to believe in your original claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this isn't admitting that you believe in things you can't provide evidence for, what else could it possibly be? Do you seriously not understand how ridiculous this sounds?

       So, just to be clear here, let me sum this up.  I point to sockpuppets and their shenanigans, one comes in and challenges this assertion, asks for 'proof'.  I point to the sockpuppet's account for ONE piece of evidence, the sockpuppet tries to derail by getting personal and putting words in my mouth (fingers).  I tell the sockpuppet that I have no interest in this discourse, but the sockpuppet cares not for this assertion either, continues to repeat itself ad infinitum.

       I don't see how my account is proof for "sockpuppet" accounts. Yes, I have more than one account, for various reasons. Does that mean anything? No. Does it mean something to paranoid lunatics? Apparently yes. And does it mean your original assertion is correct? Most definitely not, even if this was a "sockpuppet" account.

       The evidence is in my extensive online experience.  I can't link that for you.  It's anecdotal, at best.  There, I saved you the trouble of giving me those tired words.

       I am in full belief that you are one of several wonderful humans that have been berating me in the same exact ways for years now, since way back on Digg.  I even know who I believe you are.  Can I prove this?  Hell no, and you know it.  What I can do, though, is keep pointing to your behavior here as evidence for my original point.  Keep it up.  It's precious.

       RES is so widely used it would be next to impossible to slip something by all the programmers who use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statistically impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       They mainly use RES to bypass our NP CSS that requires you be subscribed to vote or post.  There is literally nothing we can do to stop that.  The NP CSS is only good at stopping the lazy people.

       jcm267....too bad he cleared. He loves making fun of how Rachel Corrie died. Loves to make the "pancake" jokes and call her all sorts of names. He loves all things police state, Israel, NeoCon, anti-Islam/ Muslim...totally pro war in the Middle East because it's Americas "obligation" to fight for Isreal.

       jcm267 is a scumbag. And I mean that sincerely. He's a Zionist piece of shit that I remember well from my time on digg.

       He led the down vote brigades at digg. He is involved with it here. No doubt in my mind.

       That is why what is surprising is the amount of tolerance that reddit has for their scummy behaviour.  These mods were the original bury brigade on digg.  They have been gaming voting for years.  Literally for years.  They created conspiritard and eps to get help from the useful idiots with their vote-gaming enterprise on reddit because the algorithm was not as easy to manipulate as it was on digg. They have all been banned for it before and they continue to make new accounts and come back and keep doing it.

       I unsubscribed to that sub-reddit last year. Those people are far too ignorant for my liking. They think that every conspiracy is a bullshit one, and when they're faced with the facts, you still end up getting downvoted to oblivion anyways. Good riddance to them.

       A percentage of debunkers are protecting a self held world view, where there entire modus operandi is to shoot down in flames, anything that they come across that conflicts with that.
If this was done with purely academic methods and debate then that is fine and furthers the cause of finding facts by filtering out extraneous information.
But THE VERY POINT OF THIS POST, is that individuals with an agenda have been manipulating the reddit system to give more exposure to their point of view and trying to create a dominant consensus along the line of their thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that method of putting your comments to the top by vote rigging, is completely dishonest! It's not debate or opposing viewpoints I have issue with. It's the completely fucking underhanded way of carrying it out.
I come to a conspiracy forum, and the most upvoted comments on a lot of threads are from people poring scorn on ops original post. That was a red flag for me, and with good reason it seems.
There is a lot of stuff on r/consp that I think is total bullshit. There is a lot of information on other subs i think is bullshit also.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not go to those subs posting thousands of times my opposition to their ideas. I've got shit to do. The very fact that others come here to do this indicates a very motivated opposition to the ideas in here. NOT an honest appraisal of the facts at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       True believers of any stripe whether a hardcore conspiracy head, or a hardcore skeptic, usually shape the facts at hand to fit their pre-conceived notion of the world. 
Which is fine, as long as they don't game the system to try and give their particular point of view the most exposure, and make it the dominant consensus.

       Think about someone who lost a loved one, in a war or in 911. Perhaps in a recent bombing incident. Would you want to embrace a theory that showed that they died for nothing? For money or oil interests? Maybe simply for a political struggle like gun control?

       It's a scary thought and no wonder so many people vehemently fight against it.

       That's a valid point. And people in that situation I wouldn't argue with. Just sympathize with their plight, and think, fuck it, I can see why they feel that way, I'm not going to try and dissuade them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that's the majority of people who come here to debunk though. I may be wrong, who knows.
I don't mind a bit of trolling either, but when it's a planned action by a group of people united in oppostion to a certain point of view, it's just another SRS.

       Concerning the 9/11 thing. I remember watching either dylan avery or one of his guys telling a woman who had lost her guy on 9/11, how it was all a conspiracy and he died for an inside job.

       Pretty much disgusted me, to watch him do that to her, it was a shitbag move of the highest order.

       Now I may be new at this, but I'm pretty sure this is just a game of shuffling chairs and like most governing bodies, this is just an illusion of a power shift. Things got a little hot, something was "done about it", and the cycle continues. What was the ultimate reasoning behind their actions? There's a thought.

       Unfortunately a goodly number of the subscribers at conspiratard aren't like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       See you just composed a normal civil response to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the traffic coming from conspiratard fails to make a point, they just call people names and click the down vote button.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but I would rather talk to a polite Nazi than I would a shit spewing troll.  And I don't like Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only more people from conspiratard would compose themselves like YOU just did, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.  When you create an environment that breeds hate toward a group of people you end up with the circle jerk of hate that is conspiratard.  Just look at titles of the posts there, its rooted in hate.  If you replaced the word conspiratards with "niggers" you guys would be indistinguishable from
       <a href="/r/niggers">
        /r/niggers

       Well I still haven't seen any evidence, and I'll agree that's the only type of comment that I see removed (and other blatantly unscientific nonsense).

       But you've provided actual evidence that they link to this sub.

       I did misread. Apologies.

       But I see jcm267 got cleared. Just like 9000sins was reinstated with all his buddies after shitting around the sub and bitching about getting spanked for trying to rule like a dictator. I think it's a valid point about how mods who get fingered for wrong doing still end up in the system. Sounds the same as government, don't it?

       You won't ever get evidence in here. The closest you will get is a rude advice to "do the research yourself".
