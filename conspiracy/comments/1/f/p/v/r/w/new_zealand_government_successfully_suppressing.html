Before research was destroyed and suppressed, the ruins were dated to 500 years pre-Maori colonisation. Maori did not use stone in any construction at any point in history. </p>

<p>The admission that Maori were not the first people to reach New Zealand would have a huge impact of the ongoing issue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi_claims_and_settlements">Treaty of Waitiangi Settlements,</a> and rewrite the global history of seafaring, New Zealand and was not thought to be discovered at this time much less colonized.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.elocal.co.nz/view_Article%7Eid%7E485%20%20%20%20%20%20%20.html">This article</a> is using comic sans non ironically. That is how old most sources are, how effective the suppression is.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.everythingselectric.com/forum/index.php?topic=312.0">This thread</a> contains every known photo of the ruins. They are all amateur photography taken by people who snuck in before it was completely shut down. Needless to say, the forest is akin to a downunder Area51.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very similarly in the USA they found some ancient white guy buried up on a reservation and the Natives up there supressed it.  One of the greatest historical fines but they were worried about burial rites (FYI the guy was thousands of years old which means his burial rites are nothing we know) but the truth is that they wanted to suppress the information because it threatens tribal land rights. </p>

<p>Fortunately they were not successful in their suppression of this information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>white brown black, its all the same.  Just joking.  Seriously he was white.  Kennewick Man was most likely part of a small group of early Caucasians who crossed the Bering Straight. A significant numbers of early Caucasians passed through China and smaller groups even traveled to Japan and Indonesia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two other people who concluded he was not.
That that I care either way or even think it&#39;s worth arguing.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s cool that he seemed to have different than expected genetics, and all the possibilities that opens up for north american history.</p>

<p>The only way I could see it really mattering is if someone had something at stake in terms of whiteness being near ubiquitous in the ancient world.</p>

But as none are written by &quot;qualified&quot; people. No-one even takes a second glance.</p>

<p>Did you not realise that NZ history is only relevant if it doesn&#39;t make people look bad or wrong.</p>
