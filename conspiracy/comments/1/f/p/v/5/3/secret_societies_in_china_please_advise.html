       Hi r/conspiracy!
      </p>
      <p>
       I am making a research on (as title says) secret societies in China (including Singapore, Hong Kong, Maccau and Taiwan); especially in the past century. Now, I have found whole bunch of literature, which pretty much got me lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've started with Commetee of 300 and got curious with numerous Dragon Families that appear in said area. Most of literature I've bump into is about Li (also known as Lee); Red Dragon family. Some of the societies i've bumped to so far, relating to them, are Red Spears Secret Society, Green Gang, Ko-Ino Hui and even Harlot Christian Church.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, all of that look very up-side-down to me, so I am looking to put puzzles in place and make  a systematical overview of all of the said families, their known members and their connectins to secret societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would appreciate any literature that could bring me closer to finishing this task (if there is a book containing all the info of the above, would be perfect). Your personal knowledge on the matter could be helpful too! So please suggest.

       I assume the Green Gang you refer to are related to the Red and Green Societyies/Gang (I've also heard Red and Blue occasionally).  Benjamin Fulford (former Forbes East-Asia bureau chief, and producer of fanciful unverifiable stories), talks a fair amount about them.  He's likely completely full of shit, but they are a real group.  You probably already know this, but they were a group of Ming loyalists who started covert activity at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty in order to restore a Han Chinese to the throne.  With the fall of the Qing and the return of mostly Han Chinese to positions of power, they seem to have become partially or fully integrated with what we call the Triad.  I found basically no published work specifically about them in a quick search.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, I don't know much specifics since Chinese Secret Societies generally work to support the interests of one family, clan or professional trade, rather than the society-wide manipulations of some Western societies.

       That is exactly what I am trying to distinct - the particular families, their members and their area of rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to addmit there is a lot more that i have to learn about Chinese history. As far as I have discovered now, there are five top families currently ruling the mainland China: Chen, Li, Zhang, He, and Huang. Also, in Taiwan, there is Yang family, who appears to be important. Now, i am not sure if each of these families call themselves Dragon Family. For the Dragon families, i have realized there are clans, and each clan claims the rights to heritage of the Chinese Emperors. They're named Dragon and have their color. Li family, for example belongs to Red Dragon family, which seems to be the most influential in mainland China (their PM, and lot of other high positioned state officials seem to be part of this one). The clans are, apparently, accompanied with the secret societies, named by extinctive color, and what I know by now the Red and the Whites are opponents, while Greens seem to support the red. There is also Black society, which, what I have found by now, might be a part of what is now White. All of them work in interest of their respective families. 
There are also numerous sources to lead to believe they're part of New World Order, and illuminati's. On the other hand, many of them seem to be in a relation to quite the opposite idea of new world order. I wouldn't go that far. What I want to find out are the facts on the field from a historical perspective.

       Once I have an overview done, I might try to include whatever else I bump to. Triads are not in my main focus right now, even though it's pretty fascinating too.

       If you come across anything about Northern VS. Southern chinese Societies, please let me know. I recently spent a month in China and Northern (Beijing) culture could not be more different from Guandong province (Hong Kong, Guangzhou [historical Canton]). Perhaps wrongly I think Triads come from Southern China, the historical trading ports of the country.

       I guess an apropriate analogy would be the tension between libertarian economics of Silicoln Valley and draconian Washington D.C.
