        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been seeing what society has turned into, and am especially disgusted with media. I am Canadian, and although I believe we haven&#39;t progressed to as terrible and secret a government as America, I do believe we are close.</p>

<p>I live with my grandparents at the moment, and they watch the news in TV everyday, and also. Read the paper. They consume it like its a daily Bible verse reading, and I try telling them that they are forcefeeding you junk half the time, telling you news that doesn&#39;t really matter so that you don&#39;t have to worry about the real problems.</p>

<p>I recall the Boston bombings, and how they were following everything that happened. The way it was portrayed on TV was fear mongering plain and simple. They didn&#39;t attempt to tell you the details, but rather the effect it had on.people. no.real.information.</p>

<p>Then yesterday I noticed they were talking about new drone style helicopters, how people are worried that they are like the real thing and people might get confused in that regard.</p>

<p>I straight up asked them, Do you see the problem here? Its not that these are available for civilian use, but rather the fact that they exist at all. People can tout them for all their benefits but what it really boils down to is that you are being watched all the damn time.</p>

<p>I was watching the craziest things caught on TV, and was shocked at how much cctv footage there was. Even more shocked that a television network gained access to that footage and was able to profit off it. I know thar has been happening for quite a while now, but it was still shocking to see proof of that right in my face.</p>

<p>I am really worried at the amount of people in this world who are given SOMA to be numbed from what&#39;s really going on in this world. I am glad I found this place where I can find likeminded people, because I have only 2 friends who realise what the hell is happening.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I am scared about how many sheeple there are. I am glad I found you guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same has happened to me over the last year. Take solace in the fact that you are not alone. It&#39;s like waking up from the matrix. You&#39;ve been awakened to it&#39;s existence and are starting to see how it all ties together and manipulates every aspect of everybody&#39;s everyday life. But now knowing what you know, you can no longer go back to living in it, blindly believing this is the way life is supposed to be. You&#39;ve been awakened to your need to serve a higher purpose and to help others do the same by spreading awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Absolutely everything is connected :) there is no better analogy then waking up from the matrix.</p>

<p>How can we spread the information without coming across as crazy people? I understand some people don&#39;t care to hear it at all, and I just don&#39;t want to come across as crazy conspiratard guy who will smoke a joint and talk about how fucked the world is maaan</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simply talking about it and standing together against these injustices is in itself spreading awareness. A revolution can not be inspired without first building an educated army of self-thinkers. And I think this leak just woke a LOT of people up to the reality of how deceitful and untrustworthy our government truly is. The government wants the sheeple to criticize self-thinkers like ourselves. They don&#39;t want people waking up to the reality of the rampant government abuses that have largely gone unquestioned and unanswered until now. We are the core of the revolutionary snowball that is quickly growing in speed and mass awareness.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is just focus on YOU.  Make sure <em>your</em> ship is in order.  Be the beacon of light you wish others to be.  If you can do that, then others will follow you like moths to the light without you having to tell them anything really.  Just make sure and do YOUR THING.  Don&#39;t try to be a leader to anyone but your own Greater Self.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear is what they want you to feel.</p>

<p>They only have power over you if you fear them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re not dangerous. I&#39;m just saying that if you see a rattle snake in the road freaking out won&#39;t help the situation. Keep calm, learn as much as you can about rattle snakes and you&#39;ll be fine. Help others <em>who wish to learn</em> about rattle snakes. With understanding you can deal with the situation without too much fuss. Snakes will come and go. You will remain you.</p>

<p>Also, you were once ignorant of these things. Others are currently where you were. You cannot judge them for being what you yourself were. To do so would be to judge yourself. You will find that even if people don&#39;t believe the sort of stuff in this forum many people know that something is afoot. Don&#39;t chase them away by calling them &#39;sheeple.&#39; You&#39;ll set up a hostility pattern of interaction and this is good for the self-appointed rulers. Divide and conquer. We are all in this together. Whether we know it or not. Be easy on yourself and be easy on othrs. This is not a sprint. This is not a short race. This is a marathon. And you&#39;re going to have to help people along the way. Get strong and get ready.</p>

<p>That said; welcome to the club.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the best analogy I have ever heard. I have also realised the guy who owns a coffee shop I frequent is awake as well.</p>

<p>You are right, this is a Marathon, we need to help others and give them seeds that they need to water themselves.</p>

<p>I was on Facebook and some of my American friends were starting to ask questions. I told them that our generation is huge, and if we all woke up, and worked together, we can change things. They seemed exasperated at what I said. They asked, how? How would that work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to change the world - change your mind.</p>

<p>The good thing about right now is that things are so bad that you can&#39;t help but take notice. This actually is a good thing. Most people don&#39;t react to problems until they&#39;re really bad. The problem or the self-appointed rulers acting like dick-holes has gotten so bad that you can&#39;t help but notice. Liberals and Conservatives know that something is up. Many of them get caught in the trap of thinking that it&#39;s a binary opposite problem (Conservatives are the opposite of my label and so all the problems of the world must be their fault, right? Right? Yeah.). That said, they have the beginning step already on lock down. They know that there is something worth thinking about. Even if their conclusions and thoughts get molded by the people causing the problems.</p>

<p>Your friends sound like the kinds of people who will believe what they&#39;re told. To some extent this same phenomenon is right here in this very sub. You&#39;ll see untold posts about how it&#39;s all The Jews or it&#39;s all The Reptilians and so on. People who have these beliefs will filter for those posts that support their views. We all do this. It&#39;s called &quot;confirmation bias.&quot; Just know that if you say things that do not go along with their beliefs you&#39;ll probably be dismissed because what you&#39;re talking about does not, in any way, fit in with their model of &quot;reality.&quot; </p>

<p>This is where creativity comes into play.</p>

<p>You cannot just go and tell someone that their whole life is a sham and expect them to smack their forehead and say thank you. They&#39;ll naturally be very upset because this means a lot of emotional investment that they&#39;ll have to abandon. This is actually, on a psychological level, very, very upsetting. You can&#39;t just take that away from them. They, like you, have to be guided into new areas of thought. The creativity part is when you think of ways to do this so that you don&#39;t psychologically harm your friends and family. You don&#39;t just show a cave-dweller the sun. You have to show the lights at the far end of the cave first. You then get to show the blue sky. Only after getting used to this strange light over a period of time do you finally show the blazing object. And only when <em>they&#39;re</em> ready to see it. You can&#39;t see it for them. They have to see it for themselves.</p>

<p>Blah, blah, blah. Jesus, do I prattle on.</p>

<p>Anyway, how can they change these things?</p>

<p>The answer is amazingly simple: you are a person. Your life has value. You are important. You have power. By being a good person and by choosing to participate in things you agree with or choosing not to participate in things you don&#39;t agree with you take your life back. You take your power back. Right now the self-appointed rulers wish to keep us in a position of non-power. No choice. They wish for us to submit to their arbitrary and damaging laws and social programs. The solution is to not play their game. You [play your own game. Their society blows. But that doesn&#39;t mean all societies are bad. It&#39;s just that theirs is a bullshit model. So don&#39;t go along with that model. You can go along with other models. This is what it means to be human. You get to live your own life. If someone doesn&#39;t like it [self-appointed rulers] that&#39;s too godamn bad. You choose your friends and you choose what you value; they don&#39;t get to tell you what&#39;s really real or what&#39;s really important. The self-appointed rulers are very likely a bunch of psychopaths anyway and as such they don&#39;t actually value anything other than power, glory and monetary wealth. They&#39;re mentally beneath us and they know it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m babbling again.</p>

<p>Basically, you&#39;re now in a larger sphere of thought. Learn as much as you can about everything you can. Learn about Luciferianism too. Lucifer is not Satan. Learn about money and taxation [tribute / serfdom]. Learn about sacred geometry and theology. Learn about mythology. Mythology is one of the most fundamental and important things skipped in education.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/EwPh4dHDmx0">http://youtu.be/EwPh4dHDmx0</a></p>

<p>Through understanding and awareness you can deal with problems.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know a problem exists you can&#39;t deal with it.</p>

<p>Now that you know a problem exists you must fully understand it. The more you understand the more effective the possible solution. The solutions themselves [there are many] are also subject to examination. Some will be more effective than others. Only through thorough understanding can you really deal with a problem. You&#39;re dealing with multinational corporations and literally billions of people who believe bullshit. This is no small thing. Baby steps and patience. Patience with yourself and others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very happy with your ranting, and I will continue to educate myself on these matters.</p>

<p>I think the most difficult part is retaining all this information. The well is deep and full of misinformation just like any other topic, learning to sift through it and find all the pieces will be a difficult journey in itself. </p>

<p>I do will try to give hints of the light to my friends and family, and hopefully they may one day want to see the light. Perhaps in my lifetime I will see change. If not, I hope I pass on knowledge to my children so that they can see change. </p>

<p>We can no longer be selfish. We can no longer think of our generations and how thing benefit &quot;us&quot;. I continuously plan for the benefit of my future, and if change in society will happen in a positive manner, I believe that we need to plan for the next generation and beyond.</p>

<p>Alas, now I am ranting. Researching now!</p>

<p>[edit] Ooh wee there is nothing better than talking to a super educated hotty from another country and she is just chilled out.  What would otherwise be an education disertation on how the world is constructed is just like &quot;ok everyone knows that&quot; and then you move on to build from there.  So painless, so nice.

    <div class="md"><p>Its been put to me that you need to master each part of your brain going upwards or you will be a slave to it.  The cortex is the least significant of all in that there are far more controls going upwards then downwards.  The ego or higher cortex part is essentially told how it is going to be by the basic mammalian brain and then it creates a justification as to why it is so.  There are increasing levels of modularization while still all being a bit fuzzy.  The cortex is supposed to check the lower part and through various specialized regions and alert the lower brain if something is wrong.  The intuitive capability of the lower brain is dramatically more powerful than the math and chess part up above.</p>

<p>The Sociopathic brain is somehow built differently in that it is able to fully utilize the higher cortex part of the brain for solving problems but it is missing the characterstic mammalian empathy part.  It is almost as if a cerebral cortex was spliced onto an aligator brain.  They are cold and calculating and missing some otherwise very mammalian qualities.  You could argue that you have more in common with a dog than a full on sociopath.  Also sociopaths are often (if not always) very bad at certain types of activities, which implies that their condition is brain damage.</p>

<p>Recently on reddit I read an article about spiders where they studied one species of spider and compared at the &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;agressive&quot; ones.  They found that if they created a colony of only the &quot;nice&quot; sharing spiders that eventually they would be overrun by a neighboring group of very agressive and violent ones.  They determined that having just several percent of the spiders be aggressive that it was enough for the species to protect itself and to be able to expand without placing too much social pressure on the group.  I don&#39;t know if the research is solid and will hold up but it seems to be timely in that people are beginning to take quite an interest in human sociopathy, since it has become such a problem.  Also we might be anthropomorphizing spiders in a nonsense way.  I have to add that since <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> always mentions this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>News Flash, you have been with us since the 70&#39;s. Your brainwashing isn&#39;t to the level of America&#39;s because ours has been around for a very long time. However, you have your own form of propaganda.</p>

<p>They play on two things with Canadians. Ego and Humor. If something is uncomfortable you laugh it off, if it is a matter of facts, you brow beat with degrees and factoid arguments. </p>

<p>The difference is your people are more egotistical by design. If you aren&#39;t, than you are seen as part of the problem, a low life, a loser. If you are not helping the &quot;Great Infrastructure&quot; that Canada has built than you are a trouble-maker. </p>

<p>Canadians have some of the most crass sense of humor as well. Willing to laugh at the most horrific issues with the world and go about their business because Canada is so wonderful. </p>

<p>This, mind you, are the words of the disillusioned is not how I feel about Canada of course, that was an example of the brainwashing. </p>

<p>The truth is Canada is becoming more divided in it&#39;s cast system. That gap is causing people to question things they hadn&#39;t previously thus challenging the social perspective of what is going on to be considered &quot;truth&quot; (I believe the term is Politically Correct, funny this term even exists).</p>

<p>And what we actually see about Canada&#39;s economics is that it begins to really slide in around this time. </p>

<p><a href="http://canadianawareness.org/2012/04/who-changed-the-bank-of-canadas-policies-in-1974-and-why/">http://canadianawareness.org/2012/04/who-changed-the-bank-of-canadas-policies-in-1974-and-why/</a></p>

<p>But to note, the brainwashing propaganda blitz occurred right than. Seeping into your culture people slowly become more Zealous about their beliefs in financial institutions and corporations. Schools began to shift from education to forms of prioritization. </p>

<p>This had already happened in America a long time ago. And so now the humor.</p>

<p>They make you laugh at us Americans. Laugh at how stupid we are. How moronic we are... </p>

<p>Laugh at the stupid humans who have been brainwashed to be cattle. Laugh at how ridiculous they sound. Have television shows where we go ask them questions and laugh as they have no idea what the answer is (but edit out any footage of them getting it right). </p>

<p>Laugh at yourselves, as you are brainwashed too and we know you will never look at this truth because it makes you sick to your stomach knowing that you have been fooled. Laugh until you die.</p>

<p>That is what they do in Canada. Make you laugh at us so much you hate us. Hate us for being such fools. And that hate makes your fellow Canadians not see what we all have in common. That we are all peaceful and on the same side. That we all want the same things, the same loves, the same dreams. And that there is room for all of them. </p>

<p>I am sorry you have to endure this, but rather you see the truth than live a lie? I have many Canadian friends and I can tell you that what they all share in common is a fear of being isolated, that no one knows how they fear. I will tell you what I tell them...</p>

<p>I have many Canadian friends and I can tell you that what they all share in common is a fear of being isolated for what they believe, because they feel like they are the only ones with think that but also because anyone who does question it is ridiculed and trivialized. You are surrounded by people who are made to think a certain way, if you understand that you simply have to forgive them and you will be able to talk to them again. They are all victims.</p>

<p>If you are really on the side of truth than you aren&#39;t afraid of someone to disagree with you, you are simply concerned with the actions they take based upon beliefs alone.</p>

<p>Be well friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>welcome...to the danger zone! i only have about 3 friends who talk about this stuff and take it seriously. i have a few more that listen to me and then call me a nut job. but, as i said in one of my recent posts, a lot of people with sharp anti-conspiracy theories are super ignorant once you start to pick apart their arguments. they literally just spew uneducated nonsense at you, and it takes a bit of weaseling, but for most people like that, once you pick them apart a bit, you see that they use their ignorance as a way of self empowerment. It&#39;s like arrogant business men: they talk loud, they get the girl, but they are in no way self-reflective enough to do good research on anything, they just spew and spew and spew with very little substance. that alone has helped me realize that i&#39;m not the absurd one. and this sub has helped too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What shocked me the most was when I was in college a couple years ago for business administration. I was doing an economic segment and learning about how the central bank creates money and gives it to private banks and that is how it is created. Currency created out of thin air.</p>

<p>When everybody was wrinkling their brains, I couldn&#39;t speak. My brain was wrinkled too. If money can be created out of thin air, then it can also be directed to people of interest. Obviously its much more complicated then that, but the fact remains that money is created by the government at their own damn whim.</p>

But yeah, much more complicated than any one conversation could do justice too. which is why the only way any of these people you talk to about it will understand is if they do their own research. it always comes back to money though. always. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I woke up about a year ago and went through a depression for about 2 months. Ever since then I have been learning as much as I can and (attempt) to inform people I know. It usually blows up in my face, but so far a lot of the stuff I have tried to tell them has come to light.</p>

<p>I always considered myself a &quot;conspiracy theorist,&quot; because I always knew 9/11 didn&#39;t feel right, but in reality I wasn&#39;t even scratching the surface of any of this. When I started reading about banks and everything, it was like all the missing puzzle pieces in what I already knew just locked into place. It was fascinating, but very scary at the same time.</p>

<p>I recently found this sub and have been reading a lot of it, although I haven&#39;t really posted as I don&#39;t know enough to actually contribute to the conversation aside from what has already been said, so I just end up reading all the comments and moving on. I am slowly learning though!</p>

I did so with a smile on my face, because he was willing to accept my knowledge for the first time ever. </p>

<p>I have learned a lot this past year, it is insane that literally every day I am learning something new. The rabbit hole goes so deep that I can&#39;t (and maybe will never) see the bottom. It is an endless descent down it, but I am happy to make the trip and to bring other people along with me on the way down.</p>

<p>Maybe not the best analogy, but it was the best I could think of, haha. Just realize you are <em>not</em> alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is definitely not necessary, as it does have negative effects for some people, such as anxiety and paranoia and more often then not, a lack of ambition, motivation or willpower.</p>

<p>I like to do it once every two weeks to a month to allow myself to think in a different manner then usual for a couple of hours. Things that didn&#39;t bother me (such as something I said to a girl) all of a sudden become quite dramatic and forces me to think introspectively about that situation.</p>

<p>But different strokes for different folks. It is being used in my province as a substitute or supplement to alcohol. A drug to get fucked up on and escape. And for that it has quite the bad rep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, that makes sense. While I do see the benefits, it is just not for me personally. If I ever needed one of those benefits though, it would be nice.</p>

<p>I feel like educating people is futile sometimes. So many times have I been called crazy, I have actually been disowned by family and friends over the past year. The rest of my family thinks I am crazy, and my grandma has even said she fears that I am going to be one of those people that ends up running into the woods and cutting off all communication from, everybody. It is depressing to have people not listen, or listen but not believe you. </p>

<p>But it is also relieving to realize there <em>are</em> people out there who you can have meaningful discussions about this with. I have a friend who always comes over to my house to hang out and play video games, and we spend hours just discussing current events. That is time I actually look forward to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend who I call the hippy guy. I worked on an organic farm with him last year for about 3 months, and our shared humour is what made us become great friends. I always bugged him about his eating habits, and how he chooses to eat naturally, and focus on what micronutrients he needs to eat, and actively avoid GMO products. Then he started talking about pyschedelics, and how he uses them to further his lifestyle and make him a better person.</p>

<p>At first I lauded him for being a basehead and hippy wearing footgloves, but after a while, we started discussing things and I realised that well, shit a lot of things make sense.</p>

<p>Take for instance DMT. dimethyltryptamine (I BELIEVE I COULD BE VERY WRONG) is a drug that is found everywhere in nature, but difficult to obtain, mainly because it can only be gathered at certain periods (human pineal glands when they are born/dying for instance). It is also highly illegal. After hearing his rant about DMT, I did a little research. Turns out that Joe Rogan is a huge fan of DMT and believes that everyone should try it at least once. He says that because it will open people&#39;s eyes to how vast the universe really is, and that there is little elves that try to explain everything to you as quickly as possible. Of course when you are off it, you lose all that revelation.</p>

<p>Intially I believed that was crazy and fucked, so I continue my research further. Anyone who has taken a sufficient amount of DMT in completely isolated situations has seen those people, have felt those same things, have had their eyes opened. </p>

<p>Is that why the government wants it to be a Schedule I drug? Is that why they want psychedelics to be banned? Because it allows us to think? I remember thinking that everything is connected, and my friends who did LSD told me that I should take it, because it will only confirm my suspicions. I am too scared, so I won&#39;t but still it makes me think.</p>

<p>EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED. The people in power do not want us to think, so take away everything that helps you think and fill it with garbage. Sensory overload so to speak so that you don&#39;t have the patience or capacity think beyond the garbage your brain is filled with.</p>

<p>I love talking to my friend, because this is what we talk about all the damn time.</p>

<p>I am really sorry for ranting, but I have never been able to talk about this before</p>

It was just as theatrical, it was unannounced, and of course there was the media, who couldn&#39;t stop saying &#39;terrorist&#39; and &#39;terror attack&#39;. Then you have the official narrative, just as full of holes as 9/11.

<p>Not a single answer given. Then people were crying out about how you shouldn&#39;t be asking those questions, look at the atrocity, you are being rude and insensitive. Fuck that. I saw the photos, I saw the footage, I saw what happened. I think its disgusting how people&#39;s lives and livelihoods were destroyed like that.

<p>Clearly we are expected to believe what we are told, and nothing else. They reinforce it with the same old tricks, essentially making up the public&#39;s mind for them. After this point, evidence matters not, and if anyone cries out for anything tangible, others point the finger and scream &#39;dissenter!&#39; Honestly, just realize that things are not as they are presented, and you the citizen are expected to fall in line and obey, never questioning and always accepting.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry, you just have to plant the seeds of &quot;doubt&quot; in peoples heads over their perceived realities. Ignore the scoffs you will get when you tell folk what is really going down, once the pieces become more obvious, i.e the recent NSA story, you can simply respond with a knowing nod and people, in my experience anyway, are less likely to dismiss you offhand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happened to me at the movies.</p>

<p>Watching the preview for the new vince vaugh/owen wilson google internship comedy movie made me think.</p>

<p>Now we have a ridiculously huge corporation endorsing the film industry so not only can it have excellent advertising, but be paid for it as well.</p>

<p>This will help them garner more employees, and also give them a comedic look at the internal world of Google.  </p>

<p>Then you have the other levels that deal mainly with social dynamics</p>
