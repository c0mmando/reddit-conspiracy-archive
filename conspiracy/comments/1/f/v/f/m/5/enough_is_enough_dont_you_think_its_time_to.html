       "American", we NEED do everything possible to repeal this act, and not accept anything less.

       During the last internet bill, I think CISPA? I got about 12 people to call all the local senators around here... They all voted in favor of it. I lost hope in it after that.

       Yea, pressures of money and whatnot will outweigh small numbers. If enough people always paid attentions and called and were angry and freaked out like we all should be then it would make a difference I believe. Just like I believe if 100% of people voted major change would happen...

       Hell motherfucking yeah! compared to voting anyway.  What the fuck does voting do but all of zero while the politicians do what they were planning on doing all along?

      <p>
       Demonstrating shows PHYSICAL NUMBERS.  How insane do you actually have to be to actually compare voting and actually physically demonstrating?  It seems apparent that you've like NEVER actually taken place in any physical activity or demonstration in your life, right?
      </p>

       Get up and demonstrate.  Get yourself going with actually DOING something toward your goal.  That will help a LOT more.

       A LOOOOOOT more than voting could have ever done.  A LOT more.  Does the fact that it got co-opted mean that it was a failure?  You want to try using that same logic toward your precious voting and say "Well, the candidate I voted for didn't get elected, so obviously I should never ever vote again."

       You know what would make me feel better?  It would make me feel better if I thought I were living in a country (or I actually WERE living in a country) where the people realized that they have been taken on a horrible, horrible ride.  It would make me feel better if people like you would realize that so long as you continue being a "dutiful cog" in the current machine of global oppression, you're doing nothing but ensuring your own downfall and manipulation, and the downfall and manipulation of your children.  It would make me feel better if you and the people like you realized that things are NOT going to get anywhere NEAR solved in a fucking ballot box, and all you're doing by going to one and thinking you're making any sort of difference is dissipating your wherewithal at the state's behest (while the state breathes a sigh of relief and laughs at the fact that the sheeple are still thinking that voting will make any difference instead of marching and demonstrating on the streets).  You vote, and you then go home and sit down and pat yourself on the back and tell yourself you made a difference and "did your part!" (Yes we can!) and then you continue on with your shitty manipulated life that you don't even know is manipulated to the extent that it is.

       I don't want to get beaten.  I don't want to participate in armed conflict.  I don't want to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also REALLY don't want to continue living in a country that is QUICKLY turning into a dictatorial regime before our very eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And against
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       , I will happily fight, get beaten, and even die trying to prevent.
