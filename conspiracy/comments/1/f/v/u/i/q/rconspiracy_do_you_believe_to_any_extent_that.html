<blockquote>
<p>“History shows that all of the worst things which a state can inflict upon individual human beings -<em>conscription, apartheid, expropriation, compulsory contraception, genocide</em> are characteristically marked by some collective abstraction like the <em>State, society, nation, race, proletariat, community or space-ship Earth</em> whose interests are said to override those of
the individual, and so justify the coercive and repressive actions of the State”</p>

<p>In authoritarian systems “individuals ...become of value and significance ... only insofar as each [is] committed towards objectives stipulated by a central authority [and to] lose himself in a cause higher than himself.”   -from Nigel Meek&#39;s <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/polin/polin144.pdf">Society Does Not Exist (And if it did, it shouldn&#39;t)</a></p>

<p>Any thwarting of &quot;danger&quot; that relies on the use of a rabidly violent animal posing[1] as a guard dog is a non-starter.</p>

<p>Ok, so you are saying when the government says security they are not intending the same definition I am using correct? I still do not understand, when they refer to things like body scanners at airports as extra <em>security</em> measures (as an example) that <em>is</em> what I consider security to mean, where is the disconnect with that?</p>

<p>I really do not have time for such a long video..can you summarize please?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I started watching this second video, looks interesting.... I will report back when I finish it. Of course we can work together to protect ourselves from danger, on small scales. If government disappeared today, could we protect ourselves in this world? Would our country, states, or cities work the same? How would you suggest they operate and face the threats and responsibilities required for our population to thrive without organizing in anything that would resemble a government or an organized group of decision makers/division of responsibilities.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Good question. There are certainly things we trust our government with they do not follow through with. Things they promise they won&#39;t do they will, and vice versa. They are also human, some are bound to act as human nature sometimes causes us to. Our government will sometimes, for differing reasons, make decisions - without our permission - they feel are necessary. We must discuss those issues openly.</p>

<p>Look at it this way, consider all the well intentioned legislation or federal programs that over time or upon execution becomes something completely unintended by the originators. Power creep, mission creep, lack of oversight, etc. can contribute but often times it simply the vague language used in such legislation. (Think Patriot Act)</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t apply to everything, but is a fair point.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Also fair, the legislation is often not written in a way that prevents oversteps (sometimes by lack of foresight, sometimes purposely you could argue and I would agree), but these things are intended to be beneficial to us, the citizens. We could certainly argue about whether or not that is the case, but honestly neither of us really know. I believe that <strong>our</strong> government, as an entity has good intentions. I of course know without a doubt that there are politicians that abuse this power. It is an interesting point though and I do think about that often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I realize that a lot here at r/conspiracy don&#39;t believe terrorist acts are real and that they are staged by the government. Can we assume they are real for the sake of discussion?</p>

<p>In that case, you&#39;re saying that you would support giving up these freedoms of privacy in order to better insure your and others safety, correct?</p>

<p>I for one say do whatever the hell you gotta do when it comes to the airport. The LAST thing I want is to be 10&#39;s of thousands of feet above the ground in a hollow missile with a guy who has explosives in his backpack/pants/shoes whatever. If making sure that doesn&#39;t happen means throwin&#39; me in a body scanner, I welcome it. On this topic I have seen a bit more anger at TSA agents doing this to small children. It seems unnecessary, and probably is, but the way I look at it you just have to be consistent across the board. Terrorists don&#39;t care, and if they realized small children weren&#39;t being given the same treatment, they&#39;d use them without hesitation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people I know who had illogically strict parents have a slight need to rebel against legitimate authority and see rebellion as a power trip. They felt out of control and thus desire control themselves to alleviate this <em>feeling</em>, when in reality it would be much better for everyone if they were simply given more breathing room. Then the chain is broken and they don&#39;t illogically control someone else in a parasitic relationship. Instead, often they can not control those who control them, so they perpetuate the thing they hate. Or they are somehow freed but there is no adequate mental closure (the parent is no longer in control but there is no recourse) and so even though they are now free they have the psychological scar and illogically must gain control of others as a surrogate for a previous lack of control of themselves.</p>

<p>At least in my case, I was not often unusually punished as a child and therefore had no reason to make my parents angry out of spite. This lead to a symbiotic relationship which benefitted us both. I had the freedom to make my own small mistakes and my parents didn&#39;t have do deal with me.</p>

<p>When you dislike something and emulate the opposite like in an internal psychological revenge against an external source, you unnecessarily contain yourself in a dichotomy which perhaps doesn&#39;t even need to exist, with infinite options instead. This is the basis of the Hegelian Dialectic. They give you a terrible option and then sneak in a less worse one that is still bad. You hate the vacuous pop music that is blasted into your ears so you like the punk scene out of spite when in reality both could be rubbish (just a hypothetical). The person left to his own devices can discover that he like classical music, and another, traditional native music. No one is being forced or &quot;anti-forced&quot; through reverse psychology/flawed-social-structure.</p>

<p>As you experience life, most importantly as a child, you either see that people can accomplish more when they work together, or you can perceive that there is a lot of evil. If you see that people can work together for their own benefit, you are able to ignore the evil and instead focus on your own personal gain through the <em>help</em> of others, accepting evil as an unfortunate circumstance. If you see the world as inherently evil, you cross a rubicon in which you are justified in yourself to commit evil acts because in your mind there is always someone worse than you, or you made one bad decision so what harm could another do, etc. and so you seek personal gain through the <em>exploitation</em> of others.</p>

<p>Now, you may say that there is still evil if you ignore it, but as this is a human problem it must be dealt with at the individual level. If people are more free, they can identify the controlling people in their lives as anomalies and not as the norm and thus avoid the psychological fallacies associated with performing evil acts already within a social structure in which evil unfortunately exists. Then they can direct their problems directly to their oppressor and not to society in general. It really is merely a threshold which affects the majority, and a small move towards good or evil magnifies within feedback loops generated by complex everyday circumstances.</p>

<p>One who believes in Liberty should not feel threatened when someone is given adequate chance to make an informed decision because he/she should know it to be a truth, and therefore the logical conclusion. This is opposed to someone who is forced into authoritarianism through child indoctrination or is him/herself oppressed and falls into the psychological fallacies discussed earlier. Obviously you can&#39;t be forced into actual freedom by definition. Thusly, having the freedom to decide whether to have liberty or authoritarian control should logically produce a majority of people who are able to observe humans working together peacefully to achieve a goal not possible without collaboration through mutually beneficial transactions.</p>

<p>So finally, getting back to your original question, I would not sacrifice freedom for security because spying and controlling people won&#39;t prevent much as people are smart enough to evade detection, but it will drive more people towards controlling behavior, creating more insecurity. The best case scenario is for a certain threshold of people to be kind and non-controlling, so that people who haven&#39;t solidified their moral compass are able to observe the benefits directly.</p>

It is natural for us to want to look towards a leader (this can also be seen in religion) or a hand to guide us. Technically we do not have a singular leader though. If you are referring to government I think it is absolutely necessary. I understand the feelings of resentment for things which they do wrong or things which some believe they did wrong/covered up, but it provides us with the structure that makes up our Country and many others (that is a gross understatement of what a government provides). Are you arguing for each state to run itself entirely separately, or a notch down from that, no authority figures at all?</p>

<p>Garble here, I&#39;ll agree with you that history is often written by the victors, but I don&#39;t know what that has to do with anything I said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you really have no bearing on reality if you think religion or government is leadership instead of control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, religion and government are two different things, it is not fair for the sake of a clear discussion to lump them as one thing. I&#39;ll address both though. I&#39;m an atheist, so, I don&#39;t have much good to say about religion. Some of those whom are religious seek to control others, others have genuine intentions. Whether or not religion itself is meant for control is a sticky topic I&#39;m really not arguing here - I don&#39;t know, but in some senses yes.</p>

<p>Government is both leadership and control, of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, just want to say this is a great question.</p>

<p>I do not believe freedoms should be lost to prevent terrorism.</p>

<p>We seemed pretty fine in that dept pre 9/11, and I don&#39;t believe we have had more attacks pre 9/11 compared to after.</p>

<p>I do not believe the lost freedoms so far have made a dent of any sort against terrorism.</p>

<p>So no, I do not think we need to lose freedoms to secure the nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I would say, we absolutely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_terrorism">have</a> had terrorism pre 9/11 (I do not expect you to read that, just throwing it up there for a thorough reference to events) it has simply changed it&#39;s form. How old are you? I am 22, so born in 1990. When I think of the word terrorism the first thing that comes to mind is someone from the Middle East blowing himself up on a plane or a public place. However, this is simply because it&#39;s what I&#39;ve experienced in my lifetime. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s wrong to say that the freedoms we have sacrificed have not made an impact. I can find some specific stories if you&#39;d like, but I would say &quot;why not have these things in place?&quot; Full body scans at the airport for example - even if NOBODY had been caught by these things as of yet, does that mean we should get rid of them? Specifically, it really doesn&#39;t bother me to go through it, it&#39;s whatever not going to ruin my day. If you disagree with this kind of practice, is it because you feel violated or what exactly do you disagree with about it? The same can be said for phone monitoring. I really don&#39;t give a shit if someone in Washington overhears 10 seconds of my conversation with my buddy about how drunk I got at the party last night, if it means there is potential they will stumble upon a terrorist plot to kill Americans later on. This is all just hypothetical of course, but I say it to make my point clear about why I am ok with it. I ask this question of course however to find why others are NOT ok with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no I don&#39;t think we had no terrorism before 9/11. I def know we have, what I said is that I do not think there has been a decrease since we gave up certain liberties/freedoms as a result of losing those.</p>

<p>Look at the NSA wiretapping thing that just broke, it does not seem like it has been effective at all. That or they have just not told us about the terrorists it has stopped.</p>

<p>I do somewhat agree with searches before flying, but that is kind of a grey area. Do you know if the TSA is getting rid of the body scanners? I thought I heard they were doing away with those. </p>

<p>Stuff like the patriot act though are more what I was referring to though, I do not believe it has really made that large a dent in terrorism, and if it has, it is doing a pretty shitty job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really OK with it personally. Security theatre to protect people from a perceived threat is money wasted that could be going to infrastructure, which clearly needs it way worse. At the very least it provides jobs in the form of the TSA, but the fact that this entire apparatus even exists is an embarrassment to this country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t know much about the current infrastructure situation in the states, so I can&#39;t speak to that - but I would say that the precautions are worth the money (which is relatively a very small amount). Why - simply because it prevents (or is much more likely to prevent) a certain type of threat, which is security while traveling on airlines. For me, I am all for anything that can put my mind further at ease while in the air. I do not mind being scanned, not a big deal for me in order for that trade off. Completely understand where you&#39;re coming from, but can I ask what you mean by embarrassment? As in embarrassing we have to take such measures to stop terrorists? In a sense, I can agree with that, but hey, terrorism is cancerous. Difficult to trace, catch, or predict. As of right now we rely on trying to catch these things with these methods.</p>

<p>All of the recent hype about bridges collapsing, et.al. aside, the U.S. could really use some help in its infrastructure in general. Things need fixing and upgrading, form roads to education. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re serious here. Don&#39;t mind being scanned? What has all of this madness gotten the traveler, besides aggravation, ever-changing rules, and capture of zero &quot;terrorists&quot;?  Scanning, taking off your shoes, all of this other regimented nonsense..it&#39;s an illusion of a problem in a war on an idea; terrorism is an idea. How do you wage a war on that? Hearts and minds, only in this case, it&#39;s to different ends. If we think it&#39;s for our protection, we willingly do it. </p>

<p>It just seems a lot of rustle about nothing to me. Aggravation, ever-changing rules? Meh, it&#39;s an airport man, you&#39;re getting on an inescapable flight machine thousands of feet in the air. You would have to expect at one point or another precautions would and <em>should</em> be put in place to make sure we don&#39;t allow things that shouldn&#39;t be on the plane or persons that shouldn&#39;t. I have read they are pulling these in many areas, and I understand where you&#39;re coming from, but I&#39;m just not bothered by it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point there. Although it may come across as more agitation than it is, I just think it&#39;s silly that any of it is in place. Sure, we need to take precautions, but post 9/11 precaution has turned into outright paranoia. It sucks because I used to like to travel, but not so much anymore. And if I do, it&#39;s light.. no check-ins and only the bare essentials.  </p>
