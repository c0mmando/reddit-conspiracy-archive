    <div class="md"><p>I can definitely see your points. At this point, the leak just doesn&#39;t seem riot worthy -- to me -- maybe it&#39;s because I wasn&#39;t surprised by it. Sadly, I&#39;m sure more is coming, and this is just another piece of straw.</p>

<p>Edit:
To be clear. This news certainly upsets me, I just don&#39;t view the average persons reaction to this to be one of violence, or even physical protest E.g. marching in the streets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sad but true. I don&#39;t know what would actually get people fired up. </p>

<ul>
<li>Gun probation seems to ignite a little bit of passion.</li>
<li>Tracking a persons location, i.e. cellular metadata.</li>
<li>Reading people private communications.</li>
</ul>

<p>After more thought, maybe you&#39;re right. Maybe this will be the piece of straw the breaks the camels back. I can&#39;t think of anything, short of false imprisonment, that is more egregious, then invading the most intimate of conversations with friends and family i.e. Facebook.</p>

I believe it&#39;s all part of this act - &quot;externalization of the hierarchy&quot; or in simpler terms - &quot;revealing themselves&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>The claims made in the &quot;leak&quot; about prism are not plausible.  I mean I&#39;m sure the NSA <strong>does</strong> spy on us, including probably having sniffers on the major internet backbones.  But the crap about them having &quot;direct access to the servers&quot; is BS, and in fact really wouldn&#39;t buy them anything since getting at the data you want is so complicated.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking this &quot;leak&quot; is a distraction to keep something bigger from getting reported/noticed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems plausible. Even to cast a shadow over the Verizon spying. </p>

<ol>
<li>Verizon Spying leaked (unintentionally)</li>
<li>Leak false PowerPoint slides of GMail, Skype, Facebook, etc. spying (Prism)</li>
<li>Public outrage over Prism engulfs outrage over Verizon</li>
<li>Prove that Prism is false</li>
<li>Public is relieved. Thinks that Verizon scandal is nothing to be upset about relative to Prism</li>
<li>Rinse and Repeat</li>

<p>Interesting, I&#39;ve noticed that too. I guess I assumed that it was the inevitable result of uncensored communication, i.e. the internet. </p>

<p>Why do you think that revealing themselves would be beneficial? Recruitment?</p>

<p>Do you think that these technologies are inherently flawed? Or do you anticipate them becoming illegal?</p>
