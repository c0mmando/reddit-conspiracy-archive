       I'm sure most of us remember the ludicrous amount of specialty ammunition and vehicles recently purchased by the DHS. I'm sure most of us remember and recognize the continual militarization of the police. We recall them trying to have the guns of the citizens taken. We know the CIA director was continently sworn in without the Bill of Rights, which is missing Freedom of Speech and of the press, no right to bear arms, no right to bear arms, no protection from "unreasonable searches or seizures", and no right to a jury trail. Mentally, we should note that the government doesn't believe we have those rights anymore. Soon, we won't have rights at all. They can be destroyed as easily as they were made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, the NSA story isn't being buried; it's being pushed. This is the straw that breaks the common American citizens back. While it may not necessarily be able to "wake them up", the average person with none of "our knowledge" can now see a clear and present distrust of the government. The crazy conspiracy kooks were right, it's not speculation anymore, it's a fact; Big Brother is here, he's watching, and he knows your name. He knows everything about you.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, either this "leak" was inevitable or it was planned. The government has been planning for mass civil unrest and violence and this will be the catalyst. Additionally, I presume we'll see some kind of convenient event in the coming weeks foiling a "terrorist attack" that will be their poster boy and reason to keep PRISM alive... Seeing as they can't point to PRISM stoping Sandy Hook, The Batman Massacre, Boston Bombings, Dorner ect (This actually feels like the plot of Minority Report now).
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know, PRISM is what we're allowed to know about and there's something far more secretive, dangerous, and terrifying that we've never heard of or never will.
      </p>
      <p>
       And depending on what side of the conspiracy coin you adhere to, the present time we are living in was predicted in a letter by the 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Freemason, Albert Pike. In his letter to an Italian general where he wrote out his plans for World War 1 and 2, and the road to WWIII. The letter has been called a fake to discredit it but, no one will know for sure. However given its startling accuracy, I believe it is indeed real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless - Civil Unrest and Martial Law are coming very soon. The government has been planning for it and we should be too. The iron is hot now that the NSA story is public, and now a lot more people are aware even if not awake. Now the idea of "the police are being militarized against you, not for protecting you from terrorists" seems way less far fetched. Now is the time to be waking up more people, unplugging people from today's Matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot be fooled either and must pay strict attention to as many (credible) details as we can in this matter. If the Government gets uprooted, if Obama is impeached and his administration destroyed, if the people we believe are the cause of all the terrible things are exposed and jailed, we still need to be very careful thinking that the threat is gone. A new mascot for the government won't change things, the underlying problem must be solved. Who controls the government(s)?

       I think if we really are going to get all riled up about the NSA and the government in general, the clearest most conscise thing we can demand is transparency.  If there is a revolution, it should be centered around this ideal.  If the public is not allowed to keep secrets, why should the government be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand clear and total transparency of all government functions.  No more 'state secrecy'  lay everything bare.

       As a person who grew up well before there
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       Homeland Security -or even terrorism (as anything but a freak anomaly, like the Weathermen) - I find the recent violations of our freedoms and rights appalling.  I wake up every day now, feeling like I've been transplanted to some foreign dictatorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statistically, you are four times more likely to be killed by lightning than by a terrorist.  Logically, Homeland Security should get less funding than the lightning rod industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my historical point of view, Homeland Security, the TSA, and all the other "security" agencies created since 1970 could all be eliminated tomorrow without compromising America's safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt much safer before the government started looking out for my safety.

       I've seen it other places too.  I believe it's for the period post-9/11.  Which is the period when all the terrorist fears blossomed.  It only counts fatalities, as lightning tends to always be fatal.

       More people kill themselves in America than die in car accidents. We should try to prevent these deaths by increasing people's standard of living instead of decreasing it, so they will be less likely to feel the need to kill themselves.

       Except you won't have a revolution. A revolution takes a willing middle class to fund it, and honestly, there isn't enough people suffering to warrant their will. Our people are weak willed and slumbering in small conveniences. I'm not sure if this alarm is loud enough to wake them.

       Its true, but I feel like we are fast approaching a critical mass.  I know this has been said for a long time, but look at the proliferation of the information.  The NSA and the Bilderbergs in the news. The information is spreading and people are becoming aware that it is all very real.

       You're right. I wasn't calling for a revolution here, but I was pointing out that it wouldn't happen. People are comfortable, even if there are small inconveniences, we're still comfortable right now. I'm pretty sure this is just going to my kids' or grandkids' problem.

       gonna be hard to have a revolution w/only 1% of people that are awake...the rest of the sheeple just keep drinking out of the koolaid well...its our younger generation that will have a bigger impact imo, so educating them is paramount... even now, I see more kids/teens knowing whats going on than anyone in my generation...I/we were so clueless

       And I personally suggest we demand these things not by using our finger to punch a button in a ballot box already rigged to elect the next corrupt politician, but by placing it squarely in front of a trigger ready to be pulled over and over again if this demand isn't met.

       Well essentially I was saying that shooting them until you find a compliant person is Stalinesque.  Now that said, there does need to be some consequence for politicians not listening to the demands and needs of the public.

       I see.  That is then most definitely NOT what I was advocating in what I said initially.  I admit that I was a bit short in my initial response, but what what I mean is that the system has absolutely been rigged to keep the elite in power, and the plebs constantly NOT in power and without much of a voice.  I advocate action and demonstration, marching and going out and physically doing
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       by way of expressing the people's disgruntlement with TPTB.  I advocate doing this peacefully above doing it aggressively.  However, I also advocate fighting back and not just simply taking a beating if your friends and family are being killed around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that this far from "shooting them until you find a compliant person."

       Well, that's putting it lightly.  "Concern" isn't going to get things done.
       <em>
        Action
       </em>
       is.  If the demands of the public are legitimate concerning housing, shelter, welfare, education, medical aid, etc, and you don't listen to those demands, then the public absolutely NEEDS to rise up and
       <em>
        make
       </em>
       you listen - whether that be by peaceful non-compliance in the system and peacefully demonstrating, or by taking up arms if need be and fighting to protect your rights and livelihood and the rights and livelihood of those around you.

       There is actually at least a few studies on this technique.  It sells more beer.  I think that it is terribly unethical.  Its pretty much some nasty Karl Marx defined alienation.  Work all day in your cubby hole with a boss lording over you and then you go out to socialize the asshole bar owner has the music turned up so loud specifically so that you won't waste valuable beer drinking time communicating, sharing, hell maybe even crying with other people.

       There are numerous bars and clubs where they play the music so loud that literally nobody can talk because people will drink more beer.  Then only men with a visceral technique are able to pick up women in such a setting.

       The fact that we have had so much disruption on this planet up to this point seems to speak otherwise.  I think that while a good portion of us ARE sufficiently evolved to make things work well w/o a government, there is a significant and unfortunately powerful and manipulative minority that feel otherwise and are doing everything they can to make sure that the people remain subservient to a governmental, overarching control system.

       That would, of course, be awesome - seriously.  However, those who for whatever twisted reason are bent toward stealing or marauding and hurting others must be guarded and protected against, and it would seem some sort of coordinated group or organization of sorts might be beneficial in these circumstances.

       Easier said than done, but DON'T let something like that take your mind off of the truth.  If something like that happens and, say, your family gets killed in the blast, and the government blames "such and such" people, we should still not absolutely jump on the bandwagon of whatever they say even if we ARE still crushed by the death of our family.  That should, in fact, be all the more reason to REALLY investigate just who is responsible (and who benefits) for the purpose of making the REAL criminals pay - not just the ones the government tells us are at fault.  This is all the more reason to research and understand the reality of

        We know the CIA director was continently sworn in without the Bill of Rights, which is missing Freedom of Speech and of the press, no right to bear arms, no right to bear arms, no protection from "unreasonable searches or seizures", and no right to a jury trail.

       Huh!?  What are you even talking about?  Sworn in without the Bill of Rights?  Who the fuck cares?  You think the President being sworn in on a Bible means he follows all the precepts of the Bible?  It means fuck all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Director of the CIA is beholden to U.S. law, just like everybody else.  His actual job is to run the network that conducts criminal activities in other countries, again, as per U.S. law.  There are plenty of laws giving the CIA an enormous amount of power to act as it sees fit - and not a hell of a lot of oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
       But your suggestion that his swearing in ceremony has some impact on these activities is PATENTLY ABSURD.

       Swearing an oath may be magical thinking to some people but it stands for something of merit in the minds of those of us who believe it's fundamental to a mans merit and should be held to the highest standard of application. The concept that your word is your bond, still holds true to some people who aren't so misanthropic and cynical to totally disregard a promise. Whether the promise is kept is fucking important and no matter whether we're talking about a man to his family, a CEO to a corporation or a head of a governmental agency to a citizenry. Just because oaths and promises are broken on all levels everyday in all social situations doesn't make me any less adamant about my stance that they are paramount to being civilized and ethical.

       Does your mathematics include the variable worth of the documents sworn upon?  Do you give 10 points for the Bible, 20 points for swearing on my mother's grave, and 5 points for a Constitution without the Bill of Rights attached?
      </p>
      <p>
       You entirely missed my point with your soaring rhetoric.  If a person's word is worth something - it doesn't matter if they swear on a stack of Bibles or the corpse of my dead grandmother - it's worth the same.  And it's only worth the deeds of that person after they make said promise - regardless of the beautiful and somewhat fantastical sentiment you express so eloquently.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, for the OP to raise this issue of the document the CIA Director swore his oath on not containing the Bill of Rights
       <strong>
        and this somehow allows the Director to ignore the Bill of Rights in his own mind or in his work
       </strong>
       is, to be blunt, fucking stupid.

       I like your snarkiness dear Sonmi, it's quick witted and has some modicum of substance to it. So what do you think Elizabeth Warren would say about her oath? Maybe she has special constitution toilet paper printed out just for basic bathroom breaks and Bill of rights toilet paper for 'Taco Friday's'.

       Your snarky humor only goes one way? You can't identify a ribbing....too bad since you can surely dish it out. Lighten up a bit. Some of us actually read and do research into the subjects we comment on and read others comments and try to be informed as to who we choose to comment too. About your note: my suggestion about her was the opposite of how you took  it....this is a good example of where /s would apply. But as for her not taking her oath seriously and it wouldn't matter to her what she swore on whether it was the bible or foreclosed mortgages...doubtful very doubtful.

       That's not how any responsible, formal, adult relationship starts. Hey, let's fly by the seat of our pants and not make any foundational verbal agreements with any detail so in the future we can just say fuck it....I reserve the right since never promised anything. In Government that maybe a formality and in personal relationships it's uncommon and rare to speak your truth right away and make promises but it doesn't make it any less important to start a relationship of any sort, just like that...with a promise. Laying it on the line let's the other party know when you're off course and need to be checked. No promise than no boundaries. What your saying maybe be partly true in a sense and I get your point but the formality and it's importance in my mind still holds a good honest foundation. Ninja edit

       Drink some more wine, brother.  No one is disputing your writing skills or your lofty sentiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the ritual of an oath is a mere reflection of the oath itself.  And to question an oath on the technicalities of its ritual is to undermine the entire idea of what makes an oath worthwhile - the person behind it and their character.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the same with Obama being sworn in twice - it was only done because petty people are looking for an excuse to destroy him - not because John Roberts said, "Once more, this time with some feeling."
      </p>
      <p>
       My frustration is in direct proportion to the enormously glaring problems within our government and the population's distraction by superfluous detail.

       I don't drink and I'm not a brother my dear, I'm a female. My sentiments about oaths are not lofty and my writing is to be desired but my point about Elizabeth Warren was to have you come out with your full opinion which you did. That it maybe a ritual to some degree but when it's done with integrity, as my example, Elizabeth Warren, it does actually mean something....as it is by design.

       I don't think this is the catalyst you're thinking of. I think as soon as it
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       (whether it be physically or even hardly altering normal life) then that might make the luke-warm people really wake up, the people sleeping to start to cause a stir, and the revolutionairies to spark the first torch

       I think they want to keep things under control (i.e. not violent) for a while longer.  Right now the noose is still pretty loose.  We still have guns, we still have some freedoms.  I think they want to get us to the point that we have no way of rebelling successfully, then they'll leak something that incites violence when they know they'll win.  That way, they can enact full blown marshall law/tyranny without the possibility of losing everything.  If I was evil and was planning something, that's how I'd do it.

       you still seem to care.  as we have been talking all day.  you are now the single longest conversation i have had with any one redditor. all the while proving my point that nothing will be done by anyone.  i hope others will see the exchange and realize the truth in my words.

       Or the fact elite Zionists initiated WW I and Bolshevik Revolution which lead to WW II and made the world safe for Zionist controlled central banks and the establishment of the criminal state of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here was the situation. By 1916, the Germans, Austrians, and Ottoman Turks had seemingly won the war. Russia was in turmoil and about to be swallowed up by communist revolution. France had suffered horrible losses, and Britain was under a German U-boat blockade. Germany made an offer to Britain to end the war under conditions favorable to Britain. But the British, and the international Zionists, had one more card to play!
      </p>
      <p>
       The British government and the Zionist leaders struck a dirty deal. The Zionists were led by Chaim Weizmann, the man who one day become the first President of the State of Israel. The idea was for the Zionists to use their influence to drag the mighty USA into the war on Britain's side, so that Germany and it's Ottoman allies could be crushed. In exchange for helping to bring the USA into the war, the British would reward the Zionists by taking over Palestine from the conquered Ottomans after the war was over. The British had originally wanted to give the Zionists a jewish homeland in an African territory. But the Zionists were fixated on claiming Palestine as their land. Once under British control, the jews of Europe would be allowed to immigrate to Palestine in great numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionists powerbrokers such as Bernard Baruch (father of the MIC), Louis Brandeis, Paul Warburg (father of the US Federal Reserve), Jacob Schiff (father of the Bolshevik Revolution), and others immediately went to work to put the screws to President Woodrow Wilson. Overnight the Zionist influenced press transformed the German Kaiser and his people into bloodthirsty “Huns”, determined to destroy western civilization. In 1916, the US, with the help of the previous year’s Lusitania “incident”, entered the war on Britain's side under the
       <strong>
        ridiculous pretext of “making the world safe for democracy”.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Beat Back the Hun!” declared Fred Strothman’s famous propaganda poster, - a slogan which became a rallying cry of “patriotic” Americans. Woodrow Wilson was caught up in a sinister force beyond his control.

       Homeland Security -or even terrorism (as anything but a freak anomaly, like the Weathermen) - I find the recent violations of our freedoms and rights appalling.  I wake up every day now, feeling like I've been transplanted to some foreign dictatorship.

       Statistically, you are four times more likely to be killed by lightning than by a terrorist.  Logically, Homeland Security should get less funding than the lightning rod industry.

       From my historical point of view, Homeland Security, the TSA, and all the other "security" agencies created since 1970 could all be eliminated tomorrow without compromising America's safety.

       But the ritual of an oath is a mere reflection of the oath itself.  And to question an oath on the technicalities of its ritual is to undermine the entire idea of what makes an oath worthwhile - the person behind it and their character.

       It was the same with Obama being sworn in twice - it was only done because petty people are looking for an excuse to destroy him - not because John Roberts said, "Once more, this time with some feeling."

       My frustration is in direct proportion to the enormously glaring problems within our government and the population's distraction by superfluous detail.
