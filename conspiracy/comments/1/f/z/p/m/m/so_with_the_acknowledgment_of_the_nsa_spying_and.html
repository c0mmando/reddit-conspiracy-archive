<p>According to its website, NSA is not allowed to spy on Americans. It is supposed to use its formidable technology to &quot;gather information that America&#39;s adversaries wish to keep secret&quot; and to &quot;protect America&#39;s vital national security information and systems from theft or damage by others,&quot; as well as enabling &quot;network warfare, a military operation,&quot; that includes offensive cyberoperations against U.S. adversaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No i dont think anything substantial will happen from the backlash. At the most we will be seeing a lot of obama vilification even though i doubt he has the authority to stop any of it. And i highly doubt he authorized any of it...he is the pupet leader anything he says to defend this crap is just to make it seem like the president is in charge..and our government isnt run by the fucking military industrial complex. </p>

A lot of people who were on the fence before are getting the push they need to start asking questions.

    <div class="md"><p>The revolutionary act of speaking the truth. Once people quit lying down and accepting their fate and realize that life sucks for everyone because the global banks want it this way and that what is happening to us is being done by design, it won&#39;t take much to remove these people from power. We still have the means to do it, all it takes is educating people about the fact that Republicans and Democrats both work for banks and corporations not the American people. </p>

<p>Those with independence will expatriate and emigrate.  Once my family ties (parents) are gone, so am I.  Northern Europe awaits my coming with cries of welcome.  Germany probably won&#39;t work so I&#39;ll have to learn Finnish or Dutch.</p>
