        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m self employed and take cash only, no checks.  I also do barter and bitcoin online.  I know it&#39;s not much, but I had to do something.  I cut up my credit cards and use cash for payments.  If a business won&#39;t take cash, I go somewhere else.  I&#39;m not in a big hurry.</p>

<p>What do you do to keep your head sane within all the insanity these days?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Well this has turned into a kind of an AMA, which was not intended, I assure you!  I don&#39;t mind answering questions about my reasons and what not.  Here&#39;s a kind of summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I pay for most bills with cash.  If I need a credit card, I pay cash for a pre-paid card.  Yes, some companies don&#39;t accept cash for payment. AT&amp;T is one example.</p></li>
<li><p>My wife and I have a small garden.  We grow a few vegetables during the spring, summer and eat most of what we grow.  Otherwise, we buy from local farms and farmers.  We don&#39;t eat much meat (don&#39;t really have a taste for it anyway), and since my wife is Korean, we eat mostly veggies and fish.  </p></li>
<li><p>We don&#39;t buy things like pre-packaged foods, ice cream, chips, snacks, candy, etc. I&#39;m a diabetic, so I don&#39;t eat anything with wheat, white rice, white potatoes anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>It took a long time to be able to do this.  We saved everything we made and paid off stuff so we have no debt.  I don&#39;t recommend it for someone just starting out.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m a musician and a music teacher.  I make about $15,000 a year.  I do take barter in exchange for lessons and services, but not many people know how to do barter, or don&#39;t think they have something of value to barter.  I think if more people bartered, it would be easier to get by with less.</p></li>
<li><p>I do have bills: insurance, taxes, food, utilities, etc.  I pay all of them with cash or prepaid credit cards.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll write more later.  Gotta go teach a lesson!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome!  Do you play a musical instrument?  There&#39;s nothing like it.  It costs no money (other than purchasing the instrument and buying strings or reeds or accessories), but the act of playing music triggers a dopamine release in your brain that makes you feel &quot;happy&quot;.  Its better than alcohol or drugs because it&#39;s all natural, you make it, and it lasts as long as you play or listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  In fact, I get extra services from some local businesses because I pay in cash.  When they see me coming their eyes light up.

    <div class="md"><p>True, although some newer businesses as so &quot;hip&quot; they rarely see anyone pay in cash. The people there look at you like you use two heads if you use cash. Imagine if you asked to pay in gold as legal tender... or Bitcoins... haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, too, invested in bitcoins. I started a (small) online business selling home made canned goods and I only accept BTC. </p>

<p>My Husband and I also converted Our truck to run on veggie oil. This helps decrease our dependence on diesel/big business. Its an adventure going to restaurants to pick up their old veggie oil for free. We have to filter it and the process takes a bit of time, but we are in no big hurry either. Plus the truck smells like french fries!</p>

<p>What else? We built a bad ass urban garden and have been producing a lot of good, organic yummy food. &quot;Gardening is the most defiant and therapeutic act you can do. Plus you get strawberries&quot;. :)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what the point is really.  I guess the austerity was a lesson in learning how much &quot;stuff&quot; I really needed and what I could do without.  Turns out I don&#39;t need much at all.</p>

<p>My expenses are thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>mortgage</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I moved to Mexico nearly 2 years ago. This was actually the biggest change I made. No credit or debit cards. Nice restaurants or places that charge large amounts for services accept them but nowhere else. </p>

<p>I think it is amazing. I love it. The shitty thing is when you show up with too little cash. You either put items back and have to drive home and get more money or you just get the items you wanted next time. But luckily for us when those times have happened, in the smaller stores, they just credit us and trust us to bring in the balance the next day. This actually happened yesterday, and I love it.</p>

<p>Another thing. I have not had a cellphone for 2 years. I panicked a little for the first few days. I could not contact my girl when she was away. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want one though. Bad things happen but that is life. I don&#39;t need to hear about it immediately. We lived a long time without them. </p>

<p>Letting go of always needing to have every piece of information instantly was a big thing for me. I love it. I hope nothing bad happens, and minor things have happened, where a cellphone would have been crucial. But we managed. And we had amazing stories to tell because of it. If we had cellphones I would have just drove and picked her up or vice versa and we would have no memories.</p>

<p>I constantly hear people berate Mexico, and I know I am not deep in the heart of it, but I have never had a bad experience, in 2 years. And we partied like animals many weekends. </p>

<p>We are just 20-something kids, living here. Besides people being thrown in jail for drinking in public, and seeing friends fight each other, I never witnessed a crime. And was never worried about my safety.</p>

<p>Mexico, at least this part, gets a very bad reputation. I walk the streets with friends or alone in Tijuana or Rosarito every night, never once a single issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DUDE! I <em>live</em> in Tijuana! And I know your feeling.<br/>
I cross to the US every weekend to buy groceries (mostly meat or stuff from Whole Foods. I know veggies and fruits here are so far non GMO and still cropped in a traditional manner in most parts) and there is this odd sense of dread I get at night even when I&#39;m in the busiest part of Downtown.<br/>
It&#39;s like they are going to kidnap me or do something to me. I don&#39;t know why.<br/>
Yet, I can be all alone in Downtown Tijuana and I know people will be helpful if anything were to happen. Heck, nobody cares about what I do alone and stuff. It&#39;s all cool.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s just has been used as a news cow for bad news and pointing on how bad we are and how better over there it is when I am just awed at how many people sleep in the streets in Downtown SD in the middle of a busy street. It&#39;s just. . odd.<br/>
There&#39;s much more openness in Mexico and less paranoia, and you can feel it - despite the fact that we are &#39;violent and prompt to kidnap your first child and sell you drugs&#39;.  </p>

<p>I just wish we weren&#39;t used as a bad example, keeping in mind most of the situation here is partially caused by the US.<br/>
People going to the US illegally to get jobs or anything? Well, if there was a steady flow already, NAFTA made it worse. We cannot compete with the US in many ways and left growers and farmers without jobs. Ironically, manufacturing companies would settle in the north to receive those who couldn&#39;t cross over and are still looking for a job. Do remember these manufacturing jobs are the ones &#39;we stole&#39;.<br/>
Cartel and Narco problems? Welp, the War on Drugs. You know it&#39;s results. Nasty thing that was fueled since 2006 and has so far killed 100k people, without counting those who had to leave and are still gone. Let&#39;s not forget the ties the Cartels have with the government. . and the media.<br/>
The Government and the Media - These are the true masters of Mexico, particularly the Media. I was shocked and enraged when Obama congratulated our current president (so on forth called &quot;That idiot&quot;) and the electoral process for being the <em>cleanest and most transparent ones in the world</em>. No, I&#39;m not lying. Heck, even Germany pointed out how the Media had helped sway the people&#39;s thoughts into voting for this puppet guy only because he was pretty (Again, not lying sadly). The Media prepared a full scale IRL telenovela which is halting progress and the ability of rising living standards overall. And yet, there are nations who have the same kind of processes and are called &#39;evil&#39; or &#39;rigged&#39; (sometimes, rightfully so). But why give such heavy emphasis on places so far away and leave us here without the recognition we need on our own flawed processes?<br/>
It just pains me, and hurts more when I listen to people living here how shitty the country is and yet they won&#39;t do more than sitting down to watch the TV and news produced by the same media that&#39;s fucking the country.   </p>

<p>. . .and I just . . made a whole rant out of a simple thing. Sorry.<br/>
I also must remember most members of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are from the States so, maybe this is irrelevant . . .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wish we would have met 2 years ago, when I was still going to be living here for 2 years haha. </p>

<p>There is a lot to touch on in your post (it was long). But I will say the thing I didn&#39;t like and the only thing I didn&#39;t like was the food. I loved the local food, but being from America, it got old pretty fast. America does have pretty good food and a ridiculous variety, healthy and not. So I love mexican food, but it gets boring. </p>

<p>Crime, Family, Culture. I can say only one thing. Mexican people work to live, unlike the US where they live to work. You can see it everywhere. People here have a sense of community, family, it is hard to explain. But I never saw it in the US.</p>

<p>As for since the Government shift. I can only comment on what I have seen. The military moved out, the crime went up. Nothing else to say really. There was crime before, we went looking for it, and we found it. If we didn&#39;t we would never see it. If you don&#39;t do drugs, or &#39;crazy&#39; things, you are probably no more likely to be a victim of a crime here than anywhere.</p>

<p>Can only attest for the TJ area though. Which is supposed to be VERY violent. But not sure about other areas. </p>

<p>TL;DR Sell drugs get killed maybe. Do drugs get killed, almost never. Same as the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so are your efforts being buoyed by your spouse&#39;s credit cards and bank account(s) etc then?  While I don&#39;t take <em>anything</em> away from your efforts and do commend them, is it the case that although you yourself are existing on a &quot;100% cash&quot; basis, your household and family themselves are actually still using credit cards, checks, etc? and perhaps your own &quot;cash only&quot; lifestyle is made possible only because it is, again, buoyed by the fact that it is existing surrounded by a foundation that (via your spouse and their possible use of credit cards, etc) is itself still credit card-based?</p>

<p>Honest questions.  Just wondering.  Not trying to undermine what you&#39;re doing or trying to poo poo on it or make it seem like you&#39;re really &quot;not&quot; doing what you&#39;re saying you&#39;re doing.  Again, just trying to get a better idea and understanding of the logistic practicalities of your situation and how you&#39;re doing it, etc.</p>

<p>Do you live in the United States?</p>

<p>Do you live in a decent sized metropolitan city?</p>

<p>And, again, what (if any) issues or inconveniences have you or your family come across working this way?  Anything that&#39;s made you guys go &quot;That would have been easier to have accomplished if we had a cc.&quot;?</p>

<p>EDIT:  Well, not necessarily &quot;that would have been easier&quot; because I know that this society tries to make EVERYTHING &quot;easier&quot; w/a cc (that&#39;s part of the scam).  I just wonder if there&#39;s anything you HAVEN&#39;T been able to do going 100% cash.</p>

<p>And the way you phrased your OP <em>does</em> indeed make the whole thing seem quite a bit like an IAMA.  That&#39;s kind of how I was approaching it anyway and is why I was asking you a few Qs.</p>

<p>The reason why it turned more into what <em>you&#39;re</em> doing is because I don&#39;t think all that many people are doing what you&#39;re doing, so it&#39;s interesting because it gives others that might WANT to do what you&#39;re doing a game plan to follow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Debt and credit are inherent in any economy of any size.</p>

<p>I sell hvac and hvac accessories. The sheer volume of &quot;money&quot; that passes &quot;through my hands&quot; in a year would require me to build a vault in my office and hire a full-time employee and a group of security guards just to drive around and pay vendors. It&#39;s not feasible to do that without credit and debt.</p>

<p>My invoices get paid within 45 days. Because I always pay out vendors within that 45 day period they trust me. They issue me credit by dropping supplies at the shop without taking COD. I go into debt every time there&#39;s a pending invoice.</p>

<p>On the job, I issue credit to my customers. I do a job, they pay when it&#39;s done. My guys work on credit. They do a job, and I am in debt to them until friday when I cut their checks. Without credit and debt, nothing would 
work. </p>

<p>Lets say im setting up a freezer in a donut factory. The price is $50k. Without credit I need that money up front to pay vendors. The donut factory will have to collect cash from every gas station it delivers to. I have to wait until they have pooled that money, a couple hundred bucks at a time. Once it&#39;s in my hand, I can start buying materials- panels from milwaukee, vents from china, tools from south korea, whatever. I&#39;m then responsible for shipping those items to my doorstep. After all, without insurance I&#39;m not trusting anyone but my own captain to ship this stuff over to me. Six months after having donuts inc pay me cash, I&#39;m ready to start building. I pay all of my guys up front, and hope they stay through the week. They probably won&#39;t. Most of them are reliable, but there&#39;s a reason checks are cut on friday after work.</p>

<p>Then, say I go over budget. work stops. I cant get more supplies. I quoted them a price, and they&#39;re not paying me any more. They have 3/4 of a working liquid nitrogen cooled fast freezer, which is to say a really warm room with a couple conveyor belt and a couple of fancy tanks outside. Donuts inc is fucked. I&#39;m fucked, because I&#39;m the guy that builds half freezers. My guys are fucked because they need work every week to eat. you&#39;re fucked because there are no more donuts. I can sell my home, but the asking price is 300k. The foreman at the donut factory is in the market because he just got promoted, got married and has a kid on the way. As soon as he has the money, i can sell to him and finish the job out of pocket. Unfortunately, without that freezer that I fucked up, the factory is closed.</p>

<p>Every day of my life I work with debt and credit, and it&#39;s a wonderful system. It keeps the roads open, keeps you and I fed, keeps the wheels of society rolling. Without it, NOTHING gets done. </p>

<p>My home is bought on credit, your cable is built on credit, every moment of your existence revolves around debt and credit.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re homeless and unemployed, then you&#39;re out of debt and avoiding new debt. If you have a job, you&#39;re trading credit for labor. Even as a day laborer, you issue credit to your employer: I will put in a days work and you will pay me afterwards. You write me a check that I trust will not bounce.</p>

<p>Getting out of debt is impossible. Avoiding new debt is detrimental to the entire world- for want of a nail, and all that.</p>

<p>That was a bit of a drawn out analogy, and if I started mixing metaphors and talking nonsense I can simplify it a bit. Otherwise I&#39;ll let it stand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pffft, I&#39;ve never had a credit card &lt;/hipster&gt;</p>

<p>I kid, but it&#39;s true. Never had one. I pay cash for everything. Contractors love it. You get some serious bargaining power with cash, for almost everything.</p>

<p>For online, I have a checking account Visa that&#39;s sole purpose is online transactions. Amazon, Newegg, etc. If I want to buy something, I have to go put that amount of money in that account, then checkout. It stays at a 0 balance at all times, and no overdraft.</p>

<p>Another checking account is used for my bills. The auto-deduction for the phone, internet, water, insurance...all that stuff. I know what the monthly amount is, and preload it each month with a few bucks extra just in case. </p>

<p>I have another checking account Visa in my wallet for the MAC machine (Where I live, the 7-11 type store has free access to my bank, and they are <em>everywhere</em>) and the gas station if I don&#39;t feel like going in. I keep at most $200 in there, and recharge it as needed. </p>

<p>My paycheck is dropped into a different bank, and every two weeks I stop there and empty the account, deposit the monthly bill amount into the other bank&#39;s account, and drop the rest in my safe. I make deposits from there into my portfolio.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an easy system to keep. My statements come in already categorized. I don&#39;t have to worry about losing my wallet, because that card isn&#39;t responsible for anything. I just get a new one. I&#39;m free of worry about any website getting hacked, because there&#39;s not much, if anything, they can get from me. I can just cancel the card. Since I&#39;ve compartmentalized everything, I don&#39;t even have to update the card number on very many websites.</p>

<p>I make it known to others what is going on.  It may seem small &quot;waking&quot; people up, but without people knowing what is wrong, where, who is responsible, and possible solutions then nothing will be done.  People see these problems and feel themselves useless in it and I explain that they have more power than they think so forth.  But it has to start with people know what the problem is to understand what is the solution.  (understand the question to know what the answer is.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a good thing actually.  The only reason why you need a credit score is so you can borrow money.  The only reason why you need to borrow money is to buy something beyond your means.  My philosophy is if you can&#39;t afford it now, you shouldn&#39;t buy it now.  It&#39;s better to put money aside and wait.  Most impulse buys are made easier by credit.  If you don&#39;t have the money in your pocket, you won&#39;t spend it (obviously).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No i dont. I dont understand why they would swallow the cost of credit card transactions and pass it to everyone, rather than why only passing it to people who use credit cards. They can make products cheaper if they have a &quot;fee&quot;. They can also call it a discount on cash rather than a fee on credit </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am aware of this, it shows on their online activity.  Theres nothing to hide anyway. They have home address once you signed up for it.  When I think about it i rarely use them that much.  Probably
cancel them sooner or later.</p>

<p>As for privacy, they are not buggin me re or hounding me on the phone
, sending spam or whatever; so im glad there.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about hiding. It&#39;s about taking back control of our money. Fiat is an instrument of debt. It is created as debt for the paying of debt. Every year the gov steals (by printing more) 2-4% of your money.</p>

<p>Bitcoins is the opposite. As there will only ever be a certain amount created, it will increase in value. It is not debt because you can&#39;t loan out more than you have.</p>

<p>Also with cash, the cops can seize it if they suspect you of a crime.</p>

<p>Purchases made with Bitcoins pay a very small transaction fee. And it arrives instantly. Try sending someone in Mexico a bunch of money and see how much you pay.</p>

<p>What about Turkey? How hard do you think it would be to wire cash to someone in Turkey right now? Bitcoins do not have that problem as they are decentralized, meaning, it&#39;s the people&#39;s money.</p>

<p>Lastly, cash is the #1 instrument for drugs, CP and all the other nasty things out there. Why are you not condemning that?</p>
