The discussion of 9/11 came up in class recently, and one of my classmates said that the buildings collapsing would be impossible since jet fuel supposedly cannot melt steel. But, can it bend steel? You don&#39;t have to reach something&#39;s melting point to weaken it, only to change it from a solid to a liquid. Therefore, would it be possible for it to weaken enough to bend and snap, even though it did not &quot;melt&quot;. I&#39;m being serious, I just want to know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes steel can lose its strength at very high temperatures, and would be significant around 600 degrees celcius, 1100 farenheight. So the test is to see if the fires in the buildings could have possibly gotten that hot.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/fires/docs/wtc12c.jpg">This</a> image shows how little fire there was, and the darker color of the smoke indicates lower and diminishing fires. But I do not have proof of what temperatures it could have been.</p>

<p>It is best to look at building 7. The only fires there were office fires. <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtc7.cfm">NIST</a> themselves say that the steel beams in WTC7 only reached 300 degrees celcius.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some info about the WTC7 collapse: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center#9.2F11_and_collapse">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center#9.2F11_and_collapse</a></p>

<p>Says &quot;heavy debris hit 7 World Trade Center, damaging the south face of the building and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon. The collapse also caused damage to the southwest corner between Floors 7 and 17 and on the south face between Floor 44 and the roof; other possible structural damage included a large vertical gash near the center of the south face between Floors 24 and 41.&quot;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&quot;NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers, nor did the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled – pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What convinced me it was a controlled demolition was the pictures of the beams of the towers being sliced all in the same diagonal direction. This how they demolish buildings by wrapping the explosives(thermite?) around the beam so it slides off allowing the building to collapse within itself like the towers did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey! Thanks for your curiosity. I am sure people have already given you many answers in here so far. I would like to stress that when the buildings falls at &quot;free-fall&quot; speed for any given time during the collapse it means that during that time it only had it&#39;s weight and gravity between it and the ground. </p>

<p>This reason why this one point is important is because it is the point that is ignored by those who would want to believe in the the metal &quot;bending&quot; rather than a control demolition.</p>

<p>It has already been proven by both architects and acknowledged by NIST.</p>

<p>The real question is, why is the point that it fell at free-fall speed is ignored? In order to believe the official story that fact cannot be taken into account because doing so would undo hundreds of years of science.</p>

<p>If someone &quot;wants&quot; to believe something, they will bend facts and blur definitions in order to make that belief real. The reason because you couldn&#39;t say the same thing about those who say that the buildings on 9/11 must be controlled demotion is because the evidence, and lack of, indicates foul play. </p>

<p>Again, in order to believe the official story you have to suspend science in order to make it work. I choose to agree with science on this one. Will be happy to answer any inquiries, good luck friend.</p>

<p>Here is a website to a bunch of architects who have put their degrees and careers on the line to speak out against the official story. Lot&#39;s of good stuff here including actual scientific explanations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your best bet to truly understand what happened that day is to watch footage of WTC buildings one and two &quot;collapsing&quot;.  Watch the video, and tell me, does that look like steel melting, or bending for that matter?  You should notice the entire building (both one and two) being exploded outward, annihilated into a million pieces.  It wasn&#39;t a collapse, it didn&#39;t fall down and it didn&#39;t melt or bend.  It was exploded, you can see air pockets being blown out as it comes down, and you can watch footage of witnesses giving accounts of explosions beneath ground level and in the basement of the towers.  That information alone, facts beyond reasonable doubt, should give you enough information that the official story (the one put forth by the treasonous &quot;leaders&quot; of our country at that time) were lying and covering up the truth.  Glad to hear you HS kids aren&#39;t swallowing the pill of the history books the very people who orchestrated this event have written.  Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently read an article that talked about steel beams from WTC 7 that were melted with holes like Swiss cheese.  No amount of jet fuel (or kinetic energy from a collapse) is going to melt holes in a support I-beam,</p>

<p>The construction of WTC 1 and 2 was unusual because of the inner core-outer column support structure that used the concrete floor/steel truss supports to stiffen the structure.  <strong>If</strong> the fireproofing was scraped away and <strong>if</strong> the fire got hot enough at the connection hangers between the core columns and the floor trusses, the floors <strong>might</strong> have sagged enough to pull away and fall.</p>

<p>I remember seeing that Underwriter&#39;s Labs built a scale model of the construction mentioned above, doused it in jet fuel, and couldn&#39;t get the steel hot enough to sag.  Interesting theory, but experimental evidence doesn&#39;t back it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the official explanation is that it defies physics. Neither plane struck the tower dead centre and the second one was way off to one side. If this had weakened the upright girders the collapse would have started on one side of the building and the top would have toppled sideways before starting to go down. But all three buildings came down exactly within their own footprint, which means that support for the upper floors gave out on every girder at exactly the same time. The only way to achieve that would be to use explosives or thermite. It is interesting to note that the damaged steel girders were cut up and hauled off site for recycling almost immediately. You have to ask yourself why it was so important to get them out of the way before people started asking questions about how the towers collapsed. But even without them, there was enough thermite residue in the debris around the World Trade Center to suggest that it had been used to cut the girders and bring the buildings down. You are right in thinking that jet fuel alone could not burn hot enough to melt the steel. There have been many steel framed skyscrapers which have been engulfed in fire, and not one of them collapsed until the day all three WTC buildings went down in Manhattan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Structural steel can be heated enough to weaken and cause failure. However, office fires and jet fuel cannot heat portions of such massive structures enough to weaken them. The interconnected columns etc  act as a huge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_sink">heat sink</a> drawing heat away from any hot spots. Underwriters Labs did a study on the steel and found the fires could not have gotten hot enough to actually heat the steel sufficiently to weaken it.

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is not that if jet fuel can bend or melt steel. The issue is where did the jet fuel come from. </p>

<p>If you see the videos of the planes hitting the towers you will see a big ball of fire, that is the jet fuel burning up. So even if jet fuel could melt steel, the vast majority was burnt up on impact. No the jet fuel was burnt up on impact so the only fire that could have been left is what was caught on fire by the initial explosion, and that burns as hot as that material does. You know office furniture, and drywall, and ceiling tile. That should be self explanatory if it weakens steel. </p>

<p>But in answer to your question the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel">open air burning temp of jet fuel is 500–599 °F</a>, and <a href="http://education.jlab.org/qa/meltingpoint_01.html"> Steel can be soft at 538°C (1,000°F)</a> so even if the fuel supply was maintained it could not even weaken the steel. </p>

<p>Then you have to take into account that the steel was not bare, it was encased in concrete. </p>

<p>But the biggest question you have to answer is this. How many steel reinforced concrete buildings have fallen due to fire ever? The answer is three, WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>By what, the materials used to build a building do not burn at that temp, otherwise they would not be allowed to be used as building materials. having worked with building inspectors I know that all buildings have to use approved materials, and every step of the process is inspected and verified to be up to specs. No materials that are flammable are allowed to be used except in specific conditions, in other words it is necessary for the building. </p>

<p>Think of it this way, the US governments official &quot;theory&quot; on JFK assassination was all tied together by a &quot;magic bullet&quot; theory as this was the only way to explain all injuries with only two bullets. So it is not beyond a government agency to lie to get their point out. This magic bullet changed directions and speed, as well as held still in mid air for a time, just so they can pin the assassination on a lone patsy. </p>

<p>So you have to take everything any governmental agency says with a grain of salt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.aisc.org/DynamicTaxonomyFAQs.aspx?id=1996">http://www.aisc.org/DynamicTaxonomyFAQs.aspx?id=1996</a> says &quot;the maximum temperature of a fully developed building fire will rarely exceed 1800°F&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire#Typical_temperatures_of_fires_and_flames">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire#Typical_temperatures_of_fires_and_flames</a> says a candle can burn at 1800F.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.doctorfire.com/flametmp.html">http://www.doctorfire.com/flametmp.html</a> says about room fires: &quot;Of interest is the maximum value which is fairly regularly found. This value turns out to be around 1200°C, although a typical post-flashover room fire will more commonly be 900~1000°C.&quot;  (900C is 1652F; 1000C is 1832F).</p>

<p>So I&#39;d say seeing 1800F in a building fire is quite possible.</p>

<p>Maybe the issue is not the materials used to BUILD the building, but the materials INSIDE the building.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, it won&#39;t <em>bend</em> it by itself, but it can weaken it enough that the weight of stuff above it bends it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, would it be possible for it to weaken enough to bend and snap, even though it did not &quot;melt&quot;.</p>

<p>This is absolutely correct.</p>

<p>And then once it reaches a certain point, it creates a chain reaction and the whole building comes down, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SoFt7fe.png">like so</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment is misleading, as I thought NIST&#39;s version was considered &quot;pancake&quot;.  What OP is asking is if metal fatigue could be related to the cause of failure.  NIST states a combination of items, including metal fatigue.  <strong>They don&#39;t seem to have a nice simple name for their concluded findings.</strong></p>

<p>Here is why your statement is correct, but misleading</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm">Full Detail</a> Question 8</p>

<p>&quot;NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse, which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers (the composite floor system—that connected the core columns and the perimeter columns—consisted of a grid of steel “trusses” integrated with a concrete slab; see diagram). <strong>Instead, the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards.</strong> Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon.&quot;</p>
