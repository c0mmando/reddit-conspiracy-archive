<p>This company from San Diego called Strategic Operations ran Urban Shield 2012 training exercise in Boston - involved 500 first responders over a 24 hour exercise - <a href="http://vimeo.com/41709220">http://vimeo.com/41709220</a> and advertises their involvement with the Boston Marathon in a media release on their website 3 May 2013 and amputee actors. </p>

<p>Huh? Also, this &quot;actor&quot; (Jeff Bauman) lives near me, and now has no legs. He had legs before the bombings. It is easy to come up with any far-fetched conspiracy when you are far away and only believe what fits your agenda. But the fact is, this guy was maimed in the bombings. This is not even a debate. I have talked with his coworkers at at Costco</p>
