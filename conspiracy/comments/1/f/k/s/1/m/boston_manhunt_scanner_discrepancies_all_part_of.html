        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It has bothered me that we never heard again about the following which were clearly reported on the scanner during the manhunt for Tsarnaevs:</p>

<p>Rocket in Basement/
Man with switch or suicide vest on/
Active shooter at the children&#39;s hospital</p>

<p>These were clearly explained on the scanner - there were a few other incidents that seemed very real that never made it to the media - in more detail than could just be a mistake.</p>

<p>Was that whole 24-36 hours part of the exercise also?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if Strategic Operations were involved that means all of those people were &quot;paid actors&quot; (lack of better word). </p>

<p>Who are those actors? How can they sit back and watch the results of their own actions unfold with such harsh devastation? I could understand someone being ignorant prior to the event but to remain silent after what has happened just seems...impossible? Improbable? Maybe I am just naive, I mean, that sort of lie would just eat me up inside and drive me bonkers.</p>
