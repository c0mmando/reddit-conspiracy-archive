       Turkey's got the right idea. Who here would be interested in organizing a serious peaceful march in the name of change. I am calling on anyone who is ready to make a real difference, regardless of political affiliation or any other ridiculous method of social separation. It is time to unite under the convictions we share instead of dividing ourselves into different groups only to be bitter toward one another and argue over who's ideas are better. The tyrants we fight don't have to worry about a thing as long as we stand divided in utter chaos, unity is our most powerful weapon. So, I am begging you, let's rise up and end this oppressive reality we have allowed to stand unchallenged for so long, let's be the generation that goes down in history as the generation that said "enough is enough" and put fear and division aside and worked for the greater good. We can do it, but it will take perseverance and real action. This cannot be a one day thing, we have to stick it out and make a real impact. Who is with me? Let's get to work.

      <p>
       We need to unite against corruption and special interest - this is true - but we have to realize that the way we do that is by uniting with EACH OTHER and making a great effort to see one another as family and work together as one.

       I took part the other day in the "March Against Monsanto" demonstration that took place in my neck of the woods.  More of those wouldn't be a bad idea.  I personally am actually NOT crazy about the party/mardi gras atmosphere that the events, marches, and demonstrations I've been to involve.  I feel the gravity of what we are demonstrating about (whether it be the MAM or the OWS demonstrations I've also taken part in) is NOT something that should have a "party" atmosphere like it's felt to me.  I like the look and feel of a lot of the Gandhi and MLK marches that I've seen.  Those people were serious, focused, somber, concentrated.  They were serious about what they were marching and demonstrating about.  It was no time to be happy and cheery.  It was time to be focused and serious - letting TPTB know that "we mean
       <em>
        business"
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway...mini rant there perhaps, but part of me feels that we can begin making it happen by searching out or organizing like minded people to - again - launch an ongoing series of proper, sustained, focused demonstrations.

       :) I cannot more heartily agree -- I supported Occupy...but there were times when I would walk through Oscar Grant Plaza in Oakland and the place would reek of pot and B.O.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike parties, or even pot, but those places are inappropriate circumstances for such shenanigans. We should be welcoming, polite, and encouraging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Serious, but not unfriendly.

       I would love to crowd the streets of all major cities so tightly that cars no longer run, that business stops and people see clearly the problems we're facing. We need to, all of us, become diplomats to our fellow Americans.

       Yeah.  Los Angeles wasn't all that much different, and it simply was indicative of a group of people that didn't have the necessary level of discipline and focus to
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       make something meaningful, worthwhile, and long term happen/take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to realize that as shitty as the current system most definitely is, anyone that wants to change things will have to STILL change things while addressing the problems of law and order, the problems of justice, of equality, of the exchange of goods and services, of housing, care of the young and old, medical services, etc, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about marching and saying "We don't like this system!" and then bailing if/when the demonstrations are successful and you actually DO oust the shitty government that's currently in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes that's how countries really DO end up becoming worse wastelands than they were before:  The people don't have the necessary discipline and attitude to work and govern THEMSELVES properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       This takes, again, discipline, focus, and a proper work ethic.  If what we want is a rockin', kick ass society where everyone TRULY is equal and things are just and proper, then that means that we all will have to raise the level of our game as citizens a WHOLE lot more than where they are for many of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of us, it is unfortunate to say, almost
       <em>
        deserve
       </em>
       to be ruled over.
      </p>
      <p>
       With great power comes great responsibility, and if we don't want the shitty government we have now, then we're going to seriously have to up our level of responsibility as citizens and get ready to REALLY help and rule and guide and lead
       <em>
        ourselves
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Easier said than done, but nothing less will lead to a proper society and civilization.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Correct.  We should also be ready and willing to be very strong, focused, and assertive in how we communicate and demonstrate.  Be intelligent.  Demonstrate in a welcoming, polite, and encouraging way to those we stand with, but - while being honorable and respectful - let those that we stand in opposition to know that we are
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       serious and are NOT to be trifled with.  We will
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       go away, and we are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       scared or afraid.

      <p>
       I would love to see this WITHOUT a party, undisciplined atmosphere.  I'm not saying we have to be walking around like dead people, but I think it would be GGGRRRREATLY intimidating to TPTB if they saw a few tens of thousands of people lining the streets and stopping businesses, etc like you mentioned...and everyone were organized and composed without a lot of yelling or screaming or disoriented anger; where it WASN'T an "angry mob".  Where it couldn't be seen as a "gathering of ravel rousers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it was something much, much scarier and more intimidating:  It was a city of serious, concerned citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would certainly turn some heads and get some serious attention.

       our state is 1/5 the size of the rest of the country combined. And our capital is on an island of American land. Although it is connected to the continent by Canada there is no road system that you can drive to your capital. And to take the ferry and want to spend less than 1g for you and your car you have to drive through Haines, Alaska. Really its a fucked up place to have a capital which allows commercial fishing and oil interest to have undue power in our government. We voted over 70perccent majority to move it inland when I was an infant yet commercial fishing interest somehow kept it in the middle of no where. Check it out on google maps, The capital is 500+ miles away.

       don't get me wrong, I'm all for change. I hate this government and I despise the inequality. I hate the fucking drones, I hate the GMOs, I hate the revolving door. but we just aren't ready yet. people are too dulled down by the constant drone of the TV and zombified by cell phones. once there's some serious reason for change that the majority of people can feel or taste, i.e. true hunger or not knowing where their next meal is coming from, that's when we'll have change.

       No, angsty teenagers are the ones who show up to rallies without even understanding what they're protesting or who specifically they are protesting against. You can't accomplish anything without clearly established goals and a plan of action to achieve them.

       ) shows that the government is made up of 2,854,251 employees split into 28 different functions (police, social services, fire protection, hospitals, transportation, postal service, libraries ect. included in "this government"). You really hate all of these individual people?

       Sadly that sounds like so many people in the past dozen mass protests these past years here in America.

       Always have people in these groups going for something far more or something completely different. Not to mention the constant power struggles in the failed occupy movements.

       First of all, I haven't been a teenager in years. Second, I am 'protesting' against everything you mentioned and then some, but instead of throwing my ideals into other peoples faces in an effort to cause an argument, I am calling for people who want change to stand together FOR change. We all may have different ideas for how the world and society should work, but none of it is any good as long as the powers that be are our masters. Period. So the first step is to get them to step down, however we can, and then the details will work themselves out as the need arises. One foot in front of another my friend.

       sorry but the only way to change america is through election. rallying and protesting will only bring an issue to light, but thats all. the system wont change. if the conspiracist of reddit really wanted change we should start looking for a president now. everybodys starting to lean towards clinton but that will still be part of the same old infrastructure. if we want change we need to find change. we need a progressive liberal who believes in our basic principles and is a natural born leader with unfaltering confidence that will not be swayed in his principles. If we don't look now for someone, then we are going to be given what we get without input. if we really want to change the system we need to start becoming more political. 1st, we should look for a president; and secondly, we need to start targeting the politicians that we believe are implementing bills and amendments contrary to our ideals. We need to find out who they are, for how long they've been in office, and why they are still in power. Then we need to implement competition. If we don't compete, then there isnt anyone fighting for our ideals in how we believe america should be led.  ?

       Let's start by analyzing exactly what it would take to be successful.  For example, organizing supplies for everyone participating, formulating ways to educate people about the reason and aim of the protests, starting online campaigns to counter the misinfo that will be broadcast by MSM, recruiting volunteers to help with cleaning, finding people to donate supplies like food and water.  A clearly defined goal will be essential.  As well as the actual protocol for the protests.  Sit-ins?  March's?  There would need to be people with cameras everywhere watching for undercover's who will be trying to incite violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I think the place to start is a checklist of things that would be required for this to work.  And then, start organizing "committees" to start working on each item on the list.  I doubt one big protest will work here.  I think this should be something that is revolving- a regularly planned demonstration rather than just hitting the streets until the riot cops come in to break up the party.  This way it can start to gain traction and attention nationwide.  Remember that TPTB have no issue with bringing out the riot cops to push people into a corner so they fight back.  At that point they'll bring out the DHS tanks and set up checkpoints and cart a bunch of us off to camps indefinitely as they will more than likely qualify us as domestic terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the reason I take this perspective is because people who are comfortable will be very reluctant to participate.  Same with people who are fearful of the reprecussions and those who have grown to love their slavery.  The only way to get them to participate is to make them feel like all the bases are covered and this isn't just about being angry and rioting, it's about demonstrating our united will as a people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of me still thinks this is a bad idea though because TPTB would love a chance to incite chaos within the states in order to clamp down even tighter on us.  Perhaps we should adopt their ideology of patient gradualism and get to work that way.  I'm curious to hear others opinions.

       I agree that a single march or protest probably wouldn't be very effective. But a continuous "occupy" or "arab spring" style protest that was large enough, and gained enough momentum, I believe, would work. The only thing is we would HAVE to stick it out, and things would for sure get crazy. People would get beat up, the riot police would be called in, but the odds just don't matter anymore. Those of us who have woken up have a duty to at least TRY, no matter what the consequences are. And I also think we will have to keep this peaceful, brute force is on their side and the second we get violent they know exactly how to handle us. Peace and unity will be our strongest allies. 
The reason I wrote this was to get the conversation started, to get the ideas flowing and to make connections. If we just get the ball rolling I think the details will work themselves out as the need arises. The most important thing right now is to begin and not to give up.

       I agree. We basically need lots and lots of protests, all over the place, of all kinds, organized by different groups. Most people are angry and frustrated, but they dont see what they can do - even protests seem pointless - but if we can get waves of big protests going every summer then the whole thing starts to seem real, like it has some momentum and some chance of going somewhere. Being a revolutionary will start to seem like an acceptable, almost mainstream kind of thing and more people will start to come out and get involved.

       Protests is fine if someone reporting it and enough people reading about it and get angry enough to act somehow. Actually vote accordingly for example. You see the problem here? What threat is occupy events really to the current situation and the 1%?

       Occupy events help build solidarity.  Meaning others get to see that they aren't alone.  The media has done an excellent job of keeping us all at home, alone, separated from each other, and making us feel as though there are only a small percentage of us who feel these things.  It's not true, and events like Occupy bring that directly to the forefront.
       <br/>
       With that courage, change can happen in a real way.
Besides, everything has to start somewhere, and while I agree that labor strikes would be a more direct threat to the 1%, those will come after the initial occupy styled events become more prevalent.

       I'd like to see more organized marches.  I participated in the march against monsanto and it was huge in my hometown (around 1000 people).  I can imagine a world where we put together big ticket issues like Monsanto, Tasers, Prisons, Marijuana, 1%, LGBTQ, raw milk, etc.  You name it, we have a march for it.  One every other week or something.  And don't be afraid to repeat an issue because you want to see real change.  Activism instead of just yelling at the tv or typing something on a message board.  Get out and meet others and make your voice actually heard!  That's how I figure we'll get our real leaders in all of this and how we'll make a real change.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was great to get to see all the people who showed up for the march against monsanto because that meant I wasn't alone and there were a large amount of people who agreed with my opinion.  Solidarity helps to build courage.  Courage helps to create change.  Take action that leads outside your door.

       There have been so many covert false flags - documented ones. None of the powers like to get caught out framing someone.  Mossad and that murder team in Dubai with stolen British passports for example.

       I feel like I've been waiting forever to hear others call for action. It seems that the protests in Turkey have awoken people's will to actually do something about our situation in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want a powerful yet seemingly simple goal, it would be to create a new debt-free currency for the US. It's simple because it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that our current financial system is a complete scam, so getting others on board wouldn't be as difficult as let's say proving to others that the government is evil. Yet it's powerful because it's possibly most important resource and tool for tptb. I'll admit I know little to nothing about economics and the consequences/troubles of establishing a new national currency, but I'm sure there are others who do. It's time we work together and fuse our knowledge for the greater good, instead of having a giant circle jerk about who knows the most on a certain topic.

       I am willing to help organize a peaceful protest. It is time that we do DO something about the immense corruption and control over human beings. We are not workers for people, we the people are workers for this planet we call MOTHER EARTH. It seems to me that many have forgotten that. PM me for me info on how to start this if you are serious.

       Just shooting from the hip but, can we all get 5 people to join us? If we all get 5 people, we will have a good start. Those five people could then recruit 5 more people. If we set some goals I think we can generate some real momentum. We need defined goals, even if they are small goals.

       How about Hand out burned DVDs like Food Inc..etc to show people how corrupt our system is. Obviously you wont get everyone to watch but if some people do go home and watch it they may formulate opinions of their own or even go to a protest like the Monsanto one.

       In order to effect a revolution you need to take a page out of the CIA's book.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) have a police officer kill or injure seriously an innocent protester, preferably a girl. (see Neda in Iran for a good example)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Have government security forces be seen to snipe innocents from rooftops etc.. See Honduras.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Have your people ready with signs, and begin the march.   Provoke more incidents, escalate and enlist foreign help for the 'rebel resistance'

       We need more people that support this kind of direct action. But in the end how do you explain subverting a peaceful cause to quickly escalate to an armed domestic conflict? It would be an armed conflict with one of the world's largest arms dealers too?
      </p>

       And to quote their own play book without seeing if they have some kind of back up or counter strategy to this...

        But in the end how do you explain subverting a peaceful cause to quickly escalate to an armed domestic conflict?

      <p>
       How do you explain? Explain to whom?  I figure you don't want to explain it. If you succeed, you don't have to answer to anyone.  If you fail, nobody hears about it for a while, until next time.

       This is what they use in every country.   Iran was really glaring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably a good way to go about it is to use crisis actors and the media as unwitting rubes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crisis actors dressed as cops are caught on video viciously attacking protestors.. maybe some girls singing protest songs.  dragged by their hair beaten, and cursed at.    The video is carefully 'leaked' to the media, and false attempts to cover it up are made.  Denials follow, and before anyone can question the authenticity of the events, the protest is in full swing, and momentum carries.

       could we create a false flag video of the police shooting a girl to incite a revolution? it sounds crazy but the CIA have had much success with covert operations why wouldn't the opposition play the same game? we do have access to the entire world thru the internet.

       OP, look up occupy events in your area. Attend rallies, meet with people and talk about the actions they are taking. Rather than splintering into different groups we should pool our efforts and resources. Whatever your initial thoughts have been about OWS, it's important to remember that this is bigger than just us in this forum, or your neighbors, or the people in America. This is about the WORLD. This is the future of our whole WORLD. We are still to this day discovering tribes deep in rain forests, but how long till they are all known, discovered, exploited? How long till this world can't sustain our current numbers because we have poisoned our lands and oceans? Where can this world possibly go if we are stuck like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB know this world is limited, in resources, and in time. What is their endgame? What is the long plan that they have? Push the rest of us down till we die off? You are right that we need to be out protesting and screaming about injustice and immorality (and I'm talking corporate world here, individual world is a whole nother story). We need to be open to educating everyone with questions, to clarifying how the world actually works with these crooked people in power. These people don't know half the faces behind the curtains, hell I don't even know them. So many crooked schemes to keep us running in our hamster wheels and rat races. Debt with imaginary money. Inflation and interest rates. The rabbit holes are many and go deep, some intertwine to make it that much harder to figure out. Just remember you are not alone in this. Unite and resist.

       I'm with you. I have been with Occupy since the beginning, in a few different states. Problem is that it fizzled out too quickly. We need REAL dedication and perseverance. We need commitment. We really can do this, it seems so impossible, but that is just a clever deception, change is not only attainable but it is inevitable. We just have to want it bad enough.

       Me and my friend often discuss this very subject. We've thought about what would need to happen, not only in America, but across the world to get on a better track. We came to the conclusion that, yes, widespread protest and boycotting the big corporations would be a great start. It's just that....how do you get enough people to look at the situation and deem it more important to sacrifice their comfort zone for the betterment of America and the world? One thing that could spark it would be the US GOVT getting its hand caught in the cookie jar so utterly blatantly that mostly everyone in america would see

       I agree that getting people interested will be struggle, but I honestly believe that the real challenge is just getting started. How can we expect to get people to see what we see if we do nothing in fear of failure? We have to try, or we can never have any hope of success.

       Occupy Movements + Tea Parties = Scared Government.  As long as Fox News continues the right wing propaganda,  MSNBC continues Left Wing Propaganda,  I'm afraid that this will continue until 2014 when "elections" are over and Republicans take power back,  and continue what George Bush and Bill Clinton before them.  Americans seem more content fighting the left or right then waking up and realizing that they are essentially the same elite that drive us apart.  We unfortunately only seem to Unite when the enemy is foreign.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can honestly make a change if we want it bad enough, someone needs to Unite the Occupy Movement and the Tea Party Patriots together, for any chance at a real revolution.  I will continue to post on Reddit to keep sane until this time comes, or move to Europe where at least I can eat real food without worrying about GM meals.

       People who are confused about all the events going on...i had spoken to my sister about sandy hook and she doesn't believe me nor do i want to believe myself, but she agreed that it was weird the way all the parents handled themselves. SO there is skepticism there. I think if we stick to these hard points and have people question those, then we can get them to start questioning everything else. For instance WTC building 7 that's a great starting point.

       Don't give up OP. There is a massive amount of shills deployed against bringing these kinds of protests (the actually effective kind) to THIS country. Notice how fast Turkey mobilized and kept in contact with eachother - but just the mere thought of protesting HERE, for
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       is
       <em>
        so fought against
       </em>
       and disrupted before it can even come to fruition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe any of the bullshit. I, and many many others, will fight for this with you. The only real question is what to do with these marketing/advertising/shill scum once the smoke clears. (And make no mistake, we will be victorious.). Noone wants those parasites to be a part of a healthy world. They are worse than mercenaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just know one thing - and it's a very very incredibly important thing - a thing that
       <strong>
        no revolution will survive without in this age, and why none have so far
       </strong>
       . And it a hard reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only language that those you protest speak IS violence. They do not speak peace. And have all of the grand fantasies of the future you want - but know that
       <strong>
        they will speak it.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point you will have to be prepared to speak their tongue. We
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       .

       It's not as easy as just getting a large group of people to walk around yelling about stuff that they hate &amp; want to change. There needs to be a leader. A strong, passionate &amp; charismatic leader that could be the face of a protest movement. That's why MLK's marches were so successful in the long run, and that's why the Occupy movement failed.

       MLK's marches weren't the only marches.  He's just the one that everyone remembers.  There were multiple leaders and multiple marches all over the nation.  They just grew and grew and MLK slowly rose as a passionate &amp; charismatic leader from those groups.  Things have to start somewhere.
      </p>

       And Occupy wasn't a failure.  If you believe that then you are seriously misguided.  Occupy brought media attention to the issue at hand, class warfare is here and very much alive (that's what the 99% vs the 1% translates to).  It also spread across the world in a very short amount of time.  Also, it showed many Americans that they aren't alone in their thoughts that things are messed up and a real change is needed.  Occupy is but a small front of a soon to be larger wave.  Large change comes through the use of movements like these strung together over time.  The "MLK" of tomorrow is learning how to lead today.  Everything has to start somewhere.

       You sir. I'm glad you are speaking up for Occupy. To often do I see people calling it a failure. It's only had it's training wheels so far. Those are coming off soon. Yes eventually they need leaders, it's the return veterans, it's the people who believe and are passionate about the movement that will rise to be leaders. That is why they had been monitoring and watching them. Protesters get added to watch lists, and have been tagged as suspicious.

       The most important things to remember with the future coming faster and faster are to not be afraid, and that you are not alone.

       Which is why a paradigm shift needs to occur. The reason tyrants step in is because their is a power vacuum that the general population is looking to fill. We need to get people to understand that looking to someone else to lead you is an outdated ideal. Real democracy is a system where the people rule themselves, America, and most other supposedly 'democratic' societies are anything but. Closer to dictatorial republics. Democracy, also only works when the public is properly educated, which given the media situation in most developed countries, isn't happening. plain and simple. When will we be able to say enough is enough? Do we not owe it to our children or even ourselves to heal this world and bring our species back into harmony?

       I am inclined to think that everyone in here should go to their city hall town meetings and talk to the local old people who still care about community. The change starts at the lowest parts of society not lopping the head off the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do that, another dictator will come in and make you promises and pat you on the head saying "It's all gonna be okay".

      <p>
       The truth is, we need community, without community no change can occur.

       A cool idea would be have people spread out throughout cities with positive messages like we are here to help, i love you, together we can do this. Then after being looked at as good people not conspiracy theorists or terrorists and after you get attention from people we can change the signs to statements like we are here for change and progression. i dont know. I think if people feel love and comfort not fear and the dog eat dog mentality we can change the way we have been taught to think.

       Maybe it's worth marching not to change things as they are, but to support an independent candidate for 2016.  Maybe it's possible, with enough internet support that a 3rd party candidate that is for the people can be elected and make a difference.  I'm not sure this could happen, but if we get someone in the white house that is really for the people and not for the corporations, real change could happen.

       I am with you. I was thinking one idea would be to hold conferences, meetings, or conventions, something to speak at, provide information to people. A PowerPoint detailing every way our government and corporations are exploiting us, fucking us over ever way possible would also be a simple, concise way to arouse people.

       I am exactly where you are right now. I am looking for ideas on how to get this going as well. My idea so far is just to get people to stop consenting to their oppression and take to the streets. I mean, the system works because we do,
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       rely on
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       . So I say, hit them where it hurts and take way their life force. We just need to get the snowball rolling and I believe, just like Turkey and other countries (Iceland, Bulgaria, Tunisia, Egypt, Etc) mass will be achieved through effort.

       It seems that your heart is in the right place - you want to improve things, but do you know what you're fighting? The corrupt powers that be in this world get their power from demonic pacts.

       The secret societies you know about teach something many of you don't know about: a practical way to sell your soul, and thats what the top senators, generals, and politicians in this corrupt cesspool of a country do with their freedom of religion. It turns them into super villains that thrive off the suffering of innocents and throws mankind closer to hell every time it occurs. To fight these demons, you need God and his angels. Anything you do without God's help will not be successful.

       That is exactly the response they're hoping to get. They will know exactly how to respond to your violence and it will not be pretty. They have a monopoly on force my friend, so we need another method of operation. A revolution of violence will only breed more violence, what we need is a non-violent revolution of consciousness. We cannot fight tyranny with tyranny, we tried that, it didn't work. Time to try something new.

       When was the last time the american people rose up violently against the US government, en masse? I look around and see tens and hundreds of thousands of people marching for all kinds of causes, and being resolutely ignored. The majority of americans want GMOs labeled. Doesn't happen. The majority of Americans want Citizens United repealed. Doesn't happen. The majority of Americans want Marijuana decriminalized. Doesn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no sense in using legal channels to affect change when those legal channels are designed by the people who don't want change to be affected. It is far too easy for some corrupt politician to sneak an amendment into a bill that is sure to pass, and far too difficult for hundreds of thousands of people to set their lives aside to march in protest until it gets overturned. Especially considering that, while their marching against one bill, the sneaky bastards will write two other bills that accomplish the same thing, so that IF we do succeed at getting something repealed, the concession will only be a moot placation anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 2008, when Citizen's United was signed into law, political candidates who spend more money on their campaign win the election over 90% of the time (politifacts checked it). That is far too strong a correlation to deny that money now buys political results. And since 60%+ of this nation's money rests with less than 5% of the populace, they will always be able to buy more political speech than we can. They will always be able to shout more loudly into the microphone than we can. And so they will always get the results that they want, inspite of the majority. That is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a republic, and I will
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       stand for it.
      </p>

       No, it cannot be fixed through legal channels. When the law becomes corrupt, it is our duty to ignore it and re-establish a functioning legal system. This government has gone too far, for too long. It's time for them to go, by any means necessary.

       I agree that legal channels are useless. But I do not agree that we are at the point where we need to take up arms against the largest and most advanced arms dealer in the world. Civil disobedience, total non-compliance, we must simply take away their power and starve them of what they need to continue operating so effectively.

       That's a critical part of removing them from power because the people need to re-familiarizing themselves with surviving off the grid, but it will not be sufficient by itself, because of
       <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness">
        executive order 13603
       </a>
       , which was signed in 2012 in anticipation of exactly that kind of action. The order authorizes the US executive branch to forcibly seize any resources deemed necessary for the continuity of government (including forced human labor), even during peacetime, without congressional approval, and not subjectable to judicial review.
      </p>
      <p>
       13603 is an amendment to the 1950 Defense Production Act, which authorized the executive branch to seize resources during war time,
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       congressional approval, but with the amendments made in 2012, it is an effective cecession of the executive branch from the checks and balances of the other two branches. I know that sounds hyperbolic, but take a look at the document for yourself. It's only about 5 pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-cooperation would empower the people to survive without the government, but the government will not allow it to collapse them. They will simply take anything they neeed to keep going. I used to have exactly the same opinion as you...until I saw that document.

       Then perhaps the proper response is for everyone to realize that the government is imaginary. That it is a mafia, and that we pay them to do what they do. And all we have to do is stop funding them. What if tomorrow we woke up and no one knew the name America? People just walked around and did their thing. No taxes, no nationalism, just pride in life and love. I know that's the idealistic beautified version, but the question is to get you to think of how to really go against it. It's to realize that the government's power comes from people giving it power. We don't need to take to the streets, we don't need to sit in and protest. We don't need to be violent. We simply need to stop being a part of it. We stop supporting it with taxes. We stop listening to laws that bend us to the will we don't want. We spread that idea to as many people as we can, and simply let the government fade out of existence. A war of attrition, where there is no enemy for them to fight. There is no one to seek out. There are no groups to shoot bullets at. They just lose power. The people are the ones who farm, who manufacture, who are traders, who build. We already run the country. We run everything. All we have to do is just stop putting any thought and money into a system that has no regard for us as anything but resources. That's the message that would change everything.

       The government's power used to come from our consent, but not anymore. They've made provisions to overcome any measure of non-cooperation that the people could offer up. I went into details in the response to DubKyd above, if you're curious why I say that.

       Well, it was really just a friendly warning. The elders don't speak this way because of prisons, and nifty things that make 25 year olds die of heart attacks right after a 5k. The time for revolution was YEARS ago, it is FAR too late.
As far as the improper grammer, I was going to follow up the gutter insult with a critique of your statement but i was drunk dictating to drinking friend. Sometimes people jump the gun :D
Unity was destroyed in the 60's and the 70's with the "diversification" of rights, i.e. black rights, gay rights, women's rights, etc. Once that happened a really fucked up caste system was created in this country. Kind of like a manic-depressive suicidal schizophrenic designed it.  In a free land, there is no such thing as "black" "gay" "women's" rights. Rights are rights, Plain and simple. I agree, shit sucks and we should change, but with the likes of Alex Jones and Adam Kokesh leading, well...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I will apologize for calling an anonymous somebody a bitch like that, that wasn't cool. But thank you for justifying it with a response ;)
Actually, super kudos, if you really are 23, congrats on not being super jaded. Also, where do stand on Ron Paul now, after the shenanigans of November? I was very active in his campaign until it became clear it was just a sham, but by then it was November, and Romney was the Alt, FML.

       With that attitude nothing happens. And what people need is hope and strength. They need to believe it can be done. Cynicism is good for critique to learn from, but it will get you no where in life. You probably already know that though.

       If your a constitutionalist and publicly signed to it your on a list. A list of terrorists. I know I'm on it, wish I wasn't, at some point you gotta put it away and treat politics like sports, something you may have an opinion on but it doesn't matter. Were not as bad Britain yet but were headed that way. Wait till the drones are up. I know you want ppl to wake up but I've literally spent my life trying to do that. The sheep like sleep, and like a dog they snap and bite if you try to wake them. This is the matrix, and there is no Morpheus, only Agent Smith.

       I was a fan of the Paul campaign as well, but like you have become wise to what it really was, malicious or not. Also, his son rubs me the wrong way in so many ways. But, right now, I cannot say I am a fan of any politician, or politics in general for that matter. I think the time has come for us to shrug off the political and economic system we have clung to for so long and evolve. But that is not the purpose of this post, I wrote this to try and create some semblance of unity among an extremely divided society. We all (almost all anyways) agree that change is long overdue, but where we fail is our inability to work together to dismantle the powers that be, which is the first and most important step. After that, we can figure out through trial and error what works best, but until then we are stuck with what we've got. Also, thanks for turning out to be a reasonable human being. What a pleasant surprise. (Also my DOB is 03/08/1990, so yes I really am 23 haha)

       Ok, Then what has to happen is that we have to start forming a constitution, its 2013, we need an update and refresh. What we should do then is come up with our list of rights and conversely our grievances. Also you have to keep geo-politics in mind, since the 90's the US gov't has done a damn good job of keeping the rabble down. The world is flippin huge and there are a lot of people.

       When was the last time the american people rose up violently against the US government, en masse? I look around and see tens and hundreds of thousands of people marching for all kinds of causes, and being resolutely ignored. The majority of americans want GMOs labeled. Doesn't happen. The majority of Americans want Citizens United repealed. Doesn't happen. The majority of Americans want Marijuana decriminalized. Doesn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no sense in using legal channels to affect change when those legal channels are designed by the people who don't want change to be affected. It is far too easy for some corrupt politician to sneak an amendment into a bill that is sure to pass, and far too difficult for hundreds of thousands of people to set their lives aside to march in protest until it gets overturned. Especially considering that, while their marching against one bill, the sneaky bastards will write two other bills that accomplish the same thing, so that IF we do succeed at getting something repealed, the concession will only be a moot placation anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 2008, when Citizen's United was signed into law, political candidates who spend more money on their campaign win the election over 90% of the time (politifacts checked it). That is far too strong a correlation to deny that money now buys political results. And since 60%+ of this nation's money rests with less than 5% of the populace, they will always be able to buy more political speech than we can. They will always be able to shout more loudly into the microphone than we can. And so they will always get the results that they want, inspite of the majority. That is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a republic, and I will
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       stand for it.
      </p>

       No, it cannot be fixed through legal channels. When the law becomes corrupt, it is our duty to ignore it and re-establish a functioning legal system. This government has gone too far, for too long. It's time for them to go, by any means necessary.
