       This shill is by far the biggest scumbag on reddit. According to his extraordinary shill claim above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto vs. Bowman and Monsanto vs. Schmeiser  did not exist. This is paid shillry at it best on Reddit. People in that thread got automatic downvotes( one of the users got 15 downvotes for correcting him ) This is obvious spreading of lies in that thread by this scumbag. He got tons of  upvotes for that nonesense, and finally he is still remains with two, even though those around him are in the negative for standing up to him!

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Both of these independent Courts were deciding whether Monsanto patents could legally stop a farmer from using saved seeds without the permission of Monsanto:ie, saving gmo seeds and selling them which is against Monsanto 's licensing agreement. Both these farmers were saving and planting gmo seeds the next Season. This is patent infringement according to the Supreme Courts. and is equivalent to copying a seed without paying the creators.

       Which is infringement, according to the law, and goes against any contract with Monsanto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bowman and Schmeiser both knew what they were doing. Both knowingly committed patent infringement.

       Are you fucking retarded? That scumbag claimed that "And Monsanto has never sued anyone for reusing seed, I dare you to show proof of this ridiculous claim"....AND
       <strong>
        My point is that Monsanto has DEFACTO rights to sue farmers for saving seed AND THEY HAVE SUED BOTH BOWMAN AND SCHMEISER FOR IT.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I AM NOT HERE TO DEBATE THE LEGALITIES OF THE COURT'S DECISION, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED PLEASE REFER TO MY ABUNDANT COMMENT HISTORY ON THE SUBJECT OF BOWMAN/SCHMEISER'S CASES.

       No. I refuse to waste time with people like him.I  replied to his comment with a well documented post. If he really was interested in my discussion  he would  bring valid arguments. Obviously claiming that I do not understand the Cases, My Question is what honest person would defend Madleper's comment? It is an obvious lie.

      <p>
       I would never spread a lie about Monsanto. I always check my facts. I always use original case evidence when discussing Monsanto legal cases. I wish others would have the same intentions.

       What YouthInRevolt did is a standard shill tactic.  Play stupid, calmly, then character assassinate you - works with redditors all the time by claiming your making the movement look bad.  He gets under your skin.  Look at his name dude: "YouthInRevolt."  Please, if that's not a paid shill trying so hard to appear authentic, I don't know what is.

       No, no. Monsanto's  campaign on Reddit has successfully ruined their image. in other words The Streisand effect is taking care of our Monsanto pest problem. The more shit and lies they spew the more we get a chance to counter their claims and  Make people aware of their business practices and their Strong hold on the Courts and on the Legislative body of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have to do is flood Reddit  with the  truth, Keep posting from their website where they expose their own  Tyranny on farmers. After awhile we will have made them so "un-credible" and pathetic. Hence the  Reddit Streisand effect.... works every time.

       If "not"saving seed was so common among farmers and only practiced by "hobby" farmers why would they include it in their licensing agreements? The answer is simple. it is the most common thing for the last Thousands of years. It is the basic process of all farming hobby or not. Monsanto knew this, and that's why they got the Patents and that's why they made it a point go after small farmers like Schmieser in the Courts.  Gary Rinehart's case is proof that Monsanto not only stalks tiny farmers But that they use sleazy litigation threats to intimidate farmers.

       What if occupy got involved and started posting comments and investigating/correcting misconceptions?  What about "We are legion"?  If the number of good people outnumber the bad by at least 50 to 1, then gaming the system would not be cost effective.

       I talked with an Iowa farmer visiting the Big Isle Hawaii on vacation. He said it cost him only a couple of $1000 dollars to replant with Monsato. Cheaper than reusing. I said okay I can see it now, but what happens if the dollar goes into hyper inflation or monsato has a monopoly and inflates the price 600%  and you can no longer afford to pay for the seeds. He said he will just close the farm.

       I see now, it always seems to be that way in the food business to never fix the problem but instead let someone else deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at beef for example, lets feed em corn to beef them up more but than they are more susceptible to ecoli so lets not right? Wrong lets just process the shit out of the beef and sparge it with ammonia till it's safe to eat.

       Have you guys ever considered that these people are just very confident in expressing opinions on things they have no idea what they are talking about, and not of part some vast conspiracy hiring people to infiltrate an internet forum?

       it's a two month old account in question that since it's inception has been hardline "pro-GMO".  If that isn't fishy as fuck when you take into account the sheer volume of profiles like this that have been popping up recently, then I don't know what is.

       I'm just here to play devil's advocate to clean up the debate-killing shill name-calling in this sub. There's no way to prove whether someone is paid to say something on the internet, so why bother throwing out the accusation? It's used to dismiss the person's argument as invalid, not to support your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't invalidate your argument if I accuse you of shilling for anti-GMO groups, so why would it work the other way around? Just argue facts, not things you can't prove.

       That isn't going to help you in your crusade.  It's good to see counter points of view, but just be polite when presenting them.  Comments like that do nothing positive.  And I have been fairly open that this is all speculation regarding who is/isn't a "shill"

       $4 million from Monsanto alone!  Is it really that far fetched of an idea that there are paid redditors to side with GMOs?  That's what I've been trying to stress here.  It's more likely there are tons of shills for

       I know it happens. I'm not saying it doesn't. But it seems like anyone on this subreddit with a differing or unpopular opinion is automatically labled a shill. I do not like monsanto. They're fucking over farmers across the globe and messing with our food. But when people say the study that links GMO's to cancer hasn't been replicated and isn't accepted by a large group of scientists, people on here jump all over them and accuse them of working for Monsanto. It's just silly.

       Thats because they make claims that aren't substantiated with real evidence.  The rat study was a big deal, and who wrote the only real counter argument to it that is propagated by the "shills" left and right?

       I agree that people call people shills all the time here without a good reason why, and that is silly when it is an obviously established user who posts all over the place.  But discounting the accuser based on that alone will lead you to miss some really important stuff on occasion.  Hell if the Olive Garden can/did do it.  Why wouldn't Monsanto hire a few goons to do the same?  Even if they are legitimate "scientists".  The cost would be a drop in the bucket to them.  And when their control over the worlds food supply is at stake, it shouldn't be too "silly" of an action to call the out.

       I understand that there are shills all over the internet now, but I have to wonder if this is really a productive pursuit to keep calling them out.  Most of the people here know what is going on, and most of those who don't would not care anyways.  I don't know why anyone would pay a moment's notice to voting anymore, honestly.

       voting doesn't matter, but if it is used to mask the truth. It becomes a problem for us. How long we let scumbag people mask  the truth and let them spread lies until Social media platform is dead ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Truth is worth standing up for. I don't want Shills to spread that Monsanto does not sue farmers for saving seed. That would be an injustice to those who have taken their pains to the Supreme  Court and lost. An injustice to Bowman who paid 89,000 for saving Monsanto seeds.

       No, no they don't know what's going on.  Anything skeptical of GMOs, simply asking questions, or presenting facts and links that are anti-Monsanto and anti-GMO get downvoted to oblivion with NO reason given other than that it contradicts some well spoken shill who gives the typical "GMOs are god's grace and will save the world, but Monsanto can just have bad business practices,"
