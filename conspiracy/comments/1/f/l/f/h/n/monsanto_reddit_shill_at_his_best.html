<p>Monsanto vs. Bowman and Monsanto vs. Schmeiser  did not exist. This is paid shillry at it best on Reddit. People in that thread got automatic downvotes( one of the users got 15 downvotes for correcting him ) This is obvious spreading of lies in that thread by this scumbag. He got tons of  upvotes for that nonesense, and finally he is still remains with two, even though those around him are in the negative for standing up to him!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Patents — Infringement — Patent disclosing genetically modified genes and cells which, when inserted into plants, increased tolerance to glyphosate herbicides — Agricultural production of canola containing patented cell and gene without obtaining licence or permission — Whether patent infringed — Meaning of word “use” in s. 42 of Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of these independent Courts were deciding whether Monsanto patents could legally stop a farmer from using saved seeds without the permission of Monsanto:ie, saving gmo seeds and selling them which is against Monsanto &#39;s licensing agreement. Both these farmers were saving and planting gmo seeds the next Season. This is patent infringement according to the Supreme Courts. and is equivalent to copying a seed without paying the creators.</p>

<p>So what was your point exactly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, no. Monsanto&#39;s  campaign on Reddit has successfully ruined their image. in other words The Streisand effect is taking care of our Monsanto pest problem. The more shit and lies they spew the more we get a chance to counter their claims and  Make people aware of their business practices and their Strong hold on the Courts and on the Legislative body of the US. </p>

<p>All we have to do is flood Reddit  with the  truth, Keep posting from their website where they expose their own  Tyranny on farmers. After awhile we will have made them so &quot;un-credible&quot; and pathetic. Hence the  Reddit Streisand effect.... works every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If &quot;not&quot;saving seed was so common among farmers and only practiced by &quot;hobby&quot; farmers why would they include it in their licensing agreements? The answer is simple. it is the most common thing for the last Thousands of years. It is the basic process of all farming hobby or not. Monsanto knew this, and that&#39;s why they got the Patents and that&#39;s why they made it a point go after small farmers like Schmieser in the Courts.  Gary Rinehart&#39;s case is proof that Monsanto not only stalks tiny farmers But that they use sleazy litigation threats to intimidate farmers.</p>

I said okay I can see it now, but what happens if the dollar goes into hyper inflation or monsato has a monopoly and inflates the price 600%  and you can no longer afford to pay for the seeds.

<p>That isn&#39;t going to help you in your crusade.  It&#39;s good to see counter points of view, but just be polite when presenting them.  Comments like that do nothing positive.  And I have been fairly open that this is all speculation regarding who is/isn&#39;t a &quot;shill&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I see where you are going, but &quot;anti-GMO&quot; groups are for the most part grass roots and would never have the resources to hire social media manipulators and such.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rodale.com/gmo-labeling-california">Case and point: $25 million was donated to keep GMO labeling OFF of food in CA</a></p>

<p>$4 million from Monsanto alone!  Is it really that far fetched of an idea that there are paid redditors to side with GMOs?  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to stress here.

I do not like monsanto. They&#39;re fucking over farmers across the globe and messing with our food. But when people say the study that links GMO&#39;s to cancer hasn&#39;t been replicated and isn&#39;t accepted by a large group of scientists, people on here jump all over them and accuse them of working for Monsanto.

    <div class="md"><p>Thats because they make claims that aren&#39;t substantiated with real evidence.  The rat study was a big deal, and who wrote the only real counter argument to it that is propagated by the &quot;shills&quot; left and right?</p>

<p><em>Why a Monsanto shell corporation of course</em>.  I am looking for the thread that backs this up at the moment.  If I am mistaken I will alter this comment</p>

<p>I agree that people call people shills all the time here without a good reason why, and that is silly when it is an obviously established user who posts all over the place.  But discounting the accuser based on that alone will lead you to miss some really important stuff on occasion.  Hell if the Olive Garden can/did do it.  Why wouldn&#39;t Monsanto hire a few goons to do the same?  Even if they are legitimate &quot;scientists&quot;.  The cost would be a drop in the bucket to them.  And when their control over the worlds food supply is at stake, it shouldn&#39;t be too &quot;silly&quot; of an action to call the out.</p>
