       The movie's premise will capture a lot of people's imagination, but in doing so it reinforces the lesson that humans need authority by implying that "laws" actually prevent people from visiting violence upon one another. It is a lesson we learn from the very beginning, if not from our parent's, then from the years in the compulsory government educational system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Purge simply serves as supporting propaganda to those who have somehow missed all the other "lessons" prevalent in our authoritarian, sociopathic driven civilization.

       I can't speak for any of you, but I don't wake up every morning and say to myself,
       <em>
        "Gosh darnit, I'd sure like to murder and steal from my neighbors, but there are laws against that so I can't."
       </em>
      </p>
      <h2>
       Here's a news flash: most human beings are cooperative creatures who dislike violence and injustice, laws do not make them "virtuous" because people are already so by nature.
      </h2>
      <p>
       The 1-4% of the sociopathic elements of the human population are the exception to that norm and supposedly the laws are meant to deter them; but they are not deterred. Worse yet, the sociopaths gain

       </a>
       and use violence to achieve their ends under the cover of "law".

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Imagine - if you can - not having a conscience, none at all, no feelings of guilt or remorse no matter what you do, no limiting sense of concern for the well-being of strangers, friends, or even family members. Imagine no struggles with shame, not a single one in your whole life, no matter what kind of selfish, lazy, harmful, or immoral action you had taken.
       </p>
       <p>
        And pretend that the concept of responsibility is unknown to you, except as a burden others seem to accept without question, like gullible fools.
Now add to this strange fantasy the ability to conceal from other people that your psychological makeup is radically different from theirs. Since everyone simply assumes that conscience is universal among human beings, hiding the fact that you are conscience-free is nearly effortless.
       </p>
       <p>
        You are not held back from any of your desires by guilt or shame, and you are never confronted by others for your cold-bloodedness. The ice water in your veins is so bizarre, so completely outside of their personal experience, that they seldom even guess at your condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        In other words, you are completely free of internal restraints, and your unhampered liberty to do just as you please, with no pangs of conscience, is conveniently invisible to the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can do anything at all, and still your strange advantage over the majority of people, who are kept in line by their consciences will most likely remain undiscovered.
       </p>
       <p>
        How will you live your life?
       </p>
       <p>
        What will you do with your huge and secret advantage, and with the corresponding handicap of other people (conscience)?
       </p>
       <p>
        The answer will depend largely on just what your desires happen to be, because people are not all the same. Even the profoundly unscrupulous are not all the same. Some people - whether they have a conscience or not - favor the ease of inertia, while others are filled with dreams and wild ambitions. Some human beings are brilliant and talented, some are dull-witted, and most, conscience or not, are somewhere in between. There are violent people and nonviolent ones, individuals who are motivated by blood lust and those who have no such appetites. [...]
       </p>
       <p>
        Provided you are not forcibly stopped, you can do anything at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are born at the right time, with some access to family fortune, and you have a special talent for whipping up other people's hatred and sense of deprivation, you can arrange to kill large numbers of unsuspecting people. With enough money, you can accomplish this from far away, and you can sit back safely and watch in satisfaction. [...]
       </p>
       <p>
        Crazy and frightening - and real, in about 4 percent of the population....
       </p>
       <p>
        The prevalence rate for anorexic eating disorders is estimated a 3.43 percent, deemed to be nearly epidemic, and yet this figure is a fraction lower than the rate for antisocial personality. The high-profile disorders classed as schizophrenia occur in only about 1 percent of [the population] - a mere quarter of the rate of antisocial personality - and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that the rate of colon cancer in the United States, considered "alarmingly high," is about 40 per 100,000 - one hundred times lower than the rate of antisocial personality.
The high incidence of sociopathy in human society has a profound effect on the rest of us who must live on this planet, too, even those of us who have not been clinically traumatized. The individuals who constitute this 4 percent drain our relationships, our bank accounts, our accomplishments, our self-esteem, our very peace on earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet surprisingly, many people know nothing about this disorder, or if they do, they think only in terms of violent psychopathy - murderers, serial killers, mass murderers - people who have conspicuously broken the law many times over, and who, if caught, will be imprisoned, maybe even put to death by our legal system.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are not commonly aware of, nor do we usually identify, the larger number of nonviolent sociopaths among us, people who often are not blatant lawbreakers, and against whom our formal legal system provides little defense.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of us would not imagine any correspondence between conceiving an ethnic genocide and, say, guiltlessly lying to one's boss about a coworker. But the psychological correspondence is not only there; it is chilling. Simple and profound, the link is the absence of the inner mechanism that beats up on us, emotionally speaking, when we make a choice we view as immoral, unethical, neglectful, or selfish.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of us feel mildly guilty if we eat the last piece of cake in the kitchen, let alone what we would feel if we intentionally and methodically set about to hurt another person.
Those who have no conscience at all are a group unto themselves, whether they be homicidal tyrants or merely ruthless social snipers.
The presence or absence of conscience is a deep human division, arguably more significant than intelligence, race, or even gender.
       </p>
       <p>
        What differentiates a sociopath who lives off the labors of others from one who occasionally robs convenience stores, or from one who is a contemporary robber baron - or what makes the difference between an ordinary bully and a sociopathic murderer - is nothing more than social status, drive, intellect, blood lust, or simple opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        What distinguishes all of these people from the rest of us is an utterly empty hole in the psyche, where there should be the most evolved of all humanizing functions.

       <del>
        mentally disturbed
       </del>
       traumatized me and I was totally screwed over and confused.  Within some weeks I stumbled on a description of a sociopath and I suddenly knew what had happened to me so I pursued the subject.  Basically I have some street smarts now that suburbs didn't prepare me for at all.

       People are social animals, just looking to history at all the many things that were once deemed acceptable by society in those times, you can see how even "nice" people can get caught up in the madness.

       You know what - I had a thought very similar to this on my way home just an hour ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought about how most people would not want to do violence. Most people would hunker down and wait it out. The only people who would actually go out and do bad things would be the psychopaths. And that's only because they are the reason we have laws. The average person wouldn't think to steal, rape or murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       This movie seems like it's trying to convince us that we're the bad ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, have an upvote. It's not much, but it's all I got.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers

       I think at the heart of every conspiracy you will find a bunch of pycho/sociopathic people who have rose or are attempting to rise to the top of the political power structures in the same manner as they have throughout history.

       Maybe relevant, your post reminded me of this video about
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7xt5LtgsxQ">
        morality without religion
       </a>
       . Has some good pointers about society not needing religion to keep people in line.

       I personally don't believe in ultimate right-or-wrongs. (You know, the kind people obsess with in Hollywood movies, or the portrayal of the sociopath in The Purge.). There is a grey balanced area with tipping points. So I agree on the not-wanting-to-kill-neighbours-when-waking-up thing you said. Actually doing it, is one of those things that tip the scale.

       I agree with what you are stating; simply put,
       <em>
        violence begets violence
       </em>
       , and that doesn't require one to be religious to recognize. This also makes it rather easy for the sociopaths to initiate a violent act to perpetuate longer conflicts where normally non-violent people will participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Violence in some for is necessary to live: we eat animals, we have to defend ourselves when attacked. Violence has a purpose and isn't "evil" in and of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference being in whether one uses aggression to achieve almost every goal even when cooperation would be easier.

      <h2>
       Concerning how we deal with the idea of "evil" and how normal people can participate in evil acts:
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In literature and film, evil is romanticized; portrayed as mysterious, yet beautiful; dark, yet conflicted. There is always a heart of gold beneath a cold-blooded exterior.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Hollywood psychopath, rarely depicted accurately, evokes both our disgust and our sympathy; war heroes slaughter their enemies ruthlessly, yet live loving lives as husbands and fathers. If the villain did not have a rough childhood, or does not show any signs of a struggle of conscience, he is seen as "two-dimensional" and "unrealistic".
Leading social scientists and psychologists promote a similarly narrow view of evil, dealing only with its social and moral aspects. In other words, they study effects; not causes.
       </p>
       <p>
        One such researcher argues that,
        <em>
         "most evil is the product of rather ordinary people caught up in unusual circumstances that they are not equipped to cope with in the normal ways that have worked in the past to escape, avoid or challenge them, while they are being recruited, seduced, initiated into evil by persuasive authorities or compelling peer pressure."
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        According to this researcher, the line of distinction between a sadistic torturer at Abu Ghraib, and a non-violent peace activist is simply one of chance.
These somewhat naive views on evil are not entirely wrong. Movies can accurately portray psychotic, or even psychopathic, serial murderers; the common view of evil can accept that human frailties and ambitions often degenerate into bloodthirsty madness. However, both of these views demonstrate a complete ignorance of the causal role of psychopathology (especially essential psychopathy) in the genesis of evil, or ponerogenesis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Film ignores an analysis of the psychopathic parent that creates the traumatized child; social sciences ignore the influence of psychopathy on the minds of normal humans and the specific processes that give rise to ignoring one's conscience.
More so, the common view of evil still partly justifies the blood-stained solutions of past, present, and future politicians.
       </p>
       <p>
        In such a way is the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the firebombing of Dresden, to the present day occupation of Iraq and Palestine justified. And without an understanding of the role of psychopathy, any attempt to objectively evaluate such symptoms of macrosocial evil, no matter how accurate, can be co-opted by spellbinders. (Deviants function as leaders and ideological
        <strong>
         spellbinders
        </strong>
        , and while normal people may act as members, they have typically accumulated various psychological deficiencies. Also, opposition from normal people is stifled, via the mass use of spellbinding, censorship, and physical compulsion. )
       </p>
       <p>
        In such a way, a partial truth can be used as justification and as a rallying point for further destruction.
       </p>

       I don't agree that you need to have a conscience or feel shame to be a good person. I don't, but I don't go out of my way to screw anyone over either. In fact, I like to help people if they're truly vulnerable. So we're clear, I don't consider myself a socio/psychopath. My emotions are muted due to some childhood traumas, more PTSD than anything.

       By your description, you aren't a sociopath but one whose emotional life has been
       <em>
        muted
       </em>
       by your childhood experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is often how people cope with bad prolonged situations; this can be seen in victims of abuse, survivors of war, torture victims, prisoners and people with similar experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       The degree and scope varies but the characteristics are depression which bring about flat emotional states, lack of interest in the emotions of others, etc. It certainly doesn't mean one is "evil", just still in deep pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pain that can eventually in time subside and allow for life to flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despondent personalities and the walking wounded are what sociopaths produce in their wake as they move through people's lives.

       You have a conscience.  You feel shame.  It's just not in the same way that you would
       <em>
        without

       the traumas you experienced.  They've shifted.  They're definitely there, however, and still guide and influence your life and actions.  That's part of what keeps you from going out of your way to screw anyone over even w/the traumas that you have.

       My point is that negative reinforcers such as shame and guilt do not guide my behavior. My behavior is guided by positive reinforcement b/c I feel good about myself when I do good for others. It's sort of what the OP is saying. I'm not held back by a conscience or shame, but it doesn't mean b/c of that, I seek personal gain through manipulation or fucking people over. The truthy truth is that if you don't have a conscience or guilt that doesn't instantly mean you are going to be a sociopath.

       The Stanford prison experiment had major flaws. It should not be taken as definitive in any way. The fact that laymen are taught that it is the Truth just goes to show that people are more interested in the narrative that we are generally bad than good science.

       The Stanford prison experiment had major flaws. It should not be taken as definitive in any way. The fact that laymen are taught that it is the Truth just goes to show that people are more interested in the narrative that we are generally bad than good science.

       highlights:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Most of the Stanford guards did not exhibit any cruel or unusual behavior, often being friendly and doing favors for the prisoners.
       </p>
       <p>
        Zimbardo himself was also criticized for actively participating in the experiment as one of the characters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Zimbardo neglected the effect of individual personalities, instead generally attributing all behavior to the prison environment
       </p>

       You are not Dwight Schrute, nor do you have to be him.  You are you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway:  All attempts to replicate the same results of this experiment, that were not run by Zimbardo himself, have failed to do so.
