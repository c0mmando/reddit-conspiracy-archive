       To me this guy doesn't fit the role. I have heard he was a dentist, who inherited power.  He looks like someone who would be on Monty Python. An Englishman. And he carrys himself with that level of sophistication.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew a guy who was Syrian in heritage, and he went to Syria to visit. He came back. He was somewhat crestfallen, he didn't really like the people. He said they were crude and primitive, the men had primitive attitudes.  I could imagine likening what he described to what my Indian friends call "tribal" people in their culture, and understand why he was glad to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Assad seems likes reasonable businessman. Wasn't his wife on larry king? Seems out of place for him to be dragged into all this military action.  Can't they just reason with these people?  I would see them choosing to sell out to preserve their comfortable lifestyle, rather than being dragged out of a rathole and hung like Saddam or Ghadaffi.

       Most dictators don't look like dictators in their state-sponsored photo ops. And some just don't look the part at all. I mean, look at Kim Jong-Un. He looks like a teenager with Downs.

       Plus those fake-democracy western nations have their own track record of attacks, massacres, and bombings on civilians.

       It's annoying that the biggest question in my mind when I hear of protests and rebellions is, "Which side is the CIA supporting?"

       Assad's wife blows millions on furniture while Syrians starve to death. Yeah, just because he looks "sophisticated" (he actually looks like an inbred clown) doesn't mean he is not a cold blooded killer.

       Ha! That's rich. The kid thinks i'm being paid. I'm not defending anyone's honour, i'm merely pointing out your lack thereof. It's ironic that you even mention honour, i'm willing to bet you've never had a shred of it in your entire miserable life.

       And 'shitbirth'? Really?
I see you're not even going to try to hide the fact that you're only 12 years old. Why don't you run along to the local park and get some sun while the real intellectuals discuss matters of importance.

       I also found it hilarious that you chose to completely ignore my reply and it is so very safe to assume that it was because I struck a nerve and you were much too dull-witted to form any sort of witty rebuke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead you chose to point out the one time I used foul language as if that was going to give you any sort of real leverage.
Well guess what, it won't. You've managed to include a line of absolute filth in every response you've given me and people won't look past that. You are an inbred oaf and your ignorance and foul attitude will bring you down forever.

       Nothing's funnier than the part where you realized you just made a huge fucking mistake by using "foul language" and then started typing with big words and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simplest fact remains, that you tried to foulmouth a stranger for voicing an opinion, and instead received a verbal beating that left you raw.

       I guess you must be feeling like your mother's anus every time she visits the rebel barracks in Syria.

       Assad's fate will be even harsher than Gaddafi's, and I'll enjoy watching it on youtube.

       I like how you think i'm trying to cover up. There was no realisation, I knew I used foul language and stand by it. What's even funnier is the fact that you think I used 'big words'. Silly child, those words are less than a fraction of any learned man's vocabulary, but you wouldn't know anything about learned men now would you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real fact remains that you are overly confident in your poor effort to best me in intellectual combat (if you will) and are clearly resentful that I managed to knock you completely off the fence with a single comment. I'll let you in on a little something, your opinion is worthless because the man behind it is worthless.

       What do you think the United States' Presidents, Senators, Congressman, do with their money?  Give it to homeless vets who can't possibly find work?  Nope.  They buy expensive "furniture" :)

       In some ways, yes, because at the end of the day, the Presidents don't really "serve" us.  We can't tell them what to do, and they have their own agendas.  I'm not saying every President is corrupt, but there are such Presidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's a known fact that, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter who we vote for, the electoral college will select who they see fit.  And there have been many voting scandals related to Presidency.

       Alright, so your point is that since most presidents are dictators in disguise... Assad's not that bad by comparisson? Something like that?

       I don't really get it, sorry.

       I don't disagree with your view on western presidents btw, I just don't see how it clears this particular asshole of wrong doing.

       No, I'm not saying anything about Assad, I don't know the guy and I'm sure you know more about him than I.  I just don't dig how we're all up in other countries' business, when we have massive issues with our political systems.  Until we fix our shitty situation(s), I feel we need to keep our involvement elsewhere to a minimum.
