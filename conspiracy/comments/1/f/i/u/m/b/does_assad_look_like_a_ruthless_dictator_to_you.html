        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To me this guy doesn&#39;t fit the role. I have heard he was a dentist, who inherited power.  He looks like someone who would be on Monty Python. An Englishman. And he carrys himself with that level of sophistication.  </p>

<p>I knew a guy who was Syrian in heritage, and he went to Syria to visit. He came back. He was somewhat crestfallen, he didn&#39;t really like the people. He said they were crude and primitive, the men had primitive attitudes.  I could imagine likening what he described to what my Indian friends call &quot;tribal&quot; people in their culture, and understand why he was glad to leave. </p>

<p>But Assad seems likes reasonable businessman. Wasn&#39;t his wife on larry king? Seems out of place for him to be dragged into all this military action.  Can&#39;t they just reason with these people?  I would see them choosing to sell out to preserve their comfortable lifestyle, rather than being dragged out of a rathole and hung like Saddam or Ghadaffi. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing&#39;s funnier than the part where you realized you just made a huge fucking mistake by using &quot;foul language&quot; and then started typing with big words and stuff.</p>

<p>The simplest fact remains, that you tried to foulmouth a stranger for voicing an opinion, and instead received a verbal beating that left you raw.</p>

<p>I guess you must be feeling like your mother&#39;s anus every time she visits the rebel barracks in Syria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you think i&#39;m trying to cover up. There was no realisation, I knew I used foul language and stand by it. What&#39;s even funnier is the fact that you think I used &#39;big words&#39;. Silly child, those words are less than a fraction of any learned man&#39;s vocabulary, but you wouldn&#39;t know anything about learned men now would you.</p>

<p>The real fact remains that you are overly confident in your poor effort to best me in intellectual combat (if you will) and are clearly resentful that I managed to knock you completely off the fence with a single comment. I&#39;ll let you in on a little something, your opinion is worthless because the man behind it is worthless.</p>
