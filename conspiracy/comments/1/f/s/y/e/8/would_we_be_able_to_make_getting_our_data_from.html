<p>I say all of us band together class-action style and show them just how many people they&#39;re fucking with here.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a possibility of a class-action suit as well, but that isn&#39;t exactly my main concern right now, my main concern is getting the data that Verizon is trying oh so hard to keep from me, as I know most of you guys are too.</p>

<p>Does anybody know how we could start something like this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome, hopefully this goes somewhere. They obviously don&#39;t want us to have something in those files if they&#39;re making it so hard to obtain.  </p>

<p>I want to know why is it that in the TED talk that was linked in one of the other threads about this that the guy was able to just get a disk with all the data so easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I really want to know is how the hell it&#39;s illegal for them to give you <em>your own information.</em> I mean, technically doesn&#39;t it require your permission? Well, if you&#39;re the one making the request...
Verizon not cooperating with customers who are requesting their own information is a ton of fucking bullshit.</p>

<p>I really wish we hadn&#39;t just renewed our contract with them.</p>

<p>Not that I have anything to hide from the government, but I&#39;d really rather not have them spying on me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I asked them, they just refused to say anything else on the subject.  When I asked for a supervisor and the guy denied it to me because I wouldn&#39;t give him another reason why I wanted to talk to one I told him he needs to go get a court order to find out why I want to talk to his supervisor.</p>
