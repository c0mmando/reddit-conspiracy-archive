    <div class="md"><p>What?  We&#39;ve had NOTHING <em>BUT</em> the right catalysts.  It&#39;s just that, as Wired said, this generation has gone totally limp and soft.  We&#39;ve had the right catalysts staring us in the face for YEARS now.  What are we expecting? for Obama to set up a press conference and in that press conference grab a little white baby and bite its head off on television for everybody to see?</p>

<p>Is that what we&#39;re waiting for?  Will THAT be the &quot;great catalyst&quot; that lets us know &quot;Okay.  <em>NOW</em> shit just got real and we can revolt.&quot;?</p>

<p>Na.  We&#39;re not waiting for a &quot;right catalyst&quot;.  Don&#39;t tell yourself that.  We&#39;ve just become soft ass bitches is what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We <em>NEED</em> to pull a Turkey. These events may be enough to set our community over the edge, but the rest of america is soft, just like you said. Once they start shooting protesters in the street, that&#39;s when its time to start legitimately fighting back., i believe that will be the only time the majority of Americans will wake up to what is really happening around them. Unfortunately, any resistance towards our government will be labeled as terrorism,  and america <em>eats that shit up</em>.</p>

<p>Found it.  There are <em>some</em> ideas <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1flvo3/time_for_a_revolution_has_come_repost_from/cabiap3">here</a>.  Only some, however.  I imagine there are much more than this though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s likely more accurate, unfortunately.  The time is <em>now</em> if we&#39;re going to do anything, and I don&#39;t think too many of us are in too much of a hurry to hit the streets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not pointing any fingers at anyone that I&#39;m not pointing at myself, mind you.  I&#39;m just acknowledging what is in fact that case.  I do what I can to an extent.  I&#39;ve put up videos designed to get people to think about the structure of the world that we&#39;ve been indoctrinated to take for granted and question it.  I&#39;ve marched in OWS demonstrations.  I took part in the March Against Monsanto demonstrations.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not like I&#39;m getting all Christopher Dorner on TPTB...and, quite frankly, I think that <em>everyone</em> has to take on more of a Christopher Dorner type mentality before things really change and get better.  THAT&#39;S what will change things:  When we&#39;re all willing to simply go out in the streets, take action, and simply not be willing to take no for an answer.  Things will change when having our tvs or our Baywatch and Jersey Shore taken away will not be a big enough deterrent to keep us from banding together and moving forward against the system.  Things will change when, like Dorner, we fear the encroachment of the shitty state and the shitty system more than we fear death itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  That&#39;s pretty much exactly right.  Sedated chemically w/regard to the food and drink we&#39;re given.  Sedated psychologically regarding the schooling and MSM tripe we&#39;re fed constantly.  Bombarded with sedating things that make us too lazy to get up and work and fight.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been spoiled.  We&#39;re the fat, lazy, spoiled 9-12 year old kid that does nothing and laughs at the other kids&#39; problems while the popsicle he&#39;s been eating drips its sickly sweet sugar all over his face and hands and he watches everybody else go hungry and fight for their rights.  Meanwhile he&#39;s getting a cage built around him that he&#39;s too spoiled and fat and lazy to even realize, and by the time that he DOES realize it, he&#39;s been rendered so apathetic to his surroundings by the food and soda pop he&#39;s been (purposefully) spoiled and fattened with that he doesn&#39;t even CARE that he&#39;s been caged.</p>

<p>So at that point, he just farts and then goes to sleep in his newly built cage that he&#39;ll spend the rest of his fat, shitty, God-forsaken life in while the tv continues playing the latest episode of Jersey Shore in the background.</p>

<p>The end.</p>

<p>Bullshit, bro.  Again, fucking stop telling yourself that.  If <em>that&#39;s</em> the catalyst you&#39;re waiting for, then you might as well just man up and say what <em>I&#39;m</em> saying - which is that we&#39;re just talking shit and are too scared to do anything...cuz you and I both know that what you&#39;re waiting for here is very likely NOT ever going to happen.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t talk about OWS because OWS had it&#39;s chance and it got SQUASHED AND KILLED.  It got bombarded by covert operations and the sheep watching what has going on got convinced that it wasn&#39;t anything but a bunch of homeless bums complaining without saying anything - all of which is absolutely FALSE, but it still effectively killed the movement.</p>

<p>So what was that about OWS?  OWS is <em>dead</em>.</p>

<p>I marched in OWS.  I supported it then and still support it now.  Not only that, but I also support YOU and your thinking that something COULD get done, but, in supporting you, I&#39;m also not going to just be a yes man and say &quot;Yeah!  You&#39;re right!&quot; if you&#39;re saying something I think is not correct.</p>

<p>And your saying that we&#39;re waiting for the televised OWS catastrophe to happen is like saying &quot;We&#39;ll rise up and revolt the second Obama starts biting off little white baby heads in front of a live studio audience!&quot;</p>

<p>We all know that shit ain&#39;t gonna happen, so why even <em>state</em> that that&#39;s what you&#39;re waiting for?</p>

<p>You&#39;re waiting for something you <em>know</em> isn&#39;t going to happen so you can always have an excuse to NOT ACT.  It&#39;s a safety mechanism so you (we) can save face.  It&#39;s a cop out is what it is.</p>

<p>Again, we&#39;re bitches, my man.  Turkey, Bahrain, etc...those cats aren&#39;t as yellow as we are in America.  In America?  Yeah.  We&#39;re bitches.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That will be the catalyst is when multiple protesters or figures are dying in our streets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;ll be too late by then, brother.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Again, this isn&#39;t an attack on <em>you</em> per se.  I know I used strong words, but I just don&#39;t want us thinking that &quot;We&#39;ll <em>really</em> start fighting when &#39;1, 2, 3&#39; happens!&quot; cuz that&#39;s just setting ourselves up for continued failure and that&#39;s not going to help us get out of this national shit hole we&#39;re digging deeper and deeper for ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably the correct answer.  They&#39;re probably getting their PR people to write responses, test them on focus groups, etc. so they have an actual response rather than their customer support being utterly unprepared.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no secret that when you call any company&#39;s customer support, the person on the other side of the call is just reading prompts off a computer screen and isn&#39;t allowed to deviate. </p>

<p>A huge influx of calls about an issue that isn&#39;t on the flowchart would increase call turnover time and could be a nightmare.  People calling in for other support issues would experience much longer wait periods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not &quot;any&quot; company. Some - even big ISPs - don&#39;t script everything. Believe me, I know for certain. However, in a case like this, it might also be that their phone lines for overloaded, rather than being taken down. That, I don&#39;t know but I&#39;ve witnessed it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I was talking to a person in another thread who called in on the phone. They were trying to get the data about themselves that Verizon released to NSA.</p>

<p>He said the Verizon Rep told him the only way he could get that info is with a court order and that a FOIA would not work. </p>

<p>Just wanted to fill ya in on what I have seen in other instances with this story.</p>
