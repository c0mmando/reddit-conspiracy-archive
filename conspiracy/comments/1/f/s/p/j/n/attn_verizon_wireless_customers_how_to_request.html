    <div class="md"><p>After talking to THREE, Verizon Wireless representatives, the only response from them concerning obtaining metadata on YOUR LINE is that you can ONLY obtain a copy of it with a federal court order.</p>

<p>They also DENIED that there is any GPS data stored in it, but wouldn&#39;t tell me what IS stored in it.</p>

<p>They also claim that their contract states that they will comply with any legal process, and because of that this isn&#39;t breaking the contract they have with customers even though the contract specifically states they won&#39;t give out any of your data to any third parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember when the FCC required all cell phones to be E911 capable back around 2003?  If you had a non E911 phone by the cutoff date, they provided you with one for no additional charge.  This is so that emergency services could locate you when you call 911.  If emergency services can locate you with this service, GPS is moot!</p>

<p>Wonder if the NSA will actually be sending back the data to those who request it.</p>

<p>Asking for another manager.</p>

<p>edit: Now being told that I CANNOT speak to another supervisor because I can&#39;t do anything without a federal court order. I&#39;m just repeating myself that I&#39;d like to speak to a supervisor concerning my account, and he&#39;s still refusing to transfer me. He claims it &quot;is not going to happen&quot; and that if I don&#39;t ask him something new he will terminate the call. He also refuses to give me his employee ID and says if I want to complain I have to do so on the website, and refused to acknowledge that I cannot file a complaint about him without his ID.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She really wasn&#39;t. As soon as I mentioned WHY I was actually calling (how to obtain the metadata) she got just as vague as everyone else. I asked what I need to do to obtain it and she said I can&#39;t, so I said &quot;I can&#39;t obtain data that was gathered about me, from my cell phone, and is specifically about me?&quot; went on about 4th amendment\FOIA etc. which is when she said they will only give the information out to somebody with a federal court order, so in order to obtain it I would have to go to a courthouse and get a court order for my data about me gathered from my phone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m getting the feeling EVERY company is going to be doing it soon enough. Even with burners, if they have access to the calls there&#39;s surely a way to figure out who&#39;s voice it is. Obviously they aren&#39;t just going to be sitting there figuring out who every single off contract phone belongs to, but having one doesn&#39;t make you any less susceptible as far as I care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The online chat is still down. I dialed *611 from my phone and it told me the wait\hold times were unusually high and they recommended I went online, but I was talking to somebody in under 5 minutes.</p>

<p>However everybody I talked to says they can&#39;t say anything other than that address and that they&#39;re giving the data out when it&#39;s requested, not just giving it all out at once.</p>
