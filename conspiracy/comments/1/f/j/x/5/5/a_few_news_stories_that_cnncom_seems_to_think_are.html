    <div class="md"><p>And the system of oppression is designed to keep it that way. Always taking liberties in small increments, or after some horrific event that serves as a catalyst. They will never willingly give us a galvanizing circumstance that turns the bulk of the people against them. We will have to create it. </p>

<p>I do <em>not</em> recommend that you thoroughly research some entities and locations where GMOs are being grown and inserted into the food supply without being labeled, and I do <em>not</em> recommend that you burn them to the ground. Clearly, the disapproval of poorly tested, unlabeled GMOs by the overwhelming majority of the people is causing all kinds of labeling laws and stringent testing regulations to be ennacted. The proper legal channels for those changes are obviously working perfectly, and will continue to. </p>

<p>I also do <em>not</em> recommend thoroughly researching corporations and other entities known to be avoiding their share of the tax burden (apple) and using public welfare programs to avoid paying their employees a living wage (walmart), or causing numerous, documented environmental catasrophes and then avoiding the financial liability of cleanup by legal technicalities (exxon, BP), and then destroying the property of those entities while being very cautious not to harm innocent people in the process. </p>

<p>Things like that would, of course, be very illegal and wrong, and I do not condone them. </p>

<p>I <em>do</em>, however, recommend that you become organized with a small group of friends and family so that, in case of an emergency, you are all able to help provide each other with whatever you might need to survive. Know someone who likes to garden? Someone who&#39;s a gun fanatic? Someone who knows his or her way around an electrical outlet? Someone in construction? Someone with some remote land out in the country? Get together with those people and create an emergency plan, so that if shit hits the fan, you won&#39;t all be running around like chickens with your heads cut off until you run out of resources and die. Make sure that you all know what to do, what supplies you should quickly round up, and where to meet. If the internet and cell phone service goes out, don&#39;t wait around for word-of-mouth confirmation that something serious is happening. Put your plan into action. Rather laugh off your over-preparedness later than mourn the lack of it. </p>

<p>Keep an eye out for camping supplies at yard sales, store a few dozen canning jars and lids, try your hand at some simple gardening in your yard or window sill. Get a box of chipped or broken solar cells off of ebay for $5 and see if you can figure out how to make some small panels (it&#39;s about the simplest electrical work imaginable, and very cheap to learn. There are plenty of youtube videos detailing every step). Make sure you have an edible plant guide and some maps. Take a camping trip and work out the kinks of what other things you might want, balanced by how much you think you can carry. If a revolution happens, you don&#39;t want to be in cities. </p>

<p>And get this stuff going now. There are too many details involved in long-term survival off the grid to try and plan it out if/when the time comes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can people who post this stuff please start understanding that the news is only going to show what earns them money? The news isn&#39;t there to give news anymore, it&#39;s a business.

<p>How about this; if you post here, stop going to main stream media sites, stop watching it on TV, and encourage other people to an alternative to pick up their information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Few News Stories that CNN.com Seems To Think <em>Will Have Higher Viewership</em> Than The Protests In Turkey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems simple enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Few News Stories that CNN.com Seems To Think <em>Will Sell Better</em> Than The Protests In Turkey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are still a company after all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Few News Stories that CNN.com Seems To Think <em>Are More Interesting</em> Than The Protests In Turkey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not everyone holds the same priorities as you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Few News Stories that CNN.com Seems To Think <em>Are More Locally Relevant</em> Than The Protests In Turkey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s in Turkey. The ones you listed are all in the US (as far as I can tell, considering you didn&#39;t give any links to the stories. If I cared though I&#39;d look them up.).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Few News Stories that CNN.com Seems To Think <em>Are More Out of the Ordinary</em> Than The Protests In Turkey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Protests in the Middle East? Practically a daily occurrence by now. Religious turmoil over Scouting policy change? Doesn&#39;t happen very often.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Few News Stories that CNN.com <em>Knows From Pageview Data are More Popular</em> Than The Protests In Turkey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would imagine that some of the story sorting is automated based on popularity.</p>

<p>Just some things to think about.</p>
