       Hey Reddit,  I don't know where exactly this post will fit in but I honestly don't know where to go from here.
       <br/>
       I live in a town on the US-Mexico border. With in the last few weeks, many children have gone missing from large grocery stores, parks, malls, ect...
Many of the children have not been heard from since disappearance, but some have been found.  The ones located were found on the Mexican side, brutally murdered.  This is where things get weird:
      </p>
      <p>
       Our local news refuses to report on the issues.
       <br/>
       Our Former District Attorney has just been convicted on 7 counts of corruption. 
Local PD have begun beefing up security and have Police officers stations outside all major retail and grocery stores.  Parks are more regularly patrolled.
I spoke with a friend of mine who is a high ranking Border patrol official, and he simply told me to stay out of it.  That its not worth getting involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       But thanks not going to happen.  I refuse to live in fear.
       <br/>
       I want to start up an investigation and make my finding public.  I have a few names of families that were victims of the kidnapping however, many people here are afraid to talk.  Just a few months ago a package bomb exploded in a house, seriously injuring the entire family including 2 small children.  The family involved still refused to cooperate with law enforcement.  That's the fear that we have in this city...   An American City!
      </p>
      <p>
       Help me start an investigation. What can I do?  Where should I begin?  I've never done anything like this before and any input you can give me would be great.

       The stores that they get reported missing from, go on lockdown until police arrive.  Then stay closed for a short period of time to look or investigate.  So it's not totally hush hush, but you still won't see it on the evening news. 
The children so far have all be US citizens.

       And their parents aren't even seeking publicity? Why not contact a media outlet outside of your local area? Maybe the competition for a scoop will spur them on to get the story first. What connection,if any,do these families have to one another? Are these average middle class people?

       I suggest that you read up on things like "The Montauk Project" and perhaps watch some talks by Al Bielek.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Montauk Project was in full swing in the 70's and 80's children were disappearing at an alarming rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an interesting project...the Columbine shooters were Montauk boys...

       When you say 'brutally murdered', what kind of injuries do they have?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking this could be related to some kind of ritual abuse and pedophilia... the media often cover this kind of thing up; and so do police... because there are a lot of powerful people in pedophile rings (watch 'Conspiracy of Silence' on youtube). Ritual abuse is related to Satanism (you would be surprised how many people are into that crap); Pedophilia is often associated with Satanism.

       I too wonder if it's along those lines: ritual killing/pedo. I think perhaps many of the killings south of the border may be those type of murder and not drug related.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a book out free if you look online "Killing Fields" by Diana Washington Valdez that has some very interesting clues on pg 33
      </p>
      <p>
       "the searchers saw what looked like dried
bloodstains on the cement floor. They also found women’s underwear and
other articles of clothing. Outside the shack, which had two doors and two
windows, was a large mound of human hair.
There were no furniture or lighting or plumbing fixtures in the
building. “The place (except for the blood stains) was spic and span,
clean,” Vicky said. “The wooden board was leaning against one of the
walls. We all looked at it.”
It was the only piece of wood like it in the area. It had pencil drawings
of nude women, soldiers, the Juarez mountain range, desert cactus and
some plants believed to depict marijuana. It had drawings of the ace of
spades, a Star of David and numerous Nazi swastikas."
      </p>
      <p>
       The piece of wood which she described was "lost" by the local police. The book is fascinating. I re-read it about once a year. The Juarez femicides have always been fascinating to me in that there must be some cover ups in order for this to continue. I wondered how long it would be before it became kinder-cides instead of just femicides. Tragic. I wish the OP would have supplied documented sources, however- the post seems casual and incidental.

       From what I heard, 3 missing children were found in a trail house in Matamoros (border city in Mexico), gutted and hanging from the ceiling.
       <br/>
       reported on a news paper in Mexico.

       operated in Matamoros and had many followers.  There is a list of possible accomplices that weren't arrested on that wiki.  Maybe you can find out somehow which of them are still in the area and what they're up to.

       Satanists will eat some body parts... I'm sure that this happens in voodoo and other black magic ceremonies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does seem to be a kind of ritual thing - this is pretty dark stuff. If there is a cover-up then this is really dark, because it means that powerful people are in on it too...

       Hanging from the ceiling does not seem to indicate that this was a medical procedure. It sounds more than pedophilia and more than murder... it seems like some kind of ritual. Oh shit this is dark.

       If you think that this could be stemming from a criminal cartel in the region, then you should definitely be cautious. Those guys follow even less laws than the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do the families of the missing children have to say? Do any of them have ties to any cartels? What could the media motivation be for not following this story? Do you feel as though you or any of your family could be in danger? Sorry, I have lots of questions, but not many solutions.

       Yup, that's it. I've heard this from several people, including my mom. The story is always embellished and told in a way that they saw a special on tv (as someone here claims. There was no special on tv about it because it's a myth but as the Snopes article states, occasionally "real" reporters get duped into thinking this is a real thing) or a friend told them about it or whatever. No proof that it actually happened.

       As I have stated previously, I don't know what's really going on.   It could be a string of kidnappings or it could be mass hysteria conjuring up stories and worrying the population.  That is why I really want to look into the situation.     Matamoros is notorious for kidnappings (although the victims are usually adults).   I am going to ask local law enforcement and news agencies personally to gain any info.    I hope that its just some spill over jitters from across.
       <br/>
       For those of you who have never been to a Mexican border town.   Shit gets sketchy real fast sometimes.  I've been in class (university of Texas at Brownsville) and have had to evacuate the campus because cartels were having a good ol' fashion shoot out less than 100 meters away.   Bullets have been removed from the walls of the campus.   Yet not much media coverage for us.  So you can see how something like this can be believed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far the only thing I can find on the Internet related to this is some dudes blog:

       But tomorrow ill get out and see what I can dig up.

       What town do you live in? Might be able to get county or state assistance depending on where it is. For instance, if it's anywhere in Arizona, I'd be willing to bet Maricopa Sheriff Arpaio would love to stick his nose into allegations that Mexicans are killing Americans.

       Well the logical reason for a parent to not want to cooperate with authorities would be extortion or ransom. Also a reason police would want to keep it hush hush. Unless the police were in on it.
