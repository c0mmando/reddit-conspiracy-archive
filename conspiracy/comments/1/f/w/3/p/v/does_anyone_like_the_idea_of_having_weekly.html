        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was thinking of running a few discussion threads on different conspiracy topics. For instance one week we could look at 9/11, another week the Prison Industrial Complex or Bilderberg. I would research some good documentaries, articles, sources and anything else which would help the discussion and introduce people to it.</p>

<p>I think this would benefit all readers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because people may not fully understand certain conspiracies, they may introduced to new ones, they could ask questions about them and we could really educate ourselves about these conspiracies. </p>

<p>So basically we would just focus on one particular topic, provide some good reading and videos, break it down and talk about it, let people who are skeptical or just curious ask questions, and give them an informed response.</p>

<p>We could make sure they were archived too so new readers had a place to go when looking at one particular topic because it would have links, and questions about it answered.</p>

<p>So If you like the idea, I&#39;m willing to run it each week and also let people request discussion threads on conspiracy topics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question: Would it go so far as to say break &quot;Weather Modification&quot; into the separate entities of the theory, basically turning Chemtrails, HAARP and NEXRAD into three topics of discussion?</p>

<p>And I would put Weather Modification at the top of my votes for what to do first. Only because it&#39;s the one I&#39;ve been doing most reasearch in recently, not because I think it to be the most important we could deal with. But we could always tackle one of the big ones first, to really grab the attention and get the free thought flowing. And on second thought one of the big ones could really help to flesh out and cement the guidelines to follow for future discussions. Or, a smaller one could do the same without the contention the bigger ones might.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I brought that one up, I have some questions I can&#39;t seem to clear up about the NEXRAD part, and really wouldn&#39;t mind a fresh set of eyes on it.</p>

<p>I spent a day reading through Bernard Eastlund&#39;s US 20070238252 A1 patent, &quot;<em>Cosmic particle ignition of artificially ionized plasma patterns in the atmosphere</em>&quot;  and also the 1996 &quot;<em>Weather as a Force Multiplier:
Owning the Weather in 2025</em>&quot; report and delving deeper on some of the things I couldn&#39;t grasp. I came away with some pretty interesting thoughts. And a few questions too.</p>

<p>I have PDF and patent search links ready for that discussion... I&#39;ll happily join in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>is there a way to stop the thread discussions from going &#39;stale&#39;?  (ie not being able to comment, vote after the archive period)</p>

<p>if we could have a continuous sidebar thread going, itd be better for most people (a lot of discussions won&#39;t be settled in a week i dont think)</p>

<p>i would hate myself if i missed a discussion that i thought i could really add to/learn from. ( i learn a lot in here about more of the modern conspiracies, but my &#39;pet&#39; conspiracy is the JFK assassination)</p>

<p>it&#39;d be great if everyone had the one place they could talk about the one subject and it was side barred for easy reference for everyone. </p>

<p>i think OP&#39;s idea is great, and that it can lead into evolving into even greater things!</p>
