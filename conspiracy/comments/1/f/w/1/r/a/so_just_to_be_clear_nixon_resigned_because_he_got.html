       I prefer Nixon's in your face asshole approach. He never pretended to be a nice man, you always knew he was scum. I do think it's funny how this is all being laid at Obamas feet. Like he was the one that proposed the PATRIOT act. He's basically a steward for the shadow government Cheney set up.

       And it's almost like he tries to tell people sometimes, but that speech about tyranny being just around the corner and having to reject those voices really makes you think... I mean.. you have to take timing into context just to be rational... and I half wonder if that was a warning. I'm almost certain it was, I'm just not completely sure in which way because he's a lawyer and they speak so carefully that sometimes it doesn't make sense until years later

       I still wonder what that letter was that Bush left on the desk for Obama. I wonder some days if it was a variation of the old "write two letters" gag or if it was the plan and the schedule he was to keep.

       Well, I imagine that they put down something pretty abstract that perhaps only a president could possibly understand, and relate on that level. I would highly doubt any plan would ever actually be written down, because in reality, a room is only secure as the people securing it and nobody is omnipotent... So it's probably just good solid advice. Bush was a VERY intelligent guy. The dumb stutterer was a complete act... if you ever heard him actually debate or talk in candid after he was out of the office.. well, he's extremely sharp. The character was perfect and planned. More than likely it's somewhere between a gag and really good advice.

       He only stumbled when he was lying or didnt believe the shit he was saying. When he stuck to the script or actually believed what he was saying he was dead on. He really was 2/3rds dumb hick. I got to watch him as Rangers owner and governor for years. Its really a shame he

       I think that in the later years he just crashed from whatever stress or coffee or alcohol or whatever that he was taking.  He sort of had it pretty rough if you think about it because he had to dodge 911 while for Obama it is behind him and he doesn't have to say shit and he has a single pronged strategy of nobody goes to jail period so in effect while people might oppose him he doesn't seem to have mortal enemies like if he was actually cleaning house.

       Kind of like Gitmo. He can say he's going to do a lot of things but most of them are really outside his actual power, he can try to lead his party and build a consensus and even try to lead popular opinion in the direction he wants but ultimately he has to have Congress on board to get anything done.

       To this should be added that the ultimate purpose behind the Watergate break-in was to ascertain whether or not the DNC had received copies of Johnson's report on the Nixon election team's "gaming" of the 1968 election by sabotaging the Paris Peace Accords. Much like Reagan's team in 1980, this action was not only arguably treasonous, it cost the lives of US. Servicemen and provided aid to enemies of the United States. The current "scandal" is only a continuation of policies enacted by the Patriot Act, and was spelled out pretty clearly a few years back to those who were paying attention to various news outlets and tech blogs.

       He and everyone else involved committed treason against the country by undermining democracy. He should have been executed and failing to even punish him rather less dole out the ultimate punishment set precedent. He should have been locked away for life simply for saying "when the president does it, it's not a crime". What horrible treason that line alone is. We have presidents, not kings, and they are beholdened to their citizens, not granted a divine right to rule.

       I wouldn't want to be. I'd much rather be a consultant rather than an actual up-front decision maker. I trust myself to observe what I see and comment on it and ask the relevant questions for my position; I would absolutely NOT want power. Éminence grise is much more appealing.

       And regardless, you're contradicting me when my ultimate statement was that the president is beholdened to the same laws as any citizen and isn't exempt as a king would be (divine right doesn't exist and our government allows such a basic observance to happen if people wish it).

       I'm just trying to say that article 2 of nixons impeachment is very similar to the actions taken by the two previous administrations. It's time we got rid of the patriot act because it allows the president too much power. Nixon denied knowledge of the scandals made by his administration the same way that obama has.

       Unfortunately, being behind the scenes is what makes them who or what they are - the puppeteers. The problem is, they put on a really good show. It is so well rehearsed and choreographed that 99.9% of the audience is completely oblivious to the puppeteers existence; all they see are the Emperor's clothes. They are ghosts, living in the shadows, in-between our world and theirs. Their presence is an invisible burden on our lives, the extent of which is yet to be seen. They are accountable for nothing, and to no-one.

       Its funny because I'm in the middle on Obama, as I am for many people. He's had good things done along with the bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I never see pro-obama people bring up his race. I constantly see anti-Obama people talk about how people who support Obama always use his race as an excuse. Its essentially an anti-Obama echo chamber where you hear enough people say they use his race as an excuse, and then you believe it despite having never experienced it.

       Nah, I don't agree with most of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       on this.   The media has an agenda, and the left serves it better.  I'm not saying Republicans never serve it, or don't at all... But the media, and the strings  that control them, favour Democrats way more.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, both parties are the same, but the Republicans "preach" a different message (personal liberty and responsibility, suspicion of centralized authority, etc.)    Though he may be a hypocrite (and usually is), he is still saying these things.   That message is still getting out.   The media allows it to get out just enough, so that people make the connection in their brains (freedom, limited government, individual rights vs. group rights and patronage = Republican), and then, they make the conservative in question look stupid.   "Binders full of women!"  "Ron Paul didn't support the Civil Rights Act of 1964!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republican Party, by and large, is full of witless shills.   But the real movers and shakers in all of this are Democrats.   Since FDR, and even before, the Dems have been the party of state power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it's that media bump that won it for Obama, and his race.

       I'm surprised you think it's ideological at all. It's seems obvious that the establishment's goal is to serve the powerful regardless of ideology. They are pro big government, but also pro military and aggressively pro business and "free market" (when that means helping American big business).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the personal liberty message is something that has been emphasized by conservatives in recent years - a great thing IMO. But where was it during the Bush years when conservatism seemed to be all about patriotism, national security and a militaristic response to terrorism?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, we can blame establishment politicians for pushing those policies. But the Republican base overwhelmingly went along with them - Bush's approval was high among conservatives until late in his second term. Unlike Democrats, who up until now have complained about (but tolerated) Obama's overreach, the majority of conservatives actually advocated militaristic, big government policies like the invasion of Iraq and the Patriot Act. I'm glad that the renewed interest in libertarianism has started to change peoples' minds about these issues, but let's not rewrite history.

       Ideology is an important measure to gain the trust and sympathies of the electorate and the public. The democratic party mainly proffers lukewarm and watered down versions of Marxism and republicans' main base is the church. I don't think your comment is any more accurate than the guy before you. You're talking about what happened after he was elected (or what DIDN'T happen, rather) and he's talking about the basis for his being elected.

       So just to be clear:  Obama is to the FAR RIGHT of Nixon on every topic except gay issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nixon used
       <a href="http://www.econreview.com/events/wageprice1971b.htm">
        <em>
         wage &amp; price controls
        </em>
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">
        created the EPA
       </a>
       , started
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y5D27z1FKk">
        OSHA
       </a>
       for worker health &amp; safety, ended the draft, signed the SALT treaty with Russia, enacted clean water regulations, and even proposed national health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nixon implemented the first national Affirmative Action programs, integrated schools, endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment, illegally spied on the DNC and his "enemies", poured money into social programs &amp; NASA (Nixon was president during the Apollo moon landings).
      </p>
      <p>
       By comparison, Obama has adopted Bush's NSA wiretapping policies, 
adopted Bush's Middle East wars and expanded them, has begun secret wars everywhere from Yemen to Somalia to Uganda using drone strikes (Nixon announced his secret war in Cambodia, which led to the Kent State protests &amp; shootings).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama pushed to CUT Social Security, pushed for extension of Patriot Act, EXTENDED Bush's billionaire Tax Cuts, adopted Bush's CIA secret prisons &amp; rendition policies, caved in on the debt deal &amp; the public option &amp; big pharma demands, and much much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama cancelled the EPA's ozone rules, resulting in environmental rules even more radically destructive than George W. Bush's.  Obama has de-funded NASA programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet according to the Tea Party &amp; Rapepublicans, Obama is a Marxist who is turning the Pentagon pink &amp; overthrowing capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Obama is a radical left-wing Marxist, then what was Nixon?

       I absolutely do not support the current Republicans, but be aware that some right wingers incorrectly use the term "Marxist" when they mean "statist". Obviously that criticism is laughable coming from Republicans, but now when coming from Libertarians.

       Step back and absorb this: You know, the whole topic here should be the wiretapping.  From a conspiracy theorists standpoint, you are falling right into the same old tired rut they have tricked you into - playing the left vs right bs instead of looking at the real issue here - wiretapping citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need a better tinfoil hat to block that stuff.  If you are really more concerned about how left or right a politician is than the actions of that politician, they have you.

       This is Obama and Bush, that's the problem. It started with the Bush-era Patriot Act and has been expanded by Obama. It's bipartisan mass surveillance, so there's no opposing side other than a handful of principled liberals and libertarians.

       Well the Patriot act really was the start of all of this.  So I wouldn't  blame  Obama solely. Independent of that, Obama sucked up a lot of votes by professing outrage when Bush did this originally.  Makes it worse imho.

       I have this feeling man, 'cause you know, it's just a handful of people who run everything, you know … that's true, it's provable. It's not … I'm not a fucking conspiracy nut, it's provable. A handful, a very small elite, run and own these corporations, which include the mainstream media. I have this feeling that whoever is elected president, like Clinton was, no matter what you promise on the campaign trail – blah, blah, blah – when you win, you go into this smoke-filled room with the twelve industrialist capitalist scum-fucks who got you in there. And you're in this smoky room, and this little film screen comes down … and a big guy with a cigar goes, "Roll the film." And it's a shot of the Kennedy assassination from an angle you've never seen before … that looks suspiciously like it's from the grassy knoll. And then the screen goes up and the lights come up, and they go to the new president, "Any questions?" "Er, just what my agenda is." - Bill Hicks

       impeachment would be difficult since congress has repeatedly voted to keep PATRIOT act in place as well as other acts that undermine civil liberties. theyd have to impeach themselves as well.

       this is why when laws like that get passed and people say "oh it's for national security" or "its just to stop terrorism" it's so dangerous. those acts remain law after the threat is gone and they keep voting to renew it. now there's an argument that it's technically legal and republicans who act upset about it look like bullshitters if they voted for renewal of the patriot act. grrr. pisses me off.

         This is not "wiretapping" as no conversations are being recorded. It's gathering metadata, something that has been legal since
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland">
          the late 70s
         </a>
         . Watergate was illegal wiretapping.

         This was done under a warrant, via the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Watergate was illegal wiretapping.

       <li>

       they're telling the truth about not recording conversations. Last time when Obama said he would remove all the liberty infringing laws and would not wiretap, then did wiretap, then covered it up, was it a lie?

       Yes,
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       are better than this, but it is too late. A Vast majority of people in this country.. A
       <strong>
        <em>
         VAST
        </em>
       </strong>
       majority do not have an inkling of what is going on or even care to know. And those of us that do, most have not known for long enough to make a difference... These plans have been in motion for a very, very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is too late. They will continue to introduce in little pieces through the mainstream media their agenda, so that more and more people can swallow it up, and accept it as the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally there will be more dissent, but there will still be a
       <strong>
        Vast
       </strong>
       majority who Do Not Care what is happening around them, because their lives are too nice to want that to change. So when that dissent is snuffed out, it will be for the greater good.

       Oh it's a conspiracy, it's just a really fucking old one that happens to now be in the news. They've been doing similar to this for 20-30 years, it's just been expanded for the modern era, and they can now justify the expansion with 'safety concerns' and 'terrorism'.

       That name sounds familiar. Obama? Oh yeah - he's the guy who refuses to release his college records and posted a PDF of his birth certificate while refusing to show anyone the physical one. Sure, it's okay for him to allow logging our phone calls, listening to them with computers  for keywords,  reading our e-mail, flying drones over the US, and ordering billions of rounds of ammo for use on American soil. Because he's all about hope and change. And he's not hiding anything himself. Google 'Obama Men's Country'.

       I love how there was a point where comparisons to Nixon were questionable. Now it's becoming more and more clear that the comparison isn't really fair to Nixon. He still had to rely on good old fashioned breaking and entering to get booted.

       Regardless of any of that, if we impeach Obama then the next motherfucker in office will just keep the wiretaps running smooth as shit, and then increase it, just like Obama did with Gitmo.

       Obama and this Congress has to be backed by some power that has control over every avenue that can come after him. That would mean that the news media, the military, the Supreme Court and every state government is on the take. If this is true that means every election is a sham, every letter an petition to Congress is ignored and peaceful protest is hopeless. Look at the Lewinsky scandal, Whitewater and Watergate erupted over almost nothing and yet this regime is beyond scrutiny. It is obviously something bigger than fear of the race card being played. Our government has been taken over by some very big, very powerful group that seek to obfuscate the facts, divide and confuse the populous and undermine the Constitution. People need to get their heads out of their asses and realize what is going on.

       So Nixon wiretapped one entity, covered it up, resigned because cover-ups are immoral. Obama wiretapped the whole world, covered it up, but nothing will happen because congress was involved? Is that how it works?

       Lets just agree this isn't a liberal/conservative, left/right Obama thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a lot of senators (all of them, according to mass media) that were in on the thing. This comes from both sides. It wasn't a red/blue thing. It is a corrupt government top-down thing, and it wouldn't be any different if a Republican was president.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "liberalbot" stuff just brings down the community and makes us all look bad, and it interferes with getting anything done if we're all bickering about which side of the spectrum is worst. Corruption is widespread, not limited to liberals/conservatives.

       What has been revealed by as being globally recorded in the recent news is called a "pen register" - who was being called, cell tower data etc. -
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       "wiretaps" - recording the conversations.
      </p>

       The decision on pen registers is from 1979:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       and the TL;DR is SCOTUS says yes it's legal, no it doesn't constitute a search, no a warrant is not required.

       Haha.  As much as I hate Obama, I'm afraid that this isn't his doing alone.  Sure, he has let it continue and perhaps even made things worse for us, but this is something that has been going on for a long time now.  It all started when we let the Patriot Act and similar legislation pass post 9/11.

       sigh, nixon resigned because it distracted from the fact that he basically just pardoned all the criminals involved in the assassination of the JFK. He ran a vast criminal network from the whitehouse and as it was exposed, he publicly went down with the sinking ship.

       So what I think I see you saying is all they have to do is make a law that says "all the rights in the constitution are now void" and you're okay with it because it's the law?

       The bill of rights is our shield against the government. That very same government is writing laws to undermine it. Don't you see the irony in that?

       Ok so you have a computer record it either just text to save on space or just make small enough recordings like 8khz or something really low quality that you can still hear.  Then you select what or who you would like to hear... like if wanted to listen to segue08 I just search his IP that i get after contacting reddit or hell maybe I bypass asking reddit altogether and just whatever and then I'm in.  Then you do whatever you want... blackmail people, steal secrets, laugh at you naked pics (yeh they access to everything not just audio).

       I think what matters is the peoples knowledge and consent.  I believe If they had the manpower or CPU they would be listening.

       What if the President thinks he may want to read a book someday so he has the courts order every library everywhere to send them a list of all their books and when and who read them and not tell anybody about it.  Its stupid, lazy, and an incredible abuse of power.

       I can't tell if you're serious.. are you talking about PRISM, or the collection of Verizon data?
      </p>
      <p>
       PRISM is the more important and wider reaching of the two.

       Ideology is an important measure to gain the trust and sympathies of the electorate and the public. The democratic party mainly proffers lukewarm and watered down versions of Marxism and republicans' main base is the church. I don't think your comment is any more accurate than the guy before you. You're talking about what happened after he was elected (or what DIDN'T happen, rather) and he's talking about the basis for his being elected.

       Ohhh,
       <strong>
        THIS time
       </strong>
       they're telling the truth about not recording conversations. Last time when Obama said he would remove all the liberty infringing laws and would not wiretap, then did wiretap, then covered it up, was it a lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Answer: Yes it was a lie.

       And I'm glad weak-minded cunts like you would rather "consult" and hide behind people with actual cognitive thinking skills who lead.

       You're like the villager who shouted "BURN THE WITCH!" in Salem.  You know that, right?
