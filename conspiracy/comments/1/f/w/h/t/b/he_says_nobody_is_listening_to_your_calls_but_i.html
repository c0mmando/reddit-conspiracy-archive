       Its all slightly ambiguous, legalise speak. What they say is not exactly what they mean and its all worded very carefully. Look at all the press releases from Facebook, Apple, Google and others. They almost are identical in some of the wording.

       Yes, they all talk about how they haven't given
       <em>
        direct
       </em>
       access to the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they meant that they hadn't given any access at all, they would have just said "we haven't given any access to the NSA".
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole "direct" thing is clear lawyer speak to cover their asses. They're obviously giving data to the NSA and are doing it in such a way so that they can technically classify it as "indirect" and therefore claim that "we are not giving access directly to the NSA".

       I work with a video transcoding service. Their reps told us at a meeting that their service does speech to text transcription and that it was licensed from the NSA and that they had to sign all kinds of NDAs to use it.

       I received a phone call to day, that at first sounded like a real person (telemarketer) but after saying hello the voice sounded funny. There was an unnatural pause waiting for a response. So I asked "is this a real person?" after another unnatural pause it responded with what sounded like a pre-recorded response. "haha of course I'm a real person" so I tested it "what time is it?" after a longer pause It told me "sorry I'm not allowed to give out personal information." So if some scammer has the ability to apparently trick people into talking to machines believing they are real people, I can only imagine what the government has.

       When I was ten years old and logging onto BBS I once was trying to page the owner and they had setup an automatic bot response after say thirty seconds of paging.  I chatted with this bot for quite some time and I was just real dissapointed that the guy running the BBS was so lame.  I figured it out like a few days later or so.  At the time I didn't know that such a thing was possible.

       I dunno, even with their huge data center and assuming highly advanced tech, I can see major logistics issues in recording and transcribing hour upon hour of teenage girls chatting about jeans. I think it's likely that they only start recording when the PRISM software finds an actionable pattern.

       I have no idea what their specific criteria are, but it's logical to me that they would have some sort of patterns they're looking for before taking further action.  They collect numbers called and length of calls... I would find it extremely strange if that wasn't going into some sort of supercomputer that analyzes patterns.

       What? The thought is that there are any number of suspicious patterns they are looking for, and when one is found they implement further actions. It's the same principle behind various futuristic crime stopping systems in fictional works.

       Right.  What do they define as suspicious?  How broad is their definition of "suspicious"?  Is there a limit, or immutable boundary, which they cannot cross?  My point is that the general population has no way to determine any of this.  The general population wasn't even supposed to know anything about what they are doing.  I find it difficult to see how anyone can blindly trust a group that has intentionally mislead or deceived them.

       Yes, I already established that I would have no idea what criteria they use. I'm also not advocating blind trust, but rather expressing a theory based on logical thought and required logistics. Constant full surveillance of every single phone call just doesn't seem feasible.

       A valid point. Nonetheless, an actionable pattern that gets flagged as a potential security threat warrants an investigation into past activities, calls included.

       When I was ten years old and logging onto BBS I once was trying to page the owner and they had setup an automatic bot response after say thirty seconds of paging.  I chatted with this bot for quite some time and I was just real dissapointed that the guy running the BBS was so lame.  I figured it out like a few days later or so.  At the time I didn't know that such a thing was possible.
