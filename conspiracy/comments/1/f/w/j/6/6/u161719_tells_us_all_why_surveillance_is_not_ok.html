       I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship.  One of the Arab spring countries.  I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US.  People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like.  It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, every
       <em>
        thing
       </em>
       is watching. A few points:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state.  Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo.  These could be religious ideas.  These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking.  It makes it very easy to know who these people are.  It also makes it very simple to control these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals.  So you make a plan and go to protest these practices.  You get there, and wow, the protest is huge.  You never expected this, you were just goofing off.  Well now everyone who was there is suspect.  Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail.  They can do something more sinister.  They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend.  Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes.  Or they can threaten to get your dad fired.  All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group.  You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job.  So you do.  You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Let's say number one goes on.  The country is a weird place now.  Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time.  People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power.  I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal.  You see on the news that tear gas was fired.  Your friend calls you, frantic.  They're shooting people.  Oh my god.  you never signed up for this.  You say, fuck it.  My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying.  That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore.  You just stop going to meetings.  You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you.  They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit.  No one can help you so they all just sit quietly.  They know if they say anything they're next.  This happened in the country I live in.  It is not a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Its hard to say how long you were in there.  What you saw was horrible.  Most of the time, you only heard screams.  People begging to be killed.  Noises you've never heard before.  You, you were lucky.  You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you.  No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember.  There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then.  To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated.  You learn in prison that torture is now common.  But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker.  Its considered a threat to national security.  Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected.  There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you.  He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you.  Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.
      </p>
      <p>
       You decide to go home and see your parents.  Maybe they can help.  This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house.  They aren't home.  You can't reach them no matter how hard you try.  A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since.  You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest.  Even your little brother isn't there.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news.  Sports scores. Celebrity news.  It's like nothing is wrong.  What the hell is going on?  A stranger smirks at you reading the paper.  You lose it.  You shout at him "fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Sorry," he says.  "I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore."  There haven't been any real journalists for months.  They're all in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone walking around is scared.  They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government.  Hell,  at one time YOU were reporting for the government.  Maybe they just want their kid to get through school.  Maybe they want to keep their job.  Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor.  It's always a simple reason.  Good people always do bad things for simple reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to protest.  You want your family back.  You need help for your leg.  This is way beyond anything you ever wanted.  It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms.  Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you.  You definitely can't use a phone or email.  You can't get a job.  You can't even trust people face to face anymore.  On every corner, there are people with guns.  They are as scared as you are.  They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all happened in the country where I live.
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       You want to know why revolutions happen?  Because little by little by little things get worse and worse.  But this thing that is happening now is big.  This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described.  In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people.  Same in Soviet Russia.  Same in East Germany.  In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Obama won't do it.  Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him.  Maybe this story isn't about you.  Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son.  We just don't know yet.  But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice.  Are we okay with this, or not?  Do we want this power to exist, or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance.  I was taught that the United States meant "liberty and justice for all."  You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution.  That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is.  Well, the government just violated that ideal.  So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for?  Safety?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself a question.  In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't make anything up.  These things happened to people I know.  We used to think it couldn't happen in America.  But guess what?  It's starting to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually get really upset when people say "I don't have anything to hide.  Let them read everything."  People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads.  They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.

       They have power because we fund them. We need to think about a new currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we stop paying taxes they can simply print more of the money since we all use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can have their own currency. That doesn't mean we have to use it. They can have their own body politic. That doesn't mean we have to give them power over us. They can have their own laws. That doesn't mean we have to obey them. The self-appointed rulers are clearly psychopathic. We don't need them. They're parasites.

       The fact that you have a computer and likely buy food at a grocery store means you're behaving and participating identically to a 'sheeple.' I'm not saying you're bad or anything. I'm only saying that we're all in this together. I'm no different. I just now had two beers from freaking Germany. I'm a part of the Globalism just by doing that. So I'm not exactly Neo fighting Agent Smith either.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only point is that when shit hits the fan - which may yet happen - you're going to end up protecting the sheeple and they'll end up protecting you. Why? Because we're al in this together. They probably won't understand the layers and subtlety that you understand, but they
       <em>
        will

       understand that they're being fucked with by the self-appointed rulers. At which point you're going to have to stop calling them sheeple. Because it comes off a lot like 'ignorant cunt.' Which will not encourage them to help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I agree that most people
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       ignorant and care about petty things. It's just that you don't need to insult them. They simply don't get it and it's probably not in their life path to understand this stuff. Which means that you have a responsibility to think, act and perform
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       them. Not because you will benefit. You will not. You are going to have to be a good person for the sake of being a good person. By being better than the self-appointed rulers you become more powerful than them. They're the ones who resort to name-calling and bigotry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I once called a friend of mine a 'normie' and suddenly understood the impact of my thoughts and words. I'm no saint. I fail at this daily, but I'm a single step ahead of where I was earlier in life. At least I'm aware of this weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you don't think I'm "coming down on you" or whatever. I'm not. This is not an attack. It's just something that I've been thinking about a lot lately and, for whatever reason, this seems like as good a place as any to let it out. I hope you don't think I'm a dick-hole. I'm not. I swear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, yeah, it might get worse before it gets better. In fact that seems likely at the moment.

       Your comment gave me chills. I've been over preparing as I know no one around me is prepared for any upset in life. They all think the government will come running and save the day. Not that I think they can, but I don't want them to. I want to be in control of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know where any of this is going to lead but I fear it's going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.

       Sometimes, I think most people just try and tune out the rest of the world, the doom and gloom, rather than thinking the government will help them. I think most people know that Government and Law are not in favor of the average citizen anymore.

       I'm up in Canada and I don't think anyone I know has heard of the NSA spying. I told my girlfriend and she flipped her lid. She was flabbergasted. She still has no interest in seeking out what other things are going on. Her life is too good. She can't fathom it going away. I can. That's why I try to be informed and prepare. I could lock my doors and be safe in my house for a month, if needed. I think everyone should have that kind of preparation ready. It's not that hard or expensive.

       I agree. At this point, the average guy has heard stories and news reports of acts of injustice. The average guy knows that there is A LOT of bs going around in politics. However, the average guy puts on the mask that the government wants, a worker and follower.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it's only a matter of time before the average guy becomes the currently publicly expressive guy of truth and then the world will have it's change, for the better.

       I think the average person is chained to that mask, to those tasks. They feel that if they don't keep doing the tasks, they won't eat. They won't have a home. They won't have anything.

       Fuck no I am not ok with this. In my opinion ever single person knowingly involved with PRISM on the NSA or corporate side are domestic enemies of the constitution and can be killed on sight no questions asked no remorse. The law is suspended until justice is defended and the constitution restored. We are now in a universal state of exception.

       Now in a state of exception? Try after 9/11 when we were placed into a state of emergency, and have not yet lifted said state. This granted wide sweeping powers to our government. Kinda like how Adolf and his buddies took over germany.

       No. Nobody will be helped by violence, no wrong vindicated. You'd simply lower yourself to their level. This is a matter of ideology, and breaking the very justice you're trying to defend will invalidate everything you're trying to do. These people should be tracked down, noted, evidence gathered against them, and when a government of the vox populi is restored, given a fair trial. I empathise with your anger, but restraint must nevertheless be exercised.

       While at the park today, I noticed a new surveillance camera. Much like OP, I started brainstorming thoughts of how this advancement in technology can hurt the citizens in these modern day situations. The more I thought, the more scary it became.

       Ever read Ted Kaczynski's UnaBomber Manifesto?  This is PRECISELY THE EXACT THING that he feared was our future.  People mocked him and called him crazy at the time, but look at what is happening to our society now?  Especially kids, they can not put down their cell phones for more then 10 minutes at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following are exerts from the Unabomber Manifesto
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, then gives them the drugs to take away their unhappiness. Science fiction? It is already happening to some extent in our own society. It is well known that the rate of clinical depression had been greatly increasing in recent decades. We believe that this is due to disruption of the power process
      </p>
      <p>
       The entertainment industry serves as an important psychological tool of the system, possibly even when it is dishing out large amounts of sex and violence. Entertainment provides modern man with an essential means of escape. While absorbed in television, videos, etc., he can forget stress, anxiety, frustration, dissatisfaction
      </p>
      <p>
       Sylvan Learning Centers, for example, have had great success in motivating children to study, and psychological techniques are also used with more or less success in many conventional schools. "Parenting" techniques that are taught to parents are designed to make children accept fundamental values of the system and behave in ways that the system finds desirable
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last sections of the manifesto, Kaczynski carefully defines what he means by freedom[62] and provides an argument that it would "be hopelessly difficult [...] to reform the industrial system in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing our sphere of freedom
      </p>
      <p>
       He says that "in spite of all its technical advances relating to human behavior the system to date has not been impressively successful in controlling human beings" and predicts that "[i]f the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. Otherwise it will break down" and that "the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years
      </p>
      <p>
       He gives various dystopian possibilities for the type of society which would evolve in the former case.[64] He claims that revolution, unlike reform, is possible, and calls on sympathetic readers to initiate such revolution using two strategies: to "heighten the social stresses within the system so as to increase the likelihood that it will break down" and to "develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology
      </p>
      <p>
       He gives various tactical recommendations, including avoiding the assumption of political power, avoiding all collaboration with leftists, and supporting free trade agreements in order to bind the world economy into a more fragile, unified whole.

       The car is on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel
      </p>
      <p>
       And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
      </p>
      <p>
       And a dark wind blows
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is corrupt
      </p>
      <p>
       And we're on so many drugs
      </p>
      <p>
       With the radio on and the curtains drawn
      </p>
      <p>
       We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
      </p>
      <p>
       And the machine is bleeding to death
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun has fallen down
      </p>
      <p>
       And the billboards are all leering
      </p>
      <p>
       And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
      </p>
      <p>
       It went like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The buildings tumbled in on themselves
      </p>
      <p>
       Mothers clutching babies
      </p>
      <p>
       Picked through the rubble
      </p>
      <p>
       And pulled out their hair
      </p>
      <p>
       The skyline was beautiful on fire
      </p>
      <p>
       All twisted metal stretching upwards
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything washed in a thin orange haze
      </p>
      <p>
       I said, "Kiss me, you're beautiful -
      </p>
      <p>
       These are truly the last days"
      </p>
      <p>
       You grabbed my hand
      </p>
      <p>
       And we fell into it
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a daydream
      </p>
      <p>
       Or a fever
      </p>
      <p>
       We woke up one morning and fell a little further down
      </p>
      <p>
       For sure it's the valley of death
      </p>
      <p>
       I open up my wallet
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's full of blood

       A lot of talk, but we really are not getting any closer to the freedom everyone is talking about. So what that we know all this? Most people, even believers of this information will continue to go to work the next day, use their banks, their school systems, buy their products and watch their propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this begs the question, what the hell is the point in knowing this information if we are not doing the IMPORTANT things like not using the banks which fund everything they do, not going to their education systems which create the people who go along with their plans, not watching their propaganda machine which brainwashes us, not eating their food which makes us sick and lazy etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       One day we go out and protest and the next day we go and support them with our own time and money. Seems really foolish to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to stop the machine is to stop moving it with our own hands!
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to be really free? Get a few like minded families together, buy a piece of land far away from the city near clean running water, build a nice cozy little home, buy a solar panel system, stock up on guns and provisions, and you are TOTALLY free. Never in history were people truly free in big cities. Its impossible to become free in a society built on lies by people who spread lies. No revolution will ever help unless people throw out their TVs, grow their own food, and use another system of money other than that created by the people who enslave us.

       All of this can be done under 30k, if really frugal. Around 50-70 and you are going to live in full comfort. Check out land prices far away from cities, you can even find some that are close to free. House costs if you build yourself can be also very low, the only real expenses are solar panels, and food stores.

       "They" can't see everywhere. "They" are not omnipotent or omniscient. Get out of their festering slums and into the wilderness. Get a nice plot of land, and be self-sufficient. Solar and wind power can keep you running the basics, and learning to grow your own vegetables takes no time at all. Livestock is easy enough to care for once you get the hang of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, you won't have the modern conveniences like Reddit, air conditioning or TV, but seriously, who gives a fuck about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single one of you is capable of this. The fattest, laziest, most clumsy and awkward of us is capable of living off the land. We have been doing it as a species for thousands upon thousands of years. That voice inside your head, that terrible, tiny voice which says "I can't do that, it's too hard"? Ask yourself where that voice came from. Is it your voice? Or is it a voice that has been put there, shaped by years of dependance?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You talk of revolution. There is a reason they are called "revolutions". They always come around again. What we need is a diaspora. Flee the cities and the suburbs, flee like rats off a sinking ship. Flee their corrupt, broken, rotten, uncaring system.
      </p>
      <p>
       flee, and find yourselves.

       Exactly. I have a feeling even 90% of the conspiracy crowd will be caught in the mess just like everyone else. Revolution is useless, going protesting is useless because it does not stop the machine which is fuelled by all of us. The best revolution is to just unplug from the city (you can still have internet and all the creature comforts in the wild).
      </p>
      <p>
       What would happen if everyone just stopped using the banks? All their power disappears within one day, ONE DAY. No need for violence, no need for revolutions or protests...
      </p>
      <p>
       All these protests and revolutions create a feeling that everything is moving in the right direction, that somehow things will change.. they wont, they never have, and never will. The only time they will change is if you get up and leave and make a better life for yourself.

       In America things have certainly changed for the worse over time. You'll get no argument from me when it comes to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're talking about is a pipe dream; The same pipe dream that the hippies in the 60's indulged themselves in. They were 'sick of the government mannn" And they were going to move to Uraguay or something and "live off the land". Never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just an escapist indulgence. That sort of talk is nothing more than talk. The truth is , if you're escaping real oppression from your country of origin: Where you gonna go? : America.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanted to create your own electricity and live off the land : you can do that right now. Whats stopping you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Me? I dont want "independence from Government". I want to take the power and give it back to the people. Real power, not the illusion of choice. To me , that sort of run away/escape talk is defeatist. 
Start thinking about 'why' protesting and civil disobedience doesn't work and what you can do better. Dont just throw in the towell. Theres a
       <em>
        reason
       </em>
       why Occupy failed. And it has more to do with the disconnection between organizing and community that people are willing to accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to tell you what to think or how to think , just to think a little bit harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going anywhere.

       When I hear Lindsey Graham say something like he thinks its a good idea to exchange privacy for safety - He's the one that needs to leave. Plenty of oppressive regimes to choose from Lindsey , maybe America just isnt your speed, and Iran would be more to your liking

       The pipe dream is how we are living now which only came to be in the last few hundred years. How were people living for millenia? In small villages and small towns. Large cities were very rare and far and between. It is as real a life as it gets. I actually am doing it right now and have never felt happier.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have our own Uruguay right here, there is thousands of acres for dirt cheap (you can find 5-20 acres of land for around 5 thousand).
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to live in the city and be free? That's absolutely fine. But you cant expect to be free while at the same time doing ALL the things they use to enslave us. A city can only be a truly free city if we stop using the banks, stop watching their propaganda (throw out theTV and boycott the movies), stop attending their brainwash/schooling system, or go shopping which are all the things they use to control us. And how many people are going to do all this?
      </p>
      <p>
       So tell me, how in the heck are city folk expecting to "fight" for freedom with their left hand and with the right hand turn the wheel of oppression?

       Agreed. The citizens of Rome once left to build a new city when the nobles would not give them the human rights they deserved. The root of all evil is our fiat money system. To overcome it we must remove ourselves entirely from it. A 'semi-autonomous zone' (Hakim Bey) is the only hope. Small pockets of freedom can and will grow, but the whole system cannot collapse without first reaching a tipping point of say 10-20% of the populace. Einstein once said if only 2% of the military would refuse to obey orders all wars would end.

       It didn't work out so well for David Koresh (just one example that immediately came to mind). I bet there are a lot of start-ups like what you've described that got shut down and the ones we know about get slandered to sway people to demonize them. Sex cult, crazy satanic religion or militia group are common ways to discredit such groups.

       I read exactly what you wrote and fully understand your intent. Reread what I wrote without David Koresh as an example. Put in "Joe Schmoe" instead and instead of religion put in Vegans. It doesn't matter what set of variables you use. Big government doesn't look kindly on anyone breaking away from it's preset and containable way of living. Your idea is great but in practice the government will find a way to shut it down while making the public feel that you are villains and God bless America for ridding us from your evil ways.

       Not obvious or it wouldn't be questioned. Lots of countries have American schools for embassy kids, expatriate kids or rich families in the host country that feel they will get a better education through an American system. Very similar to how other countries have schools in the USA that are designed after their home country - ISA (Islamic Saudi Academy) for example.

       Possibly his heritage, he may have moved here at a young age. I believe the references he is telling about the infected leg may be an example of how uncontrollable it can actually get just by losing privacy of emails, or maybe it actually happened to someone he knew.. Not sure, just my insight on it.

       This post honestly reminded me of two books I recently read:
       <em>
        Escape from Camp 14
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea
       </em>
       . While North Korea is clearly the most extreme example, these books offer insiders' perspectives into the nature of total government control.

       that is a well argued coherent point of view and I agree, the future is nothing but bleak unless we all take a stand that this is not fucking okay. Unless we learn from history and the mistakes we make we are destined to repeat them. Turn off the TV and read a book, and do what they don't want, THINK!!!

       The problem is we weren't all raised in this shit, at least not directly. So, it's unfamiliar, and it puts us on edge. We risk what was once the promise of a regular life, where we work, raise families and think about our future and our children's future. No longer. Now, for no reason other than the possibility of "terrorism" we live in fear of our own flailing economy, a government that wants to shackle whistleblowers and protestors alike but lets Tea Baggers run free like rightwing street thugs. We lie in a perpetual state of low-grade fear that it might all get taken away for no identifiable reason, just, you know, terrorists and national security.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying everyone has this experience, or that people have never had it rougher, but to have the promise of this great country where we could all get together and make something so magnificent, and then have it taken away is just too much sometimes. To make matters worse, you don't want to protest, or upset what little of value you have left, because you may end up in worse shape and never get back to the promise that motivates us all to do and be better.

       Its small steps but I just installed Linux on my older friends new notebook this week and he loved it.  I didn't even lecture him about the freedom advantages.  That lecture will come this next week or the week after that.  I'm just chipping away at it.

       I'm tired of being frantic.  I won't be in the streets ever.  I have more value behind the scenes.  Likely in later times I will be able to do more good for America by not being in America.  I think that we should all support each other doing our part and that means that some people are going to be super into guns and others will be holding signs and making a presence downtown and others will be timidly blogging all day.  We need a hell of a lot of things done and people to do them.  I support anyone who is searching or even thinking about how to become more autonomous.  Personally I'm an educator and a concensus builder.  I'm glad that I'm not the knows how to shoot and repair twenty different types of guns guy and he certainly has a role to play and will need will need our support, even if it is only ideological or consesus based.

       Its another computer system like Windows or Macintosh.  The programming code that is used to create it is available to the world so people can improve it and make sure that that it does not contain back doors that hackers or governments could use to take over your system.  I feel that Linux can be better than Windows for a beginner who only uses a web browser and creates basic word documents and listens to a few mp3 files.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is currently on just over 1% of all desktop and notebook computers and it is quickly gaining support from video game publishers.  Linux is actually the most common OS (operating system) on the planet now if you consider all of the Internet servers that run it and the Android phones which run it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is comprised of thousands of individual pieces of free software and these are compiled into what are called distributions.  There are numerous distributions but the Ubuntu Linux distribution has risen to become the dominant goto 'distro' for beginners and for software developers trying to get their software working on Linux.
      </p>
      <p>
       To start with you have Firefox and Chrome and you have flashplayer as well for watching youtube.  Its very easy to setup if you know any techies out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the key benefits to using Linux is that every piece of software that you use can be updated all at once so you never have to deal with all of the software reminders.  Also Linux actually has overall better driver support than Windows now [when you consider older hardware and the Windows XP to Windows 7-8 change] so right off of the install you currently have about a double better chance that everything will just work.  Many people remember Linux driver support being pretty bad from over six or seven years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its free and it starts you off in a very nice and simple manner and underneath it all is the same technology that powers super computers so you can grow infinitly with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also "dual boot" meaning that you can install Linux on the same computer that Windows is running on.  When you boot the computer you choose from a menu which to load.
      </p>
      <p>
       Microsoft is trying to lock down all of the new computers so that they are like an iPhone in that you can't do anything with them.  It would be like getting a Chevelle with the hood welded shut.  See what Microsoft is doing with the Xbox One and Kinect 2.0 to see where they want to take us.  Apple is no better.  Their hip hacker image is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using Linux is like shopping at the really nice organic grociery store but instead expensive prices it is free.

       "Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems. Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works. They'll warn that tyranny always lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices. Because what they suggest is that our brave, and creative, and unique experiment in self-rule is somehow just a sham with which we can't be trusted."
-Obama

       This is a fine example of our president wanting us have blind faith in our government.

       Uhm...hey buddy, got two questions for you. 1) how did you transform from someone living in the Middle East during the Arab spring into a pledge of allegiance swearing American? And 2) how did you just walk out of prison with an infection in your leg with no word from the guards or anyone waiting at your parents for you?
