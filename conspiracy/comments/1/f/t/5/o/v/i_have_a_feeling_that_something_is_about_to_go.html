America&#39;s citizens are like a sleeping lion, they just poked it twice. There are to many people who are not &quot;awake&quot; yet. Teens need to be focused on to wake up. They are our future, when your in the nursing home, they will be taking care of you. They are the future. The hope. Please do what you can. Spread the word. We can&#39;t do much unless more people know. It&#39;s like learning to run before you can walk.</p>

We are waking up faster than ever before, and the powers that be know this; that is why they are tightening their grip.

It has been predetermined since The Big Bang, when everything that we know exploded and set this path into motion so many millions of years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to hear it. As a 30-year-old whose been researching government overreach for over a decade, I&#39;d like to recommend some fundamental reading that will equip you with the referential tools you&#39;ll need to wake other people up. Some are fairly short reads, while others are ridiculously lengthy, like War &amp; Peace. But this is what all those reading assignments and book reports in school have been preparing you for. If you read these documents, you&#39;ll understand and be able to point to evidence of the most greivous extents of the US government&#39;s treasons against its people.</p>

<ol>
<li>Executive Order 13603: National Defense Resource Preparedness (~12 pages) <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness</a> </li>
<li><p>this order is an amendment to the 1950 Defense Production Act. Among the many important changes is the extension of its uses from only &quot;times of war and national emergency&quot; to &quot;peacetime and times of national emergency. It also authorizes forced human labor during peacetime, and the use of chemical weapons, and can be utilized without Congressional approval.</p></li>
<li><p>2013 National Defense Authorization Act (900+ pages): <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text</a></p></li>
<li><p>This bill is chalk full of hidden gems. It legalizes military jurisdiction on domestic soil, overturning Posse Commitatus. It authorizes Congress to wage <em>offensive</em> cyber warfare (i.e. to attack potential enemies through internets). For being &quot;associated&quot; with enemies of the US, or for being &quot;belligerent&quot; (both of which terms the Pentagon has refused to define under Congressinoal inquiry), it authorizes Homeland Security to remove a person&#39;s citizenship (if they were a US citizen), detain them as a hostile enemy combatant, without charge, without access to an attorney, and without a trial &quot;for as long as the war on terror continues.&quot; And there&#39;s some other horrendous stuff as well. </p></li>
<li><p>Patriot Act: <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/text-usa-patriot-act">http://www.aclu.org/national-security/text-usa-patriot-act</a></p></li>
<li><p>Citizen&#39;s United: <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>And you would also benefits from reading about the Consitution Free Zone and the Authorization for Use of Military Force. </p>

<p>Good on ya for getting involved early. If you build up a good store of references, you&#39;ll be a potent force in rousing the populace so that it can properly focus its efforts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whaaat?  Again WT<em>F</em> are you talking about?  I actually SPECIFICALLY pointed out what it was I meant by the statement that I typed.  I explained it to you.  You asked &quot;What do you mean?&quot;, and I explained it I was using a pun.</p>

<p>If you meant something <em>else</em>, then it was <em>YOUR</em> fault for not being specific enough.  And yet again, you&#39;re STILL not elaborating to any extent on what it is you&#39;re asking.  All you&#39;re doing is being SUPER vague while, with GREAT irony, saying that it&#39;s me that&#39;s not being specific enough.</p>

<p>You get ONE more shot at explaining what you mean.  If you expect any sort of response, try not to be an asshole this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our rights are being taken away is what I meant - i.e. they&#39;re going down/the American people are going down.  Regarding that point, I don&#39;t feel like being more specific not because what I&#39;m saying isn&#39;t true or there isn&#39;t ample evidence, but because well...there <em>is</em> ample evidence, and this isn&#39;t necessarily anything that I (or anyone really) should bother having to explain or qualify to anyone much at all anymore.  Anyone who DOESN&#39;T understand that more and more of our rights are being taken away simply isn&#39;t paying attention.</p>

<p>That&#39;s at least part of why I didn&#39;t and won&#39;t bother being more specific.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>purchase a sturdy hunting knife and a hatchet, i use and recommend SOG. For the back pack, get an internal frame, basically makes carrying fifty plus pounds feel like youre carrying a school backpack. Firearm, if possible, i recommend .22lr, lightweight, doesnt take up much space and is very cheap. have three potential firestarters at all times, matches, lighters, flint and magnesium, steel wool and a nine volt battery is what i am carrying. For water, i have a small carbon filter that is built into a regular sized water bottle, if that fails, boil water and strain it through multiple layers of cloth. in case of rain, i have a tarp for a canopy and rope. i also have a very small butane camp stove if i cannot make a fire. i am carrying a few days worth of canned food, plus a can opener. Pack a small first aid kit, nothing too extensive, but make sure you are able to at least stop bleeding and preform stitches. pack ALOT of good fishing line and a hook, maybe one or two small lures. fishing line doubles as rope, and can be used for the stitches. i also have a thing of multivitamins and vitamin C tablets. get a sleeping bag rated to a least negative twenty. pack an led headlamp, they are smaller/more compact than a regular flashlight. for reading materials, grab a plant identifying book, and a wilderness survival manual. do not pack a tent, they stick out too much and are very cumbersome, instead, learn how to make lean-to&#39;s and other shelters. if you wear glasses, pack a spare AND a repair kit. Your boots should be water proof and your clothing should not be cotton if possible. military folding shovels have a variety of uses and are very compact, invest in one. Last but not least, the flag of your nation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have met so many young people in the last few years who are awake to the madness of this country and this reality. We are waking up faster than ever before, and the powers that be know this; that is why they are tightening their grip. I know it sounds crazy, but the mass awakening and consciousness renaissance is just on the horizon. It has been predetermined since The Big Bang, when everything that we know exploded and set this path into motion so many millions of years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to hear it. As a 30-year-old whose been researching government overreach for over a decade, I&#39;d like to recommend some fundamental reading that will equip you with the referential tools you&#39;ll need to wake other people up. Some are fairly short reads, while others are ridiculously lengthy, like War &amp; Peace. But this is what all those reading assignments and book reports in school have been preparing you for. If you read these documents, you&#39;ll understand and be able to point to evidence of the most greivous extents of the US government&#39;s treasons against its people.</p>

<li>Executive Order 13603: National Defense Resource Preparedness (~12 pages) <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness</a> </li>
<li><p>this order is an amendment to the 1950 Defense Production Act. Among the many important changes is the extension of its uses from only &quot;times of war and national emergency&quot; to &quot;peacetime and times of national emergency. It also authorizes forced human labor during peacetime, and the use of chemical weapons, and can be utilized without Congressional approval.</p></li>
<li><p>2013 National Defense Authorization Act (900+ pages): <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text</a></p></li>
<li><p>This bill is chalk full of hidden gems. It legalizes military jurisdiction on domestic soil, overturning Posse Commitatus. It authorizes Congress to wage <em>offensive</em> cyber warfare (i.e. to attack potential enemies through internets). For being &quot;associated&quot; with enemies of the US, or for being &quot;belligerent&quot; (both of which terms the Pentagon has refused to define under Congressinoal inquiry), it authorizes Homeland Security to remove a person&#39;s citizenship (if they were a US citizen), detain them as a hostile enemy combatant, without charge, without access to an attorney, and without a trial &quot;for as long as the war on terror continues.&quot; And there&#39;s some other horrendous stuff as well. </p></li>
<li><p>Patriot Act: <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/text-usa-patriot-act">http://www.aclu.org/national-security/text-usa-patriot-act</a></p></li>

<p>And you would also benefits from reading about the Consitution Free Zone and the Authorization for Use of Military Force. </p>

<p>Good on ya for getting involved early. If you build up a good store of references, you&#39;ll be a potent force in rousing the populace so that it can properly focus its efforts. </p>
