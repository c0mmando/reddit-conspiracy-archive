       No no. He never lied. He said he was the most transparent and open administration.  The gov barely tries to hide it anymore. FOIA requests come back entirely redacted etc.  It's very transparent and open. "Fuck you citizen."

       Obama's main argument to overcome the Right's 'lack of experience' canard was that he would, quote "defer to his advisers" and take into consideration prefessional assessment from experienced members of his Cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I, just like everyone else, never bothered to ask "Well, what advisers are you considering?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we know. You want to know what the real Obama Administration agenda is, look at his advisers and what their titles are when they're not working in an official capacity.

       They will continue sleepwalking. A woman while watching this on tv said to me "well if you have nothing to hide then theres no problem. These people will go to their graves justifying any illegal act as needed to keep people safe from those scary terrorists. And tptb will continue to serve up just enough to fake terror attacks to keep
 the fear rising.

       I've already heard enough people completely willing to do just that "if it keeps me safe" on a flight. They didn't understand that regardless of asshole checks, the TSA hasn't caught anyone before they boarded with a dangerous device with intent to use it.
      </p>

       They've caught like, what? One dude who accidentally had a pistol in his luggage he didn't even know about? Maybe a lighter? A few thousand water-filled bottles?

       Yes.  However this quote was an honest statement made by a persecuted man.  It deserves to be used with respect.  I agree with the sentiment.  I don't agree with the triviality in which it is used.

       Its bog standard psychology. Your inherent, prime evil fear is death, your survival mechanism is one of the most prominent. Now, you keep repeating over and over again that you're in danger and it sets in. That's why they keep repeating the same things over and over and over. It isn't exactly a conscious thought either. Nobody consciously thinks about terrorism and its danger but its a subconscious thought in the back of your mind.

       People are very docile and I think we are made to be this way because of the food and technology. Our food makes us tired and unhealthy, we all have to work nonstop to survive, and to cope many people become completely distracted by Tvs and computers. Even the children don't go out anymore. We're being taught to be docile, weak, and distracted. It's awful.

       But this behaviour is normal, that's the problem. Its normal to come home and put the TV on for 5 hours and go to bed. Its normal to talk about meaningless, celebrity bullshit. And anti intellectualism is normal. Talking about politics and current affairs isn't normal, you're a geek and a bore for giving a shit about what effects your life and everybody else's lives.

       I swear people are also taught to think that they are stupid. I've met so many people that are brilliant at their jobs or hobbys, are brilliant at something and yet are convinced that they are stupid. Especially older people with computers, not knowing how to use a computer well doesn't make you stupid any more than not knowing how to do an oil change on a car makes someone else stupid. Seems like a fear of failure thing to me, or something, I'm not sure. Are they scared of what their brain can do? The state of the world can be scary when people first start facing up to it.

       Yeah, that's apart of what I'm saying. We are being made sick and tired and overworked, so at the end of the day all people can really muster is to watch their TV shows. Their lives are boring and tiring and they want to get away from it all. It's all very sad. I think its all apart of the plan. To make us weak and docile, to accept it, and continue it so none of us actually DO anything.

       What most people don't understand is that we break the law a few times each and everyday. There are so many laws that we have almost no choice!
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe me?  Simply do a search "How we break the law everyday".  We don't need to shift our definitions of what is legal, they already have the laws in place to screw us when ever they want.

       The breaking point should have happened a while ago, and it didn't. Because the enemy is very versed in PR and crowd management. And our public school system has informed the simple that if a person doesn't have authority, they can't possibly be right about anything that doesn't fit the accepted narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how people less educated than you can be convinced you're not smart enough to be right about anything.

       it's funny because we've known that we were right all along. I can't tell you how many times, in conversations with friends, where it's ended with "just wait, this shit is gonna come out, just wait." and they scoffed, and I laughed, and we laughed, and we all got more drunk, andonesingletearrolleddownmycheek, and we all laughed again and got more drunk.

       which demonstrates to me that the state has (and will) continue its tyranical control over the sheeple. so there is a co-enabling relationship between the oppressed and the oppressors. I just wish we, as non-sheeple, could separate ourselves from the sheeple. but the gov't considers all of us the same.

       Getting rid of your phone and computer would be the worst thing to do, it's abandoning the sheeple to it while giving up a useful resource. I say make as much use of it as possible, keep spreading as much information as possible. Safety in numbers, there has to be a point where there is too many people talking about anti government shit for them to be able to do anything about it.

       They're already doing the "parsing" dance. "Well they need a warrant to hear your actual conversations" "It's not like anyone in government is competent enough to do anything with it" . I really like the Senates reaction to the revelation "I’m a Verizon customer. I don’t mind Verizon turning over records to the government if the government is going to make sure that they try to match up a known terrorist phone with somebody in the United States. I don’t think you’re talking to the terrorists. I know you’re not. I know I’m not. So we don’t have anything to worry about.” -Lindsey Graham.
Feinsteins is the best. “It’s called protecting America.” and it's said in such a belabored aristocratic tone as if she's just exhausted by the peasants bothering her.

       I would ask both Senators if they were fine with me just wandering into their house and computer, digging through their drawers just to make sure they're on the up and up. I mean after all they are employed at my expense, as a citizen shouldn't I have have the ability to make sure they're not hiding anything?

       haha, and all the while, it took an old man to find the boston bomber in his backyard. I love how pretty much every terrorist is pretty open that they are aggressive in the first place because of the usa's aggressive military policies, and it's pretty obvious that all this "terrorism" (whatever the fuck that means anymore) is just blowback from years and years of shady usa dealings. god some of these statesmen's agendas are so transparently autocratic it's absurd. they're so detached from reality, they're probably so afraid that the slaves are going to revolt after they've made their whole living off of undercutting the people who they used to get rich.

       Senators and Congresscritters were the FIRST to be illegally wiretapped. I'm almost sure of it. How else do you control a government body full of individuals with differing views?

       Both parties unanimously agree on the 'important' stuff, and vote accordingly. They only differ on 'wedge' issues that can be farmed for soundbites and talking points, the better to rile up their respective bases come election time.

       Nope, not as a "citizen". A citizen is lower on the totem pole than them. The flow of power is from creator to created. You may well have another title available which is higher than citizen though. I think it's worth looking into.

       it's funny too because the people who deny it are often the ones who do no research on anything. they use their own ignorance as a shield to block  out people who actually do research and have legitimate concerns.

       The next stage of my disillusionment was having had done this sort of thing for years and years and then when things started turning that way I wasn't given any credit.  I've learned to stop throwing pearls to swine.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] I'll add that I did notice myself hating people and the system a lot because external validation was far and few between.  Also I wasn't always right about timings and orders.  Some years ago the song Iron Man by Iron Maiden seemed a bit relevant for me.  I was never shown the exact future with crystal clarity like the guy in that song but I certainly was seeing farther than the vast majority of people.  Mostly I was just really paying attention to people who did know the direction that things were going.  So looking back I think that it is important to not dream of everything going to shit just to be validated that you were correct because even if you push the button and destroy the world like the guy in that song you might never receive validation.  So it seems that you have to plunge headlong into the pursuit of truth and in this case needing validation is a vice or maybe even a sin.  The world has come around to me and now the masses can gnaw away at the extremely obvious exposes.  I have already mostly lost interest in these things and I am onto a new sort of trip.  Things tend to be accelerating so I predict that a whole lot of people won't need ten years to catch up to me but possibly only five or so.  The main concern that I have is not being around people when they realize that their world is upside down.  The agony of this moment is too much for me to bear so I opt-out of that.  I know my limitations and I can't be around lots of people who are emotionally flailing while trying to get a grip on the world.  A few people is quaint and it is really great to have a philosophical disciple, like others have done for me.  When the whole society is doing it at once I just can't stand it.  On the way down they latch onto me and then on the way back up I am discarded.

        The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.

       for the first Matrix film.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's really simple. The truth of that one is that design staff on The Matrix were given Invisibles collections and told to make the movie look like my books. This is a reported fact. The Wachowskis are comic book creators and fans and were fans of my work, so it's hardly surprising. I was even contacted before the first Matrix movie was released and asked if I would contribute a story to the website.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not some baffling 'coincidence' that so much of The Matrix is plot by plot, detail by detail, image by image, lifted from Invisibles so there shouldn't be much controversy. The Wachowskis nicked The Invisibles and everyone in the know is well aware of this fact but of course they're unlikely to come out and say it.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was just too bad they deviated so far from the Invisibles philosophical template in the second and third movies because they blundered helplessly into boring Catholic theology, proving that they hadn't HAD the 'contact' experience that drove The Invisibles, and they wrecked both
'Reloaded' and 'Revolutions' on the rocks of absolute incomprehension. They should have kept on stealing from me and maybe they would have wound up with something to really be proud of - a movie that could change minds and hearts and worlds.
       </p>
       <p>
        I love the first Matrix movie which I think is a real work of cinematic genius and very timely but I've now heard from several people who worked on The Matrix and they've all confirmed that they were given Invisibles books as reference. That's how it is. I'm not angry about it anymore, although at one time I was because they made millions from what was basically a Xerox of my work and to be honest, I would be happy with just one million so I didn't have to work thirteen hours of every fucking day, including weekends.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the end, I was glad they got the ideas out but very disappointed that they blew it so badly and distorted all the Gnostic transcendental aspects that made the first film so strong and potent. If they had any sense, they would have befriended me instead of pissing me off. They seem like nice boys.

       Truly it never will, yet experience would grow stale if it did end, no? Chapel Perilous has many corridors which may first appear as grand rooms...we're all here to live as "best" we can, we are living in a very important time in humanity I think, we should do all we can to help our planet and species survive well. Whatever that means, as in the end no matter how far the rabbit hole goes we are all living life by the seat of our pants and this is all we have. Rambling cause I'm drunk but I hope the changing times will pass with minimal effect to you and your loved ones...whatever happens.

       All of this is forcing people to overcome their core programming.

       Sometimes when I'm in a more enlightened state, I can see this to be true. That all of this - that our perceived enemies - really just exists to provide us the contrast in which to make a conscious choice. One way or the other, but consciously.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then some days I just think that's a crock of shit and I feel like no matter how aware and at peace with it all I am, they're going to come for me some day, too, and there won't even be a choice.

       I know plenty of people mad about this spying thing, but good god... if it came out that our government
       <em>
        without a doubt
       </em>
       did 9/11 there'd be riots in the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's when you grab your AR-15 (the ones that have been flying off shelves for the past 4 years) and have a 10-million man/woman/child march on DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if it was proven, the only possible outcome would be the immediate unseating of the government pending a new constitutional amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occupy/Tea Party Left/Right doesn't matter. That would be the final straw IMHO.

       You're attributing far too much to our government. They're not really in control - it's a tangled mess of bureaucrats in the regulatory industries, NSA, CIA, white house, big corporations and their lobbyists, congressmen, senators, even the president, fighting over their own spheres of influence and trying to hide things from one another. We already have fairly decent evidence that our government knew about 9/11
       <a href="http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/11/13809524-evidence-piles-up-that-bush-administration-got-many-pre-911-warnings?lite">
        well in advance
       </a>
       and we knew that it was going to be conducted by plane at least a month in advance. Look up
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacarias_Moussaoui">
        Zacarias Moussaoui
       </a>
       - his flight school instructors told the FBI they believed he was a terrorist in training almost a month before 9/11, and he had a history of supporting radical Islam and jihad, yet shockingly little was done with this prior to 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I certainly don't think our government orchestrated the attacks, I strongly believed they tied their own hands and diverted their attention. All of this evidence, while circumstantial, paints a fairly convincing picture, yet people don't care.

       I would hope that you are right. However, history shows us that the gov't can commit major atrocities, and while the people will be pissed and protest, after the dust settles, the same gov't is still in power, even though the scapegoat leaders and politicians will change. but the true (secret) owners and puppeteers (behind the scenes) will still be in power.

       It helped, sure, but it was certainly not the first application of the medicine. It came... what, not even a year after the general election process was utterly overturned and the president effectively selected by a group of nine people? And where were the riots? No, it was already a complacent population; 9/11 was just the beginning of the next stage of the abuse.

       I think most people know the dream is unobtainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why television is so popular. You get to life the dream vicariously though people more attractive than you.

       Think about how many women have decided who in their friend circle corresponds with a certain character from Sex In The City or otherwise? Even though the characters themselves are no where near the reality of living in a major city. They represent the monied, privileged elite. But the poor and downtrodden immediately identify with THEM, while their neighbors remain murky, unscrupulous strangers.

       Lots of Americans won't snap out of it until there's warfare in their daily lives. And I don't think I need to stress that it would be too late by then to learn objectively about what's happening.

        these publications

       this is to let us know it is part of life. nothing happens and in 5 years it is just accepted and common.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the purpose in letting it out. so that in the future they don't have to hide it and they can call it legal, because some corrupt senators, or fearful senators would allow it in the first place.

       btw where are the terrorists? 1 in ten years? We had more than that pre 911 in the 1990's. Tim McVeigh and Unibomber, but we didn't have to destroy the constitution over those. Boston was the first time since 2001.... THERE ARE NO TERRORISTS!

       You are correct. It was. Additionally this story has been covered by the main stream media for some time now. This was not put into light by the people of r/conspiracy or any like minded person. Rather, this has been revealed by due process.

       What most people don't understand is that we break the law a few times each and everyday. There are so many laws that we have almost no choice!

      <p>
       Don't believe me?  Simply do a search "How we break the law everyday".  We don't need to shift our definitions of what is legal, they already have the laws in place to screw us when ever they want.

       Which is a problem because too many laws means the cops and courts basically choose which laws to enforce or not enforce.  This could give the balance of power to the judicial branch, effectively turning us into a corrupt police state.

       I don't think I can stand for this shit, whether there is some vast conspiracy or not, just looking at real facts, no conspiracy jumps in logic etc., this is fucking terrible!  Could we start a new movement called We The People or something, not Anonymous because we obviously are not anymore, not Occupy because we're not "occupying" anything or anywhere, this is our country and we're supposed to run it.  Mass protest/gathering at Congress, The White House, Supreme Court, NSA buildings, everywhere that we know an injustice has been committed by our government against the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SC especially.  They are supposed to be our last line of defense against our government, to tell them and stop them when they've gone too far, but they have fucking ALLOWED this.  It is legal! They are just as guilty of this TREASON against not the government but the PEOPLE.  Bradley Manning is headed towards almost certain death because he leaked private government information to the public, we need to punish those who are stealing the public's private information (I AM IN NO WAY CONDONING MURDER, JUST MENTIONING THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE FOR US, WE NEED TO AT LEAST SEND ONE BAD POLITICIAN TO JAIL AND/OR LOSE THEIR JOB).
      </p>
      <p>
       You can mention all the ways in which the situation now is different than the one in which the American Revolution was fought, but the principles are the same.  If you, we, are not happy with the government, then we have the right to fight as hard as we possibly can to fix this or compromise, and right now, there's no compromise.  This isn't just convicted or suspected criminals / terrorists losing all privacy rights anymore, this is EVERYONE, YOU are a suspected terrorist, if not now then you will be, you might be (jeez I wonder why they would think that), that is why they have done this.  Your child, from this day forward, all of his life will be cataloged and stored not by you, but by the same government that is responsible for more murder, corruption, and injustice than we as a nation could ever let ourselves commit.  We don't want to revolt and murder because we are good people, that's why we have lost power, that's the difference between us and them.  They will do anything to get what they want.  It's about time we ask ourselves, will we?
      </p>
      <p>
       So imagine we are pre-Revolution America, it isn't far off.  Ignoring the numerous people the government, military, police have killed, are killing, will kill, we have Bradley Manning.  He is a soldier, before he did what he did, he was one of many called a 'Hero.'  Don't heroes do heroic deeds?  He didn't sell this information to other countries, he didn't go on a murder spree of innocent civilians in Iraq or Afghanistan, he didn't attack his own military base, he did what he thought was right, and no harm came from it, except his own.  If there was a 'Dark Zero Thirty' type propaganda movie for the people not the government, based on Bradley Manning, with no Hollywood BS, purely based off of facts, if presented to you as a purely fictional story, would you be rooting for him to be punished, to die?  Wouldn't the government be the antagonist, even without bias or embellishment on either side? If he had done this, but back in pre-Revolution America, don't you think we would be looking back on him as one of the heroes along with George Washington?  And don't you think his arrest/'trial'/imminent death would be a focal point of the Revolution?  He would have been a martyr, or a freed POW who helped topple the government that captured him.
You learned in school about American history and especially the Revolution, as well as various forms of "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."  We The People need to listen to these words NOW not tomorrow.  Our situation will never be EXACTLY the same as a previous one, but the basic premise is the same, our rights are being violated.  And if we haven't learned to do whatever it takes to get them back, then we really have forgotten our past.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this talk on this thread especially on how people are sedated with distractions and entertainment, the way TPTB want it, and it's not hard to believe that we are just sentient primates distracted by a new toy in our cage that have to give part of our food and cower in fear from the imposing Alpha Male when he fears we have wronged him, because THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.  Well, fuck that.  We aren't background characters in a fiction political thriller, we aren't the people we've read about in history class.  We are the people that our future generations will read about, write about, look up to, unless we sit here and let this continue. We can actually do something about this world, dammit, haven't you learned that?  No matter how microscopic, the change you have made will affect the rest of everyone's life, so don't you want to make a large meaningful one?
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to do SOMETHING, and I know it's a common question and argument, what DO we do?  If you don't know what to do does that mean you do nothing?  I can't believe that is the reaction from the same people who donated money for a bullied bus driver, who've exposed rapists, who want to prosecute people for turning a blind eye to all kinds of crimes/injustices.  What are we doing now if not the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been numerous 'wars' fronted by different government agencies throughout the years, and now we have a few in the spotlight lately, including the Drug War, the War against terrorism, they've all been fronts for what is the real War, the War against the People.  Hasn't that been the case for every evil ruler we've ever know?  One person or group of people turning the loss of rights of the people they control into profit, luxury, and power for themselves, no matter what the cost?  Yes, we might be the "Best" country in the world even after this, the most "free", but don't you think we can do BETTER, even if just a little bit?
      </p>
      <p>
       We might not know EXACTLY what to do, but we can start by agreeing what things we need to change, and start from the bottom up, and I say we start with Bradley Manning.  We need to go out in full force and protest to have this man freed.  If HSBC was only slapped on the wrist, if we cannot try our previous government officials for war crimes, can we not at least free one of the people who actually followed orders and protected our freedom and did what we all would have, SHOULD HAVE done?  This should be our first goal, it is more imminent than anything, someone is going to die, dammit! And in this we will find the truth of this whole situation, that the People rule this Nation, it's just a matter of which people.  The people in charge, they've done what they needed to, they're doing what they need to stay in charge, it is quite apparent.  Isn't it time for us to do the same?
They want a war, and a war they will have, one in which there should be no more bloodshed.  If we are to be the revolution then we must form like our enemy in an attempt in order to win this fight, form like our Revolutionary peers did, with multiple roles to be filled to ensure that we can win, but adapted for this day and age.  Those who can and are willing will protest always, we all try to vote people into office and try to get them up as far the chain of command as we can, we donate our 'arms' to our 'soldiers' in the form of propaganda, signs, forum posts etc, we feed them, we clothe them; we do whatever we need to help them even if we can't or won't risk everything, if we all just donated a tiny fraction of our paychecks and or time to this cause, don't you think we can win?  The "Hippies" get to keep being hip and protesting, and the rest of you get to keep on with your lives while still helping the cause.  How is this a bad thing?  But no doubt, we need a LOT of people to spend a LOT of time protesting and disrupting TPTB, which is why we need everyone to do their part, no matter how big, no matter how small, because we can make it work.  I'm sure someone can take my ideas and flesh them out, because I don't think what I'm suggesting is far off from what needs to happen.  We can't fix this government/world all at once, but any little thing helps.

       Yeah, this isn't the sort of thing that people laugh at conspiracy theorists for. Three-letter agencies doing ugly shit without warrants has been mainstream news for at least a decade. The fact that it's become a big deal again doesn't somehow mean the decade of conspiracy bullshit about 9/11 is vindicated.

       Incidentally, the NSA spying operation was never a conspiracy theory, people knew about it in detail from 2005 onward. There were even pictures. It's not exactly the kind of thing you'd have to go to godlikeproductions to read about. It's just that nobody statistically significant seemed to care so no one did anything. Make of that what you will, I know I have.

       On the plus side for us, they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       need a way to filter out the non-threats.  Political writers and theorists are harmless, but we use red-flag keywords for posting and searching all the time.  So we may all be on a special "just another tinfoil hat" list that prevents us from being added to the "major threat, send a human to follow-up" lists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine that we get taken off the 'tinfoil hat' list the day we order large quantities of diesel fuel and fertilizer - for our urban apartment.

       Honestly, I've been living paranoid in knowledge of these facts for the past three years or so (when I really started to understand how the .gov was collecting intel on US citizens).  It basically made me have my own version of operational security and changed my browsing habits.  I realized that I had reached the boundaries of acceptable "free speech" and that was that.  I like how everyone is up in arms NOW.  It's like, maybe you should have been paying closer attention to the laws being written and how they might affect you.  Yes, YOU, the person the government would NEVER have a reason to collect information on.  The thing is, it's all automations.  It doesn't matter to a computer program.

       I don't understand the wording here constantly. It is 'funny'? Pretty sure there are a lot of better words to convey what you are feeling. It is: Scary, pitiful, hopeless, outrageous, faggoty, unreal. I could go on and on, but 'funny', is not the word I would use here under any circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to be heard and people to listen, these words matter. Take news stations for example. They get people to listen, even when they don't even have news. They just say 'DEVASTATING!' and everyone listens.

       I can't stand the response I get when I try to inform people of these issues! "What's the problem with that?" "I have nothing to hide."  I appreciate the response on here from u/______
       <strong>
        <em>
         lol

       _____ that you may have nothing to hide but you do have something to

       This is all just the Bush warrantless wiretapping controversy but
       <em>
        surprise
       </em>
       it never actually ended and seamlessly moved from one administration to the next.   But what really makes me sick about this whole thing is the rank partisanship of both parties.  When Bush did it all the liberals were up in arms and the republicans were doing their best to justify it.  Now its under Obama and the liberals are being apologists for it and all the republicans are furious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only constant is that both the parties are all the fucking same even though they pretend to hate each other.  Its just a fucking game to them and all they care about is whose team is winning

       This whole thing was in the second tier news years ago not sure why anyone would have denied it was true then the sources were credible and the companies admitted to do it. There really wasn't any confusion back then. I can't remember exactly but wasn't a large story run in Wired? and it was in several other larger sources as well. Didn't really seem to be any controversy, guess the only difference now is that a whole lot more people are a bit more savvy about the innerwebs than they were back then.

       I noticed that all of the "Top Secret" labels are red, which would be outside of NSA and DoD guidelines as TS is pink (Secret is red). Not to mention I can't think of a way that it could even be verified as the NSA sure as hell wouldn't own up to it, and its doubtful that their congressional over-site would either.

       I think it would be great to have a WE TOLD YOU SO post which is upvoted to the homepage.  (I don't do it, because I don't feel worth of it, as I am not an active member of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       This to show all the skeptics that there are indeed conspiracies. People quickly laugh at the thought of 9/11 being an inside job, the government spying on their own and other conspiracy theories. Well... this information should make them think twice.

       No one will give a shit, except for those intent on using this to attack their political enemies. ACLU and EFF's response hopefully will give it a bit more exposure and force the trimming of the bluntest edges, there will be some fawning PR from companies promising to never ever do again what they've not been doing... and that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I smell the biggest effect will be in whistleblowing and dissent. Even retweeting something or e-signing a petition will be perceived as a big risk by those in the fence, all those with something to lose. Fear, the mind killer indeed.

       As I've said before, what is this accomplishing? Our lives are temporary. Our meaning in the grand scheme of the Universe is negligible. We, currently, have no impact on anything outside of the Earth. Their attempts are futile and as we die, they die eventually as well. And again, for what?

       I can't help but think no one is going to change their minds about Obama. When he was elected in 2008, I thought, "Bummer, but at least four years from now, when everyone realizes how fake he is, we'll elect someone who's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       different." Oh, how wrong I was.

       I think it's great news.

      <p>
       When you had all of the Reps defending Bush's patriot act, the Dems were howling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Obama promised a change, and the Dems further condemned the Bush administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now in light of this news, the Reps are now hammering Obama, but for what? It's just an extension of the Bush administration policies. That gets pointed out in every debate I've seen on the topic over the last 24 hours.
      </p>

       So now both parties are angry about the same thing, and neither has a puppet hero President to champion as the hero we need.

       Human instinct is to choose a "tribe", the people are divided and will remain divided until we have another civil war. Then it get's worse from there. That is reality. nobody seems to notice that they have already made the final move and it is "Checkmate" for the general population. Slavery from here on out on a world wide scale.

       Not really. I just look at facts. He who controls the money controls all. This is reality and you can accept it and do your best to survive as long as you can, but the control apparatus is already in place. It has happened throughout history, we just have the technology now to really control more than Hitler, Stalin and Mao could have ever imagined. This is fact, the New World Order will accomplish their goals and billions will die at their hands. You are shooting a rifle and they are calling in bombers! they have bases world wide, so how you going to take them out? You have no money to do it, they screen every email, call and IM. They are setting up drone bases all over the world. They don't even need troops in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have already used it to control the world, do you think they will not use it on us? The only question is will you die fighting or will you die as a slave? over 97% (If not higher) will die as slaves. This is reality! You can't plan on "hope" because hope is not a method...nor is it a strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The odds are stacked against us greatly because most do not even know they are slaves, it will be easy for them to demonize and criminalize any voice that reveals them. You will die in the streets or the wilderness fighting, or you can be eliminated through the slavery system.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are on this site making comments and statements right now, you will either go quietly or violently, but you will go...probably sooner than you think. That is fact.

       Most of you are so concerned over having some one else's validation whom you judge and label as less than and it's just ridiculous. Why can't you find resolve in your on view of the world? Insecurity or fear?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your tactics to share information is also really divisive. If the "sheeple" did align with you opinions as a whole you would just ostracize them from your subculture because you see knowledge as a competition
      </p>
      <p>
       The very thing you guys typically complain about, you directly contribute to it. Separatist and elitism. I'd recommend focusing a bit in the mirror.

       Only in timelines! But the info from most are pretty accurate and has come to pass so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe it is too late for us as a race (Human Race). They (Elites) have the technology to eliminate any potential threats when they are ready, the control apparatus is already in place to deal with the likes of us. Our only refuge will be the wilderness, just like Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, all of central and south Africa and much, much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       They control energy, food, water and everything essential to life and everything that can end life. The elite have become Gods in their own eyes and will soon be Gods in the eyes of the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are going to crash everything and come in themselves as the saviors! The masses will believe it.

       Well, you can hide from that under large organic matter, like trees. This is why we are still fighting in many other countries, but if you are on the grid, you are toast at will. You can actually use mylar on the top of an umbrella and avoid being noticed. You just can't wear it as clothes as your body heat would heat the material. There are ways to beat their detection, but you have to be prepared and know what you are doing.

       It's not that people don't care or aren't aware of such things anymore - deep down many of them knew things like this to be true.  It's that most have lost hope in regards to how they can help fix a problem like this.  You are up against an entire government, bought and sold by the corporations.

       This video shows that even the FBI's phone calls have been compromised since then.

       When I show all of this to the ones who doubted me before I feel vindication.  But I also feel complete sadness for the world that it's actually being proven true.  Once particular secret information is given to the masses that's when I become terrified for what's to come next.

       Because before, "Being right" meant being a "conspiracy theorist" and was dismissed because of the stigma associated with the term. I agree that patting yourself on the back accomplishes nothing, but you can't say we didn't see it coming.

       I don't think there were many people that denied possible use of the PATRIOT Act... But really though if they can't even keep internal documents about corporate data sharing a secret, I'm not sure how they'd ever pull off something such as... say... a staged terror attack with hundreds of actors betraying the public.

       They will never eat crow. It's not in their DNA to concede anything.  Instead they will try to downplay the threat and fallout as much as possible and will likely begin defending the governments VERY VALUABLE reasons for a program like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see this shit with medical/pharmaceutical apology all the time.  No matter how many studies you show them, THOSE studies don't count for reasons only they can justify with their supreme critical thinking skills.  Just like this thing recently with the GMO foods and tumors in rats... the stock standard skeptic response: Everything gives rats tumors!
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I guess there's not even any reason to do research anymore if you are going to dismiss all the studies whose outcomes you disagree with.

       They will never give an inch, and you should never expect them to change that tune.  You aren't dealing with rational people, you're dealing with narcissists who MUST BE RIGHT, at any cost.

       See, but there was evidence. Everyone chose to ignore it, or claim that the NSA constructing giant data centers in the middle of the country was just for 'security'. Even now, there are people using the argument that this is necessary to protect us.

       That is the big one that they're building right now. They have rooms in every major telecom company as well. It's very likely there are more data centers that are not known to the public. This one is just to up their storage capacity massively and centralize the data storage.

       He does not need to source that. He is not making a direct claim of fact, he is saying that he feels its likely there are more data centers not publicly known.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was saying there
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       more data centers, then you could call him out for a source.

       I should criticise that part as well:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually very
       <em>
        unlikely
       </em>
       that there are more data centers that are unknown to the public.  Why?  Look at the scale of that operation.  It is utterly conspicuous, and it's not even being done in secret, or under pretenses that the data center belongs to someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that were going on elsewhere in the country, and they were being secretive about it, it would garner more attention than even this one in Utah, which I had never even heard of.

       No, me knowing something or not knowing something has no bearing on whether it's true, or necessarily how important it is.  I never said what you suggested.  Nice strawman argument.

       The government can and does keep secrets.  What I was saying was that there was no secret about the NSA data center, and people knew about it. I was not one of those people. Nice strawman argument.

       Most people

       know that the government conducts surveillance. Yesterday, they learned about a big part of it. Now we'll just have to see how pissed off they get about it.

       He was only talking about AT&amp;T, where they apparently had the same setup at something called site 3.  So he naturally concluded that there must be a 1 and 2.  I really liked the part where he said there may as well be 4, 5, and 6 as well.  Why stop there?  Plenty of positive integers to use after that.

       How are you supposed to show no-one has been arrested?  What evidence would suffice to prove it?

       There aren't any records on who

        In some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence.

       No, the point is it's extremely difficult to
       <strong>
        demonstrably prove
       </strong>
       a negative, like 'x' didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 'x' did actually happen and its reasonable to assume an occurrence of 'x' will leave evidence 'y' behind, than a
       <em>
        lack
       </em>
       of evidence 'y' can be reasonably taken as evidence that 'x' has not occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scenario you're describing would inherently be 'inconclusive'; in no way could you extrapolate from that and arrive at something you could
       <em>
        reliably
       </em>
       call "truth".

       That's not how reality works dude.  Person A make statement.  Person B asks Person A to validate the statement with a source.  Person A provides source.  You can't just say things, even though it may seem perfectly logical in your head, and expect people to just believe you because it may not seem perfectly logical in their heads.  But even so, an intelligent person won't trust their "common sense" and require evidence before they just start repeating Person A's statement as fact.

       All of these (and more) are statements parroted over and over by conspiracy theorists without any facts, evidence or common sense being used.  And when someone points out the facts that prove these statements false, conspiracy theorists call them a shill and completely ignore the information and ostracize the person that stated it. (for a perfect example of this, visit
       <a href="/r/conspiracyV2">

       You meant "It's". You wanted the contraction of "It" and "is".

       Not the possessive "its".

       Except, of course, for my defense of the console Ouya - which was created by Rupert Murdoch to destroy Microsoft.  And, of course, how I echoed the scathing Fox News expose on how dogs don't necessarily show signs of abuse simply by showing signs of submission.  Then again, remember the time I commented on how I believed a man built his own Ironman suit for cosplay?  That was taken straight from the Fox and Friends report on how Liberals are using cosplay to make you open your rectum for homosexual penetration while you blaspheme against Jesus.

       And Game of Thrones?  The reason I love it: Fox News told me to.

       Skyrim?  Fox News.  They be all about that RPG shit.

       ad hominem: Latin for "to the man." Someone attacking the person instead of the argument. Usually made by someone who cannot defend their position with evidence, facts, or reason.  Traditionally done by using labeling (E.G. calling someone a "shill"), straw man arguments (using hyperbole and misrepresentation of an opponent's position) , name calling, offensive remarks (E.G. "You're born with the (in your case single digit) IQ you were born with.") and anger.

       I should criticise that part as well:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually very
       <em>
        unlikely
       </em>
       that there are more data centers that are unknown to the public.  Why?  Look at the scale of that operation.  It is utterly conspicuous, and it's not even being done in secret, or under pretenses that the data center belongs to someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that were going on elsewhere in the country, and they were being secretive about it, it would garner more attention than even this one in Utah, which I had never even heard of.

       First they came for the communists,
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.

       Its bog standard psychology. Your inherent, prime evil fear is death, your survival mechanism is one of the most prominent. Now, you keep repeating over and over again that you're in danger and it sets in. That's why they keep repeating the same things over and over and over. It isn't exactly a conscious thought either. Nobody consciously thinks about terrorism and its danger but its a subconscious thought in the back of your mind.

       How are you supposed to show no-one has been arrested?  What evidence would suffice to prove it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There aren't any records on who
       <em>
        hasn't
       </em>
       been arrested.

        In some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence.

       Because before, "Being right" meant being a "conspiracy theorist" and was dismissed because of the stigma associated with the term. I agree that patting yourself on the back accomplishes nothing, but you can't say we didn't see it coming.

       No, the point is it's extremely difficult to
       <strong>
        demonstrably prove
       </strong>
       a negative, like 'x' didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 'x' did actually happen and its reasonable to assume an occurrence of 'x' will leave evidence 'y' behind, than a
       <em>
        lack
       </em>
       of evidence 'y' can be reasonably taken as evidence that 'x' has not occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scenario you're describing would inherently be 'inconclusive'; in no way could you extrapolate from that and arrive at something you could
       <em>
        reliably
       </em>
       call "truth".
