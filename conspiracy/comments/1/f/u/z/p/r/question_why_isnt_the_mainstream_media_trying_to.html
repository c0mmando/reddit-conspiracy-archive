       The Turkish protests were clearly buried deep in various MSM outlets.  Why is this NSA leak front and center?  Seems fishy.

       I think this one is un-buryable.  It's like a freaking zombie apocalypse of news stories.  It's overwhelming in scope and yet affects everyone who owns a phone or computer (literally almost every American) on a personal level.  The fact that every American is being tracked, monitored and spied upon by our own Government completely nullifies the notion that we are the free and open society we wanted to be.

       That's a interesting idea. The guise of freedom.

       Maybe your right. Maybe now is the time they say fuck it and lock the whole country down.
      </p>
      <p>
       They might say go to work, eat the food watch the tv and shut the fuck up. If you do this everything will be fine.  Keep your ass in line and your won't have to worry about anything.

       Maybe they are annoyed with charde and realize the really don't even need to perpatrate it any more. Americans are now such fat complacent imbeciles that they may even welcome a nanny government.

       This was my position on why the MSM was picking it up at all. Obama said just today that the American people were now mature enough to have the debate on the balance of privacy and security. Which, in my mind means that they think that we're complacent enough to grant them what remains of our liberties.

       Maybe we can petition to the Chinese, as demonstration of futility and hypocrisy of government. Just as those poor Chinese people ironically asked Obama for help(very sad circumstance considering Obama ignores 99% American petitions)

       Even with this story, most Americans will continue to think this is the most free country on earth. As long as that delusion is maintained, the government can continue to encroach on freedoms.

       Hah we "liberals" were against this mass surveillance back in 2001 with the authorization of the Patriot Act, and lo and behold we "liberals" were right all along.   It gets so annoying to be right 10 years before everyone else. I'm not shocked at all about these mass surveillance revelations.

       I think the "liberal" term was really a swipe at Obamanoids. A lot of conspiracy theorists are conservative on a lot of issues, but liberal on a lot of issues too - the point is that we generally don't have allegiance to one of the two main parties' ideologies because we realize that they are both controlled by the same power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Liberals" that we really hate right now are the ones who are apologists for the current administration. During the Bush years, we hated the "Neocons". Ultimately, today's "Liberals" and yesterdays "Neocons" stand (and stood) for the same things - Patriot Act, Wars, Racist Prison System, Bloated Budgets, Bank Bailouts etc. etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are one of us (which I think you are) then I can understand how it is confusing for you to think of yourself as a liberal, and then see that some of us are describing "Liberals" as part of the problem. What is happening is that the word "Liberal" has taken on a new meaning for some of us recently (rather like happy people were suddenly upset to learn that they could no longer refer to themselves as "gay" when that word took on a new meaning a couple of decades ago).
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that explains it. I don't think it serves any of us well to create divisions among ourselves, just because we have differing beliefs on certain issues. We are all interested in discovering the hidden truth, and on a lot of the big issues, we ALL (pretty much) agree, just because common sense usually transcends political ideology. This is one of those big issues.

Anonymous was created to pressure corporations and government agencies to get serious about securing their technological infrastructure, and this news is being used to get everyday citizens to start using encryption and to fortify the public technological infrastructure.

       I honestly think that they're allowing the story to remain this viral to gauge the reaction of the public, allowing them an easier bridge to altering media statements, etc. in "favor" of the public view.
       <em>
        E.g.
       </em>
       Stating metadata was just "outgoing/incoming calls and duration", when in fact it is much, much more detailed than that.

       The public needs to feel like they have a voice. So making planned responses to subjects like this gives the "illusion" of the counter-point being heard. So the by stander watching the news debate against itself makes the viewer feel like the point of view was heard, reviewed, and refuted although zero discussion actually took place because you cannot talk to a television broadcast/news article.

       This has been going on since at least 2006, when I learned of it.  It is very odd that they come out and announce it now...unless you realize that they had to do so at some point if they want to use the data to bust people publicly (as opposed to saying that crooks butt-dialed 911).  That's the creepy part, to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also had to announce it at some point because it is only a step on the ladder to hell they seem to be pushing us all down.  Once the public accepts this crap, further crap can be rained (reigned?) down upon us.

       Does anyone think this will lead to Turkey like protests in America? I think the reaction to this will tell you if things are ever going to change or not. I've allways thought for anything big to happen there needs to be a shared experiance of everyone being violated. The only people not affected by this are the Amish.

       An individual News Agency decided to stand up to the US gov't. Others followed, for once. While the US is trying to soften the magnitude of the US crimes, it's taking this chance.

      <p>
       For a while, the US protected and coddled the media, the media then listened and were directed by the US. The US violated the media's perceived protection and they were looking for an opportunity. This was it.

       In my opinion, it's so it doesn't get out of hand. As long as they can go along with the initial story, they are able to take the wheel and shift public opinion in the future. This way, they are able to maintain credibility and then downplay the story in the future. They will find a way to justify it and calm everyone down.

       It is possible that none of the spying is possible and the leak was manufactured to instill fear in people about communications.  Think about it-- what would they do if they feared an uprising or something that required communications and they felt outnumbered?  If you can't hear everything what is the next best thing... to say that you can.  The same could be said about drones, nukes, etc.  The moral of my comment is that if you don't see it with your own eyes you should have a healthy level of skepticism.

       Hah we "liberals" were against this mass surveillance back in 2001 with the authorization of the Patriot Act, and lo and behold we "liberals" were right all along.   It gets so annoying to be right 10 years before everyone else. I'm not shocked at all about these mass surveillance revelations.
