It&#39;s overwhelming in scope and yet affects everyone who owns a phone or computer (literally almost every American) on a personal level.  The fact that every American is being tracked, monitored and spied upon by our own Government completely nullifies the notion that we are the free and open society we wanted to be.    </p>

Obama said just today that the American people were now mature enough to have the debate on the balance of privacy and security.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the &quot;liberal&quot; term was really a swipe at Obamanoids. A lot of conspiracy theorists are conservative on a lot of issues, but liberal on a lot of issues too - the point is that we generally don&#39;t have allegiance to one of the two main parties&#39; ideologies because we realize that they are both controlled by the same power.</p>

<p>The &quot;Liberals&quot; that we really hate right now are the ones who are apologists for the current administration. During the Bush years, we hated the &quot;Neocons&quot;. Ultimately, today&#39;s &quot;Liberals&quot; and yesterdays &quot;Neocons&quot; stand (and stood) for the same things - Patriot Act, Wars, Racist Prison System, Bloated Budgets, Bank Bailouts etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>If you are one of us (which I think you are) then I can understand how it is confusing for you to think of yourself as a liberal, and then see that some of us are describing &quot;Liberals&quot; as part of the problem. What is happening is that the word &quot;Liberal&quot; has taken on a new meaning for some of us recently (rather like happy people were suddenly upset to learn that they could no longer refer to themselves as &quot;gay&quot; when that word took on a new meaning a couple of decades ago).</p>

<p>I hope that explains it. I don&#39;t think it serves any of us well to create divisions among ourselves, just because we have differing beliefs on certain issues. We are all interested in discovering the hidden truth, and on a lot of the big issues, we ALL (pretty much) agree, just because common sense usually transcends political ideology. This is one of those big issues.</p>

<p>They also had to announce it at some point because it is only a step on the ladder to hell they seem to be pushing us all down.  Once the public accepts this crap, further crap can be rained (reigned?) down upon us.</p>
