<p>I think this whole subreddit is generally off-task.  it could be so much more, but i kind of discount it as ... i dont&#39; know... entertainment and fluff.  it&#39;s definitely not a news source.  And when i like this subreddit is when i can get good news out of it.</p>

<p>and folks, since i&#39;m on it, i mean news, and not some wanker with a blog, or some hack with an editorial column.  frigging news and facts folks.  it&#39;s what turned us down the rabbit hole in the first place.  don&#39;t get caught up with fancy and whim and rhetoric.  </p>

<p>that&#39;s their game and you&#39;re playing it for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just having this discussion with my wife, and i&#39;m not sure that&#39;s entirely the case.</p>

<p>yes, there exists a lot of editing and article removals out there.  &quot;where&#39;d the link go?!  why&#39;s it dead now!?!&quot;... yes.  but there is still A LOT, and i mean a LOT of news out there that speaks towards the stuff that&#39;s a lot closer to teh top of the rabbit hole.  stuff that is huge</p>

<p>On the front page today, for instance, the drone pilot who&#39;s feeling remorse for the 1600 people he&#39;s killed.  sure, that&#39;s not a conspiracy by definition, but you and i both know that it points towards the overwhelming reach fo the Military Industrial Complex that is not too far down the rabbit hole.  </p>

<p>there&#39;s news like this this all over that can help point people towards the truth we see, and doesn&#39;t make us sound like we&#39;ve got our tin-foil hats on too tight.  It gets people to our side one step at a time, just like we got here.  That is the shit we should be expressing.  not that david icke crap, or low-rent bloggers with nothing but a beered-up opinion and no facts to cover their asses.</p>

<p>just saying... And i mean no major disrespect to the subreddit as a whole... I&#39;ll say this.  I will start trying to spend more time here, and try to help influence it to be the subreddit i want it to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, I get my news from places other than reddit and r/conspiracy.  Some of the stuff I see on here is ridiculous, but some of it is eye opening.  And the lack of facts that are being released to us that I&#39;m implying is &quot;big brother&quot;, per se, taking events and controlling them from top to bottom.  Sandy Hook is a great example as they just passed the bill pretty much saying &quot;you can&#39;t look at ANY of the evidence we have.  Why?  Because it hurts people&#39;s feelings.&quot;  That doesn&#39;t stop them from replaying videos of 9/11 to this day.  Oklahoma City bombing is still brought up from time to time.  It was a tragedy, yes, but the public still deserves to know.  The way they should be trying to prevent events like Sandy Hook is awareness and knowledge, not ruling with an iron fist.  There&#39;s a lot of info on the big 3 events that have recently happened (Aurora, Sandy Hook, Boston) that we will probably never find out.  I&#39;m not implying the gov&#39;t had anything to do with causing them or being involved in any way.  But all they would have to do to release themselves from that scrutiny, if they weren&#39;t, is to release the information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you are saying, but one of the things I like most about <a href="/r/con">/r/con</a> is the one off blog posts or spurious news site postings.  I like to see the sub go to work either posting links that back it up, or posting links that expose it as bullshit.  There is a lot of out of the box thinking that goes on here.  That is one of the things that people make fun of.  But sometimes that thinking sparks a really interesting discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to point out in another reply, that it isn&#39;t the specific facts or lack-there-of, that makes a news story effective.  it&#39;s the questions they raise.  If you&#39;re aware of the molding effect and strategies of popular media, you are that much more equipped to negate them.  </p>

<p>Another point that i tried to expound upon, was what my real issue with a lot of bloggers is.  and that is a lack of documented sources.  I see a lot of posts through this subreddit that stop at the referenced blog.  and that blogger doesn&#39;t provide any of his data, any of his links, any of his pieces of the puzzle.  and without this, he becomes just like any other media mouthpiece: an undocumented, unverifiable editorial.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that there are a few well-researched blogs out there, i visit a few myself periodically.  I&#39;m not asking for a bright clean studio with producers making the presentation shiny.  You and I both know that doesn&#39;t make the words true.  I&#39;m asking for documented, researched, evaluated, confirmed news.  and that doesn&#39;t&#39; happen in a large portion of the blogs I&#39;ve seen connected through this sub-reddit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know... i think it depends on the subject matter involved, really.  I definitely have that same bias towards mainstream American media.  but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean everything they say isn&#39;t useful to us.  The question, when we &#39;aware&#39; are looking at popular news-stories is rarely &quot;is this true/is this false?&quot;... At least for me, that question is really &quot;what kind of mindset are they trying to guide me towards?&quot;  How are they molding their stories to imprint a broader, predictable, attitude adjustment?  that&#39;s what their game is.  sure, they have been caught in lie after lie, but when you look at the stories that are &#39;true&#39;, those ones are just as dangerous, because they still do the same &#39;molding&#39; that we are trying to avoid.</p>

<p>don&#39;t know if i lost my point.  There are a handful of proper independent news outlets out there these days, who investigate and verify their data, and do their research.  that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to see.  </p>

<p>My issue with the &quot;blogs as reddit-approved news sources&quot; is that they so rarely post their research and sources.  i like to verify my own self.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a big awakening lately. A lot of it based on fear, but a precious &quot;some&quot; is based in fact and real information. The bluderous &quot;Boston situation&quot; has drawn the attention of many, previous doubters. People are realizing that a lot of thier news is manufactured.

I like looking at things from bothsides and creating a circle of awareness on any given issue or theory. I entertain ideas without accepting them and pretty soon the two sides start creating new perspectives and new sides view from..any of this make sense?</p>
