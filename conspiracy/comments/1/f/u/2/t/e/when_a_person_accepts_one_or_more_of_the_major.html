       I think this whole subreddit is generally off-task.  it could be so much more, but i kind of discount it as ... i dont' know... entertainment and fluff.  it's definitely not a news source.  And when i like this subreddit is when i can get good news out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       and folks, since i'm on it, i mean news, and not some wanker with a blog, or some hack with an editorial column.  frigging news and facts folks.  it's what turned us down the rabbit hole in the first place.  don't get caught up with fancy and whim and rhetoric.

       I agree with you, however, it's difficult to find the facts when they don't want us to have them, and have the power to hide them from us.  They give us their version and say accept it or you're a nut.

       I was just having this discussion with my wife, and i'm not sure that's entirely the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, there exists a lot of editing and article removals out there.  "where'd the link go?!  why's it dead now!?!"... yes.  but there is still A LOT, and i mean a LOT of news out there that speaks towards the stuff that's a lot closer to teh top of the rabbit hole.  stuff that is huge
      </p>
      <p>
       On the front page today, for instance, the drone pilot who's feeling remorse for the 1600 people he's killed.  sure, that's not a conspiracy by definition, but you and i both know that it points towards the overwhelming reach fo the Military Industrial Complex that is not too far down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       there's news like this this all over that can help point people towards the truth we see, and doesn't make us sound like we've got our tin-foil hats on too tight.  It gets people to our side one step at a time, just like we got here.  That is the shit we should be expressing.  not that david icke crap, or low-rent bloggers with nothing but a beered-up opinion and no facts to cover their asses.
      </p>
      <p>
       just saying... And i mean no major disrespect to the subreddit as a whole... I'll say this.  I will start trying to spend more time here, and try to help influence it to be the subreddit i want it to be.

       Oh yeah, I get my news from places other than reddit and r/conspiracy.  Some of the stuff I see on here is ridiculous, but some of it is eye opening.  And the lack of facts that are being released to us that I'm implying is "big brother", per se, taking events and controlling them from top to bottom.  Sandy Hook is a great example as they just passed the bill pretty much saying "you can't look at ANY of the evidence we have.  Why?  Because it hurts people's feelings."  That doesn't stop them from replaying videos of 9/11 to this day.  Oklahoma City bombing is still brought up from time to time.  It was a tragedy, yes, but the public still deserves to know.  The way they should be trying to prevent events like Sandy Hook is awareness and knowledge, not ruling with an iron fist.  There's a lot of info on the big 3 events that have recently happened (Aurora, Sandy Hook, Boston) that we will probably never find out.  I'm not implying the gov't had anything to do with causing them or being involved in any way.  But all they would have to do to release themselves from that scrutiny, if they weren't, is to release the information.

       I agree with most of what you are saying, but one of the things I like most about
       <a href="/r/con">
        /r/con
       </a>
       is the one off blog posts or spurious news site postings.  I like to see the sub go to work either posting links that back it up, or posting links that expose it as bullshit.  There is a lot of out of the box thinking that goes on here.  That is one of the things that people make fun of.  But sometimes that thinking sparks a really interesting discussion.

       I tried to point out in another reply, that it isn't the specific facts or lack-there-of, that makes a news story effective.  it's the questions they raise.  If you're aware of the molding effect and strategies of popular media, you are that much more equipped to negate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point that i tried to expound upon, was what my real issue with a lot of bloggers is.  and that is a lack of documented sources.  I see a lot of posts through this subreddit that stop at the referenced blog.  and that blogger doesn't provide any of his data, any of his links, any of his pieces of the puzzle.  and without this, he becomes just like any other media mouthpiece: an undocumented, unverifiable editorial.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt that there are a few well-researched blogs out there, i visit a few myself periodically.  I'm not asking for a bright clean studio with producers making the presentation shiny.  You and I both know that doesn't make the words true.  I'm asking for documented, researched, evaluated, confirmed news.  and that doesn't' happen in a large portion of the blogs I've seen connected through this sub-reddit.

       Ya know... i think it depends on the subject matter involved, really.  I definitely have that same bias towards mainstream American media.  but that doesn't necessarily mean everything they say isn't useful to us.  The question, when we 'aware' are looking at popular news-stories is rarely "is this true/is this false?"... At least for me, that question is really "what kind of mindset are they trying to guide me towards?"  How are they molding their stories to imprint a broader, predictable, attitude adjustment?  that's what their game is.  sure, they have been caught in lie after lie, but when you look at the stories that are 'true', those ones are just as dangerous, because they still do the same 'molding' that we are trying to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't know if i lost my point.  There are a handful of proper independent news outlets out there these days, who investigate and verify their data, and do their research.  that's what I'd like to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue with the "blogs as reddit-approved news sources" is that they so rarely post their research and sources.  i like to verify my own self.

       There has been a big awakening lately. A lot of it based on fear, but a precious "some" is based in fact and real information. The bluderous "Boston situation" has drawn the attention of many, previous doubters. People are realizing that a lot of thier news is manufactured. It is very easy just to "let somebody else handle it", until it slaps you in the face. Once you cross over there is no going back.

       9/11: I was a young man and i gave it the old eyeballs test and something didn't add up,  A building that was built with state of the art construction methods, hurricane proof and each tower could hold 5 times its own weight.  No way a plane could take it out like that, No way in hell.  that was a controlled demolition and anyone who has seen a controlled demolition knows that.  I don't know when the motions where put in place to take over this country but it was long before Sept 11th, 2001.

       Ya you are right...but it has extend far beyond just news we have to absorb knowledge...my way of looking at things is this..most people know there is two sides to things. I like looking at things from bothsides and creating a circle of awareness on any given issue or theory. I entertain ideas without accepting them and pretty soon the two sides start creating new perspectives and new sides view from..any of this make sense?

       Part of the problem is that it is not properly moderated.  For instance, today someone posted a picture of a helicopter with the title "Conditioning," and it was clearly a movie shoot.  The waters are too contaminated at the moment to have a serious discussion about possible conspiracies, real world concerns, people's rights being trampled, etc.

       MSM is 2Girls1Cup. Re-ingestion of its own waste, for profit and attention. Subtle nudging of the discussion overall. MSM is a dirty Nanny putting you down for a nap.
