    <div class="md"><p>I agree that a primary function of the NSA is counter intelligence. They want to know who knows what and prevent as much sensitive info from making it into the public domain as possible. Also political profiling of populations is important to understand the current &#39;mood&#39; of a nation in order to best way to sell a particular program (i.e. if false flag ops are necessary). </p>

<p>Also a good question to ask is who exactly controls the NSA? The federal government is a very complex organization and it does not necessarily have a chain of command up to the president. There are various groups that have control over various federal agencies. That is why there is so much redundancy of organizations within the federal government since each power center needs its own agencies that it controls.</p>

<p>They take all this data, huge amounts of it, and they store it. They have super computers that use this data in sort of a &quot;Sims&quot; environment where they play out war games and social issues to judge reactions. </p>

<p>Sort of like Minority Report, but instead of the computer being able to see the future, this computer is able to compute the future. Or at least, the peoples reactions to certain events and exercises. </p>

<p>Otherwise, enemies of the state will simply be smeared in the press as a pedophile, or a hacker, or a conspiracy nut, or a militia gun freak, ect. True or not, it&#39;s what the public will believe, and that person will be ostracized from society to the point where no one will care what the government does with them.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a thought... What if the need for &quot;security&quot; in an economic system like the one we live in is used to drive technological innovation?</p>

<p>How do you jumpstart innovation which is not immediately profitable?  Would private companies like space x be moving towards a profit driven space exploration program right now if it wasn&#39;t for trillions of dollars in defense technology innovation?  Technology builds off of technology, but there is a profit motive which drives it, and you have to start somewhere.</p>

<p>Security is the name of the game in the future.  But where will this Total Information Awareness lead us to in 30 or 50 years?  The Oracle database was originally developed for the CIA.  The internet itself is a product of DARPA funded research.  How will this data driven model continue to influence the way we live our lives?  Right now, you are being tracked on databases- private and public, aimed at security, advertising, risk assessment and valuation.  Your virtual persona is being analyzed from many angles.  In terms of integrating this data, the process would logically start with a government program, as nobody else as access to everything and the costs associated are incredibly high.  But what are the potential applications of a robust virtual profile of every citizen on the grid?  A utopian society perhaps?</p>

<p>It&#39;s already a data driven society.  Your credit card company has known your buying habits for years.  Your grocery store customer care card...  Now we have smartphones.  Your xbox already watches you.  Your phone, your mp3 player, your browser, your onstar.  Soon enough, google glass will be streaming image and gps data from all over the globe.  Your thermostat will be streaming live data through the smart grid.  Your refrigerator will know when your milk is about to go bad.  What about a watch that notifies you (and your insurance company) of a high temperature and sends you a notification and advance request to your doctor for a prescription.  Imagine the implications of ubiquity in nomadic objects.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not moving off he grid any time soon.  There&#39;s too much fun stuff.  I could never be a luddite...  And sure the implications are potentially frightening.  Lots of room for abuse.  We just need to make sure that debate isn&#39;t stifled by those who would want to who might abuse this system.  </p>

<p>And as far as security goes, the fear is that, in 30-50 years, there is going to be an uprising of the unwashed masses who have not been treated well by this technological system.  As a society, maybe it&#39;s up to us to make sure that people aren&#39;t living in circumstances where it comes to that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that a primary function of the NSA is counter intelligence. They want to know who knows what and prevent as much sensitive info from making it into the public domain as possible. Also political profiling of populations is important to understand the current &#39;mood&#39; of a nation in order to best way to sell a particular program (i.e. if false flag ops are necessary). </p>

<p>Also a good question to ask is who exactly controls the NSA? The federal government is a very complex organization and it does not necessarily have a chain of command up to the president. There are various groups that have control over various federal agencies. That is why there is so much redundancy of organizations within the federal government since each power center needs its own agencies that it controls.</p>
