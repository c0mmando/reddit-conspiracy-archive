       The common misconception with this subreddit, and i think one of the major driving forces behind the existence of
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       —and any community who deems "conspiracy theory" synonymous with lunacy, idiocy, or a lack of critical thinking—is that people think upvotes, or regurgitation of the information, means we believe it. Which isnt true—at least if we do believe certain things its after extensive research, not one-off articles or posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We upvote or regurgitate, for the most part anyway, to get more information and spread the discussion. No one here denies that many of the things here are obscure, understudied, and sometimes blatantly wrong. Because of this we upvote and circulate to get the truth, to encourage discussion, To get people into the threads to debunk or support the claims. Most everyone here takes everything they read—whether its here or anywhere, whether it supports or refutes their beliefs—with a grain of salt, and most abhor that someone would just believe something because someone said it. If that wasn't the case—that we take in
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       and draw our on conclusions—we'd all be out there parroting the official stories.  Those who dont encourage critical thinking or think critically themselves are not helping any kind of truth movement—trusting
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or any 'alternative' news network or forum is just as detrimental as trusting CNN, The FDA, or a religious doctrine without question. If you think we believe everything we read here, based solely on the individual articles, i can assure you that that is not the case, at least with the overwhelming majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now of course, that's not to say everyone who has seen some evidence of one or more "conspiracies" and has become convinced—often on far too little evidence—thinks this way.
       <em>
        And
       </em>
       that's not the say that the majority of people who beieve in one or more conspiracies think this way—I honestly couldn't tell you what the ratio is, however it'd probably be safe to assume that, like the rest of America, the majority just regurgiate what they hear as fact; it's simply a change of source from the mainstream to the alternative.
       <em>
        But
       </em>
       those of us who
       <em>
        study
       </em>
       these things, and are constantly on a quest for knowledge, almost exclusively go about things in this way. Also it's important to note, just because 'stupid' people believe something doesn't make it untrue and just because smarter people believe somethings doesn't make it true (something rarely considered by much of the scientifically literate community).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying  you should believe anything here to be truth. I have my own convictions about certain content here but I would never want you to just believe them because I said so, or because
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       said so. in fact I am specifically advocating that you remain skeptical and questioning, but please do it
       <em>
        evenly
       </em>
       and back it up with research—questioning the motives of both those in power
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       those without, not simply being skeptical of things which frighten the stability of your world view (easier said than done of course)— and not just googling "[conspiracy theory] debunked" and believing that it's false just because there is a page "debunking" it. As is the case for anyone who has
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       looked at both sides of JFK or 9/11 or other thoroughly-documented-but-still not-ackowledged-as-fact 'conspiracies', you will see not only the often times flaws in logic of these 'debunking' sites but an ubiquitous lack of the whole story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to give a little example of one piece of one theory, 9/11, the 'conspiracy theory' I am most well versed in: the "debunking" sites, at least the ones I've read,  don't even address 10% of the 'evidence' for the 'theory', and not to mention most of 'our' evidence is 'mainstream accepted'—yet little known to most of the public. All we did was connect the dots that are already considered by to be fact. Of course, there is far more information about 9/11 in both directions, but for something which has so much concrete evidence, reading one article from a mega corporation whose main motive is profits and
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/en/news-section/41-articles/604-debunking-the-real-911-myths-why-popular-mechanics-cant-face-up-to-reality-part-1.html">
        whose logic on the matter has serious evidence of being fundamentally flawed
       </a>
       , or believing a government funded report  which you never read and was never even peer reviewed, and just saying STUPID CONSPIRACY THEORISTS is all sorts of detrimental to you, and our nation. If we're wrong, we're wrong, but is there really so much wrong with being a check and balance to the government that no longer exists as a result of corporate control and media censorship?  As a community, just like the rest of society, we're not perfect; we have our idiots, our racists, our fear-mongers, etc but that doesn't mean what we do here is useless. (see:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dcy67/whats_so_bad_about_conspiracy_theory_an_analysis/">
        Whats So Bad About Conspiracy Theory
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, those who most need to read this, are too hopped up on how great it makes them feel to be
       <em>
        smarter than those stupid conspiratards, they'll believe anything fucking tin foil hat wearing nut bags!
       </em>
       but I can't say I didn't try.

       If upvotes doesn't mean belief, they mean support. They mean that people looked at the link and thought, hmm, that's something that should be spread. The things that reach the front page are the ones that many people thought were worth discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem, and what some people make fun of, is that a lot of the things that reach the front page are either ridiculous or come from terrible sources. It means that
       <em>
        that many
       </em>
       people looked at a chemtrail article, or a perpetual motion machine, or an article from something like naturalnews.com, and decided that yes, this is something that deserves to be shown to a wider audience. A lot of people on this subreddit start with a firm position: anti-U.S, anti-government, anti-zionist, etc. They then upvote every article whose headline seems to support his view, rather than discriminating between valid, well-sourced, in-depth criticism, and some hogwash about oil companies suppressing someone's free energy contraption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other reason people make fun of this sub is the users' overblown paranoia about shills. Whether or not people are paid by governments and corporations to browse this forum and argue with you, calling your opponents shills is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       a terrible tactic. Every view has some real people that support it, but this subreddit's readers often seem to jump to the conclusion that their opponent must be a shill instead of providing evidence and sources as to why their opponent is incorrect.

       By support, I meant "that people looked at the link and thought, hmm, that's something that should be spread". I'm saying that even if they don't believe it, they shouldn't upvote crap to the top. They should seek to promote articles that will spark interesting discussion.

       What should? GMOs, Monsanto, Iraq/Afghanistan/other military action, conspiracies related to current protests, banking/finance/Wall St, surveillance/privacy. Difficult issues with lots of unknowns should be discussed. What shouldn't? HAARP, Chemtrails, Perpetual motion, Illuminati symbolism, UFOs (debatable). Things that either have no evidence at all or have clear evidence for one side shouldn't be taken seriously. Also, things from bad sources.

       Again you are missing the point. Posts are being upvoted because they need to be spread
       <em>
        in order to be validated or invalidated.
       </em>
       Trying to shed more light on a subject does not mean you are supporting it.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is plenty of evidence for the conspiracies you stated. GMOs, Monsanto, wars, financial corruption, this is all pretty obvious and it has been for quite some time. The only unknown is how to hold these people accountable. If you can acknowledge that financial corruption exists inherently in our monetary system, then you can see why you are not getting the "evidence" that you deem valid. Who do you expect to fund this research and why does it even matter when even if someone attempts to fund their own you consider it a "bad source".
      </p>
      <p>
       The shill thing was only a joke. I was addressing the notion that you are only skeptical towards ideas that you perceive as legitimate while dismissing everything else. Nearly 100% of your post history is geared towards dismissing and discrediting. Not a great way to learn.

       But what's the point of voting if you don't discriminate? The good thing about reddit is that it's designed to make the most interesting stuff float to the top. Chemtrails continue to reach the front page even though the comments usually call them out as bullshit; upvoting chemtrail articles displaces other, more interesting stuff. People should attempt to validate things themselves first, check sources, weigh plausability, etc. before upvoting it for
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       people to validate it. If you don't understand it but think it might make sense, upvoting is reasonable. But in either case, people should attempt to judge the merit of a story or article on their own, not just upvoting to let other people do the research.

       What? I didn't state any conspiracies, I only gave topics. "GMO" isn't a conspiracy, it's a technology around which many people claim there to be various conspiracies. The safety, morality, monopolization, propaganda, etc. of GMOs should be discussed. Some studies show some GMOs to be safe, others show other GMOs to be unsafe. It's not a clear-cut issue.

       Nobody denies that there's corruption in the financial system. This subreddit cannot do anything besides spread information and find truth;
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       isn't going to hold anyone accountable. What it can do is pick apart facts and hypotheses and figure out what's really going on.

      <p>
       Scientists, like you, are for the most part interested in finding the truth. Corporations can pay for studies, but every important issue can and is picked apart by independent scientists. There's no global suppression of science, and science remains the best way to validate truth even in controversial areas. I don't judge the quality of a source by it's results; I judge its quality on the rigors of its analysis, its reference, and its pre-existing biases and previous work. Natural News promotes lots of bullshit about homeopathy, so I can safely say that they are a poor source for scientific research.

       I like to think that I'm skeptical towards all of my beliefs, though obviously everyone has their biases. The focus of this account is discrediting and debating what I believe is bullshit; I use my primary account for political discussion and such things. I think my contributions are pretty valuable, and I always try to source what I say and avoid speculation.

       Fair enough. I suppose the real issue is that people get interested in different topics at different times, and some get so obsessed with certain issues that they continuously try to drive home the same points. It might be nice if some of these topics that are re-posted endlessly were broken down into smaller subs in order to come to some sort of consensus, but most likely it would probably just turn into a circlejerk and accomplish nothing.

       you are saying that people aren't discerning.  I think you're right, but you can say the same thing about many stories that find their way onto CNN.  I take everything on naturalnews with a grain of salt, in fact i tend to ignore anything that is linked on there.  But that's not to say that there might not be some good information that you won't get elsewhere.  It's amazing how misinformed people who follow the news religiously, can be.

       yes, but these are not just the opinions of our parents or what we are told by authority, this is a healthy distrust.  I think there is some danger when you have people who are broadly, "anti government", but I think it's also important to have those voices.  I'd say that calls for revolution in the US are poorly thought out, and broad statements against GMO perhaps dilute an important issue.  It's very easy to fall into a black and white view of things when you let yourself travel down this reality tunnel.  I'd agree that perhaps that's not the healthiest mode of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is always going to be an ad hominem characterization of people who are firm in BELIEF.  I am aware enough of conspiracies which are real, and that leads me to be skeptical in places where there is no conspiracy.  You might be dependent on the need to trust what you are being told by authority, and rather than attempting to debunk authority, you will attempt to debunk those who oppose the official story.

       That seems unlikely. If Natural News reports something that's true, then chances are that it's still better to go directly to the source. For instance, there's an article on their frontpage about surveillance right now, but they link to the guardian as their source, so there's no reason to cite naturalnews instead of the guardian.

       I'm very glad that you feel that way. Unfortunately, your statement there isn't true for a growing number of this subreddit's regulars. I don't know if its a confirmation bias, laziness or both, but more and more subscribers are instantly believing, upvoting and commenting to support anything that paints the government, jews or, lately, GMOs in a negative light, even if the source is an obvious sham. And, likewise, they jump on anything that paints any of these topics in a positive light, or things they like in a negative light, with fierce negativity, even if the source is factually accurate and extremely well documented.

       Yeah, every population does. Conspiracy theorists just happen to have a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are conspiracies, but that doesn't mean every time the government issues a press release they're planning the new world order, or every important event was caused by actors. The reason conspiracy theorists are seen as ridiculous is because the vast majority are ridiculous, and make ridiculous claims or statements.

       I think the problem is that it's very hard for the community to show it's better side when there's so much focus on the vast minority that work really hard to get themselves known, regardless of what 'side of the aisle' they are on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not unlike raising children, a community such as this takes on the shape of it's environment. The people reinforcing that kind of behavior are the ones that claim to loathe it. By constantly reminding everyone that poor choices were made in the past, you give these attention seekers the perfect foil to rail against. You personify the system. So it's showtime.

       And my entire point is that it's not for me to be concerned with what conspiritards think. They are diametrically opposed to everything I stand for.

       I wish more people would disregard what they think. Their agenda is clear; self-aggrandizement at any cost.

       the military has a lot, too. they're paid a lot of money. the government has entire agencies of conspiracy theorists called intelligence groups. but oh wait lol, that's the US investigating and proposing conspiracy theories/recognizing as reality conspiracy theories in
       <em>
        every other
       </em>
       nation on Earth.

       Just. not. here. Oh, and funnily enough, they are almost always wrong and involving them in meta-conspiracies to go to war where your friends and brothers/sons will be taken and sent to murder/die in needless meatgrinders caused by the US government lying to us through the media like during the run-up to the war in Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       but, ya know, don't worry about reality; it's much more fun and meaningful to comment on how pitiful crazy conspiracy nuts on the internet talking about jew aliens are - you are a moron.

       Could it be as simple as this---&gt; People use the term "conspiratard" as a blanket term to describe people who have provoked thoughts in them that caused cognitive dissonance because the undeniable facts presented challened their belief system. Use of this term is selfish, and only serves to dismiss facts for the sake of comfort. Thus,
       <a href="/r/conspritard">
        /r/conspritard
       </a>
       could very well change it's name to

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       upvote to encourage discussion, not to show support or belief. 2. What type of conspiracy related material would you deem appropriate to reach the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? 3. There is a difference between being skeptical and being dismissive YOU FUCKING SHILL :)

       you are saying that people aren't discerning.  I think you're right, but you can say the same thing about many stories that find their way onto CNN.  I take everything on naturalnews with a grain of salt, in fact i tend to ignore anything that is linked on there.  But that's not to say that there might not be some good information that you won't get elsewhere.  It's amazing how misinformed people who follow the news religiously, can be.

       yes, but these are not just the opinions of our parents or what we are told by authority, this is a healthy distrust.  I think there is some danger when you have people who are broadly, "anti government", but I think it's also important to have those voices.  I'd say that calls for revolution in the US are poorly thought out, and broad statements against GMO perhaps dilute an important issue.  It's very easy to fall into a black and white view of things when you let yourself travel down this reality tunnel.  I'd agree that perhaps that's not the healthiest mode of thinking.
      </p>

       there is always going to be an ad hominem characterization of people who are firm in BELIEF.  I am aware enough of conspiracies which are real, and that leads me to be skeptical in places where there is no conspiracy.  You might be dependent on the need to trust what you are being told by authority, and rather than attempting to debunk authority, you will attempt to debunk those who oppose the official story.
