       There is a group of Redditers that includes jf_queeny ,DrunkenBeetle, firemylasers, ethidium-bromide, poopsatchel, sleekery, Scuderia, mennonitedan, searine, Ray192, hexaploid, fe_fi_fo_fum, NilRecurring, and sludgehammer that are going around defending Monsanto to the very end. They all know each other and this is what they spend their time on reddit doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at
       <a href="/u/JF_Queeny">
        /u/JF_Queeny
       </a>
       's profile. He spends most of his time defending Monsanto and he even moderates
       <a href="/r/GMOMyths">
        /r/GMOMyths
       </a>
       which is nothing more than a meeting place for them to conduct raids on any negative Monsanto post. If you need any more convincing it's also interesting to note that John Francis Queeny was the founder of Monsanto.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really crazy more people on here aren't catching on to them.

       The people who are frustrating me in this thread are the ones who are 1) employing basic philosophy 101 obfuscation tactics in their avoidance of getting to the actual point of contention (the evilness of Monsanto) and 2) the people who refuse to engage in discussion of the real issue-- is Monsanto evil?-- and instead keep redirecting the conversation towards discussion of lesser issues, namely the evil, or not, of GMOs in and of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       People presenting scientific arguments and papers that say GMOs are fine is wonderful and all-- BUT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REAL ISSUE.  The case for Monsanto being evil is not a scientific one, but a moral one.  The fact that Monsanto funds GMOs of plants to withstand more pesticide just so they can get farmers to spray more of their poison on them makes them evil.  The fact that Monsanto has government agencies illegally confiscate farmer's (and beekeeper's) crops and lifestockk if they prove resistant to their poisons, makes them evil.  The fact Monsanto are treating their seeds as their intellectual property and making farmers "license" them-- and ruining their lives and careers if they don't tow the line, makes them evil.  The fact that Monsanto is basically trying to utterly dominate the world food supply in their quest for corporate power, makes them evil.  Notice that none of these arguments are hinged on whether or not GMOs in and of themselves are good or bad.

       Using the word 'evil' makes one sound like a kid?  In this context I would take evil to mean "betraying the public interest".  And no, I don't think there is a word with which you could more precisely describe Monsanto.

       I could care less about hybridized corn.  I say again:  The GMOs are not the issue.  What we should be instead focusing on is what Monsanto is aiming to achieve via GMOs, which is nothing less than agricultural slavery for the rest of the world.  THIS is the problem.

      <p>
       But use of hybridized corn forces farmers to rebuy from the same source also - you were trying to say such a plan is what makes Monsanto evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       You
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be focusing on the ecological and health and safety issues - ensuring rigorous lab testing of new products, regulated use outside of the lab, extensive testing before being given to consumers, strengthening of the EPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mixing in crazy definitions of evil severely weakens the real arguments against Monsanto and ensures the movement can be completely ignored by the mainstream.

       Nobody here has understood my point-- I never said that simply selling pesticides in and of itself was evil...but Monsanto paying to create plants that can withstand more pesticides just so they can sell more pesticides is 1) unnecessarily increasing the quantity of poison put on the plants (and into the atmosphere, the water, our bodies  etc.) and 2) increasing the financial burden on farmers who have to buy the stuff...just for their own profit.  It's a despicable and treacherous practice.

       I just had an encounter with flymylasers.  Total monsanto disinformation agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it sounds silly saying "monsanto disinformation agent"  I just don't know how else to describe it.  He had a list of articles at least 10 long to debunk a scientific study I linked to in the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't get to read all of the articles he linked to, but he made sure to imply that I was an idiot for linking to an article about scientific study.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All the article and the scientific study were suggesting in the first place was that more research is warranted about the effects of Round Up ready crops.  The study found that rats fed GMO corn were equally prone to developing cancer and dying at an earlier age as rats who had round up added to their water supply.  Rats who had neither GMO corn or roundup added were 50% less likely to develop tumors and die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I haven't had the chance to go through every single one of the links he sent to "debunk" the study, but!

       I did find that one of the claims in one of the articles is absolutely false, so far.  The article claimed that the specific lab rat they used in the study was an unusual type.  It turns out that the S-D Rat is used in almost all studies that involve cancer, so it is not an inappropriate type to use in the study at all.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        – the investigators used a strain of rats that were bred to develop tumors as they aged (a detail they failed to disclose).  Significantly, mortality rates and tumor incidence in all experimental groups fall within historical norms for this strain of laboratory rats.  Therefore, the claim that the genetically engineered corn component of the diet or the herbicide caused the tumors is insupportable.

      <p>
       Here's a link to a page for a lab rat supplier.  The S-D rat is one of the most common rats used in scientific research.

       When it was revealed that the letter was actually in defense of the study, stating that it was among the best on the subject, firemylasers response was to remove it from his list and pretend it doesnt exist. LOL!

       For the record, firemylasers is a high school student who likes to troll reddit in defense of Monsanto relentlessly spamming the same links over and over in every gmo thread. Despite his links and information being repeatedly debunked and shown to have no merit, he continues to spam them.

       The reason he had that list is because the study made huge news and so people bring up its claims very very frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The study is, by the way, absolute and pure bullshit. Sample sizes of 10 are simply insufficient to make any sort of statistical conclusion about anything. Also, the rats who were fed GMO corn were fed unlimited quantities of corn only (which is known to affect obesity and cancer in rats), whereas non-GMO rats were fed a limited diet of a variety of food. They also failed to make any distinction between the rats that were fed genetically modified corn versus those that were fed straight-up Roundup.
      </p>
      <p>
       The European Food Safety Authority,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a noted proponent of GMO foods, had
       <a href="http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2910.htm">
        this to say about the Seralini et al. study
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        EFSA notes that the Séralini et al. (2012) study has unclear objectives and is inadequately reported in the publication, with many key details of the design, conduct and analysis being omitted. Without such details it is impossible to give weight to the results. Conclusions cannot be drawn on the difference in tumour incidence between the treatment groups on the basis of the design, the analysis and the results as reported in the Séralini et al. (2012) publication. In particular,
        <strong>
         Séralini et al. (2012) draw conclusions on the incidence of tumours based on 10 rats per treatment per sex which is an insufficient number of animals
        </strong>
        to distinguish between specific treatment effects and chance occurrences of tumours in rats.  Considering that the study as reported in the Séralini et al. (2012) publication is of
        <strong>
         inadequate design, analysis and reporting, EFSA finds that it is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessment.
        </strong>
        Therefore EFSA, concludes that the Séralini et al. study as reported in the 2012 publication does not impact the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate, and does not see a need to reopen the existing safety evaluation of maize NK603 and its related stacks.

       So am I actually supposed to believe that all these dudes do on reddit, and what they spend the majority of their time doing, is rolling around looking for and commenting in threads related to Monsanto?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is the weirder possibility: That they are paid or that they aren't?

       .... I spend my time clearing the trash they spew on the main Reddits like r/news, rpolitics.  JF_ Queeny is has some legal background, he is Definitely part of well-versed Monsanto team on Reddit, the rest of them are a bunch of idiots reading off Q &amp; A  shill sheets.
      </p>
      <p>
       No problem though. I have called them out successfully many times on r politics/rworldnews. They just go away after you bring the facts.

      <p>
       I spent 1 hour the other day getting some guy to admit that Monsanto suing a farmer for Canola field contamination -was  not a Myth. He to had admit  at the end. Waste of my time, but I feel this is necessary public service against the numerous Vultures of Monsanto  experts/shills.

       after tagging all of these users, then searching through monsanto related threads, it's STAGGERING to see how they team up with each other, rapidly, and widespread.

       there is simply no denying after looking through their comment history that they're clearly looking for monsanto threads specifically to comment on.

       So you went full racist to bait racists? How does that make you better? Instead, trying preaching love for all. We are all humans after all. I feel like your approach was all wrong. But of course thats just my opinion. I apologize for being judgemental. I just have a different approach i guess.

       </em>

       From what I can see, people tend to prefer their science to come from peer reviewed journals, rather than entertainment site like naturalnews.com.  I don't know about you, but I don't think it's unfair if redditors who are educated in biogenetics (and not affiliated with biotech companies) offer their insight into discussions on GMO food.  That can involve supporting certain GMO products, and can also involve rejecting Monsanto's business practices, where they are unethical.  Perhaps that is shillery?  But as independent scientists, some of them consider it their civic duty to educate rather than leave the thousands of lurkers to make decisions based on ignorance and sensationalism, especially for a technology that we should be seeking to harnass for humanity's good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good questions for genuine critical thinking are - what technology are all biotech companies working on? What are the risks associated with their technology, how are those risks and safety concerns evaluated and mitigated for? What are the benefits of the technology?  There often are risks, but there often are massive potential benefits.  Throwing out the baby with the bathwater due to fear and ignorance says that we are not capable as a species of advancing responsibly.  I personally don't believe that to be true, although maybe this subreddit exists to ensure that view is something we try to live by.

       You paint a pretty rosy picture of technological benefits but fail to realize that we have gone down plenty of wrong-ways in the past - do I really need to show examples?  Quite often, the higher and more complicated the technology, the more likely there are problems that are easily missed or glossed over.  The decline of birds like eagles caused scientists to track back to DDT.  The makers of DDT did not catch this problem or lead the charge to rectify it.  Bottom line is that profit, not real and safe advances, are driving corporate technology.

       You're right, there are often problems.  That's why everyone should be very keen to ensure the EPA are very well funded.  Look at how tightly controlled human medication is - the FDA is reasonably well funded, and generally has very high standards (though the DePuy hip recall makes me question that for instance).  But few will argue that we shouldn't try to develop new medicines, and despite the regulation, new medicines and procedures are developed by corporations.  Basically, we need strong environmental regulations, and legal action taken against those who try to bypass safety procedures.  That's an investment that has to be made, but if it results in cheap, safe and plentiful food, then it's worth it.  Personally I think having a strong EPA is worth it anyway.

       Holy shit. A voice of reason in this sub. I'm on board with you. I don't flatly oppose GMO. I'm sure there are many good applications for it. I just oppose the politics and Monsanto in general.  They proven themselves too greasy to keep operating. No moralistic company could evolve from them.

       So you think they pay people money to push down arrows on reddit, but they're so inept at it that the stories they're trying to bury, such as monsanto protests, continuously make the front page of the site.  This despite the fact that there is nothing stopping a "shill" from creating 10,000 unique accounts and using them all to downvote the same link.  Hmm.  Have you fully thought this through?
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of companies paying people to push down arrows because they don't want people sharing certain stories or ideas on this website is incredibly arrogant and paranoid.  They really don't care that much about you or this little corner of the internet.

       I just take for granted that the government and all major corporations do this. Anyone with enough money and a reason to want to make their image appear shinier than it is. It's probably propaganda 101 for them anymore. Wouldn't suprise me if there were whole companies devoted to providing this service.

       I witness this firsthand in the last weeks, as a "Fluoride Bill" was set to be voted on in Portland.  r/portland was completely saturated (~80%) with pro fluoride material, when the ballets were finished, the bill was defeated 61% to 39% (YAY NO FLUORIDE)  80% pr fluoride on r/portland, equaled 39% pro fluride on the ballets/portland.  What this proved to me, is that there are large amounts of of influence exerted on the internet by companies and their PR representatives.  If you are going to pay to advertise, you might as well advertise in a place where people are looking... ie reddit.

      </p>
      <p>
       "Shill" typically refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers the impression he is an enthusiastic independent customer of a seller (or marketer of ideas) for whom he is secretly working. The person or group who hires the shill is using crowd psychology, to encourage other onlookers or audience members to purchase the goods or services (or accept the ideas being marketed). Shills are often employed by professional marketing campaigns. "Plant" and "stooge" more commonly refer to any person who is secretly in league with another person or organization while pretending to be neutral or actually a part of the organization he is planted in, such as a magician's audience, a political party, or an intelligence organization

       I can confirm this. I even had one that was extremely blatant. I asked on a Monsanto post "Have you heard of Glyphosate? Did you know on two occasions, the United States EPA has caught scientists deliberately falsifying test results at research laboratories hired by Monsanto to study glyphosate? Is that ok to you?" The response was a classic...

       My only question is why? It's not as if any redditors are in any position to make policy decisions. It'd be a huge waste of money. Monsanto probably has its own pr guys, but if they're wasting time on reddit, they are not doing very well. Every gmo article i see, for our against, has good back and forth in the comments, and it's generally level headed discussion.

       It definitely shouldn't surprise you. I make $13.50/hour contracting for the Monsanto/GMO lobbyist conglomerate to post here as long as I'm maintaining my 50 downvotes/hour quota. Most of us get a weekly $250 bonus if we exceed 75 downvotes/hour here, too.

       Do you honestly think that a company with the clout of Monsanto would think so small as to bother paying people click downvotes on Reddit...?  And in particular
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       - the subreddit that the whole rational world reads and is not associated with paranoid nutcasery at all?  The effect would be insignificant.  It would be more likely to invest in people without morals to simply talk up the company and practices wherever possible, and challenge anything critical of said company - this will include (but not be limited to) Reddit.

       Sadly the link to the article I read with that information was deleted off of the IMDB board for Oliver Stone's JFK.  That said, it's easy to conclude after spending some time in that forum that some of the regular posters are paid shills.

       If you google John Stockwell CIA there is a video somewhere where he (an ex CIA case manager, and the highest ranking to go public) talks about a CIA operation in the early 60s where, among other things, they actually paid reputed authors and journalists to publish and write books and articles that presented their preferred perspective on Vietnam.

       Don't expect a cogent reply. I have dealt with this guy recently and he is just as bad as the ones on the list. The ones who are not paid for their opinions are just pathetic folks who need to feel superior on the internet because of their insecurities, people whose brain was damaged in the wash. I don't care which list rusty belongs on, but he's definitely a troll who has no qualms about twisting your words to make straw men. He can't be convinced, only endured.

       What?  The statement "it wouldn't surprise me if Monsanto hired some people to come to reddit and down vote articles critical of them" is not equivalent to the statement "everyone who down votes an article critical of Monsanto is a paid shill".  Just thinking that there might be a paid shill or two about is not the same as thinking that everyone is one.

       Eh, not really. PR(in this particualr case you're talking about) is about the general public, and the general public does not buy products that carry their name in large numbers. They are actually not in much need of good PR to be financially successful, which is really why they do come off so poorly, because they just don't care about their image, nor do they need to care about their image. Their value doesn't come from their brand, it comes from their assets like patents and herbicides and whatnot.

       There are a lot of cases of academics having their research funded by corporates.  These same corporates won't fund you if you end up with results that aren't what they would prefer.

       Universities like donors.  Academics like university pensions.  Therefore it is often the case that corporates can buy academics.

       Why do you keep bringing GMOs into it?  And why do you think scientists who support GMO are also somehow supporting Monsanto?  I don't really have an opinion on GMOs-- it depends on the application.  For example, if someone could GMO a type of protein that was more easily assimilable by human blood, I could see how that could be good.  But when Monsanto funds researchers to GMO plants to withstand more pesticide just so they can sell more pesticide to farmers, I think that is quite simply evil.

       I don't work for Monsanto and don't defend them or down vote links to stories about them specifically. It wouldn't surprise me to find out that most/all Fortune 500 companies pay people to monitor/augment their online presence. If you were a CEO would you pay someone to do this? Of course!
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention these companies employ "regular" people - drivers, scientists, secretaries and board members - who probably like their employer. Monsanto employs
       <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/investors/Pages/faqs.aspx">
        22,000
       </a>
       people, some of whom are redditors. Many people who work for Fortune 500 (i.e. big) companies wear it as a badge of pride, list that facton their resume.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto aside, I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       defend GMOs and down vote stories/links with bad science about GMOs in them.
