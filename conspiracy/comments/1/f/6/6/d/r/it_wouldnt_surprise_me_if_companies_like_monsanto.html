They all know each other and this is what they spend their time on reddit doing.</p>

<p>Just look at <a href="/u/JF_Queeny">/u/JF_Queeny</a> &#39;s profile. He spends most of his time defending Monsanto and he even moderates <a href="/r/GMOMyths">/r/GMOMyths</a> which is nothing more than a meeting place for them to conduct raids on any negative Monsanto post. If you need any more convincing it&#39;s also interesting to note that John Francis Queeny was the founder of Monsanto.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really crazy more people on here aren&#39;t catching on to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who are frustrating me in this thread are the ones who are 1) employing basic philosophy 101 obfuscation tactics in their avoidance of getting to the actual point of contention (the evilness of Monsanto) and 2) the people who refuse to engage in discussion of the real issue-- is Monsanto evil?-- and instead keep redirecting the conversation towards discussion of lesser issues, namely the evil, or not, of GMOs in and of themselves. </p>

<p>People presenting scientific arguments and papers that say GMOs are fine is wonderful and all-- BUT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REAL ISSUE.  The case for Monsanto being evil is not a scientific one, but a moral one.  The fact that Monsanto funds GMOs of plants to withstand more pesticide just so they can get farmers to spray more of their poison on them makes them evil.  The fact that Monsanto has government agencies illegally confiscate farmer&#39;s (and beekeeper&#39;s) crops and lifestockk if they prove resistant to their poisons, makes them evil.  The fact Monsanto are treating their seeds as their intellectual property and making farmers &quot;license&quot; them-- and ruining their lives and careers if they don&#39;t tow the line, makes them evil.  The fact that Monsanto is basically trying to utterly dominate the world food supply in their quest for corporate power, makes them evil.  Notice that none of these arguments are hinged on whether or not GMOs in and of themselves are good or bad.</p>

<p>I could care less about hybridized corn.  I say again:  The GMOs are not the issue.  What we should be instead focusing on is what Monsanto is aiming to achieve via GMOs, which is nothing less than agricultural slavery for the rest of the world.  THIS is the problem.</p>

<p>I guess Home Depot also evil.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But use of hybridized corn forces farmers to rebuy from the same source also - you were trying to say such a plan is what makes Monsanto evil.</p>

<p>You <em>should</em> be focusing on the ecological and health and safety issues - ensuring rigorous lab testing of new products, regulated use outside of the lab, extensive testing before being given to consumers, strengthening of the EPA. </p>

<p>Mixing in crazy definitions of evil severely weakens the real arguments against Monsanto and ensures the movement can be completely ignored by the mainstream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody here has understood my point-- I never said that simply selling pesticides in and of itself was evil...but Monsanto paying to create plants that can withstand more pesticides just so they can sell more pesticides is 1) unnecessarily increasing the quantity of poison put on the plants (and into the atmosphere, the water, our bodies  etc.) and 2) increasing the financial burden on farmers who have to buy the stuff...just for their own profit.  It&#39;s a despicable and treacherous practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just had an encounter with flymylasers.  Total monsanto disinformation agent.</p>

<p>I know it sounds silly saying &quot;monsanto disinformation agent&quot;  I just don&#39;t know how else to describe it.  He had a list of articles at least 10 long to debunk a scientific study I linked to in the thread.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t get to read all of the articles he linked to, but he made sure to imply that I was an idiot for linking to an article about scientific study.
<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/09/gmo-corn-rat-tumor">http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/09/gmo-corn-rat-tumor</a></p>

<p>All the article and the scientific study were suggesting in the first place was that more research is warranted about the effects of Round Up ready crops.  The study found that rats fed GMO corn were equally prone to developing cancer and dying at an earlier age as rats who had round up added to their water supply.  Rats who had neither GMO corn or roundup added were 50% less likely to develop tumors and die.</p>

<p>Like I said, I haven&#39;t had the chance to go through every single one of the links he sent to &quot;debunk&quot; the study, but!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1eyr34/bernie_sanders_calls_out_the_corporate_controlled/ca5dac5">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1eyr34/bernie_sanders_calls_out_the_corporate_controlled/ca5dac5</a></p>

<p>I did find that one of the claims in one of the articles is absolutely false, so far.  The article claimed that the specific lab rat they used in the study was an unusual type.  It turns out that the S-D Rat is used in almost all studies that involve cancer, so it is not an inappropriate type to use in the study at all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/09/25/scientists-smell-a-rat-in-fraudulent-genetic-engineering-study/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/09/25/scientists-smell-a-rat-in-fraudulent-genetic-engineering-study/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>– the investigators used a strain of rats that were bred to develop tumors as they aged (a detail they failed to disclose).  Significantly, mortality rates and tumor incidence in all experimental groups fall within historical norms for this strain of laboratory rats.  Therefore, the claim that the genetically engineered corn component of the diet or the herbicide caused the tumors is insupportable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to a page for a lab rat supplier.  The S-D rat is one of the most common rats used in scientific research.</p>

<p>When it was revealed that the letter was actually in defense of the study, stating that it was among the best on the subject, firemylasers response was to remove it from his list and pretend it doesnt exist. LOL!</p>

<p>&quot;Oops, I forgot to remove that one last time I updated the list. Thanks for pointing it out!&quot;</p>

<p>For the record, firemylasers is a high school student who likes to troll reddit in defense of Monsanto relentlessly spamming the same links over and over in every gmo thread. Despite his links and information being repeatedly debunked and shown to have no merit, he continues to spam them.</p>

<p>I wouldnt take anything a high school kid has to say about genetics seriously, let alone a small-minded ideologue like firemylasers. He even has a whole list of bookmarks ready for defending DDT.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The reason he had that list is because the study made huge news and so people bring up its claims very very frequently. </p>

<p>The study is, by the way, absolute and pure bullshit. Sample sizes of 10 are simply insufficient to make any sort of statistical conclusion about anything. Also, the rats who were fed GMO corn were fed unlimited quantities of corn only (which is known to affect obesity and cancer in rats), whereas non-GMO rats were fed a limited diet of a variety of food. They also failed to make any distinction between the rats that were fed genetically modified corn versus those that were fed straight-up Roundup.</p>

<p>The European Food Safety Authority, <em>not</em> a noted proponent of GMO foods, had <a href="http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2910.htm">this to say about the Seralini et al. study</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EFSA notes that the Séralini et al. (2012) study has unclear objectives and is inadequately reported in the publication, with many key details of the design, conduct and analysis being omitted. Without such details it is impossible to give weight to the results. Conclusions cannot be drawn on the difference in tumour incidence between the treatment groups on the basis of the design, the analysis and the results as reported in the Séralini et al. (2012) publication. In particular, <strong>Séralini et al. (2012) draw conclusions on the incidence of tumours based on 10 rats per treatment per sex which is an insufficient number of animals</strong> to distinguish between specific treatment effects and chance occurrences of tumours in rats.  Considering that the study as reported in the Séralini et al. (2012) publication is of <strong>inadequate design, analysis and reporting, EFSA finds that it is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessment.</strong> Therefore EFSA, concludes that the Séralini et al. study as reported in the 2012 publication does not impact the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate, and does not see a need to reopen the existing safety evaluation of maize NK603 and its related stacks.</p>

<p>No problem though. I have called them out successfully many times on r politics/rworldnews. They just go away after you bring the facts.</p>

<p>I spent 1 hour the other day getting some guy to admit that Monsanto suing a farmer for Canola field contamination -was  not a Myth. He to had admit  at the end. Waste of my time, but I feel this is necessary public service against the numerous Vultures of Monsanto  experts/shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I can see, people tend to prefer their science to come from peer reviewed journals, rather than entertainment site like naturalnews.com.  I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unfair if redditors who are educated in biogenetics (and not affiliated with biotech companies) offer their insight into discussions on GMO food.  That can involve supporting certain GMO products, and can also involve rejecting Monsanto&#39;s business practices, where they are unethical.  Perhaps that is shillery?  But as independent scientists, some of them consider it their civic duty to educate rather than leave the thousands of lurkers to make decisions based on ignorance and sensationalism, especially for a technology that we should be seeking to harnass for humanity&#39;s good.  </p>

<p>Good questions for genuine critical thinking are - what technology are all biotech companies working on? What are the risks associated with their technology, how are those risks and safety concerns evaluated and mitigated for? What are the benefits of the technology?  There often are risks, but there often are massive potential benefits.  Throwing out the baby with the bathwater due to fear and ignorance says that we are not capable as a species of advancing responsibly.  I personally don&#39;t believe that to be true, although maybe this subreddit exists to ensure that view is something we try to live by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You paint a pretty rosy picture of technological benefits but fail to realize that we have gone down plenty of wrong-ways in the past - do I really need to show examples?  Quite often, the higher and more complicated the technology, the more likely there are problems that are easily missed or glossed over.  The decline of birds like eagles caused scientists to track back to DDT.  The makers of DDT did not catch this problem or lead the charge to rectify it.  Bottom line is that profit, not real and safe advances, are driving corporate technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, there are often problems.  That&#39;s why everyone should be very keen to ensure the EPA are very well funded.  Look at how tightly controlled human medication is - the FDA is reasonably well funded, and generally has very high standards (though the DePuy hip recall makes me question that for instance).  But few will argue that we shouldn&#39;t try to develop new medicines, and despite the regulation, new medicines and procedures are developed by corporations.  Basically, we need strong environmental regulations, and legal action taken against those who try to bypass safety procedures.  That&#39;s an investment that has to be made, but if it results in cheap, safe and plentiful food, then it&#39;s worth it.  Personally I think having a strong EPA is worth it anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;Shill&quot; typically refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers the impression he is an enthusiastic independent customer of a seller (or marketer of ideas) for whom he is secretly working. The person or group who hires the shill is using crowd psychology, to encourage other onlookers or audience members to purchase the goods or services (or accept the ideas being marketed). Shills are often employed by professional marketing campaigns. &quot;Plant&quot; and &quot;stooge&quot; more commonly refer to any person who is secretly in league with another person or organization while pretending to be neutral or actually a part of the organization he is planted in, such as a magician&#39;s audience, a political party, or an intelligence organization </p>

Did you know on two occasions, the United States EPA has caught scientists deliberately falsifying test results at research laboratories hired by Monsanto to study glyphosate? Is that ok to you?&quot; The response was a classic...

    <div class="md"><p>My only question is why? It&#39;s not as if any redditors are in any position to make policy decisions. It&#39;d be a huge waste of money. Monsanto probably has its own pr guys, but if they&#39;re wasting time on reddit, they are not doing very well. Every gmo article i see, for our against, has good back and forth in the comments, and it&#39;s generally level headed discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, not really. PR(in this particualr case you&#39;re talking about) is about the general public, and the general public does not buy products that carry their name in large numbers. They are actually not in much need of good PR to be financially successful, which is really why they do come off so poorly, because they just don&#39;t care about their image, nor do they need to care about their image. Their value doesn&#39;t come from their brand, it comes from their assets like patents and herbicides and whatnot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of cases of academics having their research funded by corporates.  These same corporates won&#39;t fund you if you end up with results that aren&#39;t what they would prefer.  </p>

<p>Universities like donors.  Academics like university pensions.  Therefore it is often the case that corporates can buy academics.</p>

<p>This was well documented in the case of fracking.  I&#39;m not sure about GMOs but I would bet my right nut the same shit goes on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you keep bringing GMOs into it?  And why do you think scientists who support GMO are also somehow supporting Monsanto?  I don&#39;t really have an opinion on GMOs-- it depends on the application.  For example, if someone could GMO a type of protein that was more easily assimilable by human blood, I could see how that could be good.  But when Monsanto funds researchers to GMO plants to withstand more pesticide just so they can sell more pesticide to farmers, I think that is quite simply evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t work for Monsanto and don&#39;t defend them or down vote links to stories about them specifically. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me to find out that most/all Fortune 500 companies pay people to monitor/augment their online presence. If you were a CEO would you pay someone to do this? Of course!</p>

<p>Not to mention these companies employ &quot;regular&quot; people - drivers, scientists, secretaries and board members - who probably like their employer. Monsanto employs <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/investors/Pages/faqs.aspx">22,000</a> people, some of whom are redditors. Many people who work for Fortune 500 (i.e. big) companies wear it as a badge of pride, list that facton their resume.</p>

<p>Monsanto aside, I <em>do</em> defend GMOs and down vote stories/links with bad science about GMOs in them.</p>

<p>I would be happy to meet anyone calling me a shill and show them the books/W2s from the last 13 years of working in GIS for utility companies (i.e. not in biotech/agriculture/marketing.)</p>

<p>This <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/significant.png">XKCD cartoon</a> demonstrates why, <em>without any dodgy dealings or conspiracies</em>, we would expect science to throw up a paper here or there that has a statistically significant result that is contrary to the underlying truth.</p>
