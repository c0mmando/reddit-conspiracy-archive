        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Who is with me, I want to make a Civilian Citizen agency to protect us against the govt. infringing on out rights as citizens. Its kind of a double standard for us to get in trouble for following our Constitutional rights but the govt. has immunity from it all. Why can the Govt. infringe on our Constitutional rights with out any negative side effects. We need a specific Agency to fight back against the govt. so we can be United again. It just seems to me this has got way out of control and with the DHS FBI CIA And the Police and to many more to name, we are just getting trampled on. What are our choices Its either become one of them or Just sit back and let them keep screwing you over.  America needs to go back to the people and for the people. Not who has the biggest pockets... I am only one man but together we can be united and overcome this Injustice. </p>

<p>Sorry just had to vent.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time..  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Thank you all for the vast amount of Knowledge you have brought here. It is great to see how everyone can come together and help each other. The Greatest thing I learned is this could be a plausible Reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A rose by any other name, brother...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really all too concerned with WHAT it&#39;s called - if it&#39;s even called anything at all.  While some of the names you suggested seem like they might be cool, I think it would be just as cool if it weren&#39;t actually called ANYTHING, and TPTB just knew that there was an armed force with no name that took NO bullshit and that was not afraid to fight back and defend itself.</p>

<p>That might be even scarier because it would let TPTB know that these motherfuckers are in no way concerned with &quot;cool&quot; or catchy names or anything.  They&#39;re (we&#39;re) <em>all about business</em> and that&#39;s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it would be good if we simply don&#39;t <em>let</em> them &quot;spin&quot; us that way.  Easier said than done, of course, but simply not falling for whatever name &quot;they&quot; try to pin on the movement could be accomplished by simply stating that very thing to whatever MSM sources try to pin some sort of label on it.</p>

<p>Either way, with or without a name attached, the main point here of course is that we need to get back to our constitutional right to form a well-coordinated armed militia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes, I feel like I don&#39;t know what to stay focused on any longer. The media is controlled so I don&#39;t know which information is believable or not. The important info that we would need seems to be missing, or lost in a flood of bs. I know that in a fight between a militia and the Army we would loose. I feel like there is nothing worth fighting for any longer too. I don&#39;t want to fight for the rich guy&#39;s boats and investments, I don&#39;t want to fight to protect the scum that live around me from the police, even though the police can be unfair too.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t entirely agree with that.  If enough of the citizenry band together, I certainly wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a foregone conclusion that we wouldn&#39;t be able to win - especially when you consider that there are actually quite a bit of people in the military that understand now just how much of a pawn they are and how much they&#39;ve been used to do little more than evil.  A lot of the military don&#39;t want to be what they&#39;ve become, and would fight on the side of the citizenry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like there is nothing worth fighting for any longer too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel there&#39;s a <em>lot</em> worth fighting for when you think about the fact that if TPTB have their way, they would likely turn us into super poor menial serfs to an even GREATER extent than is already the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t want to fight for the rich guy&#39;s boats and investments, I don&#39;t want to fight to protect the scum that live around me from the police, even though the police can be unfair too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then fight to keep the rich guy from fucking you more.  Fight to keep a just police force intact so that they DO protect us from the scum around us.  Fight to make the police force a BETTER organization in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess I just want to protect myself at this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think that&#39;s very difficult without protecting EVERYBODY - without joining in EVERYONE&#39;S fight to protect themselves also - because I think that most of us citizens feel the way you just described here.</p>

<p>The fight that I stand up and wage for myself is the benefit that <em>you</em> will reap and definitely vise versa.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are too many punks around. And the TV makes them out as heros.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first order of business for this Citizen group would be to educate people. I don&#39;t mean in the general &quot;you need to be educated to get a good job&quot; or &quot;you need to take biology&quot; sense (although that wouldn&#39;t hurt). What I mean is morality education.</p>

<p>We are currently living in a society void of sensible morality. Everything in the Declaration of Independence is dead on accurate if you really read it. It isn&#39;t just about creating a free nation, it isn&#39;t about prosperity or freedom, it is at it&#39;s core about combating evil. Real evil. The only kind of evil we know of really, the religion of the &quot;singular&quot;. </p>

<p>There is only individuals and the singular. What separates the group from the one is when the one believes that the group should only follow the one. When the singular morphs the morality of others to suit their will alone.</p>

<p>Anthropologically speaking yes there are Alphas and Betas and we see the group mentality in action every day. We see this dynamic of &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;follow&quot; every day. What most people don&#39;t know is that there are other ways to function as groups, as individuals. The smallest government always becomes the largest. What this means is that a small group of like minded individuals can reshape the world. In fact it has always been so.</p>

<p>The crux of the issue is this. If one is unable to understand concepts like &quot;Freedom&quot; or &quot;Liberty&quot; than they will be lost to that person. Impossible to fathom, the person is unable to obtain the power associated with said terms because they simply don&#39;t understand; While indefinitely leaving that person at the sacrificial alter of another&#39;s will. </p>

<p>For clarification this is an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence...</p>

<p>&quot;...indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, <strong>that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.</strong> But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute <em>Despotism</em>, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.&quot;</p>

<p>Definition of Despotism: 
Despotism is a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power. That entity may be an individual, as in an autocracy, or it may be a group, as in an oligarchy. The word despotism means to &quot;rule in the fashion of a despot&quot; and does not necessarily require a singular &quot;despot&quot;, an individual.</p>

<p>And the definition of Despot:
Despot comes from the Greek despotes, which roughly means &quot;master&quot; or &quot;one with power&quot;, and it has been used to translate a wide variety of titles and positions.</p>

<p>(Jeez, I wonder what J.R.R. Tolkien was trying to say when he made the dark lord literally personified as a singular all seeing eye while crafting/seeking the &quot;One ring of power&quot;. /scratch chin. Metaphors are awesome.)</p>

<p>What I believe they are saying here is that having a single WILL dominate the people is exactly what they are fighting against, group or individual alike. What makes them Despotism is when they try to make the government (or the people which ARE the government in this sense) serve their will alone. This was the bases for declaring independence. </p>

<p>Of course there are numerous reasons but judging by the beauty that is the Constitution and the Bill of Rights it is very evident that; One, they are not afraid to say that evil exist nor declare they are it&#39;s enemy: Two, their intent was to create a world without it.</p>

<p>To round this up, Morality is the object of change, education is the means of instilling said change. </p>

<p>In closing, if you cannot grasp concepts that are complex and based upon a deep understanding of morality than not only are those definitions lost to you, but the power those words yield are lost and rendered inept. </p>

<p>This is why all forms of education is the first thing to be attacked, always... What happens when genocide occurs? Teachers, musicians, artist, community leaders are the first to die.</p>

<p>And to put what I am saying into context please watch this youtube video through to the end, he explains not only why morality has always been at the central issue of justice but also HOW IT BLOODY WORKS. Ty if you read this much, criticism is welcome as well as open discussion.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/OsFEV35tWsg">http://youtu.be/OsFEV35tWsg</a></p>

<p>TL:DR: Morality is what needs to change, education is the key.</p>

It would be more of a Arbitration system so there would be less corruption.

    <div class="md"><p>It would be nice. But it would immediately get infiltrated by those with the aim of neutralizing it, making it look silly, or somehow controlling it.  The standard GOP tactic would be to create a &quot;Citizens for Freedom of Democratic Government&quot; PAC to counter everything your agency would try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the goal would be to do it on a Business level and have a operating system that set policies if an infraction is made by the govt. If the govt. kills someone it shouldn&#39;t be oops I am sorry it should be held accountable for the action. Just like you and me would face the Judicial system with a juror of our peers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that they want to be held responsible for their actions. I think that they have some sort of out where they say that they were acting as the government so they do not have responsibility (not exactly sure about this). They basically steal our money thru taxes and deficit spending, so they are robbers or criminals and so you cant expect them to go along with this. They will use all of their typical tricks like money, fear, violence to control the outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See that&#39;s the problem. If we were to start a militia it is just frowned upon. The other main issue is funding, its easy to get the people who want to change but to get funding for a group thats the downfall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a militia idea. Recruit the homeless and hungry with the signs you see on the street. The ones functional enough to train, train them. For their services those, as well as those unable to preform will be fed and cared for on a Scientology like commune. No religion or political views will be expressed or forced upon patrons. Their function or relation to the group would be based on their own instinct and interest in providing aid and protection to citizens.</p>

<p>I wonder how long that would take to get shut down...</p>
