        <h3 class="title">"Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen." Zbigniew K. Brzezinski - 1982</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">70</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-05-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/lukerparanoid.html">lukerparanoid</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In addition, it may be possible--and tempting--to exploit for strategic-political purposes the fruits of research on the brain and on human behavior.  Gordon J. F. MacDonald, a geophysicist specializing in problems of warfare, has written that timed artificially excited electronic strokes could lead to a pattern of oscillations that produce relatively high power levels over certain regions of the earth.... In this way, one could develop a system that would seriously impair the brain performance of very large populations in selected regions over an extended period.... No matter how deeply disturbing the thought of using the environment to manipulate behavior for national advantages to some, the technology permitting such use will very probably develop within the next few decades.&quot;</p>

<p>No, Zbigniew  Brzezinski is not some sort of Alex Jones nor some sort of conspiratard for those who never heard of him. He is  an statesman who served as United States National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brzezinski was also pictured WITH Osama bin Laden back in the 80s or 79, sometime around then. He didn&#39;t &quot;create&quot; the Mooj, but he was one of the driving forces behind the supplying of arms to them. This is very important considering the parallels you can see between 70s/80s Afghanistan and modern day Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><del>For those who don&#39;t know, <strong>he created Mujahideen, later Al Qaeda, whose leader was our dear friend Bin Laden.</strong></del> 
<a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a13_1240427874">He admits in this interview.</a></p>

<p>Some people made some corrections to my claim. He helped Mujahideen to gain momentum (our friend Bin Laden was also an organizer of Mujahideen), and some claim Al Qaeda roots are on the Afghan war, specifically Mujahideen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point!  Relevant to this, I saw an absolutely amazing documentary on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1521052/">Afghanistan</a> which plays to your point perfectly that it certainly is not even close to black and white.  The documentary is probably the best I&#39;ve seen in a long time.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Pay to watch if you can, it can be found online if you can&#39;t.</p>

<p>The filmaker died in Afghanistan while filming, I believe at the hands of the Taliban during the 90&#39;s.  His work was continued by a collegue.</p>

<p>I think one of the most impressive (to me personally) parts of the movie is that while it basically does not discuss 9.11 almost at all, when it does mention it, the narrative is carefully worded to not place blame on OBL.</p>

<p>The first quote is slightly different in that book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another threat, less overt but no less basic, confronts liberal democracy. More directly linked to the impact of technology, it involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled and directed society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite whose claim to political power would rest on allegedly superior scientific know-how. Unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values, this elite would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest modern techniques for influencing public behavior and keeping society under close surveillance and control. Under such circumstances, the scientific and technological momentum of the country would not be reversed but would actually feed on the situation it exploits.</p>

<p>The emergence of a large dominant party, alongside the more narrowly focused and more intensely doctrinaire groupings on the right and the left, could accelerate the trend toward such technological managerialism. Such a large dominant party would combine American society&#39;s quest for stability with its historical affinity for innovation. Relying on scientific growth to produce the means for dealing with social ills, it would tap the nation&#39;s intellectual talent for broad target planning and exploit the existence of doctrinaire groups by using them as social barometers and as sources of novel ideas.  Persisting social crisis, the emergence of a charismatic personality, and the exploitation of mass media to obtain public confidence would be the steppingstones in the piecemeal transformation of the United States into a highly controlled society. In different ways, both the doctrinarian and the conservative might find the temptations inherent in the new techniques of social control too difficult to resist. The inclination of the doctrinaire left to legitimize means by ends could lead them to justify more social control on the ground that it serves progress. The conservatives, preoccupied with public order and fascinated by modern gadgetry, would be tempted to use the new techniques as a response to unrest, since they would fail to recognize that social control is not the only way to deal with rapid social change.</p>

<p>Such an outcome—were it to come to pass—would represent a profoundly pessimistic answer to the question whether American liberal democracy can assimilate and give philosophical meaning to the revolution it is undergoing. This matter not only has relevance for the United States; it has larger implications: American success or failure may provide a significant indication whether a modern democracy with highly educated citizens can successfully undergo an extensive social change without losing its essentially democratic character.  Fortunately, the American transition also contains the potential for an American redemption.</p>
