<p>I would too.  Which is why I would just lay low, and let the media craze blow over.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t be going out on a media tour, and throwing out  first-pitches at MLB games.  (That&#39;s just asking for attention.)</p>

<p>what makes you think he was &quot;asked&quot; ?  traditionally, those kind of events are paid for / PR stunts.  psst.  you are not going to be asked to throw out a first pitch just because you got your legs blown off... if that were the case, why not every war vet ?  no, i am sorry, son.  that shxt is professional PR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your proposed narrative of immature conspiracy theorists harassing these poor alleged victims is ripped almost verbatim from the Corporate Media spin room. There&#39;s been no evidence of that being the case, and you are a hypocrite for condeming others of something that you immediately do yourself; parroting opinion that you have &quot;zero legitimate evidence&quot; for. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how that was hard to grasp from my previous post, but those who are prone to unquestioningly regurgitating every sound byte they hear from the teevee are notorious for statistically lower reading comprehension and a distinct lack of critical thinking skills. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why they market their obvious propaganda direct to your demographic, you&#39;re the most likely to buy it whole cloth. That&#39;s not hyperbole, focus groups have been polled for decades to find the formulaic that gets you off via confirmation bias. It&#39;s a science and you&#39;re the labrat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I understand I have zero evidence, which is exactly why I have stated it was my OPINION. The people I have seen claiming these people were actors, were claiming that as a fact, not as an opinion. Which I do not see as hypocritical. If I was claiming that yes these people were being harassed with out evidence, while condemning others for claiming they are actors, then yes I would see that as hypocritical. </p>

<p>Also why is it simply that when someone has the same thoughts as what the MSM paints it is automatically seen as propaganda, or you being a shill. Many people have their own thoughts, that end up agreeing with the MSM. </p>

<p>I disagree with what you have said, especially after the fact that you completely disregarded how I said this was my opinion of the matter, not what I see as fact.</p>

<p>I have stated many other times, and I don&#39;t expect you to know this, that I will not reach a conclusion on what happened without the right legitimate evidence to back it up. I have also stated in other comments I have made in this thread that there is more info I would like to have about this situation before reaching a conclusion on it.</p>

<p>I have simply stated my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not talking about it in just that context. I am referring to when someone is trying to argue/discuss something with you, and just resorts to name calling instead of stating their opinion or argument. That is what I see as immature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly the point I was making, the thought that debate or arguments need to be pretty and prim is bullshit, who cares if someone calls you a shill or immature, or even a bitch in their argument? Are you a shill? Are you immature? Are you even a bitch? Does it really matter? Is it not the point of their argument that matters more than the name calling?</p>

<p>If their argument consists of nothing more than personal degradation by name-calling and other &quot;immature&quot; things, then perhaps it&#39;s not worth your time, but just because someone resorts to such does not make them any more correct or wrong.</p>

<p>Pointing out that someone is immature for name calling is in itself childish. If anything, it appears as a desperate attempt to retaliate, or an attempt change the focus of the argument back onto them. It has absolutely nothing to do with the argument itself in the exact same way that their name calling is irrelevant.</p>

<p>My point was, even men of such stature as our founding fathers resorted to name calling in their debates and their arguments, including Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams.</p>

<p>And c&#39;mon, you and I both know that they&#39;re getting hate mail, probably even threatening phone calls. If 4Chan can dox the guy with the top-rated comment in the Samuel L Jackson monologue thread and have people threatening him at work in under 24 hours over some stupid contest, then these people, with their names and addresses published on this website, are surely even bigger targets for harassment.</p>

<p>The fact that every action anyone could possibly take is inevitably spun towards your pre-determined conclusion should tell you that you&#39;re not being honest in your assessment of the evidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s defamatory only if the accusation untrue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Chicago Tribune article that JamRocker mentions <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-28/news/ct-met-sandy-hook-hoax-conspiracy-20130528_1_website-victoria-soto-sandy-hook-elementary-school">is here</a>.</p>

<p>The cease and desist email doesn&#39;t come from or on behalf of any of the victims of the Boston bombing. It is about the Greenberg, Harmon, and Brickell families. Their only crime is having pictures on the Internet. Ed Chiarini at <a href="http://www.wellaware1.com">www.wellaware1.com</a> took a couple of Picasa albums and started matching the pictures in there to pictures of other people he thought they looked like. This is something he is really bad at. For example, he thinks that Walt Disney and Adolf Hitler <a href="http://www.wellaware1.com/hitler.shtml">were both played by Kermit Roosevelt</a>.</p>

<p>After Sandy Hook, other web sites, including nodisinfo.com, have taken up this bizarre theory.</p>

<p>Thanks for the history lesson. However, your argument in defense of the families mentioned in the post rests on an irrelevant (and unsubstantiated) connection between Ed Chiarini and the author of this website. </p>

<p>Can you prove that the idea of actors being used in the Boston Marathon, for example, was directly influenced by another blogger (out of how many million bloggers on the internet?) rather than a citizen &quot;opining&quot; foul play and investigating by his own agency? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether the theory was derived from Ed Chiarini or came up independently. It&#39;s still defamation.</p>

<p>Except for a vague physical resemblance, there&#39;s <em>no</em> evidence that any one of the Greenbergs/Harmons/Brickells have any connection to Sandy Hook/Boston/any other crime.</p>

<p>This kind of resemblance is extremely common. There are <a href="http://www.inmirror.com/separated-at-birth">whole web sites </a> that point out the similarities of unrelated celebrities.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="http://nodisinfo.com/Home/the-bickell-family-and-its-role-in-false-flags/">like this one at disinfo.com</a> show an obvious reckless and malicious disregard for the truth.</p>
