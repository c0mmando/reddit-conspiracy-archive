       What appears to be emerging is the Turkish Government's opposition to the operation against Syria, when it stopped the rebels from carrying Sarin gas  through Turkish borders into Syria.  What  a coincidence that  Turkey 's arrest of  Al-Nusra  fighters yesterday is followed by so called protests to destabilize the Turkish government the next day. What a coincidence eh? It is amazing how fast money can manufacture

       "their Zionist friends in the US and Israel."
      </p>
      <p>
       so this is a Zionist conspiracy, but Israel would end up losing land in the creation of a "New Middle East"? What happened to the idea that Israel was all about colonial expansion for themselves? Are the anti-Zionist conspiracy theorists ready to give that up? or just put it on hold?

       You think the Zionists care about the good people of Israel? That is so foolish. The people of Israel have been pawns for so long the Zionist will do whatever they want with them.The  Zionist - racist bastards kicked them out of their homelands in Europe,  carved some shitty state in the Desert so they can abuse, cocoon them in the hatred of Palestinians  and use them as  pawns in the MiddleEast for their evil dominion plans for the region.  The Zionist giveth and taketh,   They do whatever they please give land to the Good people of Israel and and then take it back when it suits their other plans.

       A proper conspiracy theorist who knows what he is talking about, should know this. Now go back to your conspirtard sub. Tell them what you learned.

       What? Do you know the words you are using? Zionism is a term for the nationalistic movement aiming at re-establishing the state of Israel, now (as Israel has obviously been brought back into existance) it's mostly about developing that state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your statement doesn't even come close to making sense. I'm actually confused as to how anybody could seriously develop such a line of thought and think it is logically sound.

       I'm not so sure that establishing a globalised society isn't the end goal of, say, Chicago Bulls, but it doesn't mean that I'd go around calling the Bulls something other than a basketball team or that if something happens that leads to a globalised society, I'd suspect the Bulls of it.

       If you do not know who they are, I would highly suggest you research Paul Warburg(chief designer of the Federal Reserve System and Federal Reserve Act) and his brother Max Warburg (instrumental in the rise to political power of the Nazi party pre-WWII, and a board member of IG Farben, who ran Nazi Germany's entire industrial machine, and secured the necessary fuels and chemicals through other groups such as Standard Oil that played both sides through the whole war). Keep in mind aso, the Federal Reserve and its response to the Great Depression was what got America into WWII in the first place. They were both German-Jewish brothers from a family that has been prominent in the banking industry for hundreds of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       They both had a falling out over Zionism, and I forgot who was for what side, but my over all point is that is the kind of social circles Zionism was created in: the kind where two brothers think nothing of organizing and making money off of both sides of one of the biggest wars on the face of this planet. Always keep that in mind.

       Because it illustrates the constant mis-appliance of words as labels. It also goes to show that with the use of every word as a label, comes a motive and intended reason for perpetuating the use of an incorrect label. In the case of elected official, by ensuring the use of that label to themselves [officials elected through rigged, or otherwise fraudulent means] they create the perception that they were legally and legitimately elected.

       What you're arguing for, to extend your metaphor, isn't that we stop calling them "Elected officials", but that we all start changing the meaning of the term "elected".

       I'm arguing for people to call them out on not be legally elected. I simply used that to illustrate fully the motivation for someone picking and perpetuating a certain phrase because of what it requires someone to assume as true before they will accept the label as valid.

       This is not how meaning in language is produced. Language is a constant, dynamic process working "anonymously" without regard to the intentions of individual agents. The meaning of a word is its use in the language, and language can not simply be "rigged" by conspiracists. Yes, there are a
       <em>
        few
       </em>
       words that have a story of intentionality behind them (modernity, for example), but the vast majority is not. I suggest you do a little basic reading on this, like Saussure or late Wittgenstein. You can't change or preserve the meaning of a word on your own.

       Still not sure how that is connected to Zionism. Are you implying the "Zionists" are using the label "Zionist" to hide the fact that they are actually anti-Zionists? What!?

       Wow...first off "Language is a constant," "dynamic process"
      </p>

       Which one is it? Because it can't be both? Language is constantly changing. Every word has thousands of connotations, situational implications, and secondary meanings. If this was not the case, none of the above words could be used to convey the intended impression that I am "irrational, a conspiracy nut, and don't know what I am talking about." Cause I sure didn't see those exact phrases anywhere in there, and that was most definitely conveyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not understand and appreciate this basic part of the nature of language, then you probably walk around confused a lot. Each word that is chosen in a moment to build a sentence, or to be used as a label, or perpetuated as a catch phrase is done so with a careful consideration of all those secondary meanings, inferences, possible implications, and connotations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who started Zionism were rich money loving psychopaths, who cared about nothing more than making more money, and the idea of a persecuted people reclaiming a homeland after thousands of years of living as second class citizens all across the region for thousands of years was the perfect thing to hide behind where most don't have the balls to point the finger at you. Why? Because that word Zionism has so many more facets than economical. What do they do? Disregard all the basic philosophies their religion stands for to keep making money hand over fist.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you, I suggest, need to spend more time thinking about the words you surround yourself with so frequently.

       And as a side note, individuals change the meanings of words all the time. It is an individual that uses a word in a new way, or connotation, or context, either purposefully or by mistake. It is by the individual doing this to be observed by others, who may or may not perpetuate this new meaning or use of a word, that words meanings and uses change and adapt. You again, need to spend more time thinking about what you read instead of just regurgitating it with no disclaimer.
