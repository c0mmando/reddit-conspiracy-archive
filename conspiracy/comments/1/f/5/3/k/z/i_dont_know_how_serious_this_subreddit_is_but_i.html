      <p>
       George Carlin's American Dream bit may seem like humor, but you cannot deny the fact that this speech is correct. A few families determine what major news we see on TV. If they want us to feel a certain way on the Benghazi attacks, they give it a lot more air time compared to how Obama's healthcare plan is doing well. (arbitrary and hypothetical example). They control what we see on TV, and they control politicians. This is correct when I explain the word control: special interest lobbyists that coax politicians to vote a certain way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently I have been realizing that the news organizations are becoming tumultuous and unstable. Fox is making more outrageous claims and trying to get people to vote Republican. MSNBC is trying to make people vote Democrat. CNN is trying to be unbias but lean Democrat most of the time. One thing they don't have total control over as an umbrella entity is the Internet. The internet is where common people and small start-up news organizations now have the opportunity to speak their minds and report news accurately from the start. This is changing people's opinions on the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could this be why CISPA and PIPA and whatever the fuck else Act the government is trying to pass won't die? Could it be the Rupert Murdochs of the world who are trying to control what the general public is able to see and make decisions based off of what they see?
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is trying to get a handle on the internet, to shut up the other organizations for their special interest buddies. By adding regulation to the internet, you take away the people's first amendment rights by fear that they will be taken off to jail for their beliefs. Piracy is just another superficial layer covering a whole body of hidden agendas from Hollywood, which includes the Murdochs of the News Corporations.

       You hit the nail on the head. That is the only reason they want to regulate the internet. They will say it's for piracy and yada yada but that is bullshit. It has been proven that piracy does not affect music and movie sales. They need a way to spread their propaganda and control it. They can't with the internet and are trying VERY hard to change that.

       It really is crazy how once we realize certain things, we can't go back. New knowledge that differs from our prior worldview + Caring enough to be interested in the state of things even if we won't be directly affected = A State of .....awareness? Frustration? Info seeking? All of the above?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since I had the epiphany that the world is run by money, and not theoretically, I couldn't stop reading and researching and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew shocked and angry and helpless, but for my ability to acquire info, as if somehow this knowledge about history and the economy and the centralized few at the top of the World Bank, and Evil and power families is all somehow going to make it right.

       Ok, buckle up, I will too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what if (theoretically, though this IS possible but highly unlikely to ever happen) all of the people like us ..."truth seekers" (?) were to gather together, like a forum, at a large convention center, and bring each of our puzzle pieces from fact finding. And we gathered into teams on different topics and unbiased and without prejudice simply stated things based on facts. Traced the path of corruption, for example, from the world bank to certain leaders then to their handlers and advisors then to those at the top to whom the advisors are reporting. Somehow, outing verifiable people seems to be possible, and if facts were presented as well documented, empirically researched and organized, we could come to conclusions... A worldwide truth seeker (TS) jury.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find that us TSs, are generally good, kind people. We want peace, don't understand how in a world of plenty there is still hunger, don't relate to leaders who seek power for power's sake, because we are...well, good.
      </p>
      <p>
       So....what if? What if we did that? What would happen if we laid out topics that are conspiratorial and hidden, unsolved and unaddressed, into categories, and.....found the truth. Presented it to humanity. Let the puzzle pieces fall where they may. A truth disclosure project spanning the genres of our world that takes no heed of mass media urging us to look at certain things and not others. A grassroots call to action and deliberation.

       If you got everyone here together in one room you would realize that you think that at

        least
       </strong>
       half of them are batshit crazy paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying they are or aren't, but nobody can agree with everything on here.  There's too many mutually exclusive theories about so many topics, and so little hard evidence that changing someone's mind would require proof thats virtually impossible to come by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose you found the truth, though.  What would you do?  What
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       you do?  As far as I'm concerned, the truth has been in plain sight for a long time now, but theres nothing (very little) anybody who cares can do, at least not without sacrificing their lives/names/families.

       And yes, sadly this is the genre that draws, by its nature, a lot of attention from people who are mentally ill or unstable, paranoid,  and obsessive. It gets tossed into the bin labeled Crazy and never garners serious public scrutiny. Once someone hears conspiracy they don't think several people coming together for a secret purpose, which is basically the definition, they think of the theorists who have publicly spoken out
       <em>
        before having the scientific and factual backing to prove their statements
       </em>
       ending in those people either being crazy, or being sane and looking/sounding crazy.

       These are the topics in my bookshelf (some legal books for work, and some parenting books) but mainly these topics... And researching these makes me feel....better. Makes me feel closer to the answer to my unknown question. Like someday facts will congeal and I'll know the truth, be able to share it, use it for good. I dont know if this makes sense to anyone..

       When my eyes were first opened, I tried to tell people about the things I was beginning to see. Some didn't care, others warned me to stop because there is nothing I can do about it and it will just drive me crazy. I couldn't stop, I went deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. I experienced the whole gambit of emotions outlined above and even fell into a depression once I realized just how grand this scheme is, how everyone participates, unknowingly or not. Even as I see the problem and want to avoid it, I must participate in order to survive. So, then I work my way out of the serious depression and start to develop solutions, but every solution that has any chance of being successful (peaceful solution) requires everyone to work together. I go back to the same people who said I would go crazy and outline my solution, they say it will never happen. I find reddit and other like minds, begin to see that some are on the right track. I research their comment history and find they made a racist comment to be funny. Can't depend on them, they folded under the imaginary pressure of peers they don't even know. I find several other similar cases of wanting change, but unwilling to change themselves. If you really want change you must change yourself 100%, not some of the time, not when it benefits you, all of the time. You will face ridicule, you will face people who you thought were friends, you will face "downvotes," you will stand out from the crowd, but isn't that what this is all about, CHANGE? Practice what you preach, say what you mean, and mean what you say. You are not alone, there are others out there, you just have to find us.

       More specifically watch the BBC documentary "Century of the Self". It doesn't go actually much into "conspiracy stuff" but it is a good starter, since it is accepted by mainstream.

       Yes, there is control.  Yes, there are huge special interests at work that "breathe together" to keep business partners in position of power and influence (practically synonyms).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, while you may be able to exercise freedom of speech on the internet, you will never be able to be truly free so long as you are under the crushing weight of high interest debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examine the messages put out by the media, and look at their economic implications.  Really, world history is the story of competing economic interests.  By enslaving you in high interest debt in a disposable consumerist society, you become the chattel of the free market.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, take the USA real estate bubble of the last decade and all of the toxic assets that were dumped upon the public.  Once the barriers to entry were lowered, individuals were able to purchase more assets than they could afford.  Suddenly, home owners had favorable balance sheets thanks to their rapidly appreciating assets.  Some jerk-off sells their own for $1M, and suddenly everyone on the block thinks they have a $1M asset on their balance sheet.  What do they do in response?  Instead of liquidating, a vast majority of (now homeless) individuals took out home equity lines of credit and used their equity to finance consumption.  Then, predictably, the market corrects itself and these mortgages are now under water.
      </p>
      <p>
       While all of this is occurring, mortgage backed securities become the hot new financial instrument, and are dumped all over the securities markets.  Well regulated funds, like many pension funds, are only able to invest in financial instruments with certain credit ratings.  Well, many of these new mortgage backed securities were rated as investment grade by conflicting interests.  And, if they weren't rated high enough, companies like AIG would insure the securities and those financial instruments, now backed by companies like AIG, have a high enough rating to make them credit-worthy investments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the media kept pumping the American Dream, that of the white picket fence and 2.5 kids, augmented by the cheap home equity lines of credit.  Everyone was feeling rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bubble, that the MSM helped create, then bursts; of course, not before massive amounts of wealth are destroyed in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we know a thing or two about science.  Energy is nature can never be created or destroyed.  That wealth wasn't destroyed - it was simply extracted out of the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       To what end?  Clearly, the establishment is attempting to create a new feudalism, and the masses keep playing right into their hands.

       Take a look at the stock market right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now research how the Federal Reserve has been pumping $85 billion (billion, that's right) dollars per month into the economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fed is keeping the stock market artificially high to make it look as though the economy is booming. Look how fast the market has risen since 08/09....definitely not on pace with economic growth.

       Indeed.  What is more fascinating to me is the $5 Trillion/day that moves in the FOREX markets of currency; over half of which is the USD.  People say the USD is tanking, but I'm not sure if it really is, or if this is disinformation to try to corner FOREX through global public relations.

       I tend to mostly agree; however, I think the dotcom bubble was a bit different.  In the housing bubble, financial institutions deliberately lowered the standards for new lenders leading to a "gold rush" type of effect.  In the dotcom bubble, the internet exploded in popularity while companies learned how to monetize the internet as a business platform.

       Possibly - I don't know the answer to that question, but if the answer is in the affirmative, then perhaps the dotcom bubble isn't as dissimilar as I had imagined.

       I got my information from a book by a retired hedge fund trader.  He started up the falcon funds I believe.  He noted, and I am recalling from memory so correct me if I am wrong, that anyone with a dotcom was being handed money left and right and the analyst questions and due dilligence was very loose and lax at this time.  I believe one anecdote was a question on increasing foreign sales, at a dotcom, and no analyst bothered to follow up with how the company would plan on achieving this growth at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless of how we got there the process seems similar in both bubbles for some consumers.  Increase paper wealth, increase confidence, increase spending, take away paper wealth.

       Nope.  The goal is to have an evenly divided electorate that thinks the guys on the other team are insane.

       You are right about CISPA though.  I strongly encourage you to read Propaganda by Edward Bernays, or at least familiarize yourself with his his ideas (wiki).

       yup, and the rise of 3D printers may be the boiling point in the push for internet control. Now that there are 3D printable gun designs flying around, the government is bound to react. They can't stop us from spreading the information as long as the internet is up and running...so they might just shut it down when the proliferation begins to reach significant numbers of people.

Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses.

       My view is its all about money.Here is a little history on television media. First you have to understand fundamentally there is no difference between CNN and MTV. They both had the same business model, drive viewers to sell ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think at the start of the rise of cable television is when this shift happened. I feel like before that television news felt as beholden to journalistic integrity as print news, and since there was not yet a single 24 hours cable news network, news shows were far and few in-between so there was not much filler. In 1981 CNN launches and for the better part of 15 years was basically the only name in cable news, and the first 24 hour news network. For a time it was good, they had no direct competition, and like the weather channel had steady enough viewership to justify ad sales and the news as driving ratings was not a major factor in many newsrooms (not to say that it didn't happen, but not nearly on the scale we are at today)
      </p>
      <p>
       So we get to 1996, CNN's reputation has grown to a respected news journalism and we get 2 new upstarts in MSNBC and Fox News. I think this is where everything in the cable news media began to change. When these for profit networks now had competition that was direct, the only difference was which audience they attempted to capture by reporting those stories in more favorable light (fox right, MSNBC left) CNN for a while just remained the big boy on the block, but dwindling viewership as the cable news market fractured, meaning CNN would either have to increase ratings or shrink its budget; and so began the cable news run for ratings, which dumped every last shred of journalistic integrity for the dollars that top ratings bring. Its not so much that they flat out change the news, although there is evidence of that, but they would over sensationalize, race to scoop which lead to misinformation being put out. Trying to follow ridiculous patterns, if a plane crashed last week, every time a plane even has a routine landing issue, we will cut to reporters watching every landing hoping beyond hope they get the shot and scoop the world. (Its the same thing with a mass shooting, after any mass shooting, the media just runs with an orgy of any shooting, or gun, or anything that has a tenuous connection to a larger event, even if they know they are most likely wrong, they still get the ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes all these television networks are worried about the internet, they are lobbying like hell to get things like CISPA passed, and are also looking for ways to move operations online and capture that market and monetize it as well. Really the entire cable news networks system of the US is entirely fucked up. Imagine if someone came out with a rival to the weather channel, and they always gave slightly better feeling forecasts, or just because there are now two, that money gets divided and they have less ability to predict the weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of a solution, its tough, this is a free society and if you want to create a TV channel based on telling news stories, no matter what skew, or spin you do or do not want to put on it thats your right. I would love some kind of broadcast bandwidth that was not based on ad sales, but somehow received enough funding to adequately be able to tell the stories that need to be told and do the reporting. Some major issues are obviously too many people would have a problem with a state sponsored media network, myself included. So it would need to be funded by the people for the people; yet at the end of the day the same issues will remain, what stories get prominent time, what doesn't (what's important to me might not be to you, etc) Yet at least you take out the profit motivation from that discussion, and hopefully whichever group you have in the news room deciding can come up with a system or method to make those decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly cable news, all of it makes me just sick, once you really see they are just pandering for ratings and importance of story is only judged on ratings, its no wonder there is so much Beiber talk on them, or that they attempt to drum up self created conflicts to keep the audience engaged
      </p>
      <p>
       While your theory sounds plausible, the money motivation is much simpler, more legal. I doubt they have any aversion to telling accurate portrayals of current events, its just history has dictated that is not what gets the the most ratings, they get ratings by throwing people in-front of a camera during a hurricane, or talking about Jodie Arias, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks god for the internet, it still has its problems, its much easier to get sucked into false information since many people making blogs etc have less attention to detail to put it nicely. The biggest difference is online I get to choose which story I want spun at me and how I want it spun. (Although the internet sites are having the same issues, having to throw up sensational headlines for more mundane stories to draw clicks, how many times have you seen a headline on Huffingtonpost that starts, " Madow evicerates conservative congressman on air" and it ends up being a run of the mill cross party interview.
