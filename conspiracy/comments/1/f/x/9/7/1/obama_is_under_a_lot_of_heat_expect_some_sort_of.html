       There is no escape from the retribution this time for all the misdeeds this government has perpetrated on its own people.  The tipping point has been reached.  They know this.  It is almost always customary that desperate actions take place when needed to divert attention away from their agenda.

       Expect some sort of Iranian threat, or Israel attacking Syria or China threatening Taiwan or some other international threat that makes the wiretapping and other events not important.  Expect something like this to happen soon.

       There seems to be a  larger interest in sociopathy recently and I think that we should focus down on that one.  Otherwise we are in a place where we are endlessly talking data points.

       This is bigger than Watergate, all three branches of the federal government have their asses in the sling. Its all rotten. They are literally data mining everyone for no reason.

       The law has turned into a straight jacket, there is no way to make the government obey the law without breaking the law.  The states or the people have to push back.

       They can't invade NSA. The patriot act has to be reviewed and they unconstitutional parts have to be undone. Verizon and the other companies were forced to comply but even though they were forced they breached every contract they had by giving info to 3rd parties. 
We should seize this opportunity to correct what is fucked up with our government federal reserve and IRS included.

       By realizing the breach of contract and filing a class action suit against all companies giving info to the fed.  Maybe the fed is "protected" by these obscure measures that claim national security is more important that the constitution, but private companies are not.  We must act fast.

       Doubt it,  this is about taking the last shred of power left from the people and disarming the bankster's "army/police" nation.  Now that it has control over all of the nations banks and military through "democracy" which is really just another word for corporate minority rule,  they don't require the US police force anymore to handle their dirty work.
      </p>
      <p>
       So its all about bringing this nation down to its knees to the point we will give away our liberties willingly.  They'll do it with money and socialization/communism.

       I honestly think we are too jaded as a country to take another terrorist hit seriously, especially right after this comes out. Also, you do realize that 911 is a fucking cash cow they haven't fully sucked dry yet. There is no way they would get rid of that yet.

       I think will see heavy coverage of domestic terrorism (like the campus shooting yesterday in Santa Monica) flood main stream media. This works in two ways: 1. it sends a message to the public that we actually "need" the NSA to spy on us for our own protection, and 2. to draw the public's focus towards the victims of these
       <del>
        fundraisers
       </del>
       err...I mean crimes. Who wants to push politics in the face of victims when there are benefits to organize? No one should be surprised when a major domestic event happens in the next few weeks/months...

       A fundraising event would be risky at Disney though. Disney is a major corporation and representative of capitalism. More likely targets are college campuses, federal buildings with social service support, public events like the Boston Marathon bombings (a lot of pride festivals are happening in a few weeks...so that is a scary thought!), etc.

       How 'bout that bird flu in China that has some strangely human-made elements? If they want to drive the public into hysteria and get protection, an epidemic is the way to go right now. China also combined that with H1N1 and made a super-flu. Who's to say they won't "accidentally" unleash that all over the world....?

       A false-flag doesn't need to be a shooting or a terrorist attack, just something to drive the public away from the wildfire.

       As a young person, I can definitely say Obama is the worst president I've ever lived through. Not that they've really been much different, but he's bringing on 1984 in front of our eyes. I've been wondering for so long if something like this could be possible or was going on, and now my suspicions have been confirmed. Sadly there's a lot of people who just don't care or don't know. If all else fails, and I mean literally all else. We have the 2nd amendment to protect the other ones..
       <br/>
       and now I'm on a list.

       They were speccing and building this stuff before Obama came into office.  Bush couldn't get away with as much because we weren't degenerated so far yet and the
       <em>
        liberal intellectuals
       </em>
       were strongly opposed to him and they simply stood down, closed their eyes and chanted
       <em>
        Hope
       </em>
       when Obama came around.  Its quite possible that the next president will be even worse because well, it will be the next president.  We might have a good president some day but likely there will be a nasty fucking crash first and the dollar will have lost its reserve status.  So if you are
       <em>
        young
       </em>
       then that is definitely in your timeline.  Its likely that your parents were young during one of the largest real estate booms in history and that most of their worldly aspirations were heavily tied to that bubble.  The game changed on you real quick and most older people don't understand that at all.  They are going to color the future with the past and I find it highly unlikely that it will be a good strategy for someone who still has 60+ years of life left to live.  America is going to crash hard and you need to make yourself globally competitive.  I just tried to take a Russian or Chinese language course while I'm home in California from living abroad and these courses don't exist at my large university or very large junior college.  There were however, I kid not, eleven American sign language courses though.  Fuck.  I guess I should forget about trying to improve myself.

       This is getting good though I was listening to a local SPORTS TALK on the radio and they were talking about this topic about the NSA and the people calling in were irate.  Most of them were at the point of "action".  This is not good for the stability of the government and I think big things are going to go down soon.

       This is bigger than Watergate, all three branches of the federal government have their asses in the sling. Its all rotten. They are literally data mining everyone for no reason.

       The law has turned into a straight jacket, there is no way to make the government obey the law without breaking the law.  The states or the people have to push back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something has to happen, they are clearly out of control.  Can the state goverments use the bill of rights to raid the NSA?
