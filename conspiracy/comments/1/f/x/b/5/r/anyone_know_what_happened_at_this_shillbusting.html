<p>Hi everyone, Just thought I&#39;d share something interesting that happened to me this week. I work for a marketing firm in Redmond that has a contract with Microsoft. I can&#39;t say specifically which division, but suffice to say we are not involved with the Xbox. We had a pretty large meeting this week at one of the offices off 31st and, because this was the first time we had visited the Microsoft complex, we got a tour of some of the buildings. It&#39;s a quite amazing place. We won&#39;t the only visitors either; there were contractors from quite a number of other firms visiting, and presumably meeting to discuss projects related to our own. We had a semi-formal meeting in one of the larger meeting rooms, followed by lunch and some more touring. In some of the buildings they have offices for a whole range of different divisions all mixed together (e.g. I saw Skype offices, Windows Phone offices and more all in just one building). At one point we visited one of the Xbox offices, and our guide went off to find a particular manager for us to meet. He was gone for a while, so we were left hanging in the middle of a fairly hectic office for several minutes. While we were waiting, various marketing employees said hello to us/shook our hands - it was a pretty friendly place. Just nearby were two guys chatting at one of their PCs, and they caught my attention because they were on Reddit! I thought that was pretty cool, and presumed they were having a late lunch break and were just goofing around online. I kind-of started to eavesdrop (I honestly couldn&#39;t help it, they were talking about Reddit!) and realized they were actually talking business. One of the exchanges went like this: &quot;I got a few more on pics and some of the smaller subs&quot; &quot;Honestly just don&#39;t bother I think, stay focused on gaming. We really should be spending 90% of our time there.&quot; [Note: I presume they were referring to <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> and <a href="/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a>] His coworker went back to his own computer, and he continued Redditing while we waited. He must&#39;ve really been hyped up on caffeine or something, because his typing was like a machine gun and he was switching tabs like crazy (or maybe that&#39;s just because Microsoft hires the &#39;hacker&#39; type of guys?) Anyway I noticed he was mass-downvoting a ton of posts and comments, and he kept switching to other tabs to make posts and comments of his own. I couldn&#39;t make out exactly what he was posting, but I presumed he was doing RM (reputation management) and asked my boss about it later. According to my boss, MS have just brought in a huge sweep of SMM managers to handle reputation management for the Xbox One. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with reputation management (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management</a>), it is basically what it sounds like. Social media managers doing RM focus on providing positive posts, likes and shares to promote the brand on social media sites and forums - usually posing as the &#39;happy customer&#39; archetype through a multitude of accounts. In the last year or so, Reddit has become more and more important to an overall RM strategy. It also often involves &#39;debunking&#39; people who make negative or critical comments about the brand online. I&#39;ve done this myself for numerous clients before (even on Reddit once, sorry!). It is fairly standard procedure, although usually not so much for huge companies like Microsoft. I don&#39;t know why such a huge company needs to devote energy to this, because their brand is already extraordinarly well-known. But in any case, they seem to be putting a BIG focus on it for the Xbox One. Not only in-house; they&#39;re also dishing out the big bucks for some pretty high-profile marketing firms to do the work for them. Reddit will absolutely be a part of that strategy, and the couple of guys I saw were probably just the tip of the iceberg. I&#39;m a fairly die-hard gamer and Redditor who frequents this sub a lot. After seeing all the massive debates about the Xbox lately, I thought you guys would probably find that little morsel to be interesting. There&#39;s a good chance that many of the positive posts/comments we&#39;re seeing about the Xbox One have been posted by employees from one of those marketing firms. It&#39;s fairly standard to diss your competitors too, so I&#39;m guessing some of the negative posts about it might even be from Sony. That&#39;s just a hypothesis, though it wouldn&#39;t be the first time a seeming-crapstorm among &quot;Redditors&quot; was actually just a proxy war between marketing employees. </p>
