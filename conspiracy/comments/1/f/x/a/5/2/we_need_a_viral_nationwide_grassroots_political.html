<p>It&#39;s about time. Scandal after scandal after fuckup after lie. If we can organize and mobilize the anger, we could get this idea spread. It&#39;s literally an ideology, and that&#39;s why it can work. Grassroots Politician. We need a grassroots political movement, in every city, to elect politicians first locally and then higher and higher in the system. Pirate party to the max. </p>

<p>We could have an open source website that lists candidates and their views, their political profile, etc, campaign contributions, etc. Enough people use the Internet that we can seriously start something...we have to try don&#39;t we?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Deep philosophical level? Is that a requirement these days for anything to occur? Does it require deep philosophical reasoning to come to the conclusion that you need to step up to the plate and do something for the generation of students who are going to be saddled with $40,000+ in student debt for 10, 15 years? Does it require deep ruminating to decide that you must hit the bankers where it hurts -- in the pocket book/balls?</p>

<p>All fallacies! An average person can come to these conclusions! No need for any life long internet philosophy degrees! Sorry, you want to think, ruminate, philosophize and kick around mental hypothetical(s) for the most basic and obvious points of attack. How about dealing with reality, instead of perpetual mental round-a-bouts? How about joining the UFAA, how about fighting for a 1% Wall St Sales Tax. No philosophers required -- just action. If it seems simple, it is because it is! So DO it.</p>

<p>These are basic ideas, very practical and do indeed change the system if they are implemented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, you can go on with your endless questions and rhetorical questions... Or, you can actually start the process of attacking the banking system with a concrete idea. The UFAA (United Front Against Austerity) is ORGANIZING people to fight for a 1% Wall St Sales Tax. Push this idea. These other questions are important, sure, but you need to be concrete. You need a starting point. Endless questions and philosophical stone kicking is pointless and a waste of time. </p>

<p>This is not about me, or my personal record. Honestly, who cares about &quot;anonymous internet forum poster&quot;. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall into the trap of the Occupy movement by having ZERO demands and engaging in endless idiotic conversations. Define what you want, go after it -- no deep thinking required. Simple demands do not require you to enter into the philosophical abyss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, so you need strong leadership, which the UFAA provides. Occupy offered NO leaders. This is an organization that provides leadership to prevent being co-opted. Also, they are starting with one basic demand ie, 1% Wall St Sales Tax. The message is clear -- fight for that one single idea.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be one of these ridiculous libertarians where you say no to basic concepts such as the nation state, fiat currency, leaders, municipal or state governments, etc.</p>

<p>You are treading on the same water by discounting entire ideas such as viral ideas and trends. </p>

<p>Again, fight for a 1% Wall St Sales tax and don&#39;t be bogged down by &quot;oh, we can&#39;t spread the idea via twitter and make it viral&quot; or &quot;oh, if we fight for that, we might get co-opted&quot;. cmon,  you are basically saying you are ready for battle and all dressed up for it, but you decide to sit still on the sidelines and do jack squat.</p>

<p>Also, you want to get to the point where &quot;they&quot; are trying to co-opt you. It&#39;s going to happen anyways with mass movements. It&#39;s such an obvious part of the struggle. You can&#39;t expect to fight for your ideas and not receive some counter attacks. We are talking about reality here; it must be dealt with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Do-nothings and impotent people.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, you mean bankers and politicians? <em>I&#39;m here all night, folks</em>.</p>

<p>. . . on a more serious note:</p>

<p>With regards to violence, I think you&#39;re justified if it&#39;s in defense of things you love and care about. What I mean is, if your wife and child are being threatened then I think it&#39;s okay to halt that threat. This is why I think the 2nd Amendment makes perfect sense. This is not about robbers or terrorists - this is about a tyrannical government doing whatever it wants to whomever it wants. The right to defend yourself against tyranny is fundamentally important.</p>

<p>I would say that how other people play their game is neither here nor there. If you disagree then simply get the hell away from them. If you agree then you can hang out or whatever.</p>

<p>If, however, they&#39;re being douche-bags that doesn&#39;t mean you need to fight them. I know a lot of douche-bags that I don&#39;t fight on a daily basis. In fact I spend a lot of time not fighting. I avoid them like Black Death because that&#39;s the best possible solution. The only times I&#39;ll ever fight or get physical is if either I&#39;m under imminent threat or someone I care about is under imminent threat. Then the gloves come off. And that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean meeting violence with violence. I don&#39;t want to be a bad person and causing another to suffer or die would make me a bad person. So, for me, this is very context dependant. If they play dirty then this means that I have to out-think them. I won&#39;t put my hands up just because they&#39;re raging assholes. It means that I have to be smarter than them.</p>

<p>I think you think that by simply doing something you&#39;re doing good. This is not necessarily the case. With whom are you allied? What are their ends? What do they expect from you? How are you benefiting them? What is the outcome of your actions? How will this impact other people?</p>

<p>To you these may be unimportant, but to me they are of great interest.</p>

<p>I am not condoning violence. Not sure where you got that from. I am not for this Adam Kokesh form of protest where you bring your guns to Wash D.C. or the state capital like a bunch of anarchists.</p>

<p>Again, you want to create a &quot;momentum&quot;... get the ball rolling.. the idea of a 1% Wall St Sales Tax can be a rallying point and single demand that unions, average joes, me, you, neighbours, churches (read: charitable demand), etc can rally around.</p>

<p>The outcome is simple.. 1% Wall St Sales Tax.. if you don&#39;t like that issue, take up another mass appeal issue like reducing the student interest rate to a minimal level like .75%...</p>

<p>The benefit is doing something for the average american. Ideas such as the two mentioned benefit reg. ppl, do not benefit Wall St interests, and the powers that be..</p>
