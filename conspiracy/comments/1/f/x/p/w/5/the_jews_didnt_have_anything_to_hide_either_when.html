    <div class="md"><p>Its true.  I may not have the country right, but I believe the Netherlands took extensive registers of their citizens prior to the war.  Of course the people had nothing to hide (at the time) and happily gave up their information. When the Nazis rolled in, it was a simple matter of obtaining the lists and going down the check-boxes, resulting in a MUCH higher rate of Jews killed than in countries without such lists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an incredibly important point. I did some research, came up with the following <a href="http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/languages/dutch/pdf/article_croes.pdf">link</a>. (PDF warning) A quote:</p>

<p>&quot;The almost complete registration of the civilian population and the hard-to-forge Dutch identity cards were the most important factors in this context. In Belgium and France there existed a tradition of opposition to or evasion of government authority — resulting in less-efficient types of population registration. In the Netherlands,
by contrast, there was for a long time little doubt that the bureaucracy would not sabotage German-imposed measures, and in fact these were thoroughly implemented.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if the Obama administration does not have nefarious plans for the data, the fact that it has been collected and organized puts everyone at danger for someone else with nefarious intent. It could be the next administration, it could be an invading country, it could be one of the evil (sarcasm) hackers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>...excellent.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.ibmandtheholocaust.com/">here is the book</a> by Edwin Black that reveals the entire historical truth of the matter. </p>

<p>The origin: Black was touring the US Holocaust Museum in Washington (with his parents who were victims of Nazi concetration camps) when he saw an IBM logo on one of the Hollerith machines exhibited. </p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from the book&#39;s introduction (wall o&#39; text ahead):</p>

<p>&quot;When the Final Solution sought to efficiently transport Jews out of European ghettos along railroad lines and into death camps, with timing so precise the victims were able to walk right out of the boxcar and into a waiting gas chamber, the coordination was so complex a task, this too called for a computer. But in 1933, no computer existed.</p>

<p>However, another invention did exist: the IBM punch card and card sorting system—a precursor to the computer. IBM, primarily through its German subsidiary, made Hitler&#39;s program of Jewish destruction a technologic mission the company pursued with chilling success. IBM Germany, using its own staff and equipment, designed, executed, and supplied the indispensable technologic assistance Hitler&#39;s Third Reich needed to accomplish what had never been done before—the automation of human destruction. More than 2,000 such multi-machine sets were dispatched throughout Germany, and thousands more throughout German-dominated Europe. Card sorting operations were established in every major concentration camp. People were moved from place to place, systematically worked to death, and their remains cataloged with icy automation.</p>

<p>IBM Germany, known in those days as Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen Gesellschaft, or Dehomag, did not simply sell the Reich machines and then walk away. IBM&#39;s subsidiary, with the knowledge of its New York headquarters, enthusiastically custom-designed the complex devices and specialized applications as an official corporate undertaking. Dehomag&#39;s top management was comprised of openly rabid Nazis who were arrested after the war for their Party affiliation. IBM NY always understood—from the outset in 1933—that it was courting and doing business with the upper echelon of the Nazi Party. The company leveraged its Nazi Party connections to continuously enhance its business relationship with Hitler&#39;s Reich, in Germany, and throughout Nazi-dominated Europe.</p>

<p>Dehomag and other IBM subsidiaries custom-designed the applications. Its technicians sent mock-ups of punch cards back and forth to Reich offices until the data columns were acceptable, much as any software designer would today. Punch cards could only be designed, printed, and purchased from one source: IBM. The machines were not sold, they were leased, and regularly maintained and upgraded by only one source: IBM. IBM subsidiaries trained the Nazi officers and their surrogates throughout Europe, set up branch offices and local dealerships throughout Nazi Europe staffed by a revolving door of IBM employees, and scoured paper mills to produce as many as 1.5 billion punch cards a year in Germany alone. Moreover, the fragile machines were serviced on site about once per month, even when that site was in or near a concentration camp. IBM Germany&#39;s headquarters in Berlin maintained duplicates of many code books, much as any IBM service bureau today would maintain data backups for computers.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, and that is one of the interesting dialectics of history. Quite often we see the victim of tyranny engage in tyranny of their own. We saw the Serbians fall victim to the genocide of the Croat &quot;Ustase&quot; during WW2, but later those same Serbs engaged in one of their own against the Bosnians. We saw the Germans oppressed at the hands of the Allies after WW1, so they took it out on the Jews during WW2. Now Jews are oppressing the Palestinians.</p>

<p>And this goes the other way around too. We saw the Tutsis and Alawites ally with the European colonizers in Rwanda and Syria, respectively. So later the Hutus, and now the Sunnis, are taking their revenge. Everyone is engaging in massive &quot;collectivism&quot;, and therefore the cycle never ends, its merely shifts from one form to another. Groups killing other groups. Nobody respecting &quot;individualism&quot;.</p>

<p>you pointed out no facts to prove your claim that &quot;the Jews&quot; are spying on us. And the FACT that you are willing to make an irrational and blatantly false statements accusing &quot;the Jews&quot; of collectively conspiring to spy on Americans and then claiming to prove it by posting an article about &quot;7 Jews&quot; who own the media and two privately held Israeli companies that helped the US government. &quot;The Jews&quot; having nothing to do with spying on Americans, if a handful of people who happen to be Jews are to blame, that number hardly represents the 13 millions Jews on this planet. You are a blatant anti-Semite and standing up to ignorant bigots who spew lies and propaganda does not make me a member of the JIDF. </p>

Furthermore, <a href="http://www.mosaisk.com/Torben-Lund/Bonnier-Hjorne-Klein-Jewish-Media-Scandinavia.php">all 6 Scandinavian news companies are owned by 6 Jewish families</a> The same news companies who avoided using &quot;muslim immigrants&quot; during the Stockholm riots.

<p>this is another blatantly ignorant generalization. Does your stupidity ever end? </p>

<p>If you would like to pick specific Jews who you believe to be evil and express your opinion of why they are evil, id be glad to talk about it.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. And when the republicans steal another election, what will they do with the data. Send us to concentration camps. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s no solution to this. Biden is no different. Or you really want House Speaker John Boehner  to be president? He&#39;s third in line. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no solution. Of the three Obama is the best choice. And the more we attack Obama, the more power we give to the Republicans and the CIA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are u drinking the Kool-Aid? What are you talking about, &quot;democrats&quot; want to help people? Republicans made war, Democrats made war. For Bush there is Obama; for Nixon, there is FDR; for Reagan, there is Clinton. How are the Democrats explicitly different?</p>

<p>This whole &quot;Obama is better than the others&quot; is pure and simple &quot;lesser of the two evils&quot; BS. Reality check, there&#39;s more than 2 choices. We have indy candidates, we have 3rd party candidates, and we have candidates who while member of the Party are still indy in their thinking (i.e., Ron Paul). </p>

<p>But Obama, he&#39;s just a shill for corporate and special interests. Corporate bailouts, NSA spying, CISPA, NDAA&#39;12, IRS scandal, Libya, Benghazi, what has he not done?</p>
