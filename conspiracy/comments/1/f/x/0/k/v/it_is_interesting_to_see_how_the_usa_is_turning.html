       Well the scary part is everyone is standing by this one.  This kind of thing happens every few years and there are supposed be mass firings, resignations, and new regulations so "it won't happen again"
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is under the Obama admin, everyone is just standing around saying "We're doing this for your protection.  It's all part of the plan.  Please wait by the stairs"

       It's not like Obama even started it, he took it a step back form Bush, who was actually listening to US citizens actual phone conversations without a warrant. I find it oh so deliciously ironic that all these republicans, including the author of the patriot act are only NOW shocked and appalled by what is happening.  There is a lot of disingenuous scumbaggery going on.

       He probably is listening, that particular ball hasn't dropped yet.  I can't see them not doing it, given what they are already doing.

       So much scandal dropping in such a short period of time, you have to ask what's next?  Also what will they do to try to clear the table?

       you're a dipshit and this is completely inaccurate.  I don't think you even understand the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Bush administration, Cheney asked congress to give him a bill that would allow they to get warrants in closed door procedures so they could monitor people without letting intelligence gathering networks be privy to what we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was something done by an executive agency under Obama which has harvested information with no kind of warrant whatsoever, based on phone numbers.  Someone applies for a job at the walmart where you're a manager?  Watchlist.  That person's mother calls him to see if he's coming over for Easter, watchlist, now we're spying on a whole sewing circle.
      </p>

       This is possibly the most egregious violation of the 4th amendment ever committed, and you're playing party politics.  Enjoy the kool aid

       Under Obama they need a warrant from a judge to listen to conversations. Bush felt he did not need that, dipshit. First time I ever heard someone defend Cheney lol and I'm the one being partisan, that's funny you're a funny guy.

       Yes, the US has always said one thing and done another. The history of the CIA and our military is one instance of brutal hegemony after another. It is astounding how many people believe we are a force for democracy and good in this world just because we say we are.
