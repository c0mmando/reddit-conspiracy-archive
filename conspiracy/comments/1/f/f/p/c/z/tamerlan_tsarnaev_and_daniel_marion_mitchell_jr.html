        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-05-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/xenoglossus.html">xenoglossus</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This all began from a thread posted earlier this week in regards to a novel found on the Barnes and Noble website titled &quot;Rape Train: Trolly Rullin Fools Into Suicide&quot; allegedly written by Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to Barnes and Noble and the publishing data contained inside the novel which is likely only available for online purchasing. I bought the book (which took some courage) after doing some research from other alternative websites about the book. I saw that some people were implying a connection between this book and a book titled &quot;The Lords of 2112&quot;, written by Daniel Marion Mitchell Jr, for reasons that I can&#39;t remember explicitly. (I saw the thread while skimming GLP, only noted the reference in passing then)</p>

<p>I can only describe the book at my first glance as a story of terrible paranoia and schizophrenia. The book is more like a collection of short stories, journal entries, and letters which loosely tell the tale of a few separate people whose lives seem to be intertwined. Some characters have obvious pseudonyms (Jimmy aka James Holmes, Lanzo aka Adam Lanza) although some characters are represented by their actual names. The over-arching thing that connects them is &quot;level 121&quot; - some sort of obscure, Satanistic mind control that forces them through hallucinogenic acts to commit terrible acts of violence or pain upon others. I won&#39;t get into it too much because I haven&#39;t been able to crack the DRM on it - I can only read the book on my e-reader or on the website. I would be thrilled to post the epub file upon request if anyone tech savvy can take a crack at it, or give directions on how to do so.</p>

<p>Now, within the book are a series of letters that are allegedly written by Daniel Marion Mitchell Jr, identifying him as an artist paid to &quot;trigger&quot; manchurian candidates in the field. This correspondence was gained due to hacked e-mails from some sort of weird love triangle, I don&#39;t really understand to be honest. It also implies that &quot;Lords of 2112&quot; was a &quot;trigger&quot; to Adam Lanza in the way that &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; was implied to be a &quot;trigger&quot; for that one guy that killed JFK.</p>

<p>One of the story arcs also revolves around a twisted, obsessed mind controlled stalker situation that results in a triple murder. I believe that this story is a confession for Tamerlan&#39;s part in the 2011 Waltham, MA murders in which </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken were murdered in Mess&#39;s apartment. All had their throats slit from ear to ear, with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. Thousands of dollars of marijuana and money were left covering their mutilated bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ibragim Todashev has recently been implicated in these murders as well, and I am not sure of the connection - HOWEVER, all of Ibragim&#39;s social media has been REMOVED and some of it mentioned <em>this very book</em>! Performing a google search of the BN number of the book will result in multiple google caches that can demonstrate this. </p>

<p>As for what or who Trolly Rulle is, I am asking for help with that. Some people think that it may be Ryan Lanza, Adam Lanza&#39;s older brother, who allegedly participated in the ritualistic rape of his brother  and another boy according to the information in this book. Some people also think that Daniel Marion Mitchell Jr was a pen name for Ryan Lanza, and that he somehow has a larger role in these events. Let&#39;s get to the bottom of this, guys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The author of the book, The Lords of 2112: The Poignantly Vulgar &amp; Vulgarly Poignant Chronicle of Americaâ€™s Future, committed suicide on December 12, 2012. 
R.I.P. January 21, 1976 to December 12, 2012 Update: Daniel Marion Mitchell Jr. was a troubled soul and tragically committed suicide. Thanks for all the support and love for our Gentle Giant. His words: My range of experiences include everything from prison to the dean&#39;s list in college. I have met all and lived with people from all walks of life. From a spiritual journey living as a homeless man to firsthand religious investigations, I have seen nearly everything. I have lived with murderers and self-proclaimed saints. My stories are more real than fiction, regardless of the format in which I tell the story. I have grown up in the small town environment of rural Michigan and traveled the world, physically and metaphorically. My life is dedicated to the constant pursuit of evolution and growth. Life is my adventure and, for better and worse, I am living the dreams constructed within my own imaginations.</p>

<p>Is there any record of Daniel Marion Mitchell Jr dying?</p>

<p>This all smells of a ploy of someone trying to profit off these events.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not, it is something straight out of a Richard Donner film.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was unable to find anything hard aside from communities reaching out, and mourning. Project Avalon is a highly regarded community of theorists, so I wouldn&#39;t expect them to assist or encourage in Mitchell profiting from the event. Especially considering the novel is only .99$ USD on barnes and noble. He wouldn&#39;t be making very much..</p>

<p>I think Mitchell most likely faked his death to avoid the backlash from this crap book.  This is a distraction.  Best to not get caught up in it.  I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t look into it, just don&#39;t let this book get your emotions in a whirl.  </p>

<p>Saying this author faked his death to avoid backlash from &quot;this crap book&quot;, however, is fucking retarded. No one who is that concerned about their reputation to take it to that level would use a pseudonym to begin with.</p>

<p>All the links to the photos, videos and screenshots seem to be dead though :/</p>

<p>OMG... you people are gonna think I&#39;m a nut but please look at this!</p>

<p>I searched for a reference of &quot;Trolley Rulles&quot; and I found a few post from 20 days ago about some guy that posted videos of a murder under that name. (only found via cache)</p>

<p>[dead link] </p>

<p>OK so this is where gets strange...
I follow the link to &quot; Black Dog Rising &quot; His comments were wiped of the forum but his profile remains!</p>

<p>[dead link] </p>

<p>There is a profile photo of Ryan Lanza?!?!?!</p>

<p>If this is some kind of hoax they would have had to start the hoax before the shooting ever took place. I&#39;m confused... and wondering how this all ties together?</p>

<p>No way of knowing if the author, Daniel Marion mitchell jr is still alive.  I&#39;ve spent about 4 legitimate hours trying to find a source for that claim. </p>

<p>If the author IS dead then I have a much harder time believing all this to be some publicity stunt. </p>

<p>Edit: Luka Magnotta uploaded his snuff film under a handle &quot;trolleyrulle&quot;. You can also get a few hits on google where he has reviewed the book lords of 2112. A user named &quot;Adam lanza&quot; also reviewed this book on amazon.com</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I see this too. It is much more likely to just be a regular government style cover-up than a huge spiritual conspiracy about mind rape and NLP. The bravado definitely says something about the credibility.</p>
