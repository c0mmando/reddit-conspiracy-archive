<p>I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that the US government and its crony corporations are waging awar on our food and water supply. They&#39;re poisoning us with flouride, bisphenol, and pesticides. And they&#39;re trying to corner the world&#39;s food supply by using patent law to force farmers into using non-heirloom GMO seeds while killing off honey bees. There&#39;s more to it than that, but those are some of the largest influences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we&#39;re dead weight, sucking up resources they want for themselves, complaining about shit they don&#39;t want to fix. </p>

<p>They used to need a bunch of people for cheap labor, but with the rate of progress in  robotics and algorithmics over the last couple of decades, and the swiftly increasing number of skilled positions being replaced by them, the powers that be are tired of entertaining us peasant folk. We <em>were</em> a nice crop for a while, but now we&#39;re just sucking up all their air and they want us gone. But they&#39;re not going to kill us off quickly because we still have a few pennies saved up and they want every damn cent of it! So they&#39;ll give us some chronic diseases that take years or decades to kill us, and that rack up enormous hospital bills in the meantime that bilk not just us, but our entire family as well. And that&#39;s how you do that...when you&#39;re a greedy fuck who cares for no one but yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who&#39;s lived in Oklahoma City for 2/3 of my life, I&#39;d say that they&#39;re well aware of what the weather can do. It&#39;s nothing new, it just usually doesn&#39;t hit Oklahoma City or Tulsa. It&#39;s There are dozens of tornadoes every year in Oklahoma and severe thunderstorms that blow down everyone&#39;s tree limbs and I really doubt that anything that has happened this year is weather control. A tornado like the one that went through Moore, took almost the exact same path as the one in May 1999. That said, almost everyone is in no way really prepared for the big ones. Almost no one has a storm shelter, and an F4-F5 doesn&#39;t just shatter windows or rip off roofs, they level houses. Also, if you&#39;re trying to actually kill people, tornados are a bad way to do that. The death between last night and the one a couple of weeks ago is going to still be cumulatively well under 100.</p>

<p>You think that kind of covert experimentation ever stopped?</p>

<p>You think technology hasn&#39;t made possible to go bigger, to experiment with weather on a regional scale? </p>
