       As I was watching Rachel while getting ready for work. I began to be reminded of the section of the geneva convention where they banned weather mod weapons. I wonder if they are trying to dwindle the population that way, violent weather instead of fema camps and bullet holes

       I've seen the HAARP longwave maps of the US the last few weeks, they started firing right over the same region after the last major tornado about a  week ago.  What a coincidence that another insane cell has formed there.

       I think it's pretty obvious that the US government and its crony corporations are waging awar on our food and water supply. They're poisoning us with flouride, bisphenol, and pesticides. And they're trying to corner the world's food supply by using patent law to force farmers into using non-heirloom GMO seeds while killing off honey bees. There's more to it than that, but those are some of the largest influences.

       Because we're dead weight, sucking up resources they want for themselves, complaining about shit they don't want to fix.

      <p>
       They used to need a bunch of people for cheap labor, but with the rate of progress in  robotics and algorithmics over the last couple of decades, and the swiftly increasing number of skilled positions being replaced by them, the powers that be are tired of entertaining us peasant folk. We
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       a nice crop for a while, but now we're just sucking up all their air and they want us gone. But they're not going to kill us off quickly because we still have a few pennies saved up and they want every damn cent of it! So they'll give us some chronic diseases that take years or decades to kill us, and that rack up enormous hospital bills in the meantime that bilk not just us, but our entire family as well. And that's how you do that...when you're a greedy fuck who cares for no one but yourself.

       As someone who's lived in Oklahoma City for 2/3 of my life, I'd say that they're well aware of what the weather can do. It's nothing new, it just usually doesn't hit Oklahoma City or Tulsa. It's There are dozens of tornadoes every year in Oklahoma and severe thunderstorms that blow down everyone's tree limbs and I really doubt that anything that has happened this year is weather control. A tornado like the one that went through Moore, took almost the exact same path as the one in May 1999. That said, almost everyone is in no way really prepared for the big ones. Almost no one has a storm shelter, and an F4-F5 doesn't just shatter windows or rip off roofs, they level houses. Also, if you're trying to actually kill people, tornados are a bad way to do that. The death between last night and the one a couple of weeks ago is going to still be cumulatively well under 100.

       Quick! Better stock up on "survival seeds" for your "Crisis Garden" and drink your colloidal silver and invest in gold because big brother is trying to kill you.

       Yeah totally man, the only surefire defense is to build a rocket and start a colony on Mars where none of that stuff exists.

       Remember those unearthed/unclassified documents about experiments on unwilling, unknowing civilian population regarding radioactive substances, pharmaceuticals, LSD, inflicted diseases, etc., from back in the 50s, 60s, 70s?
      </p>
      <p>
       You think that kind of covert experimentation ever stopped?
      </p>
      <p>
       You think technology hasn't made possible to go bigger, to experiment with weather on a regional scale?
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect to read about covert weather experimentation in a few decades. To learn about how to make omelette a few eggs had to be broken.

       Einstein may not have been able to guess what weapons world war 3 would be fought with, but we know now. It's biological and psychological warfare. And it's been going on for a long time now. People keep hoping things will turn around, or waiting for a spark that lights the powder keg, but we will never see either. The war is being waged covertly, and if we don't pick up arms and fight back now, we'll lose it before most of us even realize it has begun.

       It's always always ALWAYS multifaceted.

       Population control? Sure, on a small scale. Weather modification methods involve poison? Check. Result of extreme weather requires larger government? Check. Weather distracts large portions of the population from other important news? Check. Adds more debt? Check.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more of population control in terms of controlling them, not necessarily the number of people. More people means more debt. At least in the short-term.

       Violent weather has been around since first man experienced such. Don't blame it on weather mod machines that's an inefficient way of reducing population. Compared to more efficient ways such as releasing such killers like created disease like SARS. However yes we are under siege everyday of other forces such as big banks, Bilderberg,  big government, big Pharma etc... in eradicating men.
