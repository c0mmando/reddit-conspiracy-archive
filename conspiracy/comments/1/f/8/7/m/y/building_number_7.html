        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>During 9/11 there was a third building that collapsed. Building number 7. No planes hit it, it was said that office fired caused the collapse of building number 7(WTC 7). If you look at the video:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWorDrTC0Qg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWorDrTC0Qg</a></p>

<p>It looks like a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>So this had me think... There were four hijacked planes in 9/11...</p>

<p>1: World Trade center 1</p>

<p>2: World Trade Center 2</p>

<p>3: the Pentagon</p>

<p>4: Passengers overcame the hijackers and the plane crashed. Took off in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>If you look at a US map,  the 4th plane crashed in Shanksville, Somerset, Pennsylvania. Why would they be going to Chicago if NY is so close? I doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Then WTC 7 collapsed by an &quot;office fire&quot;. </p>

<p>Where was plane number 4 going? Was it going to hit WTC 7?
It takes months to rig a building with explosives. Months, and the cause of the collapse was from office fires...
Office fires don&#39;t reach the point to melt steel which if they did then it would be very unstable building and not to many would be made of steel then. </p>

<p>So melted steel is out...</p>

<p>No planes hit it...</p>

<p>Must have been a controlled demolition</p>

<p>How did it really collapse?</p>

<p>So if this is true.. and the 4th plane that was crashed in Pennsylvania must have been going for WTC 7. </p>

<p>oh and dont forget about the current scandals: </p>

<p>Benghazi</p>

<p>The associated press phone hacking</p>

<p>IRS</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Added the:</p>

<p>&quot;Must have been controlled demolition&quot;</p>

<p>and the current scandals.</p>

<p>and the so if this is true&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>and &quot;if you look at a US map..&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not disputing your conclusion but am curious as to the answer of my questions since they are major factors that were not mentioned in your analysis.</p>

<p>Did you consider the duration of the fire prior to WTC7&#39;s collapse?</p>

<p>Did you consider that WTC7 received significant damage from the collapse of both WTC1 and WTC2?</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>Q:&quot;Did you consider the duration of the fire prior to the WTC7&#39;s collapse?&quot;</p>

<p>A: The fires that would have occurred from the office wouldn&#39;t do much because it takes 2500 F degrees to melt steel ( jet fuel burns at 980 F degrees). So think of it like a plateu, it would go up then stay at a temp then come back down. Not getting anywhere near the 2500 F degrees.</p>

<p>2) &quot;Did you consider that WTC7 received significant damage from the collapse of both WTC1 and WTC2?&quot;</p>

<p>False. WTC 5,6 were within the first block (right next to) of the WTC 1 and 2. They still were standing AFTER the collapse of WTC 1 and 2. But we&#39;re taken down LATER because of significant damage. Still standing though. WTC 7 was in the second block shielded from collapse because if other buildings in the way.  </p>

<p>If you look at the video that is shown in the post, you will see that it imploded( collapsed within its self) thus needed to be triggered by something inside. But it takes about 2500 F degrees to melt steel and I dought that they would keep anything like that in an office. 
So fire is ruled out, no plane hit it, didn&#39;t receive significant damage from the collapse of WTC 1 and 2. 
That means...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. Significant damage was done to other columns/supports. The load that they bare does not just vanish into thin air, however. It was unevenly distributed to the rest of the building. This put additional strain on the remaining columns/supports. Strain that they were not intended to support under normal circumstances- never mind the damage that they received from debris and long unattended fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People need to look into this building more. It&#39;s ignored so much because no one was killed in it - It was empty. Coincidence? Jesus Christ, BBC correspondent Jane Standley reported the collapse of WTC 7 20 minutes before it happened. She&#39;s standing with the building behind her reporting that it fell due to structural damage. It&#39;s scary how many people believe anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the very few conspiracy theories which I am willing to consider as possibly true. I&#39;m an ex-journalist and I take pleasure in debunking conspiracy theories like chemtrails which can be disproved with science. In the case of WTC7 the science points to a controlled demolition. Enough demolition experts have looked at the footage and said &quot;that&#39;s a controlled demolition `to convince me that it was a controlled demolition. Maybe you are correct and the building was supposed to be hit by a third aircraft flying into the World Trade Center. This is the first time I have seen somebody connect the downed flight 93 with the collapse of WTC7. It&#39;s an interesting thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly doubt that the 4th plane was intended for WTC7.  For the simple fact that before 9/11, WTC7 was an unknown building.  Why would terrorists have picked WTC7 to attack, when the Empire State Building was just down the street?   Why attack WTC7 when they could have flown the plane into the Statue of Liberty?   </p>

<p>It would make no logical sense for terrorists to attack WTC7.  </p>

<p>What I believe happened, is that they just straight up fucked up with WTC7.  That building was intended to go down without any fanfare during the demolitions of either tower.   Someone fucked up, and they had to wait.  And they waited til late afternoon when they were hoping much of America had turned away from their television sets.   </p>

<p>And luckily, most of the media never mentioned it.   The media did so well at not mentioning WTC7, that most people out there still aren&#39;t aware that there was a 3rd building that went down that day.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think <em>everyone</em> here is an idiot and <em>everything</em> posted here is wrong.   </p>

<p>But basically you&#39;re saying that if there were thousands and thousands of people talking about major world events and often totally misinterpreting them, inventing false scenarios, and engaging in paranoid rhetoric, you wouldn&#39;t see any merit in correcting their mistaken facts, and asking them why they&#39;re only critical of certain points of view but accept others without engaging that same level of critique?  </p>

<p>The same way you like to point out what you see as falsity or lies or conspiracies in the world, I like to point out what I see as falsity or lies or logical inconsistencies in your theories.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m also genuinely interested in conspiracy theories, and I think it&#39;s a shame that a rational discussion of the interesting, plausible ones is corrupted by the irrational discussion of the wildly implausible ones.  </p>

<p>Calling them &quot;2 small office fires&quot; is simply a blatant lie.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afb7eUHr64U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afb7eUHr64U</a></p>

<p>The fact that certain structures were damaged in certain ways by certain debris, and others were damaged in certain other ways by certain other debris is, I agree, a statement of fact.  </p>

<p>It may have been the first (and I&#39;m not even sure that&#39;s true) but it certainly wasn&#39;t the last.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XMTALBYRNA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XMTALBYRNA</a></p>

<p>That was at Delft University of Technology in Holland in 2008.  Not surprised you&#39;d never heard of it, since it doesn&#39;t fit your neat little tale. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Flatly irrelevant, as we&#39;ve already discussed in previous posts in this thread.  Not sure why you keep saying it as though it had any shred of relevance.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plane number 4. The one that crashed in Pennsylvania was going to WTC 7.</p>

<p>It was certainly taking a very odd route to get there.  It had been flying directly toward Washington D.C.  What makes you think it was going to alter course and head to NY?  </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s actually a vast underestimation for a building the size of WTC 7.  What is your point with this statement?  Since you have no evidence of anybody planning a demolition, or wiring the building with the hundreds and hundreds of pounds of explosives and miles or wire necessary for a demolition of this size, it would seem to be a point against you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go look at WTC 5 an 6. They were within the first block of the collapse of WTC 1 and 2. They were still standing afterwards. That&#39;s the first block. WTC 7 was in the second block, being shielded from metals and other flying derbies. A fire may have started in it but steel melts at about 2500 F degrees, jet fuel burns at 980 F degrees. And an office fire... Much less. So please look at the evidence, look at the video. If these buildings were to collapse from a office fire I would be scared sh!tless to go in anything made out of steel. I wonder why buildings are made out of it then?</p>

<p>In what universe does it take more than 3 months to analyze a piece of metal?  </p>

<p>Anyway, you asked about how steel works.  I feel like you could find the answer to that extremely easily by googling it.  I went a step further and linked you to a scientific analysis of the actual steel from WTC 7.  If you want your question answered in greater detail regarding steel in general, just google &quot;steel structural integrity temperature&quot; or whatever.  </p>

<p>I agree that I wish they&#39;d gone into greater detail in the link I provided, but it was what I found after about 20 seconds of googling.  </p>

<p>How hot do fires normally burn?  Is it out of the ordinary for a raging office fire to get that hot?  </p>

<p>As far as what was feeding the fire, I mean, much of the contents of the building was flammable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I didn&#39;t ask you how steel works, I asked you if it didn&#39;t take melting to lose its structural integrity then how does it lose it&#39;s structural integrity. I don&#39;t consider that to be the same as &quot;how steel works&quot;. </p>

<p>As far as how hot does a fire normally burn, isn&#39;t that based on what is feeding the fire? Different things have different temperatures in which they ignite and how much fuel that particular thing gives to the fire in question. Considering that WTC 7 was built within the standards and codes of building safety it had to have a significant amount of fireproofing, fire doors, etc. So what burned in there, paper? Paper is not a good fuel because it burns at a low temperature and not for very long. You can&#39;t even built a good fire in your fireplace with just paper, you need other stuff to catch and get your fire &quot;roaring&quot;. I would argue that not much of the contents of the building was flammable. Steel and glass are not flammable, the wallboards would have had to be fire resistant up to a certain point, there would have been fire walls and fire doors and not to mention there were sprinkler systems installed. Also you can see from the videos of WTC 7 that there was no obvious conflagration. It almost didn&#39;t look like it was on fire at all.  Not to mention it fell at almost free fall speed, and according to the NIST report the origin of the collapse was the north east corner of level 13, so all the structural integrity from the underground parts plus floors 1-12 would have at the very least slowed the fall, but instead it turned to dust. Also, why would 1,600 Architects and Engineers disagree with the way this went down? What do they have to gain by it?</p>

<p>For the most part they&#39;re not gaining anything - they&#39;re simply wrong.  Some of them have written books and been on tv though.  </p>

<p>More importantly, 1600 is an extremely tiny percentage of the total number of architects and engineers in the world.  Fractions of a percent.  If I had 16 million architects and engineers disagreeing with your 16 hundred, would you be swayed?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming that video is indeed of WTC 7, those are not &quot;massive extremely visible fires&quot;. From the view that CNN was showing that day right before that building went down you couldn&#39;t even see that view of the building nor very much smoke coming out but you could certainly see the smoke from the burning rubble of the Twin Towers.  That is a 42 story building. Those fires, in relation to the size of that building are not big at all. Many firemen that went into that building have reported that the only fires they saw inside that building were fairly small and had been put out by the time it collapsed. 
 And while 1600 might be small comparatively speaking to the WORLD population it doesn&#39;t change the fact that is still a lot of architects and engineers that put their credibility on the line to go against the official &quot;report&quot; of what happened, and I haven&#39;t heard of any group of engineers and architects that have grouped up to defend that report, so you don&#39;t have 16 million architects and engineers that have come out with any information to sway me. Maybe they disagree, maybe they don&#39;t give a damn, maybe they are too cowardly to put their careers on the line but until they band together and take a stand one way or the other they are a moot point. But it&#39;s cool, you may certainly believe what you want. WTC 1 and 2 were made, designed specifically to withstand the impact of a 747, and building 7 was built so that if it were to catch fire it would be able to contain the damage from spreading through the building. If one were to collapse due to an airplane hitting it that could be called a fluke or blamed on faulty construction even, but the idea that 2 buildings fell from the same exact cause that they were designed to withstand, within minutes of each other and a 3rd building in the same area collapsed (in exactly the same manner; free fall and all that jazz) due to something that it was designed specifically to withstand is pretty ludicrous. Surely that would have to be the longest of longshots that 3 happened due to bad luck. Those buildings have code inspections and such, surely at least some of those problems  in design construction and maintenance would have been noticed by someone at some point. </p>
