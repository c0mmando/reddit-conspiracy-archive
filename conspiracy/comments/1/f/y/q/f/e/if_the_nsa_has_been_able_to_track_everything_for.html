       Don't kid yourself for a second thinking the first two don't exist.

       The answer is because our covert shadow government has never cared about people. It is solely interested in power.

       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: I'm not talking about minor arrests. How about in
       <a href="http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/08/hundreds-arrested-as-china-police-smash-child-trafficking-ring/">
        China where they have arrested 50,000 suspects and rescued 18,000 children?
       </a>
       . There has not been one instance since the patriot act where more than a handful of peons were arrested, and never has anyone important been implicated. When someone famous and involved with child trafficking gets outed, aka Jerry Sandusky, they cover up the ring and call him a lone pedophile.

       Why the silence on the

        Is it a little funny that Occupy Wallstreet protesters are labeled as terrorists

       but drug cartel which actually kill hundreds of thousands of people aren't? Not that I think either should be, terrorism is an illegitimate concept to start with...
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 3: And I am not implying that the NSA would be looking for evidence before finding suspects. But it should be clear to everyone that once suspects are found, the NSA can find out anything and everything about them.

       You know it. The spying that was done was not done to the real criminals in this country, but rather to entrap those with the potential to damage those responsible for the spying. How do you think they keep tabs on people like Adam Kokesh and Aaron Schwartz?

       If Tony Soprano and his cronies were in charge, would they do anything differently?  I doubt it.  When whistle blowers are enemies of the state, the state is obviously corrupt to the core.

       Becaust the government gives two shits about morality.  Dual moralities are a false construct created to continue polarizing the population.  Morality is meaningless... we are all the same animals and depending on what we are exposed to (very minor biological outliers aside) we will develop into that state.  You can already see the apologists coming out.  Our kids have been indoctrinated to believe that anything written down on a piece of paper and called "policy" or "law" are legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're fucked and we can ignore this now, but history has shown over and over again what everything the US has been doing since WW2 leads to.  It's a frightening thing to admit to oneself, but there are many who will never overcome that fear and admit what is happening.

       Actually, I think a more realistic (and more terrifying) answer is this: it's hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine what the US government can do with PRISM. It is possible for them to do the things you mentioned, and even more great things that could keep people safe. It is also possible for them to ruin the lives of any individual whom they decide they have fallen out of favour with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big difference here is that even with all of this data actually busting up a drug trafficking ring is fucking hard. Drug traffickers assume this type of data is being tracked, and act accordingly. The same goes for child porn rings, human trafficking, etc. So they haven't had huge busts resulting from this program because even though it is kind emotionally satisfying (from a security prospective) it doesn't actually make it easier to catch child porn producers, drug dealers or anyone like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tearing down some political opponent? Easy. Breaking up a drug cartel? Fucking hard!
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that is the worst part of this recent news. The only things this makes it easier for a government to do is the kind of shit that nobody actually wants there government to do.

       Doesn't everybody who would be worth tracking already assume they're being tracked and take the same precautions that a drug cartel would?  If all of the bad guys are capable of hiding their actions through decent security protocols (and of course they do), then who exactly is the government spying on?

       It's hard to break up drug cartels?  No it isn't.  Its actually really easy and cost effective! Problem is nobody's willing to see the obvious.

       Ok. It's been over a week and lots of other news on this story has broken, but I meant to answer this question initially so now that I have time, I will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the best way to do this is that I outline why I think it is hard, then you outline why you think it's easy and we'll see where we disagree. I think we both already accept that taking down some political opponent, activist whom you dislike or similar private citizen using PRISM is extremely easy so there is no need to argue that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the arguments I will use apply, to a certain extent, to every criminal organization one might hope to catch with PRISM.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Reasons Why Taking Down a Drug Cartel with PRISM is still hard
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They know you're looking for them
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The fact that law enforcement officials are pursuing drug traffickers vigorously and with every available technology is in no way a secret. Even if part of your cartel's plan for staying out of jail is to buddy up with the CIA, bribe politicians and generally make it so that nobody with power wants you arrested you are still going to be careful. You're still going to avoid phones, email, anything that can be tracked whenever possible. When you do use email or phones it's always encrypted and it's only ever coded messages. Make the messages hard to decrypt and even once decrypted, hard to understand.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They have large operations in countries/areas with little or no law enforcement
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Mexico is the classic example. The Mexican Government does not have the financial or military resources to stop the cartels.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pbxcZKE.jpg">
        Here is a recent map of their distribution
       </a>
       in Mexico. Note the huge areas they control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mexico is basically fighting 6 opposing armies. You can maybe beat a cartel, but you can't beat them all.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They're huge
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Drug cartels usually have people in many different countries working for them. A Mexican drug cartel would have many different "chapters" or "divisions" in different cities each operating somewhat independently. Maybe you can take down 20 members of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ju%C3%A1rez_Cartel">
        Juárez Cartel
       </a>
       in LA, but the organization is still fine. They can bring in new guys and regain their territory. Even if they don't bring in new guys, new guys will come but that leads us to the next point.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Their source of revenue shows no signs of going away.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Estimates for the cartel's income are obviously not easy nor 100% but a 2010 BBC
       <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8588509.stm">
        story
       </a>
       but the figure at roughly $40 billion per year (roughly as much as Singapore's government). The Mexican Government brings in roughly
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_budgets_by_country">
        $263 billion in revenue
       </a>
       , has about $292 billion in expenses and is left with a $29 billion deficit.  Consider that the expenses of the cartel are vastly different that that of the Mexican government too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The revenues of governments rise and fall much more than those of a cartel. It's also important to remember that poverty increases drug use. So as the government loses money, the cartels get stronger.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So there you have it. A brief of outline of why, for my money, breaking up drug cartels is not only extremely hard but is not made easier with PRISM. Even with the best people and the best intentions PRISM would not result in a major blow to drug traffickers or to any large organized criminal operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why even implement PRISM? Well some might be tempted to think it's actual part of some secret plan to spy on civilians, but I am not of that mind. It fits perfectly with the US governments general crime fighting strategy:
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office">
        total informational awareness
       </a>
       .  They think that if they can just get enough information then they will know everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the cries from senators and congressmen after 9/11? What did we know? When did we know it? Who knew it? There were long committees and investigations to find out exactly who knew what and when. A major recommendation of the 9/11 commission was that intelligence sharing be more common. We need to know more and we need to share more. America is still fighting every war like it's the cold war. There's a really good chance that even if they had bin laden's email password it would have told them nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The logic is kind of like this; "If the enemy had access to our secret documents, emails and letters we would be royally fucked. They would really have us by the balls. Therefore, we need access to theirs. Every file or document they ever thought they could hide, let's find it. Then we'll have them right where we want them. Then we can finally crush them."
      </p>
      <p>
       In real life though, it just doesn't work. That kind of system would definitely help you take down a private person, or maybe even a rival government but it will never help you take down an organized criminal outfit who knows you're after them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL/DR: The US government is fighting organized criminal groups with Cold War tactics. The end result is that you can't catch the bad guys but when somebody wants to abuse the power they can crush the little guy.
       </strong>

       They cannot target citizens and legal residents of the United States, so congressmen would be right out. They also are restricted in purpose. They can target a person who is "a foreign power, an agent of a foreign power, or an officer or employee of a foreign power." And they can also gather "foreign intelligence information" which is defined as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (1) information that relates to, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to, the ability of the United States to protect against—
       </p>
       <p>
        (A) actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;
       </p>
       <p>
        (B) sabotage, international terrorism, or the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; or
       </p>
       <p>
        (C) clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by an agent of a foreign power; or

      <p>
       Pedophiles, human trafficking, and drug smuggling are not covered by that. For those kinds of crimes, the FBI and police have to get a warrant for a wiretap, but can use an administrative subpoena or national security letter for many business records, such as phone records.

       But officially to use the info in court to secure a conviction they would need legal coverage they dont have under current mandate. They can spy on us all they want but if they want to do something with it publicly and legally they need a new mandate. Now terrorists are another thing entirely, they get disappeared to gitmo or bagram; they've already established precedent on that.

       Right. What I was referring to was the "official line". I've always understood that they can pretty much do whatever they want legality be damned. If they are ever called on it there will be a conveniently and quickly passed law that covers not only what they did but who did it all the way back to whenever they feel like.

       The phone records from Verizon were for everybody (but that is unrelated to PRISM). According to the sources in the newspapers, the NSA makes copies of all that data, but

      <p>
       As for PRISM, I didn't see anything in the documents or in the quotes from anybody familiar with PRISM that says that PRISM was used for surveillance on United States citizens or for any purpose other than the ones authorized. Can you point out where a knowledgeable person said otherwise?

       They can't target people but they definitely collect massive amounts of information on everyone in the country, phone and internet habits. What do they do with it all? Surely that have massive amounts of dirt on a large number of important people.

       if this business is so massive, and so powerful people run it, why don't they just make it legal? Truly massive businesesses don't have to be afraid of anything - like weapon manufacturers.

       Yes, if these businessess would be comparable to the truly massive industries, like weapon system, IT, oil, biotech - it would be legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to wiki, revenue from the legal porn business in the US is about $1.8 bln yearly. Let us assume that pedophiles are 1% of population, but spend ten times more on their fetish than average (because of illegality). Then you have $180 mln yearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its nothing. In the 2011 defense industry in the US make revenue of  670 billions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how you can call CP and child trafficking massive business? It a flea on the market.

       I misinterpeted what you were trying to say. No it isn't a big business but you can't deny that important and powerful people are involved. The best example I can think of that shows this is from May the 9th 2000. There was an article called "House Bill Targets those involved in International Sex Trade" on Asociated Press. In it there was a paragraph that said:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Smith said he and Rep. Sam Gedjenson, D-Conn., a co-sponsor, recently talked to several women who had been held as "virtual slaves" in the Washington area by foreign diplomats and employees of the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund"
      </p>
      <p>
       Within an hour and a half it was changed to just say "in the Washington area". Although this does not pertain to CP and child traffiking I'm sure equally important and even some of the same people are involved and more diligent with keeping it secret.

       in the UK way back in 2000 or a little bit earlier, there was an early morning news story of some pedophile sting, police raided some CP website got loads of names of customers. This was the only news report, no further news stories of progress or arrests.
      </p>
      <p>
       BBC Radio 4 news article mentioned types of people arrested, judges, policemen, etc etc, NO follow-up trials or convictions, so these influential people got sucked into some MI5/SB network, play the game (be tame govt assets) and we will not ruin your lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Govts love CP and similar anti-social activities, it enables govts to hold the sword of Damocles over somebodies head, they are 100% govt players after that. Need a tame judge and police to cover up a suicided VIP expert witness (Dr. Kelly springs to mind), no problem.

       There's really not much you can do other than try to get the overly entertained masses to realize where the problem lies. other than that our only option is to physically exterminate the Corporate, Banking elite. and we will be met with resistant from our own people if we do that because as I said before, they don't even know where the problem lies or that there is even a problem in Government or that a shadow Government even exists.

       Absolutely right.    What goes through the minds of the data analysts when they come across pedophiles and other creeps - I can't even imagine.  They must be cut from a completely different cloth than me.  To be able to let something like that go on and to just treat it as part of the data stream requires a special kind of mindset.  Are they sociopaths?  Sure, at the top rung they are, but what about the nsa worker drones?  How can they live with themselves?  Who are these people that can let this stuff go?  I just don't get it.

       drugs are a (govt) monopoly, their drug barons seem to thrive in this govt surveillance nirvana (notice only minor drug people get arrested), ditto with the Afghan opium growers/traders and the massive NATO presence in that occupied country...

       Or they weren't given the chance. Choices breed decent results when they are below a certain number (say, 100 candidates for the same position), but we haven;t really been given
       <em>

       much choice. Outside of wedge issues both American parties and most American candidates have the exact same policies. But you already know this.

       Those whom sit at the very apex of both child trafficking and drug trade are likely the same or at least highly connected to those who manage the NSA. By manage, I don't mean governmental head or the high ranking public faces it may wear; The NSA is answerable to 'some power'. I would suggest that power is mostly a financial power or group of wealthy/elite individuals.

       From Air America in Vietnam and Laos to modern day poppy protection in Afghanistan, they fun much of their black and untraceable funding from this source, and as a byproduct or by design, the war on drugs has made those in the prison and law enforcement industries very rich, and government officials use the drug war as another lever against liberty. Furnishing the cartels with weapons is a political tool for establishing a measure of control on both the cartels, that portion of the mexican/south-central american politics, and they get to blame the US 2nd amendment.

       Billions of dollars are spent exclusively to support the behemoth that became the American Surveillance State enacted by the Patriot Act. Unfortunately all these agencies within this mega-bureaucratic intelligence-security-surveillance structure, apparently, spend more energy in a constant conflict among each other for goverment resources and public attention, than actually performing their duties:

       There are no instances since the Patriot Act was enacted that more than a handful of peons were arrested for child trafficking, never a large ring busted and never anyone important. Compared to other countries where there are arrests in the tens of thousands.

       It is unfortunate that by simply considering an argument to come from 'nutjobs' you have given yourself an excuse to not investigate further. The evidence is overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say you want proof of the most secretive and hidden conspiracy of all time. Documents don't exist, they would never have been created in the first place. But there are whistleblowers, victim testimonies, investigations with very thorough documentation that are shut down before they reach the highest levels, complex underground tunnel systems under daycares. At what point does that become proof for you?

       Ok so you aren't understanding at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider this completely hypothetically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazis learned through their awful medical experiments that PTSD can be exploited to create multiple personalities, aka Dissociative Identity Disorder. They are able to manipulate alternate personalities with the primary personality completely unaware. They then set up a system whereby they systematically sexually abuse children, because it is most effective in children, and sexual abuse is the most traumatic, to create superspys and manchurian candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think they would create permanent documents on such a program? Of course they wouldn't. It would all be coordinated in person. At MOST a list of names of victims so they can track them.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way this is exactly what happened, and the Nazi's were absorbed by American intelligence under

       Because they've not been tracking everything. That would not only be illegal, but also rather technically impractical (think about it).
      </p>
      <p>
       This constant insinuation that the NSA acts outside of the law is ridiculous. I know it's to be expected around here, but do you honestly think thousands of people knowingly break the law every day because, well, you know, movies and shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       The stories about PRISM appear to be based on
       <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/">
        these leaked slides
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that they do not say everybody's data is collected by PRISM. They don't say that, because it isn't, and you know it isn't because otherwise the child trafficking and pedophiles and drug traffickers would be easy to pick out, you're right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine you are trying to track the communications of a terrorist. You know he is using several tools operated by big tech firms: Skype calls, Google Mail and Facebook are all in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       You go to a judge (or secretary of state) and you ask for a warrant. It's granted, and you go to the tech firms and ask for the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tech firms give you a bunch of files that make no sense. They're all in different formats, and it takes an age to get sense out of it all. What's more, these activities are happening constantly, so you're having to go back each time and work out what the hell is going on, meanwhile your target is off to the airport with his bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       What PRISM appears to do - based on those slides - is provide a standardised place to put that data, and to do it in real-time if necessary, and to be able to make it easier for analysts to see a snapshot of a target's communications.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you still need the warrant, and you still need to pick out the individual who you're interested in, but now when you go to the tech firms they give you data in a format your software understands and you can see what's going on very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence it's a bit like a CRM a business might have, except the data sources are those external tech firms collect after you've got a warrant and asked them to intercept one of their customers for you as part of an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not mass monitoring. It isn't identifying individuals behaviourally out of a larger dataset.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just taking the legal wire-tapping processes already in place and making it easier to work with in terms of the rich multimedia and data-rich applications we're using these days. It's a modern day equivalent of getting a copy of somebody's phone line, but where the "phone company" can be any one of dozens of email providers, VoIP providers, search engines, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in that context, you still need to identify the target. PRISM isn't identifying targets, it's not seeing everything, it's just helping you make sense of the communications of the people you've decided you want to watch. In order to catch child traffickers and pedophiles and drug traffickers, you need to identify them first, get the warrants and then get the data into PRISM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except in the case of US citizens, the NSA would probably be breaking the law if they did that, and it's the FBI who are going to need to go and get those warrants and processes in place, natch.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you genuinely believe that laws that are meant to curtail the activities of Government agencies are ignored, you don't need to complain and whine about it and call everybody else "sheeple". You need to prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Washington Post and Guardian bravely tried to go down that route, but it seems they've completely misinterpreted a few slides and made the interpretation that PRISM is a mass monitoring tool rather than a data analysis tool for dealing with targeted interceptions. They got it wrong. At least they gave it a go though.

       used their Patriot Act search data; to arrest more people for drug dealing than for terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the capability to process and use databases the size of the data involved did not exist prior to about 2009.  Processing hundreds of billions of pages of text, in multiple databases, with software cross-checking and comparing entries, correlating relationships with unrelated entries, and compiling profiles of individual citizens suspected of being involved in illegal activities requires expertise in "Big Data".  Big Data systems have only become common in the last year or so; it's a relatively new field.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the NSA is only targeting political activists, ask yourself this: what use might our government have for a list of almost every illegal activity performed by almost every US citizen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could that list be the most powerful tool ever created for controlling a population?  Does our government have a history of compiling and using such lists (hint: google Senator Joseph McCarthy)?

Texts, emails, calls, credit card purchases, info from license plate readers regarding your movements, and probably anything posted to a forum from any IP address associated with you. 
It stores all the info with your phone #, credit card#, social security, etc.
It most likely searches for key words but the info is there for them to review if you get caught in a DUI or drug bust or protest or any other contact with law enforcement. If you get picked up for something they can review your file and determine how big of a threat you are, what they can get out of you or how much money they can get from you.

       While there are cover ups, I think the more logical answer is that the NSA just doesn't have the computing power to efficiently analyze everyone's data. Think about the LHC, they generate a shit ton of data but only keep about 15 petabytes per year. That's also not a constant run cycle through a year, I think. For that data, they have to disperse among different tiers of scientists so that there is cross referencing and parallelized analysis.. For the NSA's kind of data, I'd assume you can use raw computing power to filter out a good 50% of the data, but you'd still need a lot of people to actually look through things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, besides efficient analysis, I think the bigger thing is that they didn't want to reveal that they had this power.

       Because the program is secret, so they don't reveal where they get the information? I mean, how do you know that the child trafficking ring busts, for example, haven't been down to intelligence from the NSA?

       Doesn't everybody who would be worth tracking already assume they're being tracked and take the same precautions that a drug cartel would?  If all of the bad guys are capable of hiding their actions through decent security protocols (and of course they do), then who exactly is the government spying on?

       What message? You guys really think it is that easy? You know the cartels are involved with racketeering, human trafficking, and umpteen other bad things right? Legalising drugs won't get rid of them.

       What did I say that was not true? The cartels run the government..they already have their foothold. They do not need drugs to stay in power.
