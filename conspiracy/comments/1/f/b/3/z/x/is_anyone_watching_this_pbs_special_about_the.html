       What are your thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       As I am watching this, now 21 minutes into the show, my first thought stimulated by this program, "Great, now PBS has become a mouthpiece for the current administration."
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm not the only one thinking this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an upside, I suppose. Once our viewing leisure time is reduced to 9th grade level film-strips (yeah, that old), all we will see and-or be exposed to for, "entertainment" is red-pill antidote. Back to the "upside"; at least PBS we will still have Nature and Antiques Road Show. But "they" will probably find a way to have a hand in those shows as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I need another red-pill, now! Please, Citizen.

       I am working on my Masters in Anthropology and I can tell you without a doubt that "race", as you think you understand it, is a completely artificial construct. I am "white" and I assume you are too. It's possible that I share more genetic material with a native Zimbabwean than I do with you. It's just exposure to a particular environment that dictates pigmentation and other adaptive physical characteristics that you associate with a "race".

       The point of what he is saying is that "race" is just word play and that we are all evolving all the time. So, if you move to Africa and have offspring, chances are after enough generations they will be black and look like native Africans by all accounts. Same goes for dog breeds. It's all selection to the environment. OP's ancestors are black. Same goes for all of us. You fucking retards.

       The point of what he is saying is that race does exist, even if you want to eschew the use of that word in lieu of something like 'continental sub-populations'. Besides, as an anthropology student you already know that Indo-European and Eurasian peoples benefit from an introgression of DNA from Neanderthals and other now extinct hominid species. Moreover, blacks (or sub-saharan Africans) do not possess these genes. That is but one of the many reasons why race is real and relevant.

       You seem to be implying that there is something wrong with being racist. Guess what, there isn't. And one only feels guilty for wanting separation of races, because we are taught from day one, that only THE most evil of men in history, wanted their race to survive.

       Racism isn't hate.

       Racism preservation.

      <p>
       Racism is pride.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racism is what you're told racism is, and should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racism, just as with Nationalism, as you are told, taught, and made to believe; to believe that these are antiquated ideologies, movements, and states of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't, and people need to begin uniting, and separating themselves from those, not of their mold, and a less than equal cast.

       Wtf are you rambling about? Ah, you must be one of those overzealous, juvenile racist types...  But what about the human race?

       You were right about one thing though. Racism isn't hate, it's ignorance. Same with nationalism. The fact that these are such antiquated ideologies makes it worse that some of us still adhere to them. In this day and technological age, such 'isms' should be going extinct...

       "[R]ambling", right.
      </p>
      <p>
       With your invocation of absolutist doctrine that there is only, one "human race", I am inclined to believe that you have not researched anything regarding the matter, of your own volition.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's either that, or you're a minority (racially or otherwise), and you honestly believe everything you have been feed with the, "you're so special and important" spoon.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        '...people need to begin uniting, and separating...

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's pretty straight forward. Please, inform me as to which of your learning disabilities is precluding you from understanding what I have said; simply for future reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So, here, I'll dumb it down
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       What is it that I would like to see to, "unite"? Race. Race coupled with ideology(ies). Subsequent separation(s) would then be delineated based on like ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is it that I would like to see separated? Races.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this simple enough for you to now understand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, enlighten me, as you seem to be an authority on the matter, what is so, "ignorant", and "antiquated", about one wanting to be with a the
       <strong>
        same
       </strong>
       of kind, and like of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need sources. I don't want anecdotes. I just want a well reasoned argument as to why, separation(s), as I have outlined them, are bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just think about this: you believe me to be an absolutist, which I am not, and it clearly evidenced with what I have said. Yet, you have bought, hook, line, and race-baited sinker, everything you have been told is truth about upright walking apes, and human beings.

       The guy is obviously lonely. Who invests the time and effort to convince people of your idea in such an inefficient way, and by inefficient I mean lashing out at people with vehement hate and distrust.

       Yes, most of us have assholes. The human genome sees to it. The functional differences between the different races of humanity are quite small. The differences we carry in our heads, however, are quite huge. This is why I feel that racial stereotyping is useless, but cultural stereotyping is legitimate and illuminating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in the racial ethos of Star Trek. It doesn't matter that Uhura is black, because she is on deck and on point and a smart officer. It doesn't matter that Chekov is a scrawny Slav, because he is a good helmsman. Culture, not race, predicts individual success.
      </p>

       I would rather team up with people who share my goals and ambitions than people who happen to share my skin tone.

       Oh I understood full well what you meant by 'unite, and separate', and there's no need to dumb it down, it's quite dumb already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enlightening you would be a task I doubtfully have the patience for, but, to answer your question... The ignorance is the arbitrary superficiality (thinking skin color can tell you everything you need to know about a man),  and 'antiquated' just means something has been around for a really long time, perhaps too long. We are all the same 'kind', humankind, regardless of race, creed, religion, or any other label used to compartmentalize people.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the problem with separating the races... Segregation promotes prejudice, which is the perpetuating factor behind racism. Children growing up in all white, or all black, forcefully segregated communities will grow up with an innate fear of other races. How is that good?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, what is there about any given race to be so proud of? How much of an accomplishment is it to be born anyway?

       Correction, racism is ignorance. Pure ignorance. Maybe add stupidity to that. The day someone finds a logical and intelligent reason that we should treat people of different races any differently whatsoever, tell me. BUt I don't think that will be happening for a LONG time.
