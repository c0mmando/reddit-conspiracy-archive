       Well I found this post on r/TIL that brought up Muammar Gadaffi being stabbed in the anus with a bayonet. The pure blood lust from the comments is astounding. Reminds you of the mind programming required to convince people to go along with genocide..This got me researching.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I already knew about the conspiracy that he was murdered for trying to start a gold currency and only accept gold for oil.
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuqZfaj34nc">

      </p>
      <p>
       But forget everything you have been told about this man and just listen to his words. What he says is very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the UN security council he talks about the UN not being democratic and being the real terrorist.( just watch what the girl has to say, starts in the middle of a documentary,Timed start)
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkTUDw0mjMA#t=26m37s">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkTUDw0mjMA#t=26m37s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is him talking about the UN being feudalism and the terror council.  (a minute long)
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2Q1DKwPViQ">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2Q1DKwPViQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here he is talking about the for profit health care industry and it's corporations creating disease for profit ( ignore Micheal Savage's obvious establishment narrative techniques, he compiles some key things Gadaffi says, 7minutes)
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfozbizJwPo">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfozbizJwPo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In this it shows that the Libyan "rebels" were supplied weapons by US/UN. The humanitarian aid Obama was talking about. (from here till the weapons are all shown and talked about)
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkTUDw0mjMA#t=15m39s">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkTUDw0mjMA#t=15m39s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And I could just keep going.... If you want more, this bad documentary is a start.
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkTUDw0mjMA">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkTUDw0mjMA
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So this all just mirrors what is happening in Syria..Supplying the weapons to the "rebels" who are accused of being foreign mercenaries/AL CIA DUH. A bunch of info saying how bad this person is. (With Gadaffi, supposedly thousands of women were raped by his command.) And the same regime change plan against someone that doesn't play ball with the NWO.

       Ya I get it. But they always make their opponent an illusionary boogy man. That is part of regime overthrow.  But is their any proof that Gadaffi accepted blame, from his own mouth? And what does a mossad spy's terrorist acts have to do with Gadaffi? Why was he overthrown and murdered if he was a zionist/NWO plant?
