        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The theory of aliens using humans to mine gold for them has been around a long time. I have been doing some research and have found many very interesting facts that aid this theory and push it farther.</p>

<p>Why gold? Gold is an amazing electrical conductor, corrosion resistant, and would be used in circuitry.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Sumerians (the first recorded human civilizations) have tablets (not iPads) that say aliens came to Earth to mine its gold but found that it was a difficult task so they created man to do the job for them. <a href="http://www.streetarticles.com/pure-opinion/ancient-sumerian-aliens-create-the-adam-to-mine-gold">source</a> <a href="http://theupliftingcrane.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/were-humans-created-to-mine-gold-for-aliens/">source</a>
-Many civilizations throughout history have had some sort of &quot;gold tribute to the gods.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>Following this sentence are real, confirmed facts mixed with my speculation on the link between them all.</p>

<ol>
<li>Throughout recorded history, strange orbs of light which some people think are UFOs have been seen over fault lines soon before and after earthquakes that can&#39;t be explained by natural causes. <a href="http://geology.about.com/od/earthquakes/a/EQlights.htm">source</a>
-This pertains to this conspiracy theory because there was a scientific finding only a few months ago that says huge gold veins are created by earthquakes instantaneously. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/earthquakes-make-gold-veins-in-an-instant-1.12615">source</a>
-Earthquake lights have been recorded in recent history. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fpZBTN6Dfk">Video Japan earthquake/tsunami 2011</a>
I have not seen anyone else make this connection and I think it is extremely interesting.</li>
</ol>

<p>(This background info is needed) I believe the Maya calendar prediction of a new era (not the end of the world). The date the calendar ended was on Dec. 21, 2012. Eras aren&#39;t usually pinned to an exact date so I see it as more of an estimation. This was to be the time that the aliens would come to Earth and determine if we are worthy of joining their Galactic Federation or if we would just remain their slaves.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>New Mexico, 1945, the first nuclear explosion on Earth took place <a href="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/atomictest.htm">source</a>. This sent up huge red flags in the galactic community. When this happened the aliens said &quot;Oh fuck, these retards have nukes.&quot; and they sped up their plan for us before things got out of hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash 1947. A mishap lead to a UFO crash while they were checking out the area of the first man-made nuclear explosion.</p></li>
<li><p>UFO seen over Fort Knox in 1948 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantell_UFO_Incident">Mantell Incident</a>. Their equipment is telling them that there is a huge amount of gold there.</p></li>
<li><p>UFO seen hovering over the White House 1952 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUJF9yIr7tk">source</a>. TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER.</p></li>
<li><p>Area 51 construction begins in the early 1950&#39;s. <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/space/aliens-ufos/area-5113.htm">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>US entirely leaves gold standard in 1971, keeping all of the gold stolen from US citizens. The gold tribute to the gods continues.
-The last (and only) time anyone has been allowed to verify that the gold was still there was in 1974 and an extremely small portion of the gold (with questionable quality) was seen <a href="http://adask.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/no-gold-in-ft-knox/">source</a>.
-Ft Knox is still a hotspot for UFO sightings <a href="http://ufoinfo.com/onthisday/hotspots/northamerica.html">ranked #291</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All of this points to UFOs controlling the US government from way back behind the scenes either by controlling an extremely small number of people who have influence or even by taking the form of humans. I know it seems crazy but it makes more sense than what they tell us in real life. Alright everybody, rip me a new one.</p>

Edit2: grammar)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If aliens can build space ships capable of going between different galaxies, and presumably build a bunch of other futuristic technology, why would they be using humans to mine gold? Why not just scan the earth for it and use a digging machine to get to the largest veins. </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to be respectful here but I just don&#39;t understand the theory, or why, if they exist, why they would want gold, or why they would use human beings to slowly, very slowly, get it for them. It all just sounds a little out there, but i&#39;ve heard worse. Upvoted none the less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, and very great questions. The gold would be used in circuitry. A person might at first assume that an advanced alien race would use something better than electronics, but what is faster than the speed of light (electricity)? They probably have much more advanced electronic systems that we can&#39;t comprehend but the fundamentals would still be the same. I have also thought about why it would be hard for them to mine and that is a very tough one to give a solid answer to. We could have been an experiment. The aliens could have 1. wanted the gold and 2. wanted to perform the experiment and decided to kill two birds with one stone. The boss at a company might be able to do a job better than one of his workers, but he still chooses to train them and let them do it because he is busy with other things. As for time, it is very possible that aliens don&#39;t die naturally. Today in science we can identify the causes of the body dying and are working on stopping it. This is r/conspiracy, yes it&#39;s a little out there :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All your points after the first (Sumerian tablets) may well be true, but still they&#39;re not even close to a confirmation or even an indicator towards the first, imo. </p>

<p>What have you studied to verify or disprove Zechariah Sitchin&#39;s work? Honestly I have never read his books, because watching him on video he comes off as the typical opportunistic fiction artist. It would be interesting to see some critics of his work though, as I haven&#39;t looked further than my own judgement.</p>

<p>But I think unless you can argue for the validity of Sitchin&#39;s work, your other points are rather premature, since they do not have any strength to support the initial claim on their own merit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t be a conspiracy theory if the facts confirmed the theory. I do believe my points support the original theory because most of them do not have a confirmed explanation and they all fit into the framework that was already set. I have not read his books either. I am left to make sense of a reality that doesn&#39;t make any sense in the big picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I said they&#39;re neither close to being an indicator. Most of your arguments are simply a support of Aliens, not of the gold-alien connection. It&#39;s a bit untidy to mix the two. I have no doubts of the alien presence, but don&#39;t think any of it shows any interest in gold. So for that part you&#39;re left with Sitchin, and that&#39;s really my point. I read your theory as being the gold-alien connection. And that&#39;s Sitchin all the way. And there&#39;s a lot of criticism of his interpretations and selective analysis.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m just saying I think this theory should start off with a proper scrutiny of that key source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did state a couple of things that are not directly connected to the gold but they are still part of the framework set by Sitchin (yes, this whole theory depends on the validity of his work). If I didn&#39;t name those things it would leave the gap of &quot;Are they stealing the gold from Fort Knox? Does the government know?&quot; Those points that aren&#39;t directly dealing with gold are still pertinent to the overall conspiracy theory. How am I supposed to give evidence for aliens taking our gold without saying anything about aliens? Sitchin&#39;s work, earthquake lights and earthquake gold, UFOs over Ft Knox, and the government sometimes doing things that don&#39;t make much sense (like saying aliens don&#39;t exist) all point to the aliens and gold conspiracy. The nuke, Roswell, UFO over the White House, Maya calendar, and the gold standard are all things we don&#39;t have a firm answer to that are timed oddly perfect and backup the already intriguing conspiracy theory. Whether it is true or not, it is a solid conspiracy theory because it takes multiple things without answers and creates an overlaying scenario that brings them all together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain why the first nuclear explosion was a milestone towards aliens? I mean in terms of efficiency they are only 0.7%.... they need to be used in an environment. (detonate a nuke in the middle of space and all you get is a radiation cloud, there would be no shock wave, no blast. I just don&#39;t see nukes as a signal to aliens that we have gotten to some point. its always curious that the signal is something that already happened. </p>

<p>I would assume the signal would be something that could threaten them, discover faster than light travel (wormholes) or some other technology that could actually have consequence to an alien life form that is advanced enough to travel here from another star system, to them nukes would be childrens toys</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a literal signal in how something of that nature would be noticed because of everything that happens when an atom is split. It&#39;s too loud to miss. It is a signal of a certain level reached because it shows that we have significant knowledge of atomic theory, which is a huge milestone. The periodic table of elements might seem like just some science table, but it is unbelievable that we would be able to discover something we can&#39;t see and organize it so beautifully to the point that we can predict how an element will work before we&#39;ve even discovered it. It would send a milestone flag to aliens just as monkeys building motors would be to us. </p>

<p>Discovering nukes is the first thing that actually allowed us to wipe ourselves off the face of the Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s odd about their interest in us developing nuclear technology?

    <div class="md"><p>Also, another assumption we make is that they believe that having these weapons will destroy us and be a bad thing.</p>

<p>I would think they would take the same approach we take with our adult children, they may go out there and make mistakes, and marry the wrong person, get the wrong job etc, but you hope they learn and grow from it, become better people. If you just gave them the answers they wouldn&#39;t learn anything. Which is why they are not coming down and giving us advanced technology. In that same vein having the destructive capabilities, maybe even using them, learning from and coming to a deeper understanding, who&#39;s to say that many of these aliens races in this federation didn&#39;t come to their peaceful ways from the same history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>although nuclear weapons are clearly the most dangerous weapon we have built thus far.</p>

<p>The idea that a nuclear war would wipe out the face of the earth, or that even a war between two countries would be enough to destroy the earth has very little actual data behind it.</p>

<p>there have currently been over 500 Megatons of nuclear explosions on the earth thus far. Even the worst strike between the US and the USSR in the cold war would not have equalled that number. Billions would still live past even the worst nuclear war.</p>

<p>And our ability to alter life on a planet wide scale probably started with the industrial revolution, you could claim that since the start of the Holocene era the planet has begun an extinction event based completely on man, and all of that occurred before the first man made nuclear reaction.</p>

<p>I simply say Alien&#39;s interest to us in modern time was likely initiated by our development of nuclear weapons, with intent to monitor it and prevent destructive use. That&#39;s it.  </p>

<p>Of course they would not have any interest to stop our development, if they did they could just wipe us off the planet sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Imo it&#39;s logical to think they want us to develop in the best way, for either the purpose of our own species, or for their potential future utilization of our planet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is where we get into trouble, you are not OP. he never mentioned a specific interest in modern times, he gave examples from past history as well as modern ones.</p>

<p>Also what would be definition of best way to develop? often times we want the best childhood for our children but giving them a childhood with no struggles can make them weak. There could be just as much evidence that the aliens are encouraging wars simply to strengthen us for the quickening to come.</p>

<p>Also, the resources on our planet they would seek would not be gold. While gold, and other metals might be valuable to them, they would be easier to attain through other methods, mining asteroids, uninhabited planets with lower gravity, less of an atmosphere etc. If they were coming here for something it would be the organic compounds, and minerals that we produce here which many are formed from complex biological processes which would be more rare in the universe than gold.</p>

<p>Sure they could be encouraging wars, is that your belief? What&#39;s the evidence for that?  It&#39;s surely a substantial amount of witness testimony for them disabling nuclear launch tests. So that argument has merit. Yours is just a hypothesis with no evidence base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my theory is that after the first round of anal probes in the 1950&#39;s they needed more study, so they secretly funded porn companies and sites to push male anal sex, including women putting dildos in the asses of good american men. Through this expansion of acceptance to anal probing, the aliens are more able to examine the modern american man since he is less likely to wake up during the probe due to a majorly traumatic experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a literal signal in how something of that nature would be noticed because of everything that happens when an atom is split. It&#39;s too loud to miss.
It is a signal of a certain level reached because it shows that we have significant knowledge of atomic theory, which is a huge milestone. The periodic table of elements might seem like just some science table, but it is unbelievable that we would be able to discover something we can&#39;t see and organize it so beautifully to the point that we can predict how an element will work before we&#39;ve even discovered it. 
It would send a milestone flag to aliens just as monkeys building motors would be to us.</p>

<p>There are things we have not yet figured out, are still trying to work out that might end up being more useful &quot;signals&quot;, discovery of dark energy or matter and harnessing it, manipulation of space time, Dyson sphere, space elevator, etc..</p>

<p>If we wanted to talk about destructive power, why not wait until a society builds antimatter weapons which would be far more destructive than nuclear ones. </p>

<p>It to me just seems like people are pushing the success of the atom to the sky and thinking that now the aliens will come.

<p>There is no more evidence nuclear weapons would be a signal over antimatter weapons.(although since antimatter weapons are more efficient would be more destructive, and would still work in space.... might be useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if monkeys started building intricate machines that picked bananas you would completely ignore it? It is extremely illogical to assume that they would ignore a nuke just because you assume it can&#39;t be used destructively against them. If we got a nuke out to them I&#39;m sure it would do something. By your logic, you wouldn&#39;t do anything with the monkeys until they had cars and guns. Of course the technologies you listed would be a bigger flag but the size of that flag has no bearing on whether a nuke is a flag or not. You obviously have a grudge against this specific topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t see the splitting of the atom as that point. Why not the wheel? why not the industrial revolution? the first coal mine? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at your monkey reasoning. clearly if monkeys out of the blue starting building complex machines we would notice, but thats not how it happened here either, it was a process of discovery that built upon itself over a course of quite some time. So why not focus on the discovery of uranium or plutonium?</p>

<p>I think the idea of the nuke fits excellent with a movie, look at the timing, right at the time of the second world war, which was also the rise of more UFO related phenomenon, as well as interest by the general population. Nuclear weapons are still currently the most advanced weaponry in our arsenal so it would make sense that the most advanced thing we posses today would be the signal, there are just so many things that make it fit, for a plot in a film where things need to fit together pretty seamlessly.</p>

<p>While I do believe the harnessing of the atom being a significant event, if aliens were looking for a &quot;signal&quot; that we had achieved some level of technological advancement, I just don&#39;t see any evidence for it. There have been other great things done? sequencing of our genome? space telescopes? </p>

<p>And of course, my real argument, that its most likely something we haven&#39;t yet discovered figured out, and that signal is yet to come.</p>

<p>Please explain why nuclear technology is a better signal than antimatter technology?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can not technologically tip-toe to discovering atoms. It is a giant LEAP in knowledge. Look around the room you are in and, using only observation of things in that room, convince someone that everything in it including the air is made of tiny balls that you can&#39;t see and is actually made of more nothing than something. They would see that since we are capable of that leap, we are also capable of many other leaps leading to the technologies you have listed. If they waited until your flags it would be too late. It&#39;s very simple. Even though this is a conversation about a very speculative topic, you can&#39;t say they would ignore an atomic bomb just because bigger things are possible.

<p>There is no evidence of this. We can both agree the aliens do not currently use fission power, that is where we are at. we have not even been able to advance to fusion power, even our fusion weapons are not pure fusion. So saying that since we have figured our nuclear fission means we will figure out dark energy, antimatter technology or others doesn&#39;t seem to hold weight. A doctor has no special insight into electronics, a dentist cannot fix my ford. Having learned one technology is by no means a signal that the ability to learn others is present. and fission is pretty rudimentary in terms of nuclear reactions, maybe Fusion.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So the point of the federation is to step in when someone is getting close to the ability to form an attack? Once again nuclear weapons are not that signal. For the same reason that gunpowder was not that signal, its not effective as a weapon, and is not deliverable. The ability to attack an interstellar race would mean having technology that allows your weapons to leave the solar system, not an easy feat, even with all our nuclear prowess, this could still be centuries in the future. In the star trek version of this theory, they use the first use of a warp drive as the signal, since it means the race now has the ability to travel, thus literally having the ability to bring the fight to the aliens. (although one can suppose that a fledgling race just discovering warp drive technology would still be no match for an alien federation of star faring races.)</p>

<p>If we were to say the nuclear technology was that point, wouldn&#39;t the first self sustaining nuclear reaction be better? They could then see if we use it for good (power medicine) or evil (weapons) or both?  Also, a weapons test is very different from using it in combat, Hiroshima?</p>

<p>It would depend on your definition of intricate machinery. To us a nuclear power plant might seem intricate, to an alien civilization that might have been around for eons, it could be childs play.</p>
