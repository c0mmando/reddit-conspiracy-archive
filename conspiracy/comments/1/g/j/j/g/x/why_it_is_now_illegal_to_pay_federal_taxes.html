        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the passing of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) it is illegal to provide support to known terrorist organizations or to organizations that are known to provide support to known terrorist organizations.</p>

<p>The President and members of Congress have just authorized the support of and will be providing weapons to Syrian Rebels which is composed mostly of the Al-Nusra Front, a known associate of Al Qaida.</p>

<p>So if I understand things correctly, by providing financial aid/support to the U.S. Government which is in turn using such aid to provide support to known terrorist groups, I would be in violation of the NDAA as would the U.S. Government, or to be more precise, I would be conspiring with the U.S. Government to provide support to known terrorist groups and in violation of the NDAA.</p>

<p>For this reason, I believe the only course of action is to request my W4 form which is used to take money from my earnings and provide it to the U.S. Government be changed to &quot;Exempt&quot; because doing otherwise would make me a co-conspirator along with the members in Government that authorized such support for the known terrorist organization.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the Government is in violation of the Constitution for passing laws that are unconstitutional and erode our rights, specifically the 1st, 2nd, 4th and now 5th amendments as the Supreme Court has recently ruled that remaining silent is evidence of guilt.</p>

<p>The Constitution is essentially a Social Contract and those in Government have broken or change the terms of said contract. Because one of the parties has broken or took it upon their selves to change the terms of the contract, the other parties are no longer bound by said contract. This alone is reason enough to stop funding and financing the Federal Government.</p>

<p>So this 4th of July, instead of Armed Protests/Marches, consider changing your Tax Status to &quot;Exempt&quot; and stop funding the criminal organization that has usurped the Government of the People.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty much about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; Rambo&#39;s former Vietnam commander gets kidnapped and tortured by a ruthless Russian colonel.</p>

<p>Afghan rebels abound in this film...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great idea.  I really like it, and if a lot of people got behind it, it could be very effective.</p>

<p>The only problem I see is that if the Judicial avenue is taken, and essentially, it comes down to a judge having to decide whether or not the US Government <em>is</em> in fact a terrorist organization or at the very least associated with and financing of terrorist activity.  The judge cannot possibly rule that the US is a supporter of terrorism and thus you do not have to pay taxes.  The pressures and implications of a ruling would be truely paradigm shifting.  So it&#39;s not gonna happen.</p>

<p>The only way it would work is mass civil disobedience.</p>

Just stop using the money and use something else....If you don&#39;t earn make or use the crap debt money, you don&#39;t pay tax....the core of the entire problem lies in the federal reserve and debt based money...most of your tax money goes to pay off the debt for money that you shouldn&#39;t be borrowing anway, you don&#39;t need to borrow or subcontract currency creation....you just need to come up with an alternate currencu and get enough people to use it and think its good, like say bitcoin....the problem is not money as a means of exchange, it the money you are using and who is controlling that</p>

I&#39;ve heard it said that the only way to not use the debt-based fiat currency is barter and direct material exchange.  If you trade goods and services directly for goods and services, you remove the fiat currency as a medium of exchange.  This is why Venezuela is a target of the banksters because they are trading oil directly for humanitarian services or whatever else they need and going around the banking system and dollar as a medium of exchange.</p>

<p>this is the crux, why?....or more like what influenced the acceptance of what we use now? ....PROPAGANDA.....but now that is no longer controlled....again bitcoin and other currency is and can be used as an example...., the reason money is good is because....1. people think the government makes it. 2. they think it is made at cost 3. only though propaganda and media saturation have they been able to do this based on &quot;group think&quot;.....every post that reaches just one person, starts to add up....and this is why we now see r/conspiracy with the amount of subscribers and this is also why news,politics and worldnews subs read like an alternate version of conspiracy....basically money as debt is out of the bag, and sooner than later, they won&#39;t be able to stuff it back in...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m saying that if someone used the argument that paying taxes to our government is supporting terrorist activities by proxy, one would have to prove that their specific withholdings could be traced specifically to funds directed to AQ or whoever (under the guide of whatever they&#39;re saying this week.)</p>

<p>I guess my point is that this would be pointless for a single person. While I am all for standing up and calling out bullshit when bullshit happens, if one person went at this, they&#39;d most likely end up in tax trouble or bankrupt from legal fees. I agree with OP, I find the argument valid. We are indirectly funding AQ through taxes, which is not ok. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, if this idea were to gain traction, leading to mass people refusing to pay taxes, protesting, then the inevitable civil unrest, the government gets what they want anyway and get to declare marshal law and dust off all the automatic weapons, plastic coffins and MRAPs they&#39;ve been spending Homeland Security&#39;s nut on.</p>

<p>Bullshit. Al-Nusra only has about 6,000-10,000 members fighting in the war. most of the rebels are FSA (about 50,000) and SLF (about 40,000), which have no real allegiances with any terrorist organizations.</p>

<p>Al-Nusra doesn&#39;t even have a place in the SMC. They&#39;re a splinter faction who wants to take down Assad, but most of the opposition forces do not share their ideologies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll see about finding an exact source for the numbers a bit later. But for now, there&#39;s the SMC.

<p>A large part of the reason this SMC even exists is to phase out involvement of extremits groups such as al-Nusra, and prevent any chance of these extremists taking over when Assad&#39;s regime is removed.</p>
