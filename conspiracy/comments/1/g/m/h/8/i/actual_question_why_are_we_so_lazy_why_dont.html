       Long story short (and attempting to be impartial)- up until the 1940's it was a hazardous by-product of manufacturing. They had no clue what to do with it all; then some 'scientists' proved in a lab that it was good for teeth and now most all municipal water has fluoride added to it.

       Don't get to disheartened about America. As much as certain injustices piss me off, I am still thankful for being born in such an amazing place. There a lot of different cultures/climates/environments throughout the US; there are great places with great people, don't forget that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are still places in America where the citizens have fought and demanded that fluoride not be in the municipal water supply.

       There is hope; but in order for democracy to adequately work, you have to be actively involved.

       That phrase right there is likely what most of the Americans feel that actually give a shit about what's going on. They're afraid to fight back. They feel they can't do anything. And they're afraid that if they did rise up, that those who would rise with them will abandon them to their fate should the government react.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally? I want to live too much to fuck with the government. Does that make me a coward? yeah, it does. But it's the truth, and I won't lie about that.

       I'd love to leave the country, but really, do you honestly think there's somewhere safer?

       So what is the argument about toothpaste then? because in my experience it seems to work for it's stated purpose. Is fluoride not the active ingredient in toothpaste? is it that too much altogether is the problem? Is it different in paste than in water?

       It may be a different compound.  What we have in our water is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid">
        Hydrofluorosilicic Acid
       </a>
       (

        hydroflauric acid

       with added
       <a href="http://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/silicacrystalline/">
        silica
       </a>
       ) and has some very nasty MSDS warnings.  We mostly get it from China as a byproduct of the aluminum industry.  What really worries me is it's warnings against skin contact.  We bath in this stuff.  Additionally the boiling point is the same as water, so I'm not sure that distilled water is any more safe than the tap, as the added fluoride could distill at the same temperature as water...but the distillation process would remove most other contaminants leaving behind H2O with concentrated fluoride levels.  As for tooth paste?  I use fluoride free, but I would think that topical application is a lesser evil than consumption or submersion in the stuff.  Remember when we were kids in school and they gave us tubes of fluoride treatment to use after brushing?  The label clearly said "do not consume".

       There are Havard studies that prove that fluoride affects cognitive development growing up:

       And thats just what we know of. I have a feeling there are more "numbing" qualities to fluoridated water, and regimes from Nazi Germany to modern America continue to use it.

       Laziness is largely a mental straight. Your body can only be "tired", but its mind that makes us "lazy". And fluoride definitely fucks up the mind.

       I mean you said fluoride messes with the mind. You said laziness is from the mind. But that is too vague of a statement and can't be proved just like that. Your coming off as weird now if you think fluoride is the reason I can't understand that...

       Lemonade with a sprinkle of cajun pepper will as well. I only drink alkaline water and lemonade. And not minute maid, Im talking jugs of simply lemonade every day. Lemons are a great source of alkaline and do wonders to de-calcify the pineal gland. 
I also recommend doing some research on alchemy and its stem along with
       <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus">
        Hermes Trismegistus

       I know it is sold at Lunds, as well as online. Alkalinr water however is not as effective as lemons or lemonade being it is a high source of alkaline. I recomend simply lemonade as it is very high in alkaline.

       No, Cajun is not a necessity, however it does add a funky kick to your lemonade. I would also be carefull about how much simply lemonade you're consuming as the alkaline rush will make you quite drowzy and tired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just get a jog and drink it in place of your regular drinks for meals, or snack drinks. In several days you will feel kind of a metallic taste in your head (weird, I know)  which means your doing good and its time to take a break. This isnt a one time cleanse, its a process. Takes months to get rid of what years of calcium has built up in your kidneys and Pineal gland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh it also cleans your kidneys, and urinal tract getting rid of calcium and infection. You will piss the funkiest piss you have ever seen.

       I did a bit more reading, and I read that sugar is horrible when trying to decalcify the pineal gland. Wouldn't this mean that the sugar in simply lemonade would cancel out the alkaline from the lemon juice?

       Yes sugar is bad, but alkaline is good. Really the choice is up to you. A gallon of Simply lemonade doesnt have half the sugar (I dont think) than a can of soda. Replace it and your getting a better deal all around anyway.

       Mass Media Machine + fluoride + fear of terrorism + eroding constitution + DHS purchasing 1.6bn rds of ammo and more + keeping tabs on all conversations + releasing the info on PRISM = A fearful and angry and armed populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a breading ground for violent protests, and the goal of the whole shebang. They want us fearful so they can feed us full of lies. They want us angry so those lies will never reveal the real truth. And they want us armed so the protests need military suppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this, coupled with the new law of the land under the Patriot Act, is just martial law waiting to happen It only requires the fuze lit by some large turnout, or nationwide turnout they can subvert into a violent attempt to overthrow the regime in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear this is the wrong country for them to do this, it will lead to so many lost lives. The people no matter how drugged will, when pushed enough, push back.

       Because we're all too comfortably distracted with what society is telling us we need, and how to live our lives. There's no time for uprising when you work 40 to 50 hours a week, spend around 60 hours sleeping, spend another 40 on Facebook or watching tv, and that last 20 to 30 hours left are spent consuming the goodies they want us to consume. Distraction.... And the lack of will to make a fucking sacrifice for the greater good.  The fact of the matter is, the mass majority want change, but don't want to sacrifice the cushy lives they actually live to make a difference. Think about it this way, if you have a full time job, are you willing to loose it over the fact that you didn't make it into work for a week ( maybe longer) because you were out trying to make a difference? Does the company you work for give a fuck about your cause? Are you willing to loose all the commodities money gets you from working a full time job such as being able to afford a phone, bills, or even your home/apartment? People want their cake and to eat it too, as the saying goes. All the change, with none of the effort.  The big corporations know this, and this is the exact reason occupy Wall Street faded. Eventually, people are forced back into the mundane cycle of their lives out of necessity to live/support their families. In my opinion, people need to take it apon themselves to be more self sufficient and rely less on government and more importantly, big business. Once you can achieve this, you now have the true freedom to make a difference in your life and the lives around you. As Martin Luther King Jr. said " Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle. And so we must straighten our backs and work for our freedom. A man can't ride you unless your back is bent. "

       People aren't rebelling because they still have "too much to lose". People in our day and age also lack adequate resources and tactics for such rebellion. It is also very foolish to begin said rebellion without any concrete long term plans for post rebellion societal structure.. Look at post revolutionary France and the reign of terror.

       IMO its just how we were all raised, to work. If you don't have work you can't survive. Yes there are things going on that we should stop but we can't get away from our jobs and sacrifice a days/weeks/months pay for myself/my family. We are slaves to the workforce. And we have the entertainment at our dwelling to numb our minds to the outside. Yeah we'll read it but its only to know what IS happening. Lay your head down and get some rest for tomorrow is a big day of work.

       Well its not like the Brazilians are protesting for less government, less power, they are protesting for more government, more power in government and frankly the worse its going to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until people realize that they can't trust other people with their money and to make decisions for themselves, I'm afraid its not going to get better.

       At this point I do think billions are going to die from wars, starvations, lack of water and shelter, disease, etc... everyone will beg for one world government to save them, of course when established it won't save them, it will kill 95% of the human population so that the elites can  use the life extension technologies and live forever.

       I know people protesting in Brazil right now and the ones i know are not for bigger government. They have told me literally when i asked them why they were rioting(from a video one posted on Facebook) that, "it's not a riot. We are striking the corruption."

       not sure that their is a country more drugged thru big pharma, fluoridated water, and chemically laden additives/toxins more than the US.. Since we're born, we get an accumulation of fluoride, then we're ingesting all the aspartame and other toxins in our foods, pesticides in our fruits/veggies , then many are put on psychotropic drugs ...

       Uniting Populists by Bruce E. Levine does quite a good job of explaining the psychology and history of action and passivity in the political sphere. Gave me a lot of clarity into the realm. IIRC a big chunk of it was learned helplessness, along with lots about how we are dependent on the system, how we are distracted, and how we are over worked, dissonance (inability to accept that something is going on), and im sure many other things (i cant recall exactly, i read it a few months ago).
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course he doesnt address any of the "conspiratorial" side of it but im sure everyone else here could give a good description on that end. However, Being suicided or indefinitely detained or whatever else, while they are noteworthy,  are not in the minds of most of the public and play very little into the mass passivity of our nation.

       We are still under the delusion that we're the best in the world.  We still think we have it really good.  I think a really good deal of Americans understand at this point that things really are beginning to hit the fan in this country, but I still think that most of us think "Well hell, at least we're not like Bahrain or Brazil or [insert any other country that's having uprisings]!  We're still okay!  Okay enough to not revolt...yet!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem with this type of thinking is that it's actually not really all that accurate.  I mean it's true, we're not necessarily AS bad as, say, Bahrain, but not only are we not that far from them, but we're sinking really fast, and by the time that enough of us stand up and realize that the ship IS sinking, it might very well be too late to keep from drowning in it.

       From what I've gathered, their police forces are inexperienced, in smaller size and angry too, despite the rapid growth of the country. There is still a gap between the middle class in the poor. And there is no credit in between to help the 2 groups meet. These people are tired of getting ripped off. I'm very sure, the police themselves are angry too.

       I'm pretty sure it just hasn't gotten that bad yet. I just saw a headline on reddit today saying brazillians pay ~26% of their wages for bus fare or something similar to that. Americans don't even pay that for the comfort and "privacy" of their own car. I recently met a girl from Brazil in Miami. She was telling me that she loves taking trips there with her family, and that everything is cheaper than they're used to...in MIAMI! You, me, and every other fucker on

       knows the American people should be rising up, but who wants to be the first one to die? There won't be martyrs either. That's something for the history books. No one will know you died fighting the good fight. Your loved ones will he mocked for having a "terrorist" as a family member. We won't stand up until it's past time. It's human nature. They've given us comforts and taken our birth rights. People either don't remember what it was like to have them or they don't care, because they prefer their comfort.

       Why do I need to consider this when I can think about the sexy actress in this week's big film? I'm hungry, I need a couple McDoubles and a Shamrock Shake, BBL.

       Quite frankly, we don't have a truly oppressive government.  Not much of what the government does has a real negative effect on the daily lives of the majority of Americans.  Look around at all of the recent revolutions around the world.  All of them had governments that were way more oppressive than the US.

       There's also more geographical and cultural barriers between people.

       snarky answer: fluoride

       thoughtful answer: we spend so much time pursuing passive entertainment we probably collectively figure someone else will take care of whatever.

       besides, we've been being conditioned for years, just like farm animals who see their herd-mates being led away never to return ut don't care as long as there's nice, succulent grass to feed on.

       For the most part people's lives are actually quite comfortable and enjoyable. Why would anyone give up regular meals, warm houses, endless entertainment, and a safe environment just because something on the news happened that barely affects them at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point at which the majority of the middle class will turn would be when the lights go out and the food stops coming in. When the people no longer have their comforts, or their family's safety is compromised somehow, that's when you'll see action.

       Nazi Germany went way, way further down the road to tyranny than the U.S. has, and many people still followed along, hell they even fought on the side of tyranny and laid their lives down to uphold fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Germans of last century are not much different from you or I, the only difference is we have a lesson from history. But if history teaches us anything it's that no one learns the lessons of history, it just repeats itself over, and over again.

       No, Cajun is not a necessity, however it does add a funky kick to your lemonade. I would also be carefull about how much simply lemonade you're consuming as the alkaline rush will make you quite drowzy and tired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just get a jog and drink it in place of your regular drinks for meals, or snack drinks. In several days you will feel kind of a metallic taste in your head (weird, I know)  which means your doing good and its time to take a break. This isnt a one time cleanse, its a process. Takes months to get rid of what years of calcium has built up in your kidneys and Pineal gland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh it also cleans your kidneys, and urinal tract getting rid of calcium and infection. You will piss the funkiest piss you have ever seen.
