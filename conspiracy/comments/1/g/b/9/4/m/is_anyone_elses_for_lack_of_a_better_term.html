What one may ascibe to &quot;gut&quot; others may subscribe to the subconscious.  What those who ascribe to subconscious others may ascribe to intuition.  What some may describe as intuition others may ascribe to changes in the electromagnetic field of the brain.  What some may describe as EM changes in the brain, others will describe as changes in the earth&#39;s EM.

<p>Reeling this back in, does anyone else feel/see/intuit some dramatic events happening this weekend?  Immense physical conflict, release/leaks of information far greater in importance than the Bengahzi, Libya, IRS, Turkey Protests, Crackdown on Journalists, the prism/nsa thing, and the recent support by the US to the Syrian Rebels?  I feel like something is in the air and it will begin to unfold this weekend.  This weekend will not be the end-all, SHTF, but the first set of tangible events that may lead to it.  In any event, my gut tells me that shit will occur this weekend that will be bigger than all of this and will be worldwide news.</p>

<p>(No, I am not trying to predict anything.  I just have a hunch that some big events will begin to unfold this weekend.  It&#39;s that gut feeling, my subconscious niggling in the back of my mind.  I hope this is just indigestion.)</p>

<p>But hope for the best. Imagine the elite trying to pull off something massive, and failing miserably in the process. Something that unmasks them to the world.</p>

<p>I say this because we humans collectively create our reality. The Law of Attraction on a massive scale. This is the main reason for their constant perpetuation of hate and fear.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe any of this, its still more fun to imagine them failing anyway, so why not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mark Passio on the podcast <a href="http://whatonearthishappening.com/">What On Earth Is Happening</a> explains it well by saying that although New Age types claim to higher knowledge over the Law of Attraction and all the convoluted karma rules etc, they are unwilling to accept that negative forces exist in the universe. Heres a joke for you:</p>

<p>A race was run by 3 people; a positive thinker, a negative thinker, and an emotionally balanced thinker. Who won?</p>

<p>The negative individual: the positive person committed suicide after refused to admit the pessimist existed, while the balanced person kept stopping to sniff the flowers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I think you bring up an important point about certain new-agers, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair or correct to assert that new ages are unwilling to accept negative forces. Negative forces are essential to almost all new age thought. Then you have David Icke and people of lesser intense theories of realities that believe there are demonic energies in play on earth that eat and murder babies. Again, I know what you meant, but you have to be careful characterizing a whole group based on the Law of Attraction people alone.</p>

Furthermore, all our instrumentation is still but a sliver in the overall picture that is universe, if you think you have any sort of bearing on reality based on your limited cognition you are just as deceived as the rest of us. </p>

<p>Sure we discover things about the universe in a nearly parabolic curve and I think it&#39;s awesome that our brains are capable of such understanding, however to think we know something is utter arrogance. We might be less wrong than our ancestors but we&#39;re still not right, the state of humanity as a whole is indication of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.. I don&#39;t think we know much. We know a lot less than we think, and that&#39;s why we have to be careful of what we know is true and what we <em>hope</em> to be true which is where your ideas lie.</p>

<p>Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty is not limited to just instrumentation. It&#39;s derived from mathematics and principles and the limitations of instruments is merely a way to explain it to laymen. This has no bearing at all to what you&#39;re saying. Its importance lies in not being able to determine initial conditions to a fine enough precision in complex chaotic systems which are technically deterministic but are effectively unpredictable.</p>

<p>If you want to convince yourself that this crap is true, go for it. But don&#39;t drag scientific ideas through the shithole with it. </p>

<p>When I was young (the 60&#39;s), the government helped citizens; collectively and individually.  I may have protested and bitched, but in the end I trusted the federal government to be sincere and make an effort, however much I disagreed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel it.</p>

<p>I just posted the following on facebook:</p>

<p>CBS news is reporting the Obama administration has determined the Assad government in Syria used chemical weapons, which was completely found to be false. The rebels, who we are secretly arming, used the chemicals. This is a major escalation of war. This is what the bad press and the leaks are all about. Pressure. Pipelinistan can&#39;t be completed until they get Syria. There will be blood.</p>

<p>This is bad. The news is happening too fast right now. This feels like the elite trying to course correct. The narrative needs to shift big and it needs to shift fast. Snowden&#39;s leak went too far. This is a little too coincidental for my liking.</p>

<p>9/11 taught many people how the global elites play us. They create the reality they need by staging events, give us the reasons why it happened via controlled media, then they are free to act as planned. </p>

<p>The shit will hit the fan when we have our &quot;Rulers&quot; backed into a corner. The more corruption is exposed, the more we learn how it is that they are controlling this world. This is why Snowden is a fucking hero...this is why the elites call him a &quot;traitor&quot;. Its become evident the people don&#39;t buy their governments word anymore...another step closer to the corner. They know it. People are starting to notice their desperation. It&#39;s obvious, they are starting to panic.</p>

<p>Tyranny is forever trying to gain control. It will always be a force we need to push back against...the Yin and the Yang. The world now realizes the the extent of the corruption. It&#39;s full blown. It&#39;s worldwide. I believe many people can sense the fuse is about to be lit.</p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t need to be a correlation between the two. These kinds of &quot;T-word attacks&quot; will continue to pop up here and there, most likely in different forms. The only reason for them is to justify a military and security presence. The military and political class has grown to unnecessarily large proportions. So when they don&#39;t have an enemy to stand against, they create one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve gotten these gut feelings every once in a while, and I&#39;ve also referred to it as my &quot;spidy sense&quot; as well.  But generally it has only worked as a BS detector when divining the truth of a story, and not so much as a predictor of future events.  I&#39;ve stayed up late at night scared and sweating waiting for the hammer to drop and it never did when I expected it to.  But as a truth detector, instinct has worked great.</p>

<p>General trends can be predicted using gut feeling, but not specific events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt there is something coming that will be used to deflect the shit storm that this NSA debacle has turned in to.</p>

<p>Its far too wide reaching, far too bipartisan and effects far too many people.  And people are actually standing up to it.  </p>

<p>And the scary part for the people who hope to quiet it down?  The fact that it seems this time we&#39;re not just going to let ourselves get easily distracted.  Its going to take something big to deflect this.  Thats my concern.  </p>

<p>If blaming the other party wont work, if just saying they&#39;ll look in to it wont work, and having the media release manipulative information wont work, what&#39;s left?</p>

<p>Something will happen before we&#39;re made aware of the full scope of these intrusions, thats my gut feeling.  Or maybe its gas.</p>

It&#39;s not some pseudo-scientific shit about EM waves and stuff.. please don&#39;t make your very legitimate claim become illegitimate because of these flawed premises.</p>

<p>I do believe that you&#39;re correct though. I mean, do distractions follow embarrassing events? Do you point out someone else&#39;s mistakes when your own are discovered? </p>

<p>Your gut feelings are just analyses you&#39;ve made from previous situations that you haven&#39;t acknowledged yet. Trusting your gut is almost always a good thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intuition is just a word for that dopamine feeling we get when our minds string together ideas and extrapolate a sense of the situation from them. There is no doubt in my mind that big changes are coming. I can&#39;t really say with any certainty if they&#39;re good or bad because that&#39;s all subjective. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t say much for the Milky Way&#39;s EM but I can tell you that the Earth, particularly it&#39;s climate and the composition of it&#39;s ocean and atmosphere are changing are at frightening pace and nothing is being done to stop this.</p>

<p>I can tell you that the population and particularly the population density of cities is also growing at a rapid pace. The implications for this with regard to things like resources, pollution and the large-scale impact of a viral pandemic are all on edging toward the brink of disaster.</p>

<p>Technology is accelerating at a parabolic velocity and with that many of the things we used to consider science fiction are quickly becoming a possibility. This one fact has the potential to render all other problems trivial but it also has the potential to make things a lot worse. It&#39;s a double-edged sword with a mind of its own.</p>

<p>Taking all of these things into account for context we can start talking about the political climate. Liberal young minds the world over now outnumber their elderly conservative parents and grandparents but we&#39;re expected to take care of them even as we change this world into something they wouldn&#39;t recognize and most likely fear. We may be naive or idealistic but we hold all the power now and we owe it to ourselves, our forefathers and our grandchild to make sure we don&#39;t fuck this up. We have a lot of lessons that we&#39;re going to have to learn and a lot of those lessons will come in the form of hard knocks. No doubt we&#39;re doing the best we can but that isn&#39;t to say that mistakes won&#39;t be made and that our grandchildren won&#39;t make equally disastrous mistakes. </p>

<p>This gut feeling is literally in your head but you aren&#39;t making it up. You know just like we all do that change is coming. Try harder to rationalize what is in your head before turning to your gut for answers. It&#39;s just telling you to think harder.</p>

<p>Turkey Protests? Microshaft SpyBOne? Ed Snowden? Obama getting us involved with Syria? Don&#39;t kid yourself if he wasn&#39;t President we&#39;d already be going to war with Iran ... either way Russia and China are fucking pissed.</p>

<p>Tell yourself it&#39;s all just a coincidence and accept that even if they are all completely isolated incidents that they all relate anyway. You don&#39;t need your intuition to know what any of this means. The facts speak for themselves.</p>

<p>There&#39;s something about where Edward Snowden chose to defect and why and this has me a little bit nervous. For years now the narrative in the United States has revolved around provoking China into a fight which is horrible because they actually depend on us just like we depend on them. There&#39;s only one reason we would ever attempt to ruin that: we know the ship is sinking. I think Ed Snowden knew what I&#39;ve been suspecting for a while now. We&#39;re going to try to bankrupt them with war to propel ourselves out of this great depression we try so hard to cover up by pulling them into the crab pot as we try to scuttle our way out. He wants to be on the side that is not only going to win ... but is going to be in the right. The same people who are going to smear him now are trying going to try to smear the PRC for harboring him but that&#39;s all just the narrative we&#39;re being told and only scratches the surface of what&#39;s really going on. We want to rule over them. </p>

<p>Once we&#39;re balls-deep in Syria&#39;s ass I think Kim Jong-un might whip out his red rocket and join the party. Once you have Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States all gang banging each other then it&#39;s official: World Orgy III. The powers that be want it all to happen because they profit every step of the way. Entire continents who don&#39;t want to have anything to do with any of this are going to get dragged into it too because their hands will be tied just like the rest of us. </p>

<p>If I had the power to I&#39;d be packing my backs and getting the fuck outta Dodge but it&#39;s not going to matter.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to be a genius to know that shit&#39;s about to go down in a big way. We have the power to stop it but it will take a God damn miracle and you would really have to believe in sky daddies and pixie dust to think it isn&#39;t going to happen without a fight ... I for one am going to be busy worshiping technology because that&#39;s the only thing that gives me hope. Spirituality is for the blind and they&#39;re going to be lead by devils in sheep&#39;s clothing. If your guts telling you anything it&#39;s telling you to think before it&#39;s made illegal.</p>

<p>I will admit I do like to think about the little hocus pocus stuff that goes on in my head sometimes so for those of you who think this is all strictly spritual let me just translate all of the technical, logicky stuff for you: the NSA found out that clairvoyants are real and that we&#39;re onto them and they&#39;re trying to fight us but they&#39;re going to lose because evil sucks at magicks because their chakras are closed off to the collective lizard subconscious and our tarot, reiki astrology jesus chakras are open and will blast them into oblivion with care bear stares ... or AK47s ... I&#39;m not really sure.</p>
