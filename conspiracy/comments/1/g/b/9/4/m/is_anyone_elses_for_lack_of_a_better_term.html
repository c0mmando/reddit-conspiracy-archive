       This is not a fact-based post.  This is entirely subjective.  We all have experienced gut-reactions, gut-feelings, and so forth.  What one may ascibe to "gut" others may subscribe to the subconscious.  What those who ascribe to subconscious others may ascribe to intuition.  What some may describe as intuition others may ascribe to changes in the electromagnetic field of the brain.  What some may describe as EM changes in the brain, others will describe as changes in the earth's EM.  What some may describe as changes to the earth's EM, others may ascribe to changes in the Milky Way's changes.  And so on, and so forth.

       Reeling this back in, does anyone else feel/see/intuit some dramatic events happening this weekend?  Immense physical conflict, release/leaks of information far greater in importance than the Bengahzi, Libya, IRS, Turkey Protests, Crackdown on Journalists, the prism/nsa thing, and the recent support by the US to the Syrian Rebels?  I feel like something is in the air and it will begin to unfold this weekend.  This weekend will not be the end-all, SHTF, but the first set of tangible events that may lead to it.  In any event, my gut tells me that shit will occur this weekend that will be bigger than all of this and will be worldwide news.
      </p>
      <p>
       (No, I am not trying to predict anything.  I just have a hunch that some big events will begin to unfold this weekend.  It's that gut feeling, my subconscious niggling in the back of my mind.  I hope this is just indigestion.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is based soley on my gut feelings

       The very bottom of the rabbit hole is the spiritual nature of reality. I'm not saying believe this just because some stranger on the internet is telling you its true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hope for the best. Imagine the elite trying to pull off something massive, and failing miserably in the process. Something that unmasks them to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this because we humans collectively create our reality. The Law of Attraction on a massive scale. This is the main reason for their constant perpetuation of hate and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe any of this, its still more fun to imagine them failing anyway, so why not?

       Basically, this does not follow from any scientific model, but the creators/spreaders of this bullshit like to say stuff like "quantum mechanics!" to lure in believers. It's a nice plot element for a fiction story, but it's pseudo-science at best, and a scam at worst.

       No, I'm saying that the placebo effect is well-known as a person inducing chemical changes in his body due to some belief, while the law of attraction is basically bending reality by positive thinking.

       explains it well by saying that although New Age types claim to higher knowledge over the Law of Attraction and all the convoluted karma rules etc, they are unwilling to accept that negative forces exist in the universe. Heres a joke for you:

       A race was run by 3 people; a positive thinker, a negative thinker, and an emotionally balanced thinker. Who won?

       The negative individual: the positive person committed suicide after refused to admit the pessimist existed, while the balanced person kept stopping to sniff the flowers.

       Although I think you bring up an important point about certain new-agers, I don't think it's fair or correct to assert that new ages are unwilling to accept negative forces. Negative forces are essential to almost all new age thought. Then you have David Icke and people of lesser intense theories of realities that believe there are demonic energies in play on earth that eat and murder babies. Again, I know what you meant, but you have to be careful characterizing a whole group based on the Law of Attraction people alone.

       That is what the extreme New-Age people believe; sorry I wasn't clear on that. Like basic new-agers don't always talk about the malicious beings (Icke's reptilians, etc.) and just kind of call things like "bad energy" or whatever. I was kind of joking around with the wording of that sentence so it made things look more extreme.

       With all your senses combined you can only perceive a sliver of the total electromagnetic spectrum, and you seriously believe that you know all there is to know. Even though you can only think about something that you've already perceived(which is an insignificant sliver in the overall picture), furthermore what you perceive is distorted by your imagination. So given that, how can you say something is bullshit or not? I'm not saying there aren't dishonest people out there trying to cash in on people's gullibility, just that we don't really understand how things work, and to just dismiss an idea is intellectually lazy.

       Even our tools and instruments can only make a measurement, we're inferring what that measurement means(entirely metaphysical endeavor).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's part of the reason why Heisenberg's uncertainty principle holds. Our instrumentation doesn't have enough resolution for both the particle's movement and position at the same time(we have to make inferences). Furthermore, all our instrumentation is still but a sliver in the overall picture that is universe, if you think you have any sort of bearing on reality based on your limited cognition you are just as deceived as the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure we discover things about the universe in a nearly parabolic curve and I think it's awesome that our brains are capable of such understanding, however to think we know something is utter arrogance. We might be less wrong than our ancestors but we're still not right, the state of humanity as a whole is indication of that.

       No.. I don't think we know much. We know a lot less than we think, and that's why we have to be careful of what we know is true and what we
       <em>
        hope
       </em>
       to be true which is where your ideas lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heisenberg's uncertainty is not limited to just instrumentation. It's derived from mathematics and principles and the limitations of instruments is merely a way to explain it to laymen. This has no bearing at all to what you're saying. Its importance lies in not being able to determine initial conditions to a fine enough precision in complex chaotic systems which are technically deterministic but are effectively unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to convince yourself that this crap is true, go for it. But don't drag scientific ideas through the shithole with it.

       The thing is physics has it's basis in philosophy. Many of our valued theories arose from metaphysical generalizations. Furthermore our "laws" aren't really laws at all, they do not hold in all circumstances. They are at best approximations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask any structural engineer if they engineer things exactly to spec. They'll tell you they always over engineer, because they know their measurements are approximations.

       I'm a physicist. I don't need to ask an engineer to know what approximations are. You need to understand that our approximations aren't going to prove us to be less right. That's not how it works.

       We're not right thought, and neither are you. You can't be right, not if you're a true empiricist, you can only be less wrong(and to others it might appear that you're right but it's only an illusion). It's all a matter of what you perceive.

       My bullshit? Oh I forgot you're omniscient because you're a physicist so you know all my beliefs and completely understand my thought process. Hell since you're a physicist I'm sure you also know how mind emerges from the neural activities in our brains. Oh what's that? Science hasn't figured that out yet? It's also utterly ignorant about consciousness as well? You mean we can't figure shit out by reducing it to it's components and studying them in isolation? Go figure.

       Except we are working on that. Research is an on-going process, but we're slowly working our way into more complex systems. For example, biophysics is really only just developing as we apply physics-styled experimentation on the biological processes (ie. look at how electromagnetism and looking at bonding on a small enough scale because of how far our technology allows us to go presently).
      </p>

       If I said I was omniscient, then I'm not a physicist. I'm telling you that your shit is bullshit because it's untestable shit that people use to scam idiots into buying videos and fake drugs.

       We're already past the age of pure rational philosophers. Even modern day philosophers don't associate themselves with Plato and his idiotic beliefs. They look at it to know where they should avoid, not for future ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks though, but you should maybe look into neural networks at the moment. It's more within the field of AI at the moment than physics, but there must be some interdisciplinary works that I don't know of.

       I actually started with philosophy in college, then went into developmental psycho-biology(which is a fancy term for behavioral psychology with a systems approach), then gave up and went into validations engineering.

       I am also a hobby neuro-hacker, I can give you a detailed anatomy of the brain, what areas are responsible for what, but I can't for the life of me figure out how our minds emerge from the trillions and trillions and trillions of neural interactions. There's some funky theories out there having to do with quantum mechanics and micro tubules, the problem is that there are so many feedback mechanisms going on and they all depend on each other that you have to investigate at a system's level, to look for they synergy.

       Not only that I've met people who are doing cutting edge research, and it's slow because what they're investigating has hard empirical evidence, but it's not along the lines of currently accepted opinion. Science especially in acadamia isn't without beurocracy and greed, let alone the private market.

       I agree with you on the bureaucracy part because that's one of the flaws of our peer-review system, but scientific research is still much better than any of the "law of attraction" crap. Maybe it's because I work in physics and not the more lucrative fields of biology/medical-adjacent stuff, but I haven't had any evidence that any of my colleagues or any of my previous professors have been or are tainted by greed. The worst motivation would be the raw ambition, but even then, it would not produce ideas lacking real merit or evidence.

       I agree no such thing as a "law of attraction" I think they're over-hyping something much more basic in the hopes of pushing overpriced books full of flowery language. That said, our imagination has the power to manifest what we hold in our minds, I wouldn't say it's "law of attraction" more we manifest what we bury in the back of our minds. If you keep looking for miracles your mind will inevitably begin seeing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that we manifest things out of thin air, our constant thinking about something makes it salient, invariably we're going to notice it sooner.

       Okay, could you rephrase your question then? I don't understand what you are saying, but an atom has a known mass depending on its isotope. There are ideas that people have come up with based on vibrational modes of "strings" but they have yet to come up with more than just elegant math. In addition, none of their models would allow for.. this law of attraction, "positivity" mechanism for bending reality.

       You are a fool. One can very easily have an understanding of the laws of physics and the scientific model and also have an understanding of the metaphysical and spiritual laws that govern our universe. They actually go hand in hand if you stop focusing on the bullshit law of attraction stuff. Actually research the mystery schools and try and have an open mind...you don't need to pay anybody or be gullible but you are being a close minded fool if you dismiss these ideas because some new age assholes try to pitch them for money. The occult has nothing to do with new age quackery but everything to do with the base nature of reality.

       You are putting words in my mouth. I made none of the claims about the vedas you are refuting. People will manipulate anything for personal gain. Meditation and spirituality are not scams, the buddah was not a con artist. Choose what you believe carefully indeed, but becoming cynical and jaded to the god that is within you is worse than sending money to IDL. The vedas contain esoteric knowledge which need to be interpreted through your own lens of perception

       Don't worry about it. I know I'm a dick online (I don't play any games, and honestly, besides hanging out with friends once in a while, I mostly have work and reddit so venting online is my stress relief).
      </p>

       As I remember it, the Buddha wasn't a con artist, but the Buddha also didn't advocate these things. The main results of his musings were that suffering comes from imbalance between what we have and what we want, but what we want is something we can control so in a sense, we can control our own suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, I guess we'll have to disagree on this issue. I'm a scientist by training and I'm naturally more skeptical of any question that cannot be verified through tests.

       When I watched the towers fall, I knew we were fucked.  Not because of the act itself, or because terrorists were a threat.  But because I knew the brain-dead people - both those in charge and the followers - would react by fucking us all in the name of saving us.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I read about the NSA shit, I knew the same thing.  Except this time, since we were already fucked, we're
       <em>
        more

       fucked.

       As far as big things happening?  Well, Obama just took the first step towards involving the US in the Syrian Civil war: arming the rebels.  Why?  Why else; Weapons of Mass Destruction (where have I heard this before?)  In this case, chemical weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemical weapons, BTW, are the least effective weaponry ever made.  Their only effectiveness has ever been due to the fear they generate.  As an example, WW I introduced chemical weapons to the battlefield on a wide scale.  Yet only 1 percent of all lives lost in WW I were due to chemical weapons.

       My bad; I thought you meant the current civil war here in America.  I know, technically there is no civil war.  But hasn't the government, by it's actions, declared war on all US citizens?  Sure seems like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was young (the 60's), the government helped citizens; collectively and individually.  I may have protested and bitched, but in the end I trusted the federal government to be sincere and make an effort, however much I disagreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I fear and mistrust our government.  Every intelligent person I know does as well.

       IMO the real problem is the government's budget. They have A LOT of money to spend (EDIT: however they want to with little oversight.) and there are many companies out there telling them how to spend it. This PRISM deal came about in the private sector, then the government bought into it.

       I'm refering to the power of words. The average American doesn't know that the CIA created Al-Qaeda, but they do know that Al-Qaeda has been bad guy #1 since 2001. Asking them to learn history from more than ten years ago is futile. So, by calling the rebels what rhey really are, and a boogey-man that they understand, helps to undermine the efforts of the West to paint them as "freedom fighters".

       They're losing. I'm pretty sure that's all that matters to the US government. They like to pick an underdog and use that as their foot-in-the-door to take over the country, install a central bank and a dummy democracy.

       I feel it.

      <p>
       I just posted the following on facebook:
      </p>
      <p>
       CBS news is reporting the Obama administration has determined the Assad government in Syria used chemical weapons, which was completely found to be false. The rebels, who we are secretly arming, used the chemicals. This is a major escalation of war. This is what the bad press and the leaks are all about. Pressure. Pipelinistan can't be completed until they get Syria. There will be blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is bad. The news is happening too fast right now. This feels like the elite trying to course correct. The narrative needs to shift big and it needs to shift fast. Snowden's leak went too far. This is a little too coincidental for my liking.

       i get where you're coming from, but at the same time, this story is something that is almost universally relatable. Whereas a lot of people used to think the gov't actually only used this tech to to catch terrorists, now they have it from "reputable" sources that the gov't has not only being lying to them, but collecting data from everyone. it could definitely be a distraction. i mean, it comes from the Guardian, and all of us "in the know" know that the UK is probably the center of it all, right?

       It is a story of a study that showed once the hundreth monkey had learned some new trick known by 99 other monkeys, suddenly the entire monkey population seemed to know the trick.  Scientists weren't able to explain it.

       What we are seeing, IMHO, is the build up of what may turn into global revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 taught many people how the global elites play us. They create the reality they need by staging events, give us the reasons why it happened via controlled media, then they are free to act as planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shit will hit the fan when we have our "Rulers" backed into a corner. The more corruption is exposed, the more we learn how it is that they are controlling this world. This is why Snowden is a fucking hero...this is why the elites call him a "traitor". Its become evident the people don't buy their governments word anymore...another step closer to the corner. They know it. People are starting to notice their desperation. It's obvious, they are starting to panic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tyranny is forever trying to gain control. It will always be a force we need to push back against...the Yin and the Yang. The world now realizes the the extent of the corruption. It's full blown. It's worldwide. I believe many people can sense the fuse is about to be lit.

       i get where you're coming from, but at the same time, this story is something that is almost universally relatable. Whereas a lot of people used to think the gov't actually only used this tech to to catch terrorists, now they have it from "reputable" sources that the gov't has not only being lying to them, but collecting data from everyone. it could definitely be a distraction. i mean, it comes from the Guardian, and all of us "in the know" know that the UK is probably the center of it all, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       but i guess the question is, what should we really be paying attention to?

      <p>
       There doesn't need to be a correlation between the two. These kinds of "T-word attacks" will continue to pop up here and there, most likely in different forms. The only reason for them is to justify a military and security presence. The military and political class has grown to unnecessarily large proportions. So when they don't have an enemy to stand against, they create one.

       I feel it too.  It's also like we're in some sort of bizarro alternate world too, Fringe-style almost, if that makes any sense.  It just feels like something major has shifted with this NSA stuff being revealed, that we're in uncharted/novel territory now...
      </p>

       I get the sense that we're in the calm before the storm, that we're all holding our breath because we sense that there has to be some sort of response now or change that needs to take place (which includes action taken by either "side").

       I think it is just a matter of momentum really-- people are kind of like a herd in that once enough people around them start acting, then they'll act too.  So once that tipping point is reached on a broad scale, then it should be exponential (well, hopefully anyway).

       I don't know.  I've gotten these gut feelings every once in a while, and I've also referred to it as my "spidy sense" as well.  But generally it has only worked as a BS detector when divining the truth of a story, and not so much as a predictor of future events.  I've stayed up late at night scared and sweating waiting for the hammer to drop and it never did when I expected it to.  But as a truth detector, instinct has worked great.

       I have no doubt there is something coming that will be used to deflect the shit storm that this NSA debacle has turned in to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its far too wide reaching, far too bipartisan and effects far too many people.  And people are actually standing up to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the scary part for the people who hope to quiet it down?  The fact that it seems this time we're not just going to let ourselves get easily distracted.  Its going to take something big to deflect this.  Thats my concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       If blaming the other party wont work, if just saying they'll look in to it wont work, and having the media release manipulative information wont work, what's left?
      </p>
      <p>
       Something will happen before we're made aware of the full scope of these intrusions, thats my gut feeling.  Or maybe its gas.

       Intuition comes from your data analysis of situations based on experiences you've had without you really realizing that you've done the analysis already. It's not some pseudo-scientific shit about EM waves and stuff.. please don't make your very legitimate claim become illegitimate because of these flawed premises.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that you're correct though. I mean, do distractions follow embarrassing events? Do you point out someone else's mistakes when your own are discovered?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your gut feelings are just analyses you've made from previous situations that you haven't acknowledged yet. Trusting your gut is almost always a good thing.

       Yeah but it doesn't take a gut feeling for how the Russians are going to react. After today's Obama BS. Putin is probably kicking over chairs now in the Kremlin. He already made it known that US military in Syria will be met with a counter of Russian presence. This will escalate even more as Assad will now be more bold with Russian troops at his side. Then what is Obama going to do when Russian troops are shooting at rebels and other village citizens.

       We are openly giving Syrian "rebels" (horribly general term) weapons and support now. Openly we admit it. Big step towards another cold war/ww3 to me almost as much as the twin towers going down and the war on terror starting. There are now so many different interests supporting different factions in Syria that I would consider it an actual open war zone for the big geopolitical powers.

       Intuition is just a word for that dopamine feeling we get when our minds string together ideas and extrapolate a sense of the situation from them. There is no doubt in my mind that big changes are coming. I can't really say with any certainty if they're good or bad because that's all subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say much for the Milky Way's EM but I can tell you that the Earth, particularly it's climate and the composition of it's ocean and atmosphere are changing are at frightening pace and nothing is being done to stop this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you that the population and particularly the population density of cities is also growing at a rapid pace. The implications for this with regard to things like resources, pollution and the large-scale impact of a viral pandemic are all on edging toward the brink of disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technology is accelerating at a parabolic velocity and with that many of the things we used to consider science fiction are quickly becoming a possibility. This one fact has the potential to render all other problems trivial but it also has the potential to make things a lot worse. It's a double-edged sword with a mind of its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking all of these things into account for context we can start talking about the political climate. Liberal young minds the world over now outnumber their elderly conservative parents and grandparents but we're expected to take care of them even as we change this world into something they wouldn't recognize and most likely fear. We may be naive or idealistic but we hold all the power now and we owe it to ourselves, our forefathers and our grandchild to make sure we don't fuck this up. We have a lot of lessons that we're going to have to learn and a lot of those lessons will come in the form of hard knocks. No doubt we're doing the best we can but that isn't to say that mistakes won't be made and that our grandchildren won't make equally disastrous mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This gut feeling is literally in your head but you aren't making it up. You know just like we all do that change is coming. Try harder to rationalize what is in your head before turning to your gut for answers. It's just telling you to think harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turkey Protests? Microshaft SpyBOne? Ed Snowden? Obama getting us involved with Syria? Don't kid yourself if he wasn't President we'd already be going to war with Iran ... either way Russia and China are fucking pissed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell yourself it's all just a coincidence and accept that even if they are all completely isolated incidents that they all relate anyway. You don't need your intuition to know what any of this means. The facts speak for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's something about where Edward Snowden chose to defect and why and this has me a little bit nervous. For years now the narrative in the United States has revolved around provoking China into a fight which is horrible because they actually depend on us just like we depend on them. There's only one reason we would ever attempt to ruin that: we know the ship is sinking. I think Ed Snowden knew what I've been suspecting for a while now. We're going to try to bankrupt them with war to propel ourselves out of this great depression we try so hard to cover up by pulling them into the crab pot as we try to scuttle our way out. He wants to be on the side that is not only going to win ... but is going to be in the right. The same people who are going to smear him now are trying going to try to smear the PRC for harboring him but that's all just the narrative we're being told and only scratches the surface of what's really going on. We want to rule over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we're balls-deep in Syria's ass I think Kim Jong-un might whip out his red rocket and join the party. Once you have Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States all gang banging each other then it's official: World Orgy III. The powers that be want it all to happen because they profit every step of the way. Entire continents who don't want to have anything to do with any of this are going to get dragged into it too because their hands will be tied just like the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had the power to I'd be packing my backs and getting the fuck outta Dodge but it's not going to matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to be a genius to know that shit's about to go down in a big way. We have the power to stop it but it will take a God damn miracle and you would really have to believe in sky daddies and pixie dust to think it isn't going to happen without a fight ... I for one am going to be busy worshiping technology because that's the only thing that gives me hope. Spirituality is for the blind and they're going to be lead by devils in sheep's clothing. If your guts telling you anything it's telling you to think before it's made illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit I do like to think about the little hocus pocus stuff that goes on in my head sometimes so for those of you who think this is all strictly spritual let me just translate all of the technical, logicky stuff for you: the NSA found out that clairvoyants are real and that we're onto them and they're trying to fight us but they're going to lose because evil sucks at magicks because their chakras are closed off to the collective lizard subconscious and our tarot, reiki astrology jesus chakras are open and will blast them into oblivion with care bear stares ... or AK47s ... I'm not really sure.
