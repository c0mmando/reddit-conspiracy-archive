       “The National Security law creating the National Security Council and the CIA, as you know, was passed in 1947.  The CIA was given its charter to perform such other duties and functions as might be necessary to national security interests and given a vague authority to protect its sources and methods.  I think it was in the mid ‘80s that I coined this phrase the ‘Third World War’ because in my research I realized that we were not attacking the Soviet Union in the CIA’s activities, we were attacking people in the Third World.  And I am going to just quickly, in the interest of time, just give you a little sense of what that means, this Third World War.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Basically, it’s the third, I believe in terms of loss of life and human destruction, the third bloodiest war in all of history.  They undertake to run operations in every corner of the globe.  They also undertook the license of operating just totally above and beyond U.S. laws.  They had a license, if you will, to kill, but also they took that to a license to smuggle drugs, a license to do all kinds of things to other people and other societies in violation of international law, our law, and every principle of nations working together for a healthier and more peaceful world.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Meanwhile, again, they battled to convert the U.S. legal system in such a way that it would give them control of our society.  Now we have massive documentation of what they call the secret wars of the CIA.  We don’t have to guess or speculate. We had the Church committee investigate them in 1975 which gave us our first really in-depth powerful look inside this structure.”

       I am so completely disappointed in Obama, he ran on a promise to end the wars and to provide transparency in government. Now he is enmeshing us in one country after another and signing into law the government that George Orwell predicted.

       I was having this discussion the other day on here with a guy, about how i thought he was genuine, and as soon as he got into office he realised how fucked everything was. The other guy disagreed, and said he was likely bullshitting all along, and was just a really fantastic public speaker, and an even better liar. I changed my mind. By the end of that discussion i thought he was right. No way did Obama not know what was going to happen; even if he's not in control, he plays his part in the game perfectly.

       I'd say that's a secondary motive. The main motive is still the same one that it's always been: oil. Syria might not have massive supplies itself, but it's essential for pipelines, and is also Iran's biggest ally. It would be sensible to knock out Iran's sidekick before taking on the man himself.

       This. It doesn't matter whether the oil physically goes to the US, just whether US companies get a nice slice of the pie. Not to mention that increased global supply is good for everyone, not just the country that new supply is being pumped into.

       There's debate about that. It's not like there would be fighting over actual oil, but i think the US was surprised by how unstable the country was, even right up to the point they pulled out. To me, the biggest indication that they had plans to stay was the
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       embassy complex that they built there. It's basically empty now.

       Methinks Israel's goal here is to oust Assad and crush Hezbollah in one fell swoop - bringing "order out of chaos" by installing an Israel-friendly puppet regime in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel HATES Assad. They want him gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is that Israel also HATES Hezbollah - the latter being likely to gain a serious foothold once the former is toppled - UNLESS the US intervenes with generous offerings of blood, toil and treasure to make sure that BOTH acquiesce to the new "democratically elected regime".
      </p>
      <p>
       But why is Obama playing along NOW? He's been dragging his feet the whole time, refusing Israel's demands that the US STOMP on Syria, and especially on Iran.

       invulnerable? That the tide of Public Opinion can be turned against him as those that control the media organs see fit?

       It's always about oil. Syria isn't the end goal here, Iran is. Although Syrian pipelines are important too. If you think (which seems to be the other strangely popular opinion around here) that the wars in the ME are all about appeasing Israel, you're the one who's misinformed.

       it is only as useful as the actions based on them.  since nothing is being done, yes it is useless.  if something where being done with the information the public has had for generations, you and i wouldn't be having this conversation for there would be no need for it.

       protesting is just complaining with signs. the NSA is still going to have access to all of your information. people have known since 2006.  you will get upset, you will colmplain, the media will do the bare minimum to cover it, a new atrocity will arise, you will forget, and nothing will be done by anyone.  look at that completely successful occupy protest.  that sent every wall street worker in the world to jail right?

       i think the only thing protesting has done, if anything, is give the government an opportunity to wash their hands of certain social issues.  see the civil rights movement and women's rights.  yes the government says it is illegal to discriminate based on sex and race, but it still happens everyday.  nothing was done by anyone. nothing will be done by anyone.

       Well yeah, there is still discrimination, but it is no where near as horrible as it used to be. Look at womens wages and how they have changed in the past 40 years. Look at the jobs held by minorities, and where they fit in to society. If you really think nothing has changed in those aspects you are completely blind to reality.

       i would say marginally better.  the bigger picture is that the best protesting has ever done was slightly stem the tide of discrimination.  that is it's only real victory in america. it's like listening to a losing team cheer because they didn't lose as much this year.  also, don't fail to keep in mind how horribly inept society becomes at resisting as time passes.  the tea party and occupy movements are prime examples of what you have to work with if you plan on actually doing something.

       that is the issue though.  if we project the amount of "change" those protest created onto any further protest, you don't get the world you want.  historically monsanto will still poison your food, though not as much, wall street will steal your money, though not as much, the government will  steal your information, though not as much.  the powers that be will only change enough for you to stop protesting, they aren't going to change enough to be what you want though.
