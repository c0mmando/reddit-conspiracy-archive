<p>When I asked you how you would &#39;reduce heart disease by throwing money at it&#39;, you refused to answer - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1glj35/who_cares_if_the_nsa_stopped_supposedly_50/calq0b7">Here</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same way they treat cancer!  They throw lots of money at it....yet never do anything about it!  98% of all Cancer funds generated end up in the foundations pockets!  Only about 2%MAX is ever received towards Cancer!   There where multiple threads about the misuse of &quot;FUNDING&quot; last week in this area!    So in all reality....no one should fund anything and then maybe they will creat a few cures for things....but since they make so much money on fundraising they will never come up with a cure for anything..... What was it that was last cured anyways? Polio....and where done!</p>

<p>The problem with most of the people that you assume aren&#39;t welcome here because they are &quot;skeptical of conspiracy theories&quot;, is that they can not resist screaming RETARD and ANTISEMITE every time they get into a debate with someone here.</p>

<p>This clearly violates the rules of the sub, and it is because of people like that, that the mods have had to resort to banning these accounts.  I have NEVER banned an account for a difference in opinion.</p>

<p>I am a mod here and I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; in 99% of the theories proposed in this subreddit.  That doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t participate in the discussion without being a flaming cock sucker to everyone who does believe.</p>
