       Even if the majority of these accounts are duplicates, shills and trolls that's still a good thing.

       What it means is that they're forced to spend time and attention on us.

       Same way they treat cancer!  They throw lots of money at it....yet never do anything about it!  98% of all Cancer funds generated end up in the foundations pockets!  Only about 2%MAX is ever received towards Cancer!   There where multiple threads about the misuse of "FUNDING" last week in this area!    So in all reality....no one should fund anything and then maybe they will creat a few cures for things....but since they make so much money on fundraising they will never come up with a cure for anything..... What was it that was last cured anyways? Polio....and where done!

       Amazing logic. So we shouldn't fund anything until it fixes an issue? But without the funding, how can incredibly difficult issues like cancer be fixed?

       That said, you sounded a bit hostile and I didn't really feel like getting berated by someone I think might be an ideologue. I don't really mind being wrong. I just don't like getting bitched at for it. I mean - you stalked me from one post to another. That tells me something about your mentality.

       You can also see that I spent several paragraphs on another poster.

       I answered his questions because he was polite and thoughtful.

       I'm fickle and weird. It cannot be helped.

       Skeptics are welcome here, I happen to be a fan of wilwheatonfan for example.  He is a debunker but he doesn't resort to insults and accusations of antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with most of the people that you assume aren't welcome here because they are "skeptical of conspiracy theories", is that they can not resist screaming RETARD and ANTISEMITE every time they get into a debate with someone here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This clearly violates the rules of the sub, and it is because of people like that, that the mods have had to resort to banning these accounts.  I have NEVER banned an account for a difference in opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a mod here and I don't "believe" in 99% of the theories proposed in this subreddit.  That doesn't mean that I can't participate in the discussion without being a flaming cock sucker to everyone who does believe.

       Yeah, Im not promoting it, but when i came to reddit on my original account about 16 months ago there was an unbelievable amount of antisemetic, holocaust-denying, master-race spouting bs around. I kind of forgot about it actually. What changed? Jew mods take over?

       This did make me think of a post i wanted to make recently that i typed out, submitted, and lost due to, "you're posting too fast, shut up." gonna go do that now.

       The anti-semitism is a bit of a drag.

       Fortunately, they're a minority and are easily snubbed.

       You just remind them that they're being racist assholes; they hate being called out.
