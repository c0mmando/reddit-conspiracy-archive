        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi everyone. I&#39;ve been reading colonial America history. I believe today&#39;s issues requires being informed and a decent attempt at understanding history. I found something very interesting during my readings.</p>

<p>The <strong>Townshend Acts</strong> is a group of laws, prompted by hatred/dislike over the writs of assistance. The writs of assistance were basically warrants (or general warrants) authorized by tax collectors. Even if you did nothing wrong, if your neighbor smuggled goods to avoid taxes, you could get searched just because. Probable cause was not needed.</p>

<p>Either way. The recent Boston Bombing resonated. Read this quote, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Acts">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Townshend Acts were met with resistance in the colonies, prompting the occupation of Boston by British troops in 1768, which eventually resulted in the Boston Massacre of 1770.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>During the Boston Massacre, troops quartered the homes and then the massacre occurred. During the Boston Bombing, a &quot;massacre&quot; occurred first, and then law enforcement forced themselves onto homes, martial-law-wise.</strong></p>

<p>Coincidence? Doesn&#39;t matter. But history does repeat itself for those who don&#39;t know. Except our ancestors didn&#39;t put up with that shit! Somehow, we do. </p>

<p>Anyway, just my 2 cents of history. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to come up with an intelligent response to this, but I&#39;ve got nothing. How you can equate a several year military occupation of a city that eventually caused tensions leading to a riot that lead to several accidental deaths and was ultimately propagandized to support a revolution, to a terrorist attack followed by a manhunt which lead to searches of a large number of homes, is basically beyond me. There are basically minor details in common. </p>

<p>Yes, over time familiar patterns of events may unfold, but if you&#39;re going to be this bad at finding these patterns, you may as well not bother.</p>

<p>Of course, since you&#39;re convinced that the searches conducted for the Boston Bomber were illegal, and more importantly, evil, you don&#39;t really care what I have to say. If you could find some convoluted way to tie them to Holocaust, you would, except you probably think the Holocaust is capitalist propaganda created by Zionist media.</p>

<p>The reality is that when a guy who may or may not have explosives is running around, and there is reason to believe he may be within a certain populated area, you need to search everywhere. If Joe Schmoe decides that he isn&#39;t going to let the police search his home, there are any number of reasons that this complicates things - what if the target of the manhunt has snuck into the dwelling, or is holding Joe&#39;s family hostage and forcing him to keep the police out, or hell, what if Joe is an accomplice? Okay, so the last is a stretch, but the previous two were very real concerns - hence the barging in uninvited.</p>

<p>Of course this doesn&#39;t fit the &#39;narrative&#39; of most r/conspiracy posters, so what do any of you care? (Though, newsflash, just because you can build a narrative around events does not mean that that explanation for events is more logically sound - life is not Castle, as much as I enjoy Nathan Fillion)</p>

<p>I simply shared a little observation on Boston&#39;s history. This wasn&#39;t meant to be a &quot;pattern&quot; or a newsflash or a &quot;OMG&quot; sort of thing. What are you trying to prove to me? Relax, you&#39;re being wayyyy too critical over my post. The 2 events have zero relevance to one another. Like I said, I just wanted to share this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like you hit a shill nerve.</p>

<p>I have been wondering lately, as madness grips my psyche, on the concept of time and temporal illusions. James Holmes participated in a DARPA program directly related to this, as well as retroactive collusion, prior to his participation in the Colorado theatre shooting. What if time is not real, and history is literally repeating itself on a macrocosmic level, and we see incidents that bear striking resemblances to eachother?</p>

<p>You should definitely check out some of Terrence McKenna&#39;s work. 
<a href="http://www.fractal-timewave.com/">Its a bit focused on Dec. 2012 as was most things prior to that date, but still interesting in a general sense in that time is static and all events occur simultaneously..</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is likely a sockpuppet account for a troll based on the fact that it is fresh, and the name is literally a random set of characters.  Also notice how he alludes to the fact that he often reads posts here and wants to come across as experienced and credible in his statements, but he has only been registered for 4 days?  Sounds fishy if you ask me.  Especially when you can look at any front page post on this sub and the lowest voted comments are usually all from 0-3 day old accounts, completely lacking substance or outright attacking the sub or it&#39;s members.  I have also noticed a lot of &quot;violent&quot; themed posts that fall under this category as of late which is troubling.</p>

<p>Why would there be &quot;shills&quot; on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? Because this subreddit is basically <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> uncensored, and our subscriber count is steadily growing every day as more and more people realize that the system of governance most of us fall under is a scam.  This would frighten anyone in a postition of power enough I would think, to spend the pittance required to try and <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/22/1112509/-The-Gentleperson-s-Guide-to-Forum-Spies">change the narrative if they didn&#39;t agree with it.</a></p>

<p><em>The IDF does it all the time</em>, why wouldn&#39;t the DHS, CIA, FBI, or any branch of the Military?  Don&#39;t even get me started on corporations gaming reddit to improve the online image of their products.  Because we can all see that just browsing the front page for 20 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Do I think the account we are talking about is a paid government agent?</strong>  Not really. While it is possible, it is more likely a member of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> (or something similar) just doing what those jackasses do &quot;best&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This subreddit requires people to subscribe to post, so of course your subscriber count is up. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t have a main account. I deleted my original account when I realized I was adjusting what I was saying if I was worried it might lose karma. When I want to post, I make a new account - I don&#39;t even remember the password on this one, so sooner or later I&#39;ll be logged out of it and I&#39;ll start a new one when I have something else to say.</p>

<p>Am I trolling? I&#39;m not trying to. I do find this subreddit to be fairly ludicrous though. Why have I posted here? Because it&#39;s pointless discussing things with people I already agree with.</p>

<p>And even in the case of genuine shills, it shouldn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re shills or not. If you don&#39;t discredit their argument, then you&#39;re just dodging the actual issue. Crying shill at anyone who disagrees or thinks your a dumbass is meaningless. You should be trying to prove them wrong, not prove that they&#39;re a plant.</p>
