I only know a couple Jewish people, but really i don&#39;t know anything about the religion or race specifically. I know the racist clich√© about money. When i first saw <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> i got in an argument with some dude i labeled in my head as a neo-nazi. He was denying the holocaust, and i maintained reason while trying to argue with him...he did too. Neither of us were sourcing, but we were having an intelligent conversation about conspiracy theories and whatnot. One thing that he said that really stuck out in my mind was that you could read in the census from Germany and surrounding countries that there weren&#39;t anywhere close to 6M Jews, for lack of a better word, available to be killed. I started looking for these censuses that he was talking about, but i wasn&#39;t sure if i was finding something legitimate or not. I have known people that act like Hitler did so much good, &quot;hurr durr Volkswagen!; mmhmm mmhmm heart surgery, all of our medical tech.&quot; Im not about that, but i was raised in America, the side that won the war, and we know who writes history. I don&#39;t know why, but its been a subject that scared me to research in the past, because of the possible answers i could find i guess. Anyway, enough of my preambles and prologues. I&#39;m interested in these types of theories or facts. I don&#39;t care what your beliefs about religion are right now. Can you prove anything to me? Even if you can&#39;t prove it, got any theories you feel hold water?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s times like these that I wish my grandfather had lived long enough to see the Internet and Reddit.</p>

<p>His AMA here would have been amazing.</p>

<p>He was a German immigrant who served in the US Army during WWII (and in fact had left Germany because of the Nazis in the late 1920s), fighting in Africa against Rommel, and then up through Italy, etc. He didn&#39;t even know if he was killing his own family members or not, and it was always something that bothered him.</p>

<p>Oh the stories he had about what he witnessed and did during that war would probably make your skin crawl.</p>

<p>And yes, there was a Holocaust. He also always said the Jewish numbers were inflated and the numbers of handicapped, Romany, gays, atheists, leftists, etc under-inflated. He said the total number may have been 6 million with ALL groups included, but was more likely closer to 3 or 4, and that we will simply never know because of the actions of Stalin and the Russian army during and after the war (Russia was quick to block any access whatsoever to camps in territory controlled by them, and many official documents from that period have never been allowed access to any scholars, etc outside of the Russian Politburo.)</p>

<p>For their part, the Waffen-SS was also extremely efficient in burning most of the documents containing any official tabulated numbers from the camps. What we have left is best guesstimates made by scholars and government researchers over the years based on only partial evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the medical records that have been released by Russia, there was a rampant typhus epidemic that started in spring of &#39;42, maybe due to conditions at the camps, but more likely brought in by ghetto denizens.  Within a few months, tens of thousands of inmates were dying of this horrific disease each month.  They tried to get it under control by shaving the inmates heads to get rid of lice, and by delousing the clothing with Zyklon-B (this is where the &quot;gas chamber&quot; myth got started).  But Allied bombing campaigns had destroyed German infrastructure to the point that medicines weren&#39;t readily available.  </p>

<p>Typhus is a terrible disease, that causes vomiting and diarrhea, and the related high fever---108 degrees F is not uncommon---makes the person boil to death in their own skin over a period of 4-8 weeks.  When you see pix of emaciated inmates, it&#39;s not because they were starved, it&#39;s because they were unable to keep food and water down.  Typhus is much worse than the supposed gas chambers ever could have been.</p>

<p>Its more than okay to question the status quo, and question why history is written the way it is and even if it has been changed to fit an agenda. That being said, &#39;holocaust denial&#39; and &#39;intelligent conversation&#39; belong nowhere near each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, a little more info than what i actually posted: he was saying to compare the censuses from before and after the war, and that there weren&#39;t 6M less. I agree that denying the holocaust isn&#39;t part of an intelligent conversation, but denying the &quot;facts&quot; about it isn&#39;t the same as just denying it. I think we&#39;re agreeing with each other. Also, from some other comments it seems to me that the 6M(as in Jew only) number is a blatant fallacy. All that does is bring more questions though.</p>

<p>you&#39;re talking about comments from a sub that mostly anti-Israel (doesn&#39;t necessarily have to do with our conversation, but i digress) and quite often anti-Semitic. If i were you i would refrain from making assumptions  on the subject based solely on the responses you got from the reddit conspiracy sub. Did any of the responses you got contain any reputable sources, because all im seeing are websites that are well known for their holocaust denial or anti-semitism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone in here posted 2 pictures of a plaque at auschwitz. The old one said 4M died there, and the new one said around 1.5M died there, yet the 6M number never changed. There&#39;s also a blog post that someone posted in here with a bunch of sources(that i haven&#39;t checked myself) about there being no real evidence of gas chambers having been used. That blog post was in the same comment as a bunch of other links, a couple of which i started reading, but found too biased to take as legitimate. I&#39;m not taking everything as fact that i read, but i feel like i have to read the side biased &quot;against the Jews&quot; since everything I&#39;ve ever heard or read was biased the other way. It seems impossible to find a real discussion on the matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>well the first picture makes no mention of Auschwitz, the bricks in the background look similar, but without a source its hard to know where that came from or if its even real. Having said that, even if 6 million Jews were actually killed in the holocaust, its hard to believe that 4 million of them died in one place. I would say the second plaque is certainly more accurate, and that number is backed up even by the US Holocaust Museum.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, i don&#39;t think that the plaque in the first picture is real. If someone could prove it was in fact real at some point, i would be more than willing to acknowledge that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s wikipedia, and you could argue it&#39;s validity but a few quick Google searches and here&#39;s what i found: <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp</a></p>

<p>I believe around 1990 the first sign was removed and replaced, possibly on a different wall. I&#39;m on my phone so i have trouble linking to a specific section. It was under the &quot;death toll&quot; part. If you read it, it says that historians never really believed the 4M number. Most estimates from my past few minutes of research say somewhere between 900K and 1.1M died there. It also states that these numbers do not justify a change in the 6M number, because that came from German documents and not from adding together the extermination camps death tolls. It says that that is a common claim from holocaust deniers to try and make historians look like they&#39;re lying.</p>

<p>So, i don&#39;t think the 6M number is a blatant fallacy as i said previously, but i still wonder what kind of things we don&#39;t know. It does make sense after some of the reading I&#39;ve done to talk about this holocaust over the 25-30M holocaust in the context of it nearly eradicating a race/religion. I&#39;d like to see the holocaust denying laws repealed, and I&#39;d like to be able to have an intelligent conversation about all this stuff. I&#39;d like the NSA to quit watching me too though. I think it&#39;s possible to get to the bottom of it all if it was all in the open. The part that makes me suspicious is the fact that some places it&#39;s illegal to talk about it. I&#39;m not saying Jews rule the world, but as i stated here elsewhere i do feel they are overrepresented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, someone else provided another link that seemed relatively reputable, that stated the sign in question did in fact exist at Auschwitz around the early 90&#39;s. </p>

<p>But i asked him, where the 4 million number came from? Was it put there by the Polish government or a Jewish group? im not really sure, but it doesn&#39;t seem like an official number. As i also mentioned to him that the US Holocaust Memorial Museum lists the Jewish deaths at Auschwitz at under 1 million, yet they still maintain that the number of Jewish deaths during the entirety of the Holocaust is around 5.7 million.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, i know it wasn&#39;t just the Jews, and Im not particularly looking for holocaust denying stuff. Like i said, it&#39;s a whole category of conspiracy theories i skipped over for comfort i guess. It&#39;s convenient to look at Hitler as the #1 evil guy ever and use him for comparisons. I really don&#39;t know anything about Jews either good or bad. I&#39;ve seen folks getting really angry that no one talks about the other holocausts, the ones that killed ~5x more people than the German/Jewish one. That&#39;s where the numbers matter in some minds. If 6M is printed in every American history book, why don&#39;t they say anything about the 30M holocaust? Im not saying that would change any facts of the 6M holocaust. Did anyone keep a neutral journal of the ordeal? All they taught me in school is he killed 6M, there were big piles of shoes and watches, Anne Frank, and he pussed out and suicided. Seriously, that&#39;s all i remember from school. Also, it is called THE holocaust. The 30M one - i don&#39;t even know if that has a name, and i couldn&#39;t even tell you the guys name that did it. We all know who Hitler was though. He was the biggest evil ever to come to this planet, and Murica democratized his ass. Geez, been up drinking coffee all day and Im getting ranty the past few hours. Hitler did do those good things i mentioned in my original post. I&#39;ve seen some shows on the history channel about Nazi technology. All I&#39;ve seen are theories. I&#39;m actually planning on doing some research about Judaism itself too. I was raised a Christian and my family talked bad about Jews. I just don&#39;t know shit about them, and i want to. Another thing that I&#39;ve heard but don&#39;t know is that we created Israel right after ww2. Kinda weird since the country that got the land taken from it wasn&#39;t Germany. Did we really delete all the history we didn&#39;t want seen? If so, why?</p>

One thing I&#39;ve come to learn is that America has permanent interests, never permanent friends.  Our foreign policy is based on what we can get out of it for the given situation.  Which is why I think a lot of other mass-killings on that scale are overlooked or ignored.  I don&#39;t know.  Look at Africa and the latest tragedies over the last couple decades.  Why didn&#39;t we intervene there?  Why not go after Kony? </p>

<p>For instance, I find it terribly ironic that we trained Bin Laden in the 80&#39;s to help drive out the Soviet Union.  Or how we backed Saddam Hussein during the Iraq-Iran war.  We created the very thing the so-called war on terror is fighting.  Yet what our politicians blatantly choose to ignore (or just don&#39;t give a shit, narcissism at its finest), is that if you come to my land and mess with my people, you&#39;re going to get a justified foot in the ass. </p>

<p>Particularly in the wake of this NSA debacle, I find it even more disturbing what the news outlets choose to cover; notice the glaring lack of discussion about it.  Notice the national apathy that is drowning out the real anger about it.  The sleight of hand to distract gen-pop.  But, there&#39;s only so much time for so many sound bytes that sell corporate ads.  What will wip the population in to a patriotic frenzy?  I think it largely comes down to mass-manipulation and control.  Create a status-quo whether legitimate or fabricated, disagree or question it and you&#39;re tagged as a trouble maker.  It&#39;s a statist sort of thing I suppose.</p>

<p>Check out the documentary - Why We Fight, <a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/whywefight">www.sonyclassics.com/whywefight</a>.  In it, then president Dwight Eisenhower even warns of the rising military industrial complex and the rest of the film shows just how it slipped neatly in to place in the years following WW2.  War sells, peace doesn&#39;t.  Citizen, pick up that can. :)  </p>

<p>Millions more Christians died but we barely hear a peep about it. Its rather obvious that Jews took advantage of the Holocaust. One negative word about the Jews and BAM your an anti-semetic for the rest of your life. Just look at Reddit, thousands of posts bashing on Christians and hardly anyone bats an eye.

<p>millions more Christians died, but the percentage of the Jewish population that died was exponentially larger than the percentage of the Christian population that died. That likely has a lot to do with why you barely hear a peep about it.</p>

<p>what i would like to know, and something i didn&#39;t find in your article, is who is providing that number? I could be wrong but it doesn&#39;t seem as if that is the official number, but one just spouted by someone (as you have stated) trying to inflate the numbers. Because the US Holocaust Memorial Museum estimates the number of Jewish deaths at Auschwitz less than one million, yet they still maintain the number of Jewish deaths is somewhere close to 5.7 million. </p>

<p>but you haven&#39;t proven that 4 million was the &#39;original&#39; number. You gave me an article that stated some Jewish historian (who&#39;s legitimacy im not questioning) saw somewhere people or possibly Jews claiming 4 million people died at Auschwitz. What you provided me with is nothing more than hearsay. What you have proven is that at one point there was a sign in Auschwitz that read &quot;4 million people died here&quot; and you are correct, that is obviously false. But we don&#39;t know who put that sign there, it could have been the Polish government for all we know, nor do we know where they (who ever placed the sign) got that number from. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Jews grossly inflated the number of deaths</p>

<p>this is a gross generalization, &quot;the Jews&quot; did no such thing, specific Jews or specific Jewish groups may have. There is a major distinction.</p>
