    <div class="md"><p>If it was someone like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_the_Jackal">Carlos the Jackal</a> attacking Israel, or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod_Airport_massacre">Japanese Red Army</a> group, then it makes sense that you wouldn&#39;t want violence initiated against them. But when Palestinians &quot;attack&quot; Israel, its because they want their land back. By land, i am not even referring to &quot;country&quot;. But the individual pieces of land that individual families lived on or owned. Their children inherit that land, instead they squalor in tiny strip of land such as Gaza, or the increasingly-tiny strip of land the West Bank, while thousands more squalor in refugee camps throughout the middle-east. Many have died in the conflicts of Lebanon, Syria and Iraq caught in the cross-fire. The apartheid and the increasing settlements don&#39;t help the ones living in Palestine either, not to mention the raids and airstrikes.</p>

<p>I believe that acts of violence on both sides are wrong. </p>

<p>Israel is wrong for stealing land, and some Palestinians are wrong for engaging in acts of violence. </p>

<p>I am not sure how to resolve this, but violence doesn&#39;t help anyone and it just makes your side look bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re sounding like the mainstream liberal/progressives, who always condemn &quot;violence from both sides&quot;. When in reality, the ratio of the violence from both sides is extremely disproportionate. It is largely one-sided (hundreds to thousands dying on the Pali side, with only a few dozen at most on the Israeli side). And that&#39;s not even touching Israel/Zionist&#39;s lobbies influence on America and the West (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident">USS Liberty</a>, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/adl-spies-the-strange-history-of-the-anti-defamation-league/5338994">ADL spying scandal</a>, &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm">A Clean Break</a>&quot;, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews settling in quick bursts is seen as a simple news item and not policy.  Then it settles down for a while and they do it again.  Those Jews are gaming the world outrage system.  The status quo is that this continues until the entire area has been made Israeli territory.  Meanwhile the weak people fight with their weak weapons and the strong people fight with their strong weapons.  Somehow the strong side always has moral and material support of powerful powers around the world.  The weak side doesn&#39;t have anything material to bargain with and in the international banking feudalistic sense Israel can borrow and broker using other peoples land as collateral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Palestinians for a long time have not intentionally targeted civilians. In the past during the first Intifada, the PFLP and other leftist groups did target civilians, but those groups barely even have support anymore even among Palestinians (who largely turned nationalist or islamist). Today, the most likely cause of civilians deaths is the rocket fire (from islamist), which is actually a (in)direct consequence of the Partition Wall that surrounds most Palestinians territories. I am not &#39;justifying&#39; violence, merely pointing out that it is inevitable when people are so desperate. The Israelis never receive their fair share of the blame. If you wanted violence to stop from one side, it needs to be stopped from the other. And that started with the Israelis who first invaded/occupied Palestine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a little late now.</p>

<p>Supporting the dismantling of the Jewish state would make no sense at this point and is probably a misdirection campaign.</p>

<p>While there are huge issues with how things were done, <del>the Israeli government is now actively buying Palestinians&#39; land, or paying them for it,</del> or whatever - which is what the ultra-super-orthodox who were living there and oppose the Jewish state have been doing since time immemorial.</p>

<p>So at this point it&#39;s just a matter of figuring out what the proper development of the already existing Jewish state is and how to compensate those wronged.</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry, got my facts wrong - the claim crossed out above is, unfortunately, blatantly incorrect.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is correct. My mistaken notion stemmed from misreading <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-05/19/c_132393199.htm">this article</a> about IDF returning some land... I had assumed this was much more general.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still of the opinion that it&#39;s too late and all that&#39;s left to do now is figure out how to run that government ethically, so as to avoid &quot;the American problem&quot; (house of cards/emperor&#39;s new clothes syndrome).</p>

<p>That said, those american dollars are more like a burden these days, considering their negative worth (in any sane economic valuation). You should be thanking them for holding some of those toxic assets for you (and anyone else who buys american dollars).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was someone like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_the_Jackal">Carlos the Jackal</a> attacking Israel, or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod_Airport_massacre">Japanese Red Army</a> group, then it makes sense that you wouldn&#39;t want violence initiated against them. But when Palestinians &quot;attack&quot; Israel, its because they want their land back. By land, i am not even referring to &quot;country&quot;. But the individual pieces of land that individual families lived on or owned. Their children inherit that land, instead they squalor in tiny strip of land such as Gaza, or the increasingly-tiny strip of land the West Bank, while thousands more squalor in refugee camps throughout the middle-east. Many have died in the conflicts of Lebanon, Syria and Iraq caught in the cross-fire. The apartheid and the increasing settlements don&#39;t help the ones living in Palestine either, not to mention the raids and airstrikes.</p>
