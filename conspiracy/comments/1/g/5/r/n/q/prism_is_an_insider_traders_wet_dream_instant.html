<p>This makes some feel more comfortable, but the truth is if a choke point is controlled any communucation that goes through it is compromised. Point is, these companies can be completely honest with us about what they share, and the NSA still gets it through other means. You can bet they havr hardware for cracking SSL when needed too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ooh another one! Thanks, I was making a mental list in my head of ways the &quot;powers that be&quot; can use this mega data base. I already concluded they can squash any scandal related to Monsanto and Pharmaceutical companies but now we can add a lucrative email spy operation in order to make money.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of funny really, everyone is very upset because they feel the NSA is spying on them but I really think that&#39;s just a by product, the real issue is controlling the flow and output of information in order to control every conceivable variable so they don&#39;t lose their control. At this point what keeps them from intercepting and responding to emails? Could really fuck some shit up that way if you wanted. Frankly you cannot unbake this cake, it never will be private to use electronic communication again, if it ever even was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no.  It is undoubtedly the newest form of getting screwed by the market makers, but a lot of HFT firms actually hold longer term positions, it&#39;s just not as widely known.  SAC Capital, for instance, has been embroiled in insider trading investigations (federal pinch) for the past few years, while largely deriving its value from HFT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must be confused, anyone can hold anything for however long they want to, regardless of the methodology used. However, high frequency trading takes place within a time period and a level of access that is not afforded to regular folk. It&#39;s not high frequency trading to hold a stock for a long time. It&#39;s high frequency trading to make millisecond decisions regarding your long term position. </p>

<p>HFT is what I said it was. They don&#39;t get credits from exchanges for creating liquidity, in fact, they usually pay the exchanges for special network access. It is true that the exchanges tout the benefit in increased liquidity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Confused, perhaps, but more likely poorly explained.  HFT is HFT, it&#39;s trading at incredibly fast speeds (usually through colo facilities).  No argument there.  What some HFT firms do (however) is use HFT as a means of amassing positions whilst making it appear to be part of an algo.</p>

<p>The rebates (I said credits) undoubtedly exist, search &quot;HFT liquidity rebate.&quot; From Investopedia: &quot;As an incentive to the firm, the NYSE pays a fee or rebate for providing said liquidity. As of 2009, the SLP rebate was $0.0015. Multiply that by millions of transactions per day and you can see where part of the profits for high frequency trading comes from.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s trading being done by an algo, it&#39;s algo trading. Even if you hold it for a long time. I don&#39;t think anyone actually ever though that trading houses gave the entire keys to kingdom to algos. </p>

<p>Trading done by a HF machine on a HF network through the HF platform, is HF trading. </p>

<p>I imagine the SLP rebates must be a sort of a wash considering the expense of the trading platforms and the fees they must pay to access them. And I&#39;m not sure that every HFTer is an SLP. Didn&#39;t know about that, thanks for the link. </p>

<p>My point was that any high frequency trade inherently rests upon a timeframe and a location that is unknown or inaccessible to the regular population. I think this demonstrates how the effectiveness of HFT is tied to the speeds the systems can achieve, and their proximity to the exchange network. Meaning the benefits generated HFT (as opposed to benefits which could be obtained via other trading methods) are due solely to those two factors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have no idea if it ends up being a wash, I just know that it&#39;s formally encouraged.  Additionally, it is undoubtedly to a huge advantage to the big boys, and the inside crew due to the huge amounts of capital and connections necessary to get in.  In other words, I couldn&#39;t agree more.  However, we are talking about securities exchanges, so it&#39;s not like the &quot;rich get richer&quot; is anything new.  </p>

<p>The real thing that&#39;s scary still goes back to the Fed, and the funny money in the economy.  We have no trace of trillions...and I have no doubt this money is being put to use.  The other side is, without oil, the dollar is no longer sacrosanct.  With much of the rest of the world in slow alignment against our policies, this is turning into an international dispute that may go live.  </p>

<p>On the financial side, our government has set the precedent to honor all kinds of fraudulent contracts, and a quadrillion dollars in derivative swaps that are just waiting for the next big crisis to happen to get activated.  If you think we have inequality now, watch the Fed cut the money supply, interest rates and inflation go through the roof simultaneously, and only the connected get bailed out (2008, but worse).  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, we&#39;re stuck in a police state (and the police will continue to get inflation adjusted payments, so continued subservience is to be expected), with the full NSA surveillance structure in place while we&#39;re stuck with with poisonous food and drones ready to go if they spot the organization of dissenters.  Think it&#39;s far fetched? Take the treatment of Afghanistan and Iraq and put it on our land.</p>

<p>What scares me is when Bill Binney (who was instrumental in building the systems) says we&#39;re &#39;this close&#39; to a totalitarian state.</p>

<p>I am not so sure that this is true.  Look at FX and the amount of USD that is traded every day.  Even if the USD rapidly deflates, I think it would be challenging to dump all that currency.</p>

<p>I used to think that oil gave the USD its power.  Now I am almost certain the US military gives the USD its power.  People need oil, so it is a good commodity to pin the dollar to as the demand for oil is high.  USA can use the full force of the military to enforce the rules of Big Business, Inc. in whatever markets may be necessary; especially when you consider interesting information like the number of US military bases around the world, and little project called Gladio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That, is a very good point.</p>

<p>However, the sheer dollar volume in oil the oil commodity trade is enormous.  The only commodities that end up in the same kind of strategic, or value importance are food (production capabilities are not as easily controlled) and industrial metals (value is not quite as high).</p>

<p>We&#39;ll have the weapons, but without the oil backing, there isn&#39;t quite the need for the dollar (except for our advanced armaments).</p>

<p>However, I have not put nearly as much thought into this as necessary.  I am more than interested to hear alternatives that could fill the position (especially considering our industrial capacity has been thoroughly offshored).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but food is produced...everywhere.  Oil is produced in select territory.  Something like 95% of the GMO food is produced in the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and India (ie. the US and its colonies).  The stuff has been run out of the rest of the world.  Oil is also a &#39;point&#39; commodity, not a dispersed commodity.  You can control the territory it sits on with guns much, much easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Water is also similar to food, and is an issue of national security.  It&#39;s not as much a point resource as oil is in that all of the water couldn&#39;t be effectively locked by a small group so easily (there&#39;s no massive resource needed to acquire it, and...rain).  Water is bought in local currency around the world, and I don&#39;t think we could afford the implements to keep it under control.  Under our current environmental/business paradigm, we are definitely heading towards a scarcity situation, but that and dollar strength aren&#39;t necessarily correlated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more with everything you&#39;ve written. Spot on. </p>

<p>I think they are multiplying the social angles as well. I couldn&#39;t believe the NRA speech a month or so ago. The media is creating a class of people that are going to be ready (and excited) to fight against the totalitarian gov&#39;t with their own arms. Of course this is a fool&#39;s errand, nevertheless the NRA is encouraging it as if it was a divine duty among southern and midwesterners. In the end, it will be the fuel they use to justify the behavior of the police state as they clamp down upon the rest of us. </p>

<p>As always, I believe non-violence is the answer. That doesn&#39;t get you very far around here as there is a significant militant attitude that pervades this subreddit. The irony being this attitude is as cultivated by the elite as much as the obama &#39;circlejerk&#39; in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multiple social angles --&gt; divide and conquer??</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t be surprised.  The left-right fracturing (while false), is true because people believe it.  So the game is played.</p>

<p>I&#39;m am for gun rights, but I am against &#39;armed revolution&#39; in that sense.  Non-violent struggle has ended up ending governments over and over again.  It makes it clear who is the oppressor, and who is the oppressee.  It will mean that people will have their skulls cracked, and I might end up being one of them, whether just, or unjust.  Sadly, this game will be played as long as there are at least three people (I don&#39;t think we can get away from this sentimentality, it is the human condition, but we must follow where our souls guide us, and I think many things going on are wrong).</p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of a reformed liberal, now libertarian, but a libertarian who believes in the removal of corporate personhood.  Campaign finance, and all kinds of &#39;liberal&#39; reforms go back to an axiom, a &#39;corporation&#39; is the responsible body, not the operators and owners of the corporate entity.  If they did wrong, the liberal institutions kept the game going by adding another layer of &#39;safety&#39; (and another chance to blame someone lower in the organization) rather than pushing the more harsh reality.  Send them to jail. They&#39;ve committed crimes, and cost people&#39;s lives.  In a just world, selling carcinogenic food gets people sent to jail for life (Monsanto execs should be in jail, not in the White House, Chris Hedges hit the nail on the head recently saying the criminal class is in power).  </p>

<p>Smoking an herb that makes someone lazy (at worst), maybe prevents them from earning greater material wealth.  Instead, we are enriching the poisoners, and imprisoning organic relaxation.  We had a prohibition and it helped create an unjust society in the name of &#39;safety.&#39; Sadly, this is the real world.  </p>

<p>For the division of corporate personhood, it comes right out of the 14th amendment. But it can easily be seen as the core to major violations of the Bill of Rights, corruption of government, monetary policy, and on and on down the line.  The devolution of individual responsibility, combined with the good old evil of big finance, and the statist predisposition for control has gotten us where every wealthy society has ever ended up: fat, happy, fearful and out of control.  The combination of Adulous Huxley&#39;s and Orwell&#39;s most feared society.</p>

<p>If we didn&#39;t have 23 million people on food stamps, we would have riots in the streets.  The Chinese have rioted for centuries on the basis of pork prices.  $4B just got cut from the program. We have some interesting days ahead.</p>
