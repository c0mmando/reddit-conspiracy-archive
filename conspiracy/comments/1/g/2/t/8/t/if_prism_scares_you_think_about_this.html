<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A</a></p>

<p>&quot;
<strong>Room 641A is a telecommunication interception facility operated by AT&amp;T for the U.S. National Security Agency that commenced operations in 2003 and was exposed in 2006.</strong>[1][2]</p>

<p>The room was referred to in internal AT&amp;T documents as the SG3 [Study Group 3] Secure Room. It is fed by fiber optic lines from beam splitters installed in fiber optic trunks carrying Internet backbone traffic[3] and, as analyzed by J. Scott Marcus, a former CTO for GTE and a former adviser to the FCC, who has access to all Internet traffic that passes through the building, and therefore &quot;the capability to enable surveillance and analysis of internet content on a massive scale, including both overseas and purely domestic traffic.&quot;[4] Former director of the NSAâ€™s World Geopolitical and Military Analysis Reporting Group, William Binney, has estimated that 10 to 20 such facilities have been installed throughout the United States.[2]&quot;</p>

<p>What SHOULD scare you more is the fact that this truth is being hidden by downvotes right on this forum, so the truth can&#39;t even be exposed very well.  </p>

<p><strong>HOW is the CONVERSATION able to be controlled so pervasively and effectively to mislead us in this way?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been known since the 70s that the NSA decrypts &quot;unintentional intelligence bearing EM signals in the atmosphere&quot;- recreating exactly what&#39;s on a PC monitor TV. It&#39;s part of the NSA mission statement. How far have they progressed in decrypting the EM emanations from human skulls can only be speculated on. Nobody ask that question though. This latest scandal will really make them stop. This time.

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t get, regarding the theory that they can intercept our brainwaves and decrypt them, is that people think we all have the exact same brainwaves.</p>

<p>As I understand it, our brain is programming itself from the first second it starts to receive stimuli, creating trillions of unique connections with itself.  For anyone to be able to intercept a given human brainwave, they&#39;d need some sort of secret decoder ring custom made for each person, because each person should be sending out custom made signals...shouldn&#39;t they?</p>

<p>So how do people suppose they&#39;re doing this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans share a lot of physiological responses. When exposed to low-frequency EM fields, for example, the brain will entrain to them. It&#39;s proven sleep can be induced through brain entrainment at a 1 or 2 Hz ELF. Other responses can be induced based on the frequency. Dr. Ross Addey investigated a seized Soviet brainwashing device called the LIDA machine and documented how it used this process to induce trance, sleep, etc. He also found frequencies that could induce &quot;riotous behavior.&quot; </p>

<p>The Malech Patent for reading and altering brainwaves remotely is often cited. </p>

<p>Psychotronic weapons were purportedly used in Iraq, and, indeed, the USAToday of Feb &#39;92 reported an accusation by Saddam that the CIA had targeted him with psychotronic attack. </p>

<p>The reports about Iraq involve S-Quad or Silent Sound Spread Spectrum. It&#39;s a technology that claims to be able to clone EEG emotion-clusters onto a computer and broadcast them in such a way that targeted populations will accept them as their own. The article below cites reports of this use in Iraq from overseas and interviews an official from the patent holding company.

<p>Further advanced methods can only be speculated on. Some researchers say FMRIs can illuminate even a single neuron firing in the brain through our already established radar systems. There&#39;s an interesting story below on researchers how uncovered the existence of a MIND device (magnetic integrated neuron duplicator) that a prisoner/MKUltra subject had previously described being used on himself.

<p>Its sort of the opposite.  </p>

<p>I believe 100% that brain activity can be stimulated through EM fields/magnetic pulses.  No doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what you&#39;re asking then. 
You can look into how TEMPEST and Van Eck hacking work. There&#39;s videos of scientists seeing what a cat is seeing through its eyes by decoding the electrical activity of the animal&#39;s brain and seeing the images on a computer monitor. It would just be a matter of monitoring and decrypting the EM emanations remotely and decrypting them, as opposed to with electrodes. An impressive feat, inarguably, but the next logical evolution in the technology and one already proven operational in the non-biological parallel.

One of the common allegations of current victims is another person seeing through their eyes. This is detailed many places, notably in the lawsuit Akwei vs NSA, wherein the plaintiff alleges to have knowledge of operational functions of an NSA tech called Remote Neural Monitoring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So...people are aware of this monitoring as it happens?  How does that work?</p>

<p>And maybe I&#39;m just being stubborn here, but sensory information is being transcribed from a reproducible external source.  Individual thoughts are not based on external stimuli.</p>

<p>Not to mention there have been cases of similar symptoms recorded for hundreds of years.  How many times, in biblical texts (regardless of whether you believe any of it...the idea was there) has someone heard a voice?  Been possessed by evil spirits?</p>

<p>Idunno.  I think this particular theory is just wishful thinking, trying to explain away mental illness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree with that notion about thought being different from the visual stream. I think maybe they were able to detect if you were thinking about a shape, like a triangle, square, or circle; perhaps by recording the pattern evoked by thinking of those shapes, but it didn&#39;t get to much more detail thought recognition than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t our genetics control the overall construction of our brains (frontal lobe, visual cortex, cerebellum etc..)? The neural pathways will be different because each human experience is different but to interface with certain parts of the brain as a whole it may actually be generalized.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to believe. I wouldn&#39;t have believed it either. 
It&#39;s not subtle at all. It&#39;s extremely electronic and accompanied by a pulsing tinnitus that can sound exactly like a modem going online. 
The only thing I disagree with you on is that individual thoughts are not based on external stimuli. 
Check out the CNN report on Radio Frequency Weapons. They use Russian literature on psychotronic weapons, hire an electronics engineer to build a device based on their specifications, then use the device to transmit actual images into the CNN reporter&#39;s mind. The engineer is astounded but confirms that in a couple weeks he could build a device that could do the same to an entire city.</p>

<p>I should also add that I don&#39;t believe people are aware of it while it&#39;s happening, not until their attackers make themselves known. It&#39;s ability to be unrecognizable, and its surreal nature make it more insidious. It&#39;s only in retrospect that one realizes their thoughts were being tampered with and they may have been acting, and believing, out of character.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you link that report?  Google returns lotsa links.</p>

<p>If the russians had this technology and it was so simple to produce on a massive scale...why didn&#39;t they?  If we now have it, why does the government even dick around doing anything less than hijacking our brains en masse?   If we&#39;re all to be slaves for the NWO...why bother playing games?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to attack you, but &quot;It&#39;s extremely electronic&quot; and statements like it often act as a smokescreen for ideas that belong in science fiction novels.</p>

<p>As for Akwei...Every site I&#39;ve looked at has read like a schizophrenic rant against the fascist Nazi Zionist Liberal Pope and his various evil henchmen.  Its all got a ton of speculation with even fewer &quot;proof&quot; links than most of the activist blogs wer get here.  Do you have any legitimate sources?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. I really appreciate your civility and genuine skeptical curiosity. 
The electric nature of the attacks is subjective to the experiencer, but it differentiates the experience from a psychotic break. Also, extensive victim interviews have shown the same scripts being used. That is victims claiming this have heard the electronic voices saying the same things, verbatim. Some of these scripts are laughable- &quot;We are evil reptilian aliens and we&#39;re going to experiment on your brain.&quot; Some are just horrific, as they&#39;re more plausible, &quot;We&#39;re the CIA and we&#39;re conducting experiments on you. We&#39;re now going to give you a heart attack&quot;- followed by the victim&#39;s heart feeling like it&#39;s beating out of their chest with all accompanying physiological symptoms. This is what Saddam said was done to him by a CIA psychotronic attack in USAToday Feb 1992 (14th I believe), along with thousands of Americans. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to the segment of the CNN report on Radio Frequency Weapons I mentioned. You can view the whole thing if you wish. You can read more about Delgado, the neuroscientist who stops the bull using an implanted &quot;stimoceiver.&quot; He also implanted these in humans, and eventually revealed he didn&#39;t need the implants at all, as the same effects were achieved non-invasively using pulsed EM waves.

<p>The Russians have always been more open about their bioelectromagnetic research. The FBI brought Russian psychotronic expert Igor Smirnov to Waco, and considered using his devices in the siege there. They planned to piggyback electronic signals that would subliminally register as family&#39;s pleas to leave the compound over the telephone wiring, and wanted to use the &quot;Voice of God&quot; on Koresh. The plan was abandoned after Smirnov conceded it could backfire and they might all kill each other.  You can find this information from articles about Smirnov on his Wiki entry. </p>

<p>The Russian Psychotronic Program is also discussed in the US Army publication, &quot;The Mind Has No Firewall.&quot; <a href="http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/98spring/thomas.htm">http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/98spring/thomas.htm</a></p>

<p>Putin recently stated his psychotronic weapons program will be a big part of the Russian military up until 2020. He said these weapons, which can effectively zombify people, are more powerful than the atom bomb but more politically acceptable. 
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2123415/Putin-targets-foes-zombie-gun-attack-victims-central-nervous-system.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2123415/Putin-targets-foes-zombie-gun-attack-victims-central-nervous-system.html</a></p>

<p>I can only speculate on why it hasn&#39;t been rolled out en masse. Perhaps it will be. Maybe they&#39;re working out all the kinks. Maybe they want it fully operational, but honestly hope to never have to totally enslave everyone. Maybe they do plan to totally enslave everyone but reason that if it becomes known at this point, that won&#39;t be as easy. Why did Putin disclose it? Why did he stipulate the year 2020? Why don&#39;t Putin&#39;s revelations, the known available research, and congruent victim testimony at bioethics.gov cause much concern? I don&#39;t know.</p>

&quot;Subvocal recognition involves monitoring actual movements of the tongue and vocal cords that can be interpreted by electromagnetic sensors. Through the use of electrodes and nanocircuitry, synthetic telepathy can be achieved allowing people to communicate silently.[5]
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization</a>
When you think a word, your vocal chords vibrate minutely as if the word was spoken, and a corresponding EM signal- which has been decrypted- is emitted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. Anyone who has been paying attention for the past decade already knows the NSA is spying on everyone. Why all of a sudden the BIG stink in the MSM? Are we being distracted from something else? Or are we simply being psychologically conditioned to see the error in our anti-Patriot Act thinking right before the next false flag attack on the Homeland? Or could this simply be a NSA drill to assess the mood and mettle of the People (in anticipation of even more draconian measures to come, eg, after a financial collapse)? Perhaps the Elite are actually pushing/hoping for a rebellious showdown with the People on July 4th. Why wait? Ammo supplies are limited at the moment. A march on DC by Kokesh &amp; Co. would be the perfect excuse to crack down hard on gun owners nationwide. In any case, it&#39;s clear that the MSM are pushing this <strong>now</strong> for some nefarious reason or another.     </p>
