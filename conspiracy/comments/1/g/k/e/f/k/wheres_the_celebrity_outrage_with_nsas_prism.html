<p>Has her kid&#39;s autism been medically linked to the vaccine by a trained medical professional? I would like another source containing scientific data please.</p>

<p>And practically all vaccine related injuries are dismissed by the doctors or even worse, they put parents in jail for battery! Because some babies have such bad reactions to the vaccine that they look like they have been beaten with a bag of doorknobs, so police just charge them because they don&#39;t know better.</p>

<p>Any &quot;scientific data&quot; I can post about these issues can immediately be countered by a host of big-pharma propaganda...oh sorry...&quot;official studies&quot; done by the same corporations that profit on the drug &quot;safety&quot; so I don&#39;t play &quot;scientific data&quot; ping pong&quot; on reddit. Read the inserts that the vaccine manufacturer&#39;s provide and you will see the side effects clearly listed. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm093830.htm">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm093830.htm</a></p>

<p>So i did what you said and checked the inserts of six random vaccines. Not a single one contained autism as a side effect. I&#39;m not willing to go through more than half a dozen. It&#39;s not a great sample, but it&#39;s enough to convince me.</p>

<p>And practically all vaccine related injuries are dismissed by the doctors or even worse, they put parents in jail for battery!

<p>I&#39;m not going to bother even looking at either of these. They&#39;re from sources that are biased towards your particular view. If you can find some that are closer to non-biased, I would be more than willing to look at them. Sorry yo, but if you don&#39;t trust scientific testing, I don&#39;t trust biased media.  Seems like a fair deal to me.</p>

<p>And not looking at so called &quot;biased&quot; information is like refusing to hear or receive evidence. These &quot;biased&quot; viewpoints are extremely valid, if not more valid, than any scientific study that was paid for by big-pharma and most of them, Like Dr. Wakefield, simply questioned the science and asked for bigger and better studies to be done...which they have not nor do they intend to do. This includes the double blind placebo tests as well as tests for cancer and interaction with other drugs. None of this has been done and these drugs have been raced to the production lines because there is trillions of dollars at stake in worldwide vaccine distribution.  Science is being used to control the population and vaccines are the ultimate tool for that purpose as we WILLINGLY go into the doctor&#39;s office and ask them to inject a completely unknown substance past our natural immune systems affecting our health in ways still unknown to modern science...but they will never admit to that!</p>

<p>So the fact that Jenny McCarthy&#39;s <a href="http://www.celebritytalent.net/sampletalent/1573/jenny-mccarthy/"><strong>minimum</strong> speaking fee</a> is $50,000 isn&#39;t a way to make money? I sure see a financial incentive in that stance for her. Considering that she was all but gone before she started her rabid anti-vaccine crusade. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t Wakefiled&#39;s initial study only have a trial sample of 12 autistic children? It was studying how MMR causes bowel problems for kids with autism.  12 is a <strong>ridiculously</strong> small sample size. Nothing conclusive can come from a study that small.  At best you have anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for bigger and better studies, but at what point is the study big enough or better enough to suit your needs?  What does science need to do to cut through your confirmation bias? </p>

<p>Think about it this way... Smallpox was the leading cause of death in the 18th Century, and was eradicated by the 20th.  Polio cases have been reduced by a factor of 100. And both of those things were accomplished by vaccines.</p>

<p>Do we need some more research? Sure, I can agree with that.</p>

<p>But a choice between kids have a 76% chance of dying from a disease we can vaccinate against, or a muuuuuuuuch lower chance of literally anything else happening... I&#39;ll take the latter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tellin you, I really applaud your trolling skills. You&#39;re good. :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK...you called me a troll twice. (shill tactic) You brought up polio and smallpox as examples of &quot;successful eradication&quot; of a disease by vaccination (a lie as both of those diseases were all ready declining by the time the vaccines were intorduced and yet another shill tactic). You reversed what I said about Wakefield (shill tactic) as he was specifically saying that his own research was not enough and that they should do more! You dismissed the idea of bigger and better studies because &quot;none of them would satisfy me&quot;. (shill tactic)</p>

<p>And as for science that is good enough for me...there needs to be honest independent testing by third party researchers who DO NOT PROFIT from the answer that they find. And that is not being done nor does any group have the money needed to perform that task outside of governments or multi-nationals...which are all either corrupt (our governments) or occupied by the industry capture (regulatory capture) executives. </p>

<p>So I also applaud your shilling skills. You&#39;re good. ;D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, calling someone a shill really has no merit unless you can back it up. You&#39;re essentially saying, &quot;You disagree with me so you must be in bed with Big Pharma&quot;. Grow the fuck up.</p>

<p>Also, as a scientist, most of us do not get paid very well at all and if we could actually point to a veritable environmental cause for autism, it would increase our bank exponentially. That&#39;s really my biggest issue with vaccination conspiritards, its that you look at all scientists as these menacing eugenicists who are going to destroy the worlds population for .... something nefarious. Seriously, if I could pinpoint an external factor causing autism, i would be so rich right now even if it came at the temporary expense of my credibility. (Which is essnetially what a lot of these vaccine conspiracists are doing)</p>

<p><em>note</em> I do think its a really dumb idea to give a kid under 2 eleven vaccines.</p>

At best you have anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for bigger and better studies, but at what point is the study big enough or better enough to suit your needs?  What does science need to do to cut through your confirmation bias? </p>

<p>Think about it this way... Smallpox was the leading cause of death in the 18th Century, and was eradicated by the 20th.  Polio cases have been reduced by a factor of 100. And both of those things were accomplished by vaccines.</p>

<p>Do we need some more research? Sure, I can agree with that.</p>

<p>But a choice between kids have a 76% chance of dying from a disease we can vaccinate against, or a muuuuuuuuch lower chance of literally anything else happening... I&#39;ll take the latter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tellin you, I really applaud your trolling skills. You&#39;re good. :D</p>
