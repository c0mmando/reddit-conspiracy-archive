    <div class="md"><p>Is this entire thing in response to &quot;where there&#39;s warming, there&#39;s cooling&quot;? What on earth did you get out of it that I deserved such a diatribe? Yeah, the planet is warming as it cyclically does, and then we get cold. Ever hear of project cloverleaf? The idea there is that if we can stop the planet from heating up by 2% by using chemtrails that spread reflective material in the atmosphere to create a blanket that bounces back sunlight, we&#39;ll avoid another ice age that is on the way. That&#39;s the science that claims that our manipulating the weather is a good thing for our benefit argument for those who acknowledge chemtrails but say they&#39;re not harmful.</p>

<p>Actually, the debate is how much of an effect, how much humans induce an effect on the climate with our &quot;activities&quot;.
You should look up what anthropogenic means, you are fucking insane. Don&#39;t make bland stupid comments that obviously can be interpreted that anthropogenic climate change isn&#39;t real.</p>

<p>Again Google <em>anthropogenic</em> maybe take a Latin class while you at it too.</p>

<p><em>cough cough human induced</em></p>

<p>Stop before you make yourself look more retarded.</p>

<p>The best part is that the cooling you speak of won&#39;t come for thousands of years after our planet is fucked by whats coming within the next 100 years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the science that claims that our manipulating the weather is a good thing for our benefit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any scientist that has a background in ecology or environmentalism will tell you manipulating the weather, or any ecosystem has dire consequences, that for the most part are purposely overlooked because of a profit motive to keep a human social economic system running.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you&#39;re sounding like a psychotic. Just stop. Reread what you just said. You even quoted me giving you the definition of anthropogenic. And no shit there are dire consequences to weather manipulation, that&#39;s why people are concerned about chemtrails.</p>

<p>Really... what is your fucking point? Why are you &quot;talking&quot; to (anyone) like this WHILE making yourself come off as a pompous jackass who has to keep doubling back on himself to seem like he/she/it even has a valid fucking point to make in the first place?</p>

<p>So this quote is false as I said before....</p>

<p>To make it even more clear the debate is how much of an effect we humans have. Here is nice easy sentence for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the climate changes regardless of human interaction, humans are not <em>responsible</em> for climate change, however we have an impact on it&#39;s rate, that&#39;s the influence. We can induce positive feedback loops such as releasing CFCs in the atmosphere that lead to reduction of ozone and the famous &quot;greenhouse affect&quot;. To sum up, I am saying we are responsible for those (not good) positive feedback loops that end up warming the climate at a much faster rate than it would normally.</p>
