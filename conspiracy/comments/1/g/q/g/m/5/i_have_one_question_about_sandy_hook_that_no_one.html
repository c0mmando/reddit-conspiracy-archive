       I have listened to the police scanner audio a few times. I assumed others who were interested in this had as well but they all seemed to miss something, which is surprising with the musical-guns discussion everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the audio there is a police officer who identifies himself as being IN the school, at the point that sounds like it comes immediately after Lanza goes down or is discovered. He calls for weapons to be picked up, presumably for evidence. His call for weapons pick up sounds like: "a long gun and a shotgun" or "a long gun...uh, a shotgun"
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think it sounds like "long gun AND shotgun." Either way this puts the shotgun UNDENIABLY INSIDE THE SCHOOL. Not the trunk (unless they meant later, after pick up, but why? That isn't how evidence should be handled) Anyway, this is a recorded fact available to everyone. I have not see it discussed. Please do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why call for the pick up of a shotgun or a a long gun and a shotgun but none (neither?) of the handguns? They couldn't have been calling for this far from Lanza's body right? He and all of his stuff would have been right there, because he shot himself as the cops came in right? He didn't run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what kind of off-duty cop (or whatever) runs away from brother cops coming onto a scene?

       Dude...take a step back and a big breath and look at the WHOLE Sandy Hook situation...have you seen any visual evidence that an entire classroom of children was shot and killed by Adam Lanza?  I mean, a school has cameras going 24/7 right?  Have you seen him walking up to the school? In the school? In fact, have you seen Lanza in anything but dated photos? What's even more intriguing is that his own supposed neighbors never saw him either, in fact...they didn't even know who he was. Once you accept the fact that there's no evidence of the event actually taking place why sit there and split hairs over a fuzzy word here or there...we already know enough to qualify Sandy Hook as a false flag.  I don't mean to be rude, but I really don't see the significance of your topic.

       The media LOVES surveillance footage!!! They show it for all the dumb gas station robberies etc etc, even Boston bombings had footage. So why would they not release footage of Lanza anywhere on the school property? Hmmmmmmmm

       All and I mean ALL schools have some kind of surveillance. Maybe not in the class room but For sure of the entrance of the school and parking lots so at some point you would see Lanza approaching and or entering the school.

       Because they were bragging about their nifty security system. And no one wants to see children being murdered. We want to see the guy walking into the school with a gun. Why would they have surveillance cameras in the classroom? Your argument is weak. And if you remember Columbine, they have no problem showing kids (a little older or not, still minors) in shooting situations. But we don't want to see a kid actively get shot. We want to see the blood on the walls (or anywhere for that matter, you didn't see any), the bullet holes, an image of Lanza anywhere at the school, etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone asking a question like you have comes across a little shilly, by the way. Let me guess, you want to censor everything because of child porn, right? Not that i'm looking for child porn, but here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       it's generally believed that the ones pushing for internet censorship under the guise of "protecting the shildrens" are usually connected to CP somehow themselves. Like how most openly anti-gay politicians are usually fooling around in same sex situations themselves, but since they're pointing the finger, no one is looking at them.

       Yes, everyone who questions our intelligent minds is a shill and looks at child pornography, and they want to censor the internet so that they can... not look at child pornography. This makes perfect sense.

       And no, not everyone who questions our intelligent minds, but you're using an argument that isn't the entirety of the issue and actually a classic redirection technique. Do you have any evidence that Sandy Hook happened as we're told? Go ahead and prove it. Taking the stance about footage of children being shot is a distraction.

       Evidence. Evidence or it didn't happen. The news footage and interviews shown to us masses is what's raising the questions because the "evidence" is indeterminable at best. And if this is a conspiracy, it would explain why they're tearing the school down. So we, the masses, will never be able to know for sure if it happened or not. There's no blood, the whole thing is set up at the firehouse, it's all 4loco style fucking stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       You swallow everything shown on tv or that you read on the internet, don't you? What kind of evidence could I provide to YOU that it happened or not? What would YOU accept? You've already gotten a taste on what I'd like, so now it's your turn. Do you have evidence that it went down like in the official report? What about all the gun confusion? Come ooooooon, you'll be a hero!
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're still acting shilly.

       The multitude of eyewitness reports at the school
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the evidence. Though they're obviously crisis actors and the murdered children are obviously hiding underground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your whole "argument" that it was a conspiracy theory seems to be, "I must see the killer or it's a government plot". One, the government could have easily hired an actor to pose for the camera. It's what they apparently did at the Boston Bombing, how hard could it to do it inside a building?
      </p>

       You haven't given actual evidence to support the absurd claims you're making, and calling me a shill will only make yourself look paranoid, because I highly doubt that a shill from the government would waste time "arguing" with you.

       Hasbara is an example of government people hired to argue with people in forums. Does the American version of this have a name or is it just some three letter organization? Do you get my point or are you retarded enough to just stop at j00z?

       Actually, I will tackle this one since my other thing is currently working on something else. Not important.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "eye witnesses" are only part of what we're questioning. The kids didn't say much, there is no evidence backing any of the others up and that creepy fucking old guy's story just reeks of horse shit. 6 kids were randomly dropped off at a stranger's house with information that hadn't happened yet? Totally reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       My desire for damning evidence could very well be faked. Like that fat forensics guy... i wouldn't want him doing the analysis of the blood that is supposed to be all over the place because he's clearly paid by the govt (you know, he does literally work for them) and he'd probably lie and say it belonged to the kids. So some magic independent analysis would be lovely. But yes, I must see evidence of a killing to believe one happened. I believe most rational people feel the same way. I mean, when the kids all got stabbed in China there were images that LOOKED like something happened. Amazing propaganda guys over there. Go ahead and do a cursory search, there are plenty. But here we have some supposed tragedy being used to ramp up the government's monopoly of force... I'd like some god damn evidence to justify this. The footage from that day does not look like a shooting happened and children died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't given evidence because I am claiming a lack of evidence. How would you like me to prove a negative? Go ahead, this should be good.

       Here's the thing, you're jumping to conclusions. Appeal to ignorance is a logical fallacy. Just because Sandy Hook does not have sufficient evidence to satisfy you doesn't mean that it's a false flag used to ramp up the governments monopoly of force.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking you to support your claim that this was a setup. Saying "My conspiracy theory is true because there is no proof that a massacre happened" is not reasonable thinking.

       Again, you're asking me to prove a negative. I never said it was set up. All evidence of a lack of evidence is something I'm sure you've gone over so if you can't think of anything anything reasonable to add to your ignorance, I'm done appealing.

       Wow, I had no idea there was no such thing as terrorism until you put it in quotations and told me they were actually private contractors. I mean how can I argue with that? Clearly there are no terrorists just private contracts man it's obvious! Eye's officially opened in light of the strong argument you have made. Thank you.

       Nothing happened in terms of new gun control laws as a result of Sandy Hook.  The only law that was passed as a result was to restrict crime scene photos because of many freedom of information act requests by conspiracy theorist.
