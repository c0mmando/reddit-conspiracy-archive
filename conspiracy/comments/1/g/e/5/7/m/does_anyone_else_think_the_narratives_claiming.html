<p>We are ruled by bullies.</p>

<p>Arguing with them is pointless. If they even believe there is such a thing as truth, they believe themselves above it - free to lie in the name of power without shame or guilt to achieve their desired ends for their particular ideal of the &quot;greater good&quot; - free to reinterpret and redefine terms beyond any historical understanding so as to manipulate language to support their agenda, free to construct conditions that can be presented to the public to justify evil acts after or before the fact.</p>

<p>They count on good people like you to stand by and do nothing. Bush was right, there <em>is</em> evil in the world, and it rules the world - he is part of it, Obama is part of it, and they all want you to believe and hope that standing around on a street corner with a sign or voting for the next puppet will change things.</p>

<p>In fact, the only way to stop a bully is to speak to him in the language he understands - violence. How else are we to interpret US actions against Libya and Syria?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither has violence though. Are you willing to go as far as it takes? You are talking about violence against a criminal class completely unfettered by any sense of morality. </p>

<p>They will target your families and loved ones. Anyone unprotected. Do you have a daughter/sister/mother? They&#39;ll rape and behead her in front of you, maybe just sell her into sex slavery. How about your father? He will be tortured and parts of him will be sent to you. It&#39;ll be videotaped in excruciating 1080p bluray quality so you can see the anguish on his face as he is told he is being tortured for you. They&#39;ll enlist your brother to do the same to another family. Your loved ones will be forced into prostitution and slavery. Addictive drugs will flood your communities and you&#39;ll watch as any wealth you&#39;ve managed to accumulate is wrested from you. You will constantly be bombarded by messages deriding your revolutionary stance. You will live in a burnt out cinder block shanty spearing rats and looting burnt out houses for food. That&#39;s what CIA funded terrorism does throughout the rest of the world. That&#39;s what it&#39;ll do here. </p>

<p>Are you prepared to open that door? Will you do the same to the families of the soldiers who are doing that to you? Will you be able to do the same to the families of whatever class you think is oppressing you, be it bankers, reptiles, or others? How will you know that your targets are to blame and aren&#39;t just patsies and set ups by the real powers that be?</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be a fair fight, and you won&#39;t have the moral high ground. It&#39;ll be dog-eat-dog and wolf-bites-wolf. Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods. Do you really think violence is the answer? I don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peaceful revolution is absolutely possible, and liable to break out at any moment. Non-violent resistance is more effective, however, as participation increases. To increase participation you need leaders with a clear vision and good planning and organizational skills, the very essentials that the Occupy rallies were missing. Everyone had some beef or another with the system, but were stymied as to how to organize the message and effect real political change.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, even Ghandi believed that violent force was sometimes necesary. Peaceful resistance doesn&#39;t mean you never lift a finger in you&#39;re own defense.  The principal of satayagraha is that the means to an end is everything, so of you&#39;re trying to achieve peace, then violence probably isn&#39;t your best approach.  However, the principal does not state that simply sitting there and being mowed down is acceptable either.  Preserving your life or the life of others is of course encouraged, so long as you use no more force than necessary to do so, up to and including killing if given no other options.  If there is a peaceful option however then that is always preferred.  Ghandi was a smart fellow.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a b.s. method, makes pretty good sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, peaceful resistance means EXACTLY THAT, you DO NOT lift a finger in your own defense. That is why Gandhi let strike breakers beat him in South Africa, that is why he led thousands to purposefully allow British soldiers to beat them at the Salt strikes in India, and that is why the British lost heart and gave up. I simply cannot express how important this is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to Google satayagraha.  You are wrong.  Yes, you may have some pain inflicted on you in the course of peacefully resisting.  It&#39;s part and parcel of non violent resistance.  But, if your opponent is killing you and your fellow resistors en mass, without regard, even Ghandi believed that fighting back in order to preserve your life or that of another was valid.  He believed struggle was a part of the principal, but not senseless martyrdom.  Please before you go preaching non violent resistance at least have a full grasp of understanding of the principal itself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not to say that giving up your life on principal is unacceptable, just that it is not expected.  It is a personal choice.  Keep in mind however, that I did not say that Ghandi said &quot;fight back&quot; he said that the peaceful option is always best,  even if that , means to flee, but there are instances where that may not be an option.  In which case, attempting to preserve ones life or that of another is acceptable under the principal of non violence.  </p>

To those who preached violence and called nonviolent actionists cowards, he replied: “I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence....I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonour....But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment.”[13]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said you are wrong, because you were wrong.  I said peaceful resistance doesn&#39;t mean NEVER lifting a finger in you&#39;re own defense.  Being beaten is one thing, being rounded up and forced into fema camps, or drone bombed enough mass is quite another.  Ghandi in his own words says fight back when that point is reached.  The problem is, people hear people like you saying never ever lift a finger in you&#39;re own defense, that is the essence of peaceful resistance, and how they cant stress it enough, and they raise an eyebrow, and misunderstandings like OPs question occur.  Non violent resistance is a tactic, not a rule to be slaughtered by.  There is a distinction between cowardice and resistance.  The whole point of non violent resistance is that the means to an end is everything.  Violence gets you nowhere when trying to posit change, however, you are allowed to fight back in you&#39;re own defense if the opposition escalates to wholesale murder or concentration camps.  </p>

But the question was do we think the peace is the only way narrative essentially a bunch of hogwash when you&#39;re talking about going up against the American government.

<p>Neo, have you heard stories of how peaceful activist groups are sometimes infiltrated by a undercover cop or FBI agent? Whenever I heard these stories, the undercover guy is always trying to get the group to use violent means. They do this so that then the cops can crack down on them. Also, have you heard stories of peaceful marches having a small group of black clad anarchists go around breaking windows and such? These are more undercover agents trying to cast the entire march as being violent. Don&#39;t do their job for them and resort to violence until it is a last resort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your point? That I am advocating violence?  That agent provocateurs exist?  Or that I am an agent provocateur?  Well however you slice it, you&#39;re entitled to believe what you want to believe, but I agree fully with Ghandi that peace is far superior to violence.  And I&#39;d love to spread the message far and wide, most certainly it is the way.  But when. You are trying to explain to people why your way is superior, you need to be able to answer the tough questions, like is violence ever acceptable? Can there be a point where one must fight in order to achieve the goal of peace? And the simple answer is yes, there can be instances in which defending yourself is necessary. The other thing I&#39;d like to point out is that the definition of violence and defending yourself is interpretable.  If we are supposed to be discussing the merits of the non violence principal then why can&#39;t we not be truthful with one another, and have an actual discussion?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I think the reason he was asking that, is in part due to the misconception that being non violent means never defending yourself.  It most certainly does not mean that.  I don&#39;t mind discussing it openly, but sorry, if you&#39;re wrong, you&#39;re wrong.  You originally accused me of being wrong in not so many words.  Read your original response.  Perhaps I&#39;m a bit stand offish, but during occupy I dealt with a lot of people who were truly misunderstanding the idea of non violent resistance with cowardice, and plenty more people who like you insisted that non violence is the ONLY way.  It created a lot of tense moments and lost us some people who might have otherwise understood that it&#39;s a tactic and not utter submission to authority.  And I think it does need to be addressed. Plenty of folks can get behind the idea that being peaceful and locking arms or whatever can work, but plenty of them also wonder what do we do if it doesn&#39;t.  When the only answer they can get is peace is the only way, they turn around and walk away, because they see the idea as a flawed one, as complete submission masquerading as resistance, and as ineffective in the face of fema camps, or drone murder.  They need to know that even the most peace preaching among us can see violence as necessary to defense under the right circumstances.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, you spend a lot of time here trying to tell me that non-violence does not mean utter submission to authority. I agree and have stated ways MLK and Gandhi did so too. We are not yet facing fema camps and drones, so as of yet, violent revolution will not be effective. There were a lot of reasons why Occupy didn&#39;t work out, failing to become violent is hardly one of them. We are not yet &quot;under the right circumstances,&quot; (though I think we will be someday), and we have not really tried non-violent revolution on as large a scale or for as long a period as Luther and Gandhi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I never said we were to that point.  I never said occupiers were to that point.  I personally don&#39;t believe that were anywhere near that point.  Just that you need to have answers to the tough questions.  I don&#39;t advocate for violence, I see it as stupidity given who our opposition is and what they are capable of.  I&#39;d like to convince more people to join a non violent resistance movement.  But, if they ask me what do we do if this doesn&#39;t work? I&#39;d prefer for them to have a proper answer.  Non violence is far superior, and we may get a few bruises, pepper spray, water cannons, some may even die, but, it&#39;s our actions that will determine the course of our movement.  However, I wouldn&#39;t ask a person among us to sit by idle if the opposition resorts to mass indiscriminate and lethal violence, if that becomes the case, we should defend ourselves.  </p>

<p>Of course once again, violence, defense, these words are interpretative. Would shaming a cop by chanting &quot;shame on you&quot; as they beat a girl for sitting down and not moving be considered violent?  Some would say yes it&#39;s verbal violence and antagonizing the officer.  How about kicking a gas canister back towards police, rather than allowing the crowd to take the brunt of the gas? What about erecting barricades and setting them on fire as turkey has done?  Are these peaceful resistance tactics or borderline violence?  Is this lifting a finger in your own defense or not?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think moderation might be in order where it regards the balance between total passivity on one end and complete violence on the other.  Work steadfastly toward peace, but if you are dealing with an adversary that refuses to respond to peace, then use as much force as necessary to eventually bring about such peace.  On some occasions, all it takes it the mere threat of violence in order to bring about peace.</p>

<p>On other occasions, the adversary must first be completely obliterated before peace comes about.</p>

<p>Always work toward peace, but never be afraid to defend it fiercely against those that mean to undermine equality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were 2 schools of thought during that last revolution, the civil rights revolution. Martin Luther got the South to do it non-violently. They organized sit-in&#39;s, refused to get off buses, things like that. They put their bodies in front of hoses and dogs and WANTED to go to jail. Every time they went to jail, every time they got bit, every time they made a white cop hurt them they won a victory. A moral victory and a public relations one. </p>

<p>On the other hand, on the west coast, the black panthers tried violent revolution. They carried guns around, they got into shoot outs with cops. They were vilified by the press, they were hunted down by the cops, and the public was on the cops&#39; side. Which do you look back in history and see as being more successful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neo, have you heard stories of how peaceful activist groups are sometimes infiltrated by a undercover cop or FBI agent? Whenever I heard these stories, the undercover guy is always trying to get the group to use violent means. They do this so that then the cops can crack down on them. Also, have you heard stories of peaceful marches having a small group of black clad anarchists go around breaking windows and such? These are more undercover agents trying to cast the entire march as being violent. Don&#39;t do their job for them and resort to violence until it is a last resort. </p>
