       I've thought the same thing to a degree

       The skeptic needs to skeptical of everything, even to people who claim to be telling you the "real truth".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the US government, at the very least, has the power to silence a news story that they don't want getting out. Maybe not far reaching enough to cover everything, but at least the major media outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, even sports organizations like the NBA and the NFL have the power to silence news stories that make them look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they have such power and such intent, they could have kept this story quiet. And they chose not to, it's all over the news. I'm not sure what to think about that.

       I wonder sometimes if there aren't people in the government fighting to declassify this stuff gradually in a way that won't be to disruptive to the American people. Maybe they just have me lusting after a benevolent Big Brother

       I doubt it considering the extents their going to with Syria to cover it all up. I think they were genuinely pissed about what was leaked.

       What if this was the blinder to get us into Syria? What if China bought Snowden and his leaked info? I've been thinking about these things a lot. It's frustrating knowing I won't get a conclusive answer. I feel like we're getting seriously close to FEMA camps.

       This is what I feel on a lot of issues. At a certain point I just come to the best conclusion I can with the facts I have then be done with it.

       To me it just wouldn't make sense, Obama would loose support because of the NSA bullshit then he'd loose even more going into Syria based on complete bullshit. He'd be doing so much willful damage to himself over one issue, it just doesn't seem worth it. He could have gone into Syria based on chemical weapons claims without the NSA stuff.

       I hear what you're saying, but imagine they wanted him to lose support. What happens when the American people rise up once he's in the single digits of approval rating? Obama's favorite president was Lincoln, and we know what he did when the country tried to split. I don't really buy that scenario either though. I think its bigger than our country. I believe in some kind of global elite and their control over everything. My best guess is population control, but really that's just a guess. America is getting pushed into a war everywhere. The American people don't want these wars. I feel like its a matter of time before every country starts coming back at us. Im getting out there now, so I'll leave it where i did last time. It's frustrating knowing I'll never have a conclusive answer. It doesn't ruin my life knowing that, but i do feel as though my quality of life has diminished because of it.

       I think so. Big Brother wants to interject and solidify the controlling thought that we are somehow suspicious by nature. It's a ramping up of us all policing one and other. Being scared and suspicious of others causes us to be alone, vulnerable and compliant.

       I think it's more like "We can spin this and blame the Americans for their apathy in the past as an excuse to continue doing it in the future." That's why I think it's asinine when someone says "but... but... 2006?" Yeah, like anything that happened in 2006 started then, or will end then. People wake up when they wake up. Shit. I don't even wake up when my alarm clock goes off. I don't expect other people aren't in denial about the time to wake up any less than they want to get out of bed in the morning. It's just a natural response that is only cured by yelling "Fire!" when there's an actual fire.
