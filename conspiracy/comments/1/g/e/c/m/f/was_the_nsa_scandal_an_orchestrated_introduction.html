<p>The skeptic needs to skeptical of everything, even to people who claim to be telling you the &quot;real truth&quot;.</p>

<p>I think that the US government, at the very least, has the power to silence a news story that they don&#39;t want getting out. Maybe not far reaching enough to cover everything, but at least the major media outlets.</p>

<p>Hell, even sports organizations like the NBA and the NFL have the power to silence news stories that make them look bad.</p>

<p>If they have such power and such intent, they could have kept this story quiet. And they chose not to, it&#39;s all over the news. I&#39;m not sure what to think about that.</p>

<p>This is what I feel on a lot of issues. At a certain point I just come to the best conclusion I can with the facts I have then be done with it. </p>

<p>To me it just wouldn&#39;t make sense, Obama would loose support because of the NSA bullshit then he&#39;d loose even more going into Syria based on complete bullshit. He&#39;d be doing so much willful damage to himself over one issue, it just doesn&#39;t seem worth it. He could have gone into Syria based on chemical weapons claims without the NSA stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear what you&#39;re saying, but imagine they wanted him to lose support. What happens when the American people rise up once he&#39;s in the single digits of approval rating? Obama&#39;s favorite president was Lincoln, and we know what he did when the country tried to split. I don&#39;t really buy that scenario either though. I think its bigger than our country. I believe in some kind of global elite and their control over everything. My best guess is population control, but really that&#39;s just a guess. America is getting pushed into a war everywhere. The American people don&#39;t want these wars. I feel like its a matter of time before every country starts coming back at us. Im getting out there now, so I&#39;ll leave it where i did last time. It&#39;s frustrating knowing I&#39;ll never have a conclusive answer. It doesn&#39;t ruin my life knowing that, but i do feel as though my quality of life has diminished because of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more like &quot;We can spin this and blame the Americans for their apathy in the past as an excuse to continue doing it in the future.&quot; That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s asinine when someone says &quot;but... but... 2006?&quot; Yeah, like anything that happened in 2006 started then, or will end then. People wake up when they wake up. Shit. I don&#39;t even wake up when my alarm clock goes off. I don&#39;t expect other people aren&#39;t in denial about the time to wake up any less than they want to get out of bed in the morning. It&#39;s just a natural response that is only cured by yelling &quot;Fire!&quot; when there&#39;s an actual fire.</p>
