        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today there was ANOTHER leaked memo, this time alleging the U.S. State Department covered up pedophilia, sexual assaults, illegal drug trafficking, and &quot;endemic&quot; solicitation of sexual services. The timing of this memo is incredible, especially after the revelations on the IRS, Benghazi confusion, drone strikes of Americans, PRISM, the BLARNEY surveillance system, Verizon wiretapping, AP wiretapping, Fox News reporter wiretapping, and so forth.</p>

<p>What is going on?</p>

<p>My theory: the rogue elements of the shadow secondary military state, in particular the NSA and related Pentagon departments, are battling for control with the civilian side under Obama&#39;s control. We are witnessing a coup d&#39;etat in which the shadow state is attempting to remove Obama/Clinton and put forth an even more controlled system of governance.</p>

<p>This is speculative on my part, but it explains the insanity we&#39;ve been witnessing recently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have to go deeper than this.  Start studying Deep Politics.  With all of the recent revelations, do you really think that Mr. Barack Obama is anything but a puppet of The Establishment; and by The Establishment, I mean the permanent government.</p>

<p>Stop and think about this for a moment: in the USA, we are enthralled by &quot;left wing&quot; and &quot;right wing&quot; politics with its controlled discourse and its controlled opposition.  These are two wings of the same beast.  There is a &quot;Conservative&quot; arm of The Establishment made up of the elite in the DoD, the intelligence agencies, and the military-industrial complex.  There is a &quot;Liberal&quot; arm of The Establishment made up of elite groups like The CFR, The Tavistock Institute, Academia, the Sate Department, etc.</p>

<p>I believe in one conspiracy: unchecked greed fueling dynastic consolidations of real power.  These dynasties are headed by international financiers.</p>

<p>It is all a part of the show; an atmosphere that is the product of social engineering by those wielding control of true world power through high finance.  You need to command an equal or greater force to stop the momentum, and with a heavily fluoridated population enticed by their Brave New World, I don&#39;t see a real revolution coming any time soon.</p>

<p>Thank the gods!</p>

<p>I say, let it all barrel on.  Ordo ab Chao.  Things will probably get much worse (full blown neo-feudalism for the &quot;first world&quot; with the eventual re-emergence of a strong mercantile class) before it gets better (provided, of course, we don&#39;t mutually annihilate one another through internecine conflicts for fun and profit).</p>

<p>Down vote me if you like, but I&#39;m a huge fan of the so-called New World Order: I think it will arise out of the trance-formation of our current society pushed to its farthest limits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you this: I don&#39;t think the current course can be easily altered from the base of the pyramid where the majority of us work and toil; not without mass coordination of effort from the masses.  This has been achieved in the past, at various times, by numerous prophets (real and imaginary) and founders of religious sects.</p>

<p>But the results are predictable.  A theurgic sect degrades from gnosis and becomes entrenched in dogma.  That dogma then becomes a vehicle for corruption.  I am all for personal ambition, but I don&#39;t think we need to exercise that ambition through exploitation.</p>

<p>It would be far more effective to change course from the top of the pyramid.  If I roll a ball down a hill, a slight change in course at the beginning, from the top of the hill, can have drastic effects on the final position of the ball as it comes to a stop.  That same amount of effort lower down the hill doesn&#39;t necessarily produce such drastic results.  Shifting a few degrees at the top can make miles of difference at the bottom.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have been a student of Hermetics for far too long to regard destruction as an axiomatically bad state of affairs.  What will really be destroyed?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we will all annihilate each other, but I do think our over stimulated masses are going to need courage to walk away from an exploitive central banking system.  However, we have become soft with our Reddit, and our modern conveniences.  We are already deep in our neo-feudalism.  It looks like the wealth gap is the largest it has been since the Dark Ages.  Perhaps we are in a new Dark Age ironically illuminated by iPhones and Androids.</p>

<p>Yes, I am a bit cynical.  I see people everyday just grunting away at their lives.  I think they are perfectly content to just remain exploited.  If that is the case, then the masses have precisely the government they deserve through their own apathy.</p>

<p>I have to hope that there are more people in the world that are starting to hope, and dream, and plan a New World Order (I hate that term - it was co-opted by the intelligence services) that doesn&#39;t have us crushed under the weight of debt slavery.  However, I have absolutely no sympathy for those individuals who took on more debt than they could handle out of pure consumption - I certainly don&#39;t pity these fools.</p>

There is something really interesting going on over there in that it is trivially easy to pirate content of all kinds.  The big producers don&#39;t seem interested in selling over there so likely its not even possible to buy content.  There was some kind of law or directive passed in Ukraine to shut down pirate sites and then the government websites went under massive attack and apparently from what I was told the government actually relented.

    <div class="md"><p>So would you say that the Scandenavian countries are all right in there with this new type of police state?  I just don&#39;t know much about that region because its much too expensive for me to linger there on my current income.</p>

<p>It seems to me that most if not all of the new justifications for locking down the Internet are based around either piracy or terrorism concerns.  Far Eastern Europe doesn&#39;t seem to be terribly concerned about either of those things.  It can be difficult to do business in Ukraine but it seems that it is much more free than is commonly understood.  They really are a bunch of disillusioned people over there after all that they have been through.  They seem to have mostly given up on having an overtly functional system and instead just do want they want.  I think that this makes them a bit resistant to the copyright and patent racket.  With their disillusioned attitudes, high intelligence and general lack of money it creates an unusual situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say that Scandinavia is turning into a physical police state, but rather a surveillance state, but then again our own police will soon be able to carry guns. all this data storage became a hot topic after the tragedy at Utøya. and Norwegians in general are like sheep when it comes to forming an opinion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not willing to give up my basic human rights because of piracy or terrorism. the movie industries need to adapt to the new market and terrorism is a fucking bad joke.</p>

<p>I already know that our own intelligence agencies here in Norway got access to our FB profiles and that they are bombarding us with trojans and malware just as much as any other agency in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I prefer to be in the company of Norwegians more than my own people.  I&#39;ve noticed something really cute and interesting about the people in that they seem somewhat unexperienced or unable to immediately comprehend, or identify evil or antisocial behaviour in a way that it seems to me that most Americans are able to.  In time I&#39;m sure that a Norwegian would realize that a person was fucked up but more likely the Norwegian would assume that they personally were not understanding something that was going on.  So I&#39;d say that your people are more likely to assume that a person is not a monster, to give that person a chance if they deserve it or not.</p>

<p>One time I was speaking at length with a Norwegian guy and I was telling him about hwo some thing are in America, the obesity, work places, antisocial behaviour, etc and it was obvious to me that I was in many ways coming from a super fucked up society.  Overall I enjoy the people because they are fairly likely to have the ability to comprehend and for some reason they care about things.  Having said that I could see the Norwegian people slipping into a comprehensive surveillance state that is totally over the top too much.</p>

<p>If I was an evil genius I would implement a system in Norway extremely slowly and I would make sure not to intrude or act overtly aggressive with the people.  Then the general positive intention of the people would act as a cover.  If I were evil.</p>

<p>And this may very well be part of why both groups are being controlled by a bigger more powerful force - even if some or most of the players on either side don&#39;t know about it, are ignorant of it, and are actually sincere in their antagonism toward each other.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1g66pr/we_are_witnessing_a_coup_detat_in_the_united/cah8a23">Like I mentioned to Invictus8</a>, the ultimate goal of either group seems to involve a level of control over the plebs that really makes it six in one hand, half a dozen in the other.  They&#39;re both going toward the same goal of control, just in different ways...just like the charade which is the Democratic and Republican parties.  Whether they&#39;re the same or not - on the same team or &quot;against&quot; one another - the end goal of national enslavement will end up the same.  Either way it&#39;ll be &quot;mission accomplished&quot; according to TPTB.</p>

<p>I would not disagree with this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would say they aren&#39;t because both wings are just as controlled by a higher power as the Democrip and Rebloodican gangs are controlled by a power above them as well.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That seems to be one theory, but when it looks like the end game of <em>either</em> leak is simply more controls and constrictions upon the people of this country, then one sees that the end game is exactly the same from either group.  They&#39;re both working toward the same goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes a lot more sense if you understand the motive.</p>

<p>In the next decades we&#39;ll by and large lose petrochemical energy sources, as well as have to waste enormous efforts on merely surviving in a world with rapidly changing climate. This will more then half collective wealth worldwide, as at the same time populations go up by another few billion. There will be mass migrations, biosphere die-off, revolutions. </p>

<p>And the biggest hit will be technological unemployment - by 2050 more than 75% of jobs will have become irreversibly automated, and very little in terms of new forms of employment will emerge. We&#39;ll only see unemployment go up and up from this moment onwards. My estimate is that real unemployment has effectively gone up 1% per year, since the late 1990s. Probably over 1% per year. This is making the investor caste gruesomely rich, and everyone else has to compete three times as hard, live stressful lives.</p>

<p>We as a species COULD maybe hold things together but that would mean the rich would have to sacrifice a lot of their amassed wealth. The elites are completely not in favor of such a scenario. The 1% would rather see a sizeable portion of humans &quot;die off&quot; by gradual extinction rather than they lose more than half their affluence.</p>

<p>So what do they do? They have somewhere at the end of the last century, <a href="http://www.911truth.org/">used whatever means at their disposal</a> to grab power.  They are by and large successful. My worst case scenario is that by 2100 population numbers of natural human beings will have decreased by over 50%. The point is that we make sure they haven&#39;t decreased by over 99%, leaving only that 1% alive as some form of post-humans.</p>
