    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       I'll start with a quote from one of the great modern day philosopher Bill Hicks (R.I.P.... we need you man, wish you were here):
"You know why our institutions are failing us, the church, the state, everything's failing? It's because, um â€“ they're no longer relevant. We're supposed to keep evolving. Evolution did not end with us growing opposable thumbs. You do know that, right? There's another 90 percent of our brains that we have to illuminate."
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings honestly amaze the shit out of me, I read about and believe in the endless possibilities of the human mind. It mystifies and excites me. Then I go out in public and I see the people I'm surrounded with, especially those in my age group (early 20s) and it frustrates me. Not just the wannabes that adopted a personality that the orchestrators imprinted on them, but also just those so caught up in the illusion that there's no way to convince them it isn't real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum studies contend that our mind is so powerful it creates the reality that we live in. It's participatory and amazing and each one of us perpetuates it and creates their own little piece that adds to the whole. A Collective Consciousness. It only makes sense that certain powerful forces would take advantage of this knowledge. If we create the world we live in why wouldn't they give us a blueprint for the world they want to create? Change our minds? And it's perfect because it's our choice the whole time. They don't even have to get their hands dirty, let us imprison ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're the ones with the power, the numbers, we would never do it if we were forced. Make us think it's our choice to live this way, live in fear and separate us from one another. I hate to be cliche but it's the fucking matrix man, except if we broke free the world would be even more beautiful than it was before. We would actually SEE this masterpiece we created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the information that is fed to us is a perpetuation of this agenda. Take the recent violent "terrorist" attacks for instance - although there's so much more all with varying degrees of severity but planting seeds none the less. I'll take the Boston bombing to give a specific example. I know a lot of people knew this was questionable, if not a ridiculously obvious farce but they're too afraid to speak up in a tragedy lest they offend someone. Be "politically correct" at all times or be publicly shamed!
      </p>
      <p>
       Most will go along with it so they're not viewed the same way which is a strange but expected flaw in human behavior. It's why millions of people were killed in the holocaust, why millions of people die at the hands of evil entities every single day. Well it's fucking offensive to me to continue to let these things happen, it's just paving the way for more "tragedies" and more people dying, more fear, more division, so our government can run in to "protect" us. We should be more intellectually evolved than this! We can not be tricked that easily, can we? I know we've went through years of conditioning and brainwashing, but really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, if you're afraid that you'll lose all the precious things you hold so dear in your little box of quiet, pretty, comforting, subjective lies by speaking up it's counter productive because that's exactly what's going to happen if you don't. It's such a paradox. We have to realize that everyone here - in this world, and maybe others - is our family. We're all making this world together as One and breaking free is the only way to save the things that matter in our piece of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a war for your mind. It's the ultimate weapon and certain beings understand this and will do anything to have it because with it they can acquire the world like it was just another possession. I for one am pissed the fuck off. We shouldn't have to fight for control of our own life and consciousness, it's the one thing we ever truly have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything in this universe is mostly just empty space and particles flying around each other at varying velocities. Consciousness can't be measured or studied, it's intriguing and exciting and beautiful and endless. And it's what we are as Humans. I hate them for taking that away from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We went from drawing on cave walls to the fucking moon dude in an infinitesimal amount of time when you look at it from a universal perspective. Imagine what we could do if we were free to explore our consciousness.

       The people at the very top are likely psychopaths or manipulated by psychopaths.

       Psychopaths, by the by, are barely people. This is probably the most important issue in al of conspiracy theory world if only for the fact that it explains literally everything about the behavior patterns of the elites. This is a deep subject of study. I think you - specifically you - would get a lot out of the subject.

       I stumbled upon this concept a year and a half ago.

      <p>
       It has changed my whole outlook.

       I'm much more optimistic about things these days.

       That is really interesting, I've always been intrigued by psychology it helps me evaluate the things I do with a more logical insight. I've heard that a lot of very successful businesspeople or whatever they choose to do are psychopaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't understand because I can't relate and I can't imagine why a person would have the need to have control of everything. I imagine it's a thrill to be so powerful and to be able to make things happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       But those people are few and we're many. It might not happen in my lifetime but I have faith in the human species that we'll prevail. It's a cycle that's been continuing forever and will always continue. I can almost see the potential this world has and I'm just hoping. It's a mad world.

       My mind is not working properly these days so I'll have to take your reply point-by-point.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Logic is a tool. Don't hold it in an undue esteem.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, logic - for me - is the first tool out of the tool-box when a problem arises.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a tool. No more. No less. The user of the tool is what's most important.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) I've heard about banks having certain hiring programs that filter in favor of psychopathy. I have yet to find one of these papers, but you can just look at the business world and it's littered with psychopaths. Watch the Enron documentary for a great look at psychopathy in action.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this is more of a top-down thing than a bottom-up thing. People tend to behave relative to the context in which they find themselves. If the context is one in which psychopathic traits are valued then the person will tend to mentally migrate toward acceptance of psychopathic traits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out the Stanford Prison Experiment for details.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) You actually
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       relate to psychopathy on some level. Interestingly psychopaths have identical neurological wiring as any other human. The key difference is that they don't use al of it. You're the same as any psychopath; only as where they rely primarily on the base of the brain you use the base as well as the pre-frontal cortex.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is fundamentally important.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pre-frontal cortex.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pre-frontal cortex is where all the cool stuff is. This is where art, God, empathy, deep analysis, behavior modification / inhibition and so on all come into play. Without this you cannot inhibit your behavior - or at least it's much harder to do so (psychopaths are infamous for their inability to control themselves).
      </p>
      <p>
       The base of the brain - reptilian part - is where literally
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       decision making happens. You make decisions with the same part of the brain a psychopath does. But you have access to deeper and more subtle styles of thought the psychopath does not. You make your decisions with other people in mind as where a psychopath does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the same wiring. But yours is better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the power thing is pretty key. You'll find that our for yourself as you investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) You're correct about them being the few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people estimate between 3 and 5 percent occurrence of psychopathy in the population. Since they favor power this is very likely much higher as you go into certain occupations and career fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.) This is a never ending battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will never not be psychopaths as far as I can tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn as much as you can about everything you can.

       Psychopaths and sociopaths are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both are recent terms and clinicians describe both with identical terminology.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's something also very much worth considering: the people who implement and conduct the plans of the psychopaths are normal people. You and everyone you know use U.S. Dollars; these are tools of the psychopaths. This isn't to say you can't have you own money system. And it's not even that you're bad for using the U.S. Dollar. The point is illustrative. The psychopaths have systems that they expect us to follow and we dutifully follow. There is a relationship between the manipulator and the manipulated that needs to be examined.

       Sociopaths and psychopaths are not one in the same. Psychopaths are aware of their lack of feeling and empathy, and are master manipulators for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sociopaths aren't fully aware of their lack of feelings, thus making them less prone to manipulating and being in positions of power.

       I'm sorry to disagree with you, but all of the literature I've read is to the contrary of your beliefs.

       Not that it matters.

       it is that you dont like them, thats what drives us to change the world for the better. Its a good thing to recognize corruption in others on a collective level. this is revolution inducing. we Need to hate, to abhor, to revile these people, and organisations. They strangle us, and sometimes that alone is not enough. We are no longer oppressed, we are at the 100th monkey stage (and I mean specifically now, with leaking being integral to this). More people believe, more people question, more people and standing up and realizing.
  Having said all this, we still have a lot to do to bring ourselves collectively forward like teasing a thorn out of a wound.
       <br/>
       Our whole society and system of governance (globalist imperialistic consumer based , waste and debt driven society) is based on our participation in a perceived dependence on Big Brother. Now it has reached the stage where we have become like domesticated dogs. 
 We think our brains our blunt and theirs our sharp. We think we need them for food, for communication and without them we should be fearful of the dark. 
  If we want to tell our own stories to our grandchildren about this difficult era in human consciousness, We have a duty to ourselves to remove us from this perpetual cycle of oppression by different means. We need to come back to fundamentals, education, agriculture and ethics. We need to become spiritual without the dark walls of institutionalized religion monopolizing off of it.
We, more than everything, have a duty to the future of the free human race to defend freedom so fervently that we are willing to die for it.

       When you realize everything is bullshit, essentially we are all slaves to money which runs the machine that perpetuates all the evil that we see on a daily basis. Here's a question for you. What now? This is the crossroads that I am currently at. What do we do? When is enough? It is to hard to just "plug" back into the system. It is only getting worse.

       Definitely should take a look at this article x/post from r/psychonaut and written by the OP. May help you restore your faith in humanity somewhat, only paying back the favor after reading your post. Check out r/psychonaut, you'd feel welcome there.

       Crazy idea time, put on your foil hats and buckle up. This may jarr you, but think about it before you bite me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love your rant, we are supposed to keep evolving and the ones in charge are wanting to lock humanity in place forever. They want to do this with the NWO w/ a side of selective breeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't insta hate me for saying this but think about it first. If we, as an evolving species would like to take a good long break from same-species conflict, and focus on science/technology for the next 232 years (aprox time till we have star reaching tech) we
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       a "new world order". Not the NWO they are selling you at this moment though.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have to do is very forcefully take the scepter from the ones who are holding it. Change how things are done and keep the world piece.
Put all liberties back in place and give the people their lives back again. Yes fringe groups will still wage conflict, but as an entire planet focused on survival and spread, it won't take long to take care of that problem (each time it pops up)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a numbers game. You get every Country working collectively as a whole, things will go along so much faster than just Indonesia working alone. Now it's risky and delicate, but with proper guidelines this can be managed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any
       <strong>
        <em>
         SERIOUS
        </em>
       </strong>
       questions/comments will be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Each Country will remain the same sans the fuck-o's, but working in unison.

       you are absolutely right.  The majority of people working towards a world order are not psychopaths, psychopaths just make for effective leaders.  Most world leaders are just looking towards the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       There IS a threat that technology could wipe us out before we reach our apex status and evolve to the next stage.  We are at a critical juncture in our species.  Man is in the process of merging with machine, both physically and consciously.  Depending on your perspective, perhaps that may not be the ideal progress for humanity, but that is where we are being led.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to the conflict between those vying for control of the world order, there is likely going to be a conflict between those who cannot afford this technological evolution and those who can.  This is what the security lockdown is about.

       Based on the technological advances in the world today, people should be working LESS than ever before and their standard of living should be going up MORE than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, they are working more than ever before and their standard of living is going down not up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for all this is very simple... those at the top are taking all the extra profit associated with increased productivity through technological advancement and simply keeping it for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the most powerful people who run our corporations and government are focused purely on gaming the masses for their own financial benefit human progress with not only occur much slower than it should, it will go off in directions that it never otherwise would have.

       Not to shit on Bill, but that other 90% does some pretty important things that we don't really notice. Breathing, digestion, shitting, muscle contractions, changing the pupil to react to variations of light. It sends that electrical trigger so you don't have to think about doing it every time.
