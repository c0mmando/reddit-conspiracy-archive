       This worries me compounded by the post I read citing he is a government plot to distract from other news. I cannot find the post at the moment though.

       Agreeing. Pretty self explanatory I thought. The defamation of snowdens name is exactly what MSM is doing. They won't talk about anything except him being a high school drop out and the fact his gf was a stripper. They are attacking his character instead of dealing with the issues

       It sucks. People are already starting to believe the propaganda too. I was at the barber shop getting a haircut and I asked the people in there what they thought about the NSA situation. The majority of people agreed that Snowden is a traitor and deserves to be executed or thrown in prison. The media can do wonders.

       A lot of people think Assange is controlled opposition or even an outright gatekeeper. It wouldn't surprise me that this whole scandal has been orchestrated by TPTB. The entire "national conversation" has been shifted, thanks to the lamestream media, from the government violating constitutional law to the dangerous leaker Snowden and his game of international shadows.

       This is exactly right. It does not matter one lick whether Snowden is a hero, traitor, homosexual, or Tyrannosaurus Rex. The real question is ALWAYS about the information a whistleblower reveals.

       Really? It seems more to teach the lesson to leave the country before blowing the whistle than the whistle shouldn't be blown.
      </p>
      <p>
       A smart guy like that willing to give up all that he has to get the word out about what's going down? Well, shit, I would think that would tell us that things are serious and we
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       keep blowing the fucking whistle if we don't want whatever shit that's going down to bite
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of us in the ass. And if you yourself don't have a whistle to blow? Then use what you do know to get something done. There's plenty of publicly available info to get angry over and do something about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wondering if we should restart Occupy Wall Street. Do you think the police will kick us out this time? Or... maybe we could start holding protests inside military bases. Just sort of file in during the day, and wander about, then at a specified time go to a field somewhere and start protesting there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the soldiers going to do? Shoot us? Or maybe they don't like shit that's been going down, either. Maybe they'll join us in the protest.

       Just like everything else "they" want to control, take the focus off what you cannot control and put it on what you can, the character you plan on assassinating or worshiping. Look at Christianity, "they" have taught the followers of a peace loving, money hating, humanitarian to hate peace, love money, and wage war. They did it by teaching them to worship the man instead of following his message. From there everything you convince them this person said is worshiped.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this instance the same technique is used but in the reverse way. Character Assassination, the reason "credibility" is everything in law and substance is nothing. Look at Julian Assange and Bradley Manning kill the character of the messenger and you eliminate the credibility of the message. And from there anything they say will be dismissed as lies. This is nothing new it has been going on for thousands of years and humanity is blind to it for the most part.

       I don't get it then.  You want to talk about the revelation that Snowden brought.  The NSA is listening and recording everything.  Ok.  Got it.  Some of us have known about this for a while now.  So what's the point?  Or are you just still shocked by it?

       Ok, well for starters, much of the problem with the prism program is that the NSA has a little room at each of the hubs where they split the signal.  Get rid of these.  Make the NSA have to develop its own infrastructure.  It's hard, but they can do it.  If it can be guaranteed by service companies that the only way to get information deemed private is through a court order, it will go some ways to making the system step in the right direction..  Cleaning up the courts is a different matter.

       Think, folks:  if the media wanted to black-out the entire Snowden story, they could and they would.  But they aren't doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now why is that?  Could it possibly be that this entire leak is scripted from day one?  Perhaps Snowden is not really seeking political asylum anywhere but is merely following orders sent down from above to play the role of a political hero.

       Because the data itself is pretty straight forward. Boiled down, every person who uses an electronic device on this planet is basically being tracked, or having a file assembled on them. Outside of the US it is boiling, and people are pissed. They can't trust america. That's part of the reason US media is blaring Snowden. They feel if they keep it on him long enough, people won't realize what's been going on. The worst part is, as time goes on, the government is declassifying and releasing more and more, raising the question, did this Leak do any real harm to america, or did it just show an ugly secret that TPTB didn't really want out there?

       Thank you! I thought I was the only one who noticed this. He's always referred to as a "leaker" which has a certain negative connotation about it that "whistleblower" doesn't. Kudos to you.

       the media has managed to brainwash about 50% of the population...probably higher.  then probably about 40% know something is wrong but are afraid to speak out against it for fear of being called unpatriotic.  scary shit

       It's a common tactic. Discredit the man and don't even acknowledge that everything he said is true.

       The difference is that many Americans see through this narrative. Those who are too stupid to understand what media spin is will likely never reach this point but it is important to point out how MSM paints anything anti - establishment as being conspiracy lunatic fringe.

       The gov doesn't want any discussion of the constitutionality of the massive surveillance programs, so they and the lapdog media are keeping the focus on Snowden, not the illegal programs.

       all eyes are waiting for snowden next move, that's why U.S. wants him so bad and labeling him a traitor. snowden can shine more light into how dark our gov. truly is. he might also have answers to many other secrets like aliens, assassinations, elitist and many more untold secrecy hidden by the gov.

       Agreeing. Pretty self explanatory I thought. The defamation of snowdens name is exactly what MSM is doing. They won't talk about anything except him being a high school drop out and the fact his gf was a stripper. They are attacking his character instead of dealing with the issues
