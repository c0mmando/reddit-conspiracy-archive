    <div class="md"><p>Really? It seems more to teach the lesson to leave the country before blowing the whistle than the whistle shouldn&#39;t be blown.</p>

<p>A smart guy like that willing to give up all that he has to get the word out about what&#39;s going down? Well, shit, I would think that would tell us that things are serious and we <em>better</em> keep blowing the fucking whistle if we don&#39;t want whatever shit that&#39;s going down to bite <em>all</em> of us in the ass. And if you yourself don&#39;t have a whistle to blow? Then use what you do know to get something done. There&#39;s plenty of publicly available info to get angry over and do something about.</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if we should restart Occupy Wall Street. Do you think the police will kick us out this time? Or... maybe we could start holding protests inside military bases. Just sort of file in during the day, and wander about, then at a specified time go to a field somewhere and start protesting there.</p>

<p>What are the soldiers going to do? Shoot us? Or maybe they don&#39;t like shit that&#39;s been going down, either. Maybe they&#39;ll join us in the protest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like everything else &quot;they&quot; want to control, take the focus off what you cannot control and put it on what you can, the character you plan on assassinating or worshiping. Look at Christianity, &quot;they&quot; have taught the followers of a peace loving, money hating, humanitarian to hate peace, love money, and wage war. They did it by teaching them to worship the man instead of following his message. From there everything you convince them this person said is worshiped.</p>

<p>In this instance the same technique is used but in the reverse way. Character Assassination, the reason &quot;credibility&quot; is everything in law and substance is nothing. Look at Julian Assange and Bradley Manning kill the character of the messenger and you eliminate the credibility of the message. And from there anything they say will be dismissed as lies. This is nothing new it has been going on for thousands of years and humanity is blind to it for the most part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, well for starters, much of the problem with the prism program is that the NSA has a little room at each of the hubs where they split the signal.  Get rid of these.  Make the NSA have to develop its own infrastructure.  It&#39;s hard, but they can do it.  If it can be guaranteed by service companies that the only way to get information deemed private is through a court order, it will go some ways to making the system step in the right direction..  Cleaning up the courts is a different matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think, folks:  if the media wanted to black-out the entire Snowden story, they could and they would.  But they aren&#39;t doing that.</p>

<p>Now why is that?  Could it possibly be that this entire leak is scripted from day one?  Perhaps Snowden is not really seeking political asylum anywhere but is merely following orders sent down from above to play the role of a political hero.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the data itself is pretty straight forward. Boiled down, every person who uses an electronic device on this planet is basically being tracked, or having a file assembled on them. Outside of the US it is boiling, and people are pissed. They can&#39;t trust america. That&#39;s part of the reason US media is blaring Snowden. They feel if they keep it on him long enough, people won&#39;t realize what&#39;s been going on. The worst part is, as time goes on, the government is declassifying and releasing more and more, raising the question, did this Leak do any real harm to america, or did it just show an ugly secret that TPTB didn&#39;t really want out there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! I thought I was the only one who noticed this. He&#39;s always referred to as a &quot;leaker&quot; which has a certain negative connotation about it that &quot;whistleblower&quot; doesn&#39;t. Kudos to you.</p>

<p>The difference is that many Americans see through this narrative. Those who are too stupid to understand what media spin is will likely never reach this point but it is important to point out how MSM paints anything anti - establishment as being conspiracy lunatic fringe. </p>
