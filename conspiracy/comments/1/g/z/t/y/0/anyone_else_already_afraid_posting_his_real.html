       Then I proceed to delete the comment. I am already using a different account again and I am looking forward to get total encryption of my internet connection, before I will feel safe again posting anything 'critical' online.

       No, because taking such measures only declares you to be someone with something to hide. My statements stand, regardless of if they're being stored somewhere. We cannot let fear of the NSA and surveillance to impel us towards self-censorship and inaction, because that's how they'll win.

       Seems too much. Just my two cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are the unstoppable force you seem to consider them to be, what's a little encryption to crack? Or allowing that prevents them spying, what's a lie and action against you going to be deterred by?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're assuming the worst; is it not reasonable to expect no matter what the precaution, there's a method for bypassing it, they know of? Or can devise?

       It could be said, in the past, that all empires fall; that no tyranny can last forever. But not this time. This time, the US regime is striving for a supremacy against which no number of people could ever rebel again, once gained. The superiority of their technology, and their ability to stifle the development of technology by others, will make it so that a very few people in power can maintain control of everyone else on earth. So I approach this battle with an all-or-nothing mentality. I do not think about what might be used against me afterward, if we fail, because nothing could be worse than an eternity of mental and physical slavery, which is exactly what's at stake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the US military has fully automated its drones so they need no pilots, equipped them all with solar panels so they never need to be re-fueled, implemented 3D printing technology that can replace any number of them which get shot down, cloaked them in wave-bending metamaterials that make them invisible to sensors and eyes alike, and outfited them all with multi-spectral imaging algorithms that can see and track everyone, everywhere, all the time, it will be all over. There is no escaping such a complete stranglehold. No uprising could ever gain momentum before they quashed it, no rebel with a cause could ever hide, no freedom from them could ever be attained again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't worry about what you say online, or what you do in attempt to overthrow them. There is no worse alternative than their victory. We
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       prevail. We must dismantle and eject the powers that be, and we must do it NOW!

       Thank you, I am working on several, although they will take a while as I like to be quite thorough. But there will be no need to buy them; I will share my intellectual property freely, as I have taken freely the intellectual property of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, definitely pick your moment with care. Do your homework and find a sweet spot that you can strike to damage the infrastructure of this government. Words have failed, and action has regretably become necessary, but with the right tact, and great care, we can affect massive damage with no loss to life. The machine is already in dis-repair from borderline insolvency: bridges crumbling left and right, law enforcement stretched thin, prisons more crowded than ever, and a financial sector on the verge of rampant inflation. Now is the time to remove a few more supports and bring it all down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'll be ugly for those not prepared to survive for a while without a trip to walmart, but it must be done. If they can't afford to pay the soldiers and police, then they won't long have an army to withstand us and we can force them out of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wear that dissident badge proudly, but stay cautious and vigilant. If we accidentally harm people in the process, the rest of the public will turn against us. And make sure to record as much as you can, or they'll paint you as a monster to distract from their own fangs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And always keep an eye on what needs to be done afterward. The purpose is not to exact vengence, but to clear the garbage so that we can rebuild. Personally, I recommend that we look heavily into online governance, now that quantum computers are taking off. They create the possibility of un-hackable networks, enabling far greater security in online governance than in representative governance. And the speed with which we can obtain the opinions of huge numbers of people online makes most government positions obsolete now anyway. It is the power, not the people, that corrupts the system. Any time we give people power over their neighbors, they will end up using it, almost without fail, and we cannot rely on the hope that we have elected the few people who would resist that temptation. The positions of power must be eliminated. The playing field must be leveled, and to every person must be returned his and her own voice and vote.

       Something along those lines. It is almost inhumanly difficult to create realistic projection of future society, but it is perhaps more important than ever to attempt to do so for our time. Technology moves so quickly, and people stay so busy, that we are hurtling into a future we know almost nothing about, and it behooves us to look at where we might be heading before we are already there.

       People are overloaded with information, so I am attempting to sift through a great deal of it and make concise what would otherwise remain an overwhelming labrynth of data. I often doubt that I'm anywhere near capable of the task, but I have to try because I suspect that this is the lifetime in which humanity will either rise above its survivalist evolutionary imparatives, or grind itself back into the dust. Whatever small influence I can have, I'd like it to be uplifting.

       But I will take no riches for any of it. I prefer to live simply and minimally. I'm no saint, and like the people against whom I fight today, I might just as easily succumb to the temptations of too much wealth and power, so I eschew it as much as I am able. I'll be happy to see anyone read what I write for free.

       Laws violating the constitution are illegal. You cannot stand against your oppressors without accepting there will be consequences.  But the spirit of freedom dwells within and it cannot be stymied indefinitely because nothing is absolute. Do not fear. Fear is the mind killer.

       If we fear retaliation for speaking our minds, we're already imprisoned. I would rather die in a FEMA camp for speaking out than live in an America where I was afraid to speak.

       Something along those lines. It is almost inhumanly difficult to create realistic projection of future society, but it is perhaps more important than ever to attempt to do so for our time. Technology moves so quickly, and people stay so busy, that we are hurtling into a future we know almost nothing about, and it behooves us to look at where we might be heading before we are already there.
