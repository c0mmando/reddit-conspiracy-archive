<p>If they are the unstoppable force you seem to consider them to be, what&#39;s a little encryption to crack? Or allowing that prevents them spying, what&#39;s a lie and action against you going to be deterred by?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re assuming the worst; is it not reasonable to expect no matter what the precaution, there&#39;s a method for bypassing it, they know of? Or can devise?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be said, in the past, that all empires fall; that no tyranny can last forever. But not this time. This time, the US regime is striving for a supremacy against which no number of people could ever rebel again, once gained. The superiority of their technology, and their ability to stifle the development of technology by others, will make it so that a very few people in power can maintain control of everyone else on earth. So I approach this battle with an all-or-nothing mentality. I do not think about what might be used against me afterward, if we fail, because nothing could be worse than an eternity of mental and physical slavery, which is exactly what&#39;s at stake. </p>

<p>Once the US military has fully automated its drones so they need no pilots, equipped them all with solar panels so they never need to be re-fueled, implemented 3D printing technology that can replace any number of them which get shot down, cloaked them in wave-bending metamaterials that make them invisible to sensors and eyes alike, and outfited them all with multi-spectral imaging algorithms that can see and track everyone, everywhere, all the time, it will be all over. There is no escaping such a complete stranglehold. No uprising could ever gain momentum before they quashed it, no rebel with a cause could ever hide, no freedom from them could ever be attained again. </p>

<p>So don&#39;t worry about what you say online, or what you do in attempt to overthrow them. There is no worse alternative than their victory. We <em>must</em> prevail. We must dismantle and eject the powers that be, and we must do it NOW!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I am working on several, although they will take a while as I like to be quite thorough. But there will be no need to buy them; I will share my intellectual property freely, as I have taken freely the intellectual property of others. </p>

<p>And yes, definitely pick your moment with care. Do your homework and find a sweet spot that you can strike to damage the infrastructure of this government. Words have failed, and action has regretably become necessary, but with the right tact, and great care, we can affect massive damage with no loss to life. The machine is already in dis-repair from borderline insolvency: bridges crumbling left and right, law enforcement stretched thin, prisons more crowded than ever, and a financial sector on the verge of rampant inflation. Now is the time to remove a few more supports and bring it all down. </p>

<p>It&#39;ll be ugly for those not prepared to survive for a while without a trip to walmart, but it must be done. If they can&#39;t afford to pay the soldiers and police, then they won&#39;t long have an army to withstand us and we can force them out of power. </p>

<p>Wear that dissident badge proudly, but stay cautious and vigilant. If we accidentally harm people in the process, the rest of the public will turn against us. And make sure to record as much as you can, or they&#39;ll paint you as a monster to distract from their own fangs. </p>

<p>And always keep an eye on what needs to be done afterward. The purpose is not to exact vengence, but to clear the garbage so that we can rebuild. Personally, I recommend that we look heavily into online governance, now that quantum computers are taking off. They create the possibility of un-hackable networks, enabling far greater security in online governance than in representative governance. And the speed with which we can obtain the opinions of huge numbers of people online makes most government positions obsolete now anyway. It is the power, not the people, that corrupts the system. Any time we give people power over their neighbors, they will end up using it, almost without fail, and we cannot rely on the hope that we have elected the few people who would resist that temptation. The positions of power must be eliminated. The playing field must be leveled, and to every person must be returned his and her own voice and vote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something along those lines.
