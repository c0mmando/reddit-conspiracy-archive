       We're often known as a bunch of "tin foil hatters" to other redditors. We've been consistently mocked as "loons" and "idiots" yet when something finally comes out in the open , we don't receive much credit for it, so I've put together a list of links that show just how long we've been talking about this NSA surveillance and why people should maybe start to listen a bit more instead of mocking us. My question is, What else are we right about?

       Yes... And the rest of America has known about it since at least 2005 when the New York Times reported on the surveillance supercomputer in a hidden room at AT&amp;T... Some just forgot about it.

       Yes... Yes they have. It was in the papers, in the news, in high profile court cases... Hell, Bush even admitted it publicly. Everything you're seeing this month has been done before, six and a half years ago. And then people stopped caring and pushed it to the back of their minds. Many will probably do so again, and then we'll be having this exact conversation yet again in a few more years.

       It really does seem that conspiracy theorists are quite often right - or at least close to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       More often that some might think, the "crazy conspiracy nuts" have noticed, researched, learned, and documented the truth that others would deny. Then, maybe years later, all of their "wild speculation" turns out to be completely true.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that everybody with a tinfoil hat is a well-informed genius, and that doesn't mean that every little thing is a huge clandestine operation. But I think people who normally dismiss things like this are starting to pay attention.

       I was talking to one of my friends about this and his response was "are you really surprised?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And I guess that's true - nobody is even surprised. We've lived in a state with an infinitely powerful government with its military set to perpetual war for all of our lives. We just accept it now, don't know the difference. I can't even say that I'm somehow above that, I don't know the difference either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's been a lot of people's reaction - shrug their shoulders and say "I'm not surprised, but there's nothing you can do about it"

       I've heard things about the NSA since 2003 keeping all communications. In the 60s the government funded the research and development of the internet. I believe the origins started in Nazi Germany (IBM anyone?) It is no secret about the Bell/At&amp;t telephone was a government sanctioned monopoly from 1913 (what else happened that year?) to 1984. Today the "regional bell operating companies" are at&amp;t, verizon, century link/qwest, alcatel/lucent, avaya, etc....
Now look at this link:

       Is helps to distract us from many other topics like an escalating war in Syria which could easily lead us into Iran, Distract us from the failing congress as they are taken over by corporate interest in the public's view, and to keep the people busy thinking about Snowden's pole dancing ex... I fapped to that before the news broke.

       Can we actually convince the government to stop funding rebels in Syria? I don't know if there's ever been a war that we've successfully prevented/repealed via protests. How do we stop it?

       I feel that we as people cannot stop this without massive protest within the next month. 4th of July would make the biggest statement if we all posted up on Federal properties in our home towns for BBQ and protest. Then the next step is to not produce or go to work the following week, yet as 50%+ of Americans are paycheck to paycheck this may not work. But a protest of this ideal must replace the Democript and Rebloodican divides and bring the people together against a tyrannical power.  Once freedom is lost in America world leader's guns and bombs wills blaze the urban areas into a more manageable population level.  I predict this will be pawned off on the next president as i dont think we will be fully engage in Iran for a while. Our citizenry does a lot better if we prep them with years of propaganda before blowing up people in a country they can't locate on a map.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Kinda a tangent rant there, but I believe our entry into war with Iran will bring about a full loss of the individual American's freedom cause your gonna have to be with us or against us, and now with the NSA completing their plans just in time to be exposed, they are ready.

       You are not ridiculed because of this. You are ridiculed because of your insane, heartless beliefs of Sandy Hook, The Boston Bombing, 911, assumptions of false flags, governments executing people, FEMA camps and things of that nature. And now you are being rediculed for making a posting like this. Everyone has had their suspicions of the NSA. No credit to this subreddit. You did not reveal anything that wasn't known already.

       Well, no shit.  This same exact thing was a huge story back in 2005-2006 when I think the New York Times had a front page article on it.  Some people forgot about it while others didni't.  The reason that this Snowden thing is such a big deal is because we haven't had any evidence of it that was this solid since 2006, thus proving that the program has continued and expanded under Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody who was old enough and actually paid attention to the news in 2005 was surprised that the NSA collects all of our communication.
