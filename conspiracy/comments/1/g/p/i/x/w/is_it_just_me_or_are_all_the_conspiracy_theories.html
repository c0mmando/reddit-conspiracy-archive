<p>TWA Flight 800 actually was shot down by a missile? Genetically modified foods really do cause infertility and cancer? The government really is giving arms and weapons to Al Qaeda? The NSA and CIA are recording everything and creating a cashless society control grid? The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th amendments no longer exist? The entire financial system of interest rates is fixed by a handful of elite bankers?</p>

It&#39;s not a fucking game, nor is it a contest. If you&#39;re only now starting to realize that this shit is real, you&#39;re arriving at the party too late.</p>

<p>Google Project for a New American Century (PNAC), Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses (published in 2000). They said that they needed a &#39;New Pearl Harbor&quot;. Imagine that, a year later they got one. This shit has been written in the wall for a ling time and nobody wanted to see it. Now it&#39;s pretty much too late to do anything but watch the police state apparatus close its jaws around us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Little late to the party? you think? </p>

<p>Find someone who&#39;s been doing this longer then you and learn.. and prepare...and then learn some more. Then prepare some more..Whatever you think you know and are prepared for...let me just be the first to say You don&#39;t know shit and aren&#39;t prepared for shit. Life could get extremely brutal with literally just the flip of the banker&#39;s switch. Read about the Chechnyan Revolution or about japanese internment. About how lighter&#39;s could afford an entire weeks meal. Learn about what it&#39;s like to try and take a simple nap or piss or shit during a revolution. This shit is real and we are going to see it with our very own eyes and probably within a generation. </p>

<p>Like Doctor brain wave said..this isn&#39;t a contest or a fucking game..this is real life. These people already know you... they already know all of us more then likely(I can almost guarantee not many here are good enough at computers to cover their tracks). These conspiracies aren&#39;t coming true.. They are just becoming known. Yes some conspiracies are happening in the now and its becoming easier to pick them apart. But let&#39;s face it..the biggest conspiracy of pretty much the century happened right in front of our faces and half of the population still believes it was those would be terrorists and their box cutters. The propaganda and mind control are STRONG with tptb.</p>

<p>Are conspiracies true? yes. Have they been all along? yes. Will they continue to be? Yes. At least until as a nation we take accountability and responsibility for our inaction and inability to make sure that the people&#39;s will was done by our supposed leaders. </p>

<p>Best advice: Learn and prepare..and then...learn and prepare some more.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t think I am berating you either. This is a simple communication of me telling you to get out of your own head. Take in as much as you can and realize that conspiracies are tied in to the very existence of our being. They have literally been around since the dawn of man. Our history is shaped by it and our future will be too unless we can know and accept the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think these things are being &#39;shut down&#39; on the back end of government, so the media only brings it up once it&#39;s been handled, thus handing over the problem unless the white house wants to admit to the american people that they have some rogue factions in control of certain channels of information. The 3 letter agencies (NSA, DHS, CIA, etc.) were probably using the surveillance to spy even within government, but once the whistle was blown, it may be that they were stopped so they hand the story off to the media so the elected folk can take all the blame right on the forehead. It&#39;s actually quite smart - use these injustices to your advantage, and when caught, throw the story to the public so they can get enraged and create more distractions.</p>

<p>Veteran&#39;s Today (not a great source, but nonetheless) has been saying there has been an internal struggle in the intelligence/military agencies over the last year or so. They claim this is why all of the &#39;shootings/events&#39; (newtown, batman, boston, etc.) have been so sloppy; there are elements who are trying to make the machine fall apart in the public view. So I think that could be what is happening here (just my opinion, not saying its absolute)...</p>

<p>I actually saw another theory on this idea in that Snowden was put in a position of extreme power when he was made an administrator of the NSA system. I believe that is not a role you just flippantly hand out. Some are arguing that it seems like Snowden was set up to blow the whistle by somebody within; usually a 3rd party contractor would not be put in such a position where they could compromise the entire NSA system very easily, or without great checks &amp; balances. We could be seeing the public angle of an internal struggle. </p>

<p>Personally, I think the White Houses&#39; information channels have all been hijacked a long time ago and that whoever is president is usually working with only a half-deck of cards at any one point. If i&#39;m a person of great power, influence, and potency, and I want to control government, why would I waste my time with the elected officials who may or may not switch out for new people every 4 years? Instead i&#39;d try to control the bureaucracy that doesn&#39;t switch over all the time. There has to be structure in washington; politicians have to delegate much of their work and depend greatly on intelligence reports and advisors. If the white house was being given bad information &#39;by mistake&#39;, how would they ever prove/deal with it? Tell the american public there is a shadowy hand they can&#39;t control? How quickly would he be impeached/lose all confidence if Obama said that?</p>

<p>I always say that if I were a family that owns the federal reserve and I were in control of selling money to countries, I wouldn&#39;t want anybody to know my face or name. That&#39;s what we&#39;re dealing with here - a faceless monster. Hopefully these things continue to come to light and we can start seeing some change. We&#39;ll have to wait and see tho...</p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, &#39;old tradition&#39; doesn&#39;t quite scratch the surface of what it all really entails.

Also, with the rapid economic decline, I&#39;m not sure funding rebels and terrorists is going to continue at its past scale, either.
About the magical/mystical aspect- I agree that no supernatural forces are at work, but I do think that many key figures in the &quot;power structure&quot; are practicing occultists/illuminists- hence New Age religion becoming so prolific in the last decade or so.  I honestly don&#39;t think this &quot;new spirituality&quot; shift is a human response to dogma, fundamentalism and &quot;the failings of the Church, but another manufactured control device.   </p>

</blockquote>

<p>While I largely agree with your insights, I would point out that an <strong>armed</strong> mob remains a mob - a chaotic, unfocused force.</p>

<p><strong>Who is the &quot;enemy&quot;?</strong> It is undefined and enigmatic by design. Can you identify who or what should be the focus of the energy of resistance?</p>

<p>In order to be effective, the &quot;mob&quot; would need to communicate, organize and work together toward a common goal - that means accepting and recognizing a leadership. </p>

<p>But who to trust with that leadership? The Bolsheviks have a lesson to teach us in &quot;revolution&quot;.</p>

<p>The raw energy of the mob is surprisingly predictable. The enigmatic &quot;enemy&quot; has long studied &quot;mob psychology&quot;, and is well skilled in manipulating that raw energy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that there is no hope, but I am saying that we should tread carefully, and be wary of &quot;false messiahs&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>However we should be mindful that those who seek to increase their power are extremely clever an resourceful, and are fully aware that the best was to convince The People to surrender their rights is to contrive a position under which they will ask - nay - BEG that their rights be abandoned in the name of achieving some short-sighted goal.</p>

<p>False-flags are real, and they are not necessarily easy to recognize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve researched and read that manual pretty extensively, and researched the job that it covers.  The manual was never leaked, it&#39;s a standard army manual that&#39;s been around for years.  The PDF is only 3 clicks away from the front page of the Army&#39;s primary documentation site (<a href="http://www.apd.army.mil/">http://www.apd.army.mil/</a>).  The sites that make it out to be something sinister typically piece together quotes out of context from different parts of the manual to make it sound like something it&#39;s not.  All of what&#39;s described in the manual seem like something that the army would realistically have to deal with sometimes.  If there&#39;s something inappropriate or sinister about this manual, it would take quite a bit more research into the job and the history of the document to show it.  I suspect that although it may have changed names, this job and manual probably have existed in the army in some form for decades.</p>

<p>I would have to argue the contrary here. Sports have been around since ancient times (the Olympics), and many cultures without a form of currency (such as the Iroquois and lacrosse) participated in sporting events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I agree that sports have (obviously) become a major spectacle and can help pacify the population, I would still have to disagree that they were created for that sole purpose. Maybe that comes from the bias that I hold (former college basketball player, whole family is deeply involved in sports).</p>

<p>I think that the government has taken advantage of the joy and passion that sports bring to the people, and spun it in a way to benefit them. However, there is no denying the government is involved in sports now. Just look at the steroid hearings for MLB a few years ago, senators who knew nothing about the game were conducting the trials.</p>

Isn&#39;t GMO usually just combining the genes of, for example, a strain of wheat that grows tall and a strain of wheat that is resistant to cold weather? Humans have been cross-breading plants for years and years; the modern banana is a sweat version of a fruit that was similar to a plantain developed in the 1800&#39;s, and the strawberry is a cross between a flower from the Carolinas area and a cousin of it from the Brazil area.

    <div class="md"><p>Here we go, this might be confusing but here&#39;s the general gist: GMOs are not innately bad; the current GMO <strong>strategies</strong> are evil-incarnate. </p>

<p>The main GMOs of today are crops that have been modified to be glyphosate resistant. Glyphosates are extremely toxic herbicides and a few ml will kill a person in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>So what has Monsanto gone and done? They make crops glyphosate resistant so crops can take it up into their system, but the glyphosate will not dry out the plant, it just stays in the plant doing nothing (until you eat it). Then they tell farmers to spray all the glyphosate they want, it won&#39;t harm your crops. So the farms do, they spray that shit everywhere, and indeed, it kills the weeds but leaves the crops intact. After a few seasons, the glyphosate concentration in the ground increases, and increases, and increases, and increases. Until eventually we&#39;ll have lettuce with enough PPM of glyphosate that it starts outright killing people after you eat it. The cancers and such you start getting before the PPM reaches a lethal dose.</p>

<p>That is why GMOs aren&#39;t inherently bad, it&#39;s the GMO strategies that we use that are going to kill us.</p>

There is an app called fooducate you can download for free, you can scan stuff and it will tell you if it could be gmo product or not as well as other neat options.

    <div class="md"><p>It is very difficult, indeed. Monsanto, Cargill, Bayer, and Dow Chemical essentially control all domestic food production in the United States and a large part of the UK, Canada, Germany, and a few other nations.</p>

<p>Monsanto, for instance, owns the patents on the base genome for 95% of all soybeans produced in the US. Think about that, they control if and when seeds are allowed to be bought, sold, modified, etc. Now consider how much soy is now in the American diet. You can hardly escape it.</p>

<p>Another poster mentioned strawberries. This is a good one, because there are essentially no pure strains of strawberries left anywhere in the the entire world. Even the wild berries have been contaminated by the GMO&#39;d versions and are essentially extinct for all intents and purposes.</p>

<p>Corn? Forget it, even most local farmers use Monsanto, Cargill, Dow, or Bayer corn stock. There&#39;s no way you can verify one way or another without having it taken and examined at a lab.</p>

<p>Wheat, barley, rye and oats are a tossup. Large producers are most certainly using the GMO&#39;d versions, leaving you to search out specialty suppliers.</p>

<p>So, what can you do? There are options to purchase organic from specialty producers, but even then you must be careful, as about 3-4 companies up the organic company subsidiary chain, guess who&#39;s staring back at you.</p>

<p>Probably not. There&#39;s has been discussion of what the NSA is <em>actually</em> doing in the mainstream media for years.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th amendments no longer exist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. If you just read the headlines on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you might think this, but if you&#39;re actually familiar with the court cases and history, it&#39;s just not true. Yesterday on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> there was a story about how now, due to a new court ruling, your keeping silent could be held against you! But if you actually read the details, this was a gross distortion. The person was trying to create a new right and the argument was rejected by the court. This wasn&#39;t the elimination of some previously-recognized right.</p>

<p>A few days ago, there was a story about how the Supreme Court was banning all protest at the Supreme Court. What a rape of the 1st Amendment! Unless you actually read the details, when you find out that this was just a more precise statement of the rules that have been in place since 1947.</p>

<p>The courts are recognizing broader Second Amendment rights now than ever before in history. Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller">DC v. Heller</a>, the Second Amendment is much stronger.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Third Amendment</a>, dude? Seriously? Or are you trolling?</p>

<p>Also, <em>all conspiracy theories</em>? Lizard men? The moon is not real? There were no Japanese planes at Pearl Harbor? I could go on and on.</p>

<p>Nothing is as it appears, nothing we&#39;ve been told is wholly true. </p>

<p>I wonder, as you admit to trolling here quite some time, how many people have you claimed were conspiratards?</p>

<p>How many <a href="/u/jcm267">/u/jcm267</a> are there in here now? Bastards.</p>

<p>An if you have a look over at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, they&#39;re still hard at work denying that any of this is actual truth. They just mock any and all &#39;revelations&#39; or truth to conspiracies because they dislike Alex Jones or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to say I agree with a large amount of those conspiracies, however there are some that I don&#39;t agree with, however I respect your right to believe as you wish. Should you allow me to speak on one of those conspiracies, GM food products to be exact, I would like to share my opinion on it. </p>

<p>As a student attending University for Biochemistry and Bio technologies in order to one day become a Genetic Engineer myself. I don&#39;t believe GM foods when made properly can cause cancer. When you introduce a modified gene into an organisms DNA, it mostly is to produce a new or different amino acid sequence which results in a protein, enzyme, or catalyst for a reaction. There are some proteins that could cause damage to DNA and therefor result in cancer, however, if the Genetic engineers analyze the organism to determine all chemicals of that sample they can find the protein produced by the chance and determine its effects, both beneficial and adverse.  </p>

<p>GMO&#39;s have a relatively bad name in today&#39;s society, I feel it is because of genetics only being in its infancy stage as well as the civilian backlash from using human blastocysts (embryos shortly after fertilization which contains about 100 cells) to produce stem cells for medical treatment (ie, cloning tissues and organs for transplant)</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion on the GM food&#39;s conspiracy and respecting my right to do so as I have respected your right. Please don&#39;t take all what I have said as absolute fact as I am going off my memory and there are bound to be faults somewhere in it. Hopefully once I finally become a G.E. I will be able to do right and make sure that all products or techniques I aid in developing are safe and have little to no adverse affects. Anyways enough rambling on my end. Have a wonderful day everyone!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he&#39;s right.  The government doesn&#39;t want you to know your true powers.  Did you know if you close your eyes and use mental positive energy you can actually levitate?  Try it on a scale where you weigh yourself. There&#39;s a few techniques but basically you can get the weight to slowly go down.  You may never lift up, but you will have proven it correct.  I highly recommend tinfoil as a form of quantum mechanical catalyst as mentioned in the videos that <a href="/u/Illustrio">/u/Illustrio</a> linked.  It is quite effective at keeping out the gravity rays from the sun beams.  Just make sure you put on some music to get the good energy flowing.  I recommend Lady Gaga.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See them as powerhouses of negative <em>energy</em>, not negativity. Everything works from a zero point, neutrality, and then we create our surroundings with our energy. We all do this together. Have you heard stories of how passing kindness to one person makes that person pass it to someone else, and so on and on? Well, it works exactly like that except it&#39;s being manipulated. It isn&#39;t a conspiracy, but if we shine light on this truth we can create a better world together.</p>

<p>Look at how the hierarchal system works. When the person at the top becomes corrupt, it leaks down through out the whole. It also permeates our surroundings, everything in our existence. I could give an example if you&#39;re interested in hearing my &#39;crazy&#39;, but if not I&#39;ll understand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sweet! I&#39;ll give this another go. Last night I was so tired, the reply was a huge word-jumble mess.</p>

<p>When you wake up every day, you have a choice of making it a good day or bad day. Especially if you didn&#39;t have any dreams, the moment you open your eyes you are in neutrality. Nothing is influencing your thoughts negatively or positively, until you start to choose what you think about and how you perceive it. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you just went grocery shopping yesterday and bought a ton of food. You woke up and remembered you purchased pancakes yesterday and are super excited about it! Pancakes are freaking awesome, especially with fruit on top... A week later, you wake up and realize that you forgot to go grocery shopping and all you have are pancakes and fruit. Meh. They aren&#39;t so exciting this time around because it&#39;s all that you have. The only thing that changed about this scenario is the perception chosen. Instead of appreciating the greatness of these delicious cakes (I just started liking them recently, so good!) you no longer desire them because it&#39;s all you have. It&#39;s like you perceive that you have no choice in that moment, when actually the choices you had made up to that point have created that scenario, so why be down about it? </p>

<p>I really hope you like pancakes, otherwise I don&#39;t think it will make too much sense, lol. </p>

<p>With companies, when CEOs start worrying more about money than employees, morale goes down through out the whole structure. They set an example of how it should function. Along with feeling unappreciated, employees are more than likely working a lot of hours and getting underpaid. While they&#39;re getting underpaid, they need things they can buy to live; other countries are getting underpaid so their government can receive money from OUR government to keep policies low so our companies can use their people to meet the lifestyle of our people.</p>

<p>Our country is the most overworked population in the world currently, and instead of building personal relationships to grow from, we buy things. They&#39;re like little additions to who we are. We buy all of this crap and where is it all going to go? The Earth can&#39;t break down landfills fast enough for us to use that as a proper way of disposal. I think it&#39;s because we&#39;re trying to complete ourselves with THINGS versus growing from a true relationship; we haven&#39;t reached a balance yet between our intelligence and lifestyles to make it possible. We grow from our personal relationships, and with growth comes wisdom. Growth doesn&#39;t come from buying things, working all of the time and pretending to be happy about being there, and drowning our sorrows of the empty lives we lead in alcohol or medications.</p>

<p>The average American doesn&#39;t really have time for their family- what are we here for then? Our born right of developing and maintaining relationships with the people we care for is now a rare reward? We&#39;re social to the core, we&#39;re <strong>meant</strong> to socialize with one another; not work all of the time like useless slaves.</p>

<p>If we stand up for ourselves and not work jobs that take away from our value of life, then we&#39;ll create something different. Humanity won&#39;t come to a standstill and never function again, we would rebuild something else. The initiative has to be there though, otherwise it won&#39;t happen. We can&#39;t expect a leader to make a different way of life a smooth transition for us, we have to use our individual energy to contribute to the whole. </p>

<p>The universe is in constant motion and change, and we&#39;re apart of it. Another way to think of neutrality is think of the Earth with out us humans on it. How peaceful and beautiful it would be. Then add us. Why does that beauty and harmony have to be destroyed just because we&#39;re here? </p>

<p>Ahh, this is long as well, I&#39;m terribly sorry! :( What do you think? Does it make sense?*</p>

<p>EDIT: speaking of relativity, it says that time is relative to the observer. but wait, as any physicist will tell you, space-time is one fabric, so if the time you percieve is relative to each individual, then the space you percieve must also be relative to the observer, and thats exactly what i am trying to say to you, that what you physically see is relative to the observer. thanks for bringing that up.</p>

Of course I left out... doctored chemical weapons &quot;analysis&quot; against Syria, secret trans-pacific trade deal now in Congress, Monsanto &quot;Nobel&quot; food award, bizarre 4am fiery crash of NSA/FBI/DOD reporter, study showing 70 percent of Americans are on prescription drugs, G8 protests, Chiptole admitting it&#39;s <em>impossible</em> to serve GMO-free food, massive protests in Brazil and Turkey... </p>

<p>AND THAT IS JUST WHAT I READ TODAY. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that!  I never said I believe in &quot;Bluebeam&quot; per se, I said we&#39;re being set up for a Bluebeam style situation (faked extra-terrestrial contact or threat scenario).<br/>
I&#39;m happy to be called gullible- if people can&#39;t see the trend toward space fear and alien interactions being pushed to the max in just about every corner of &quot;reality&quot; at the moment, so be it!  </p>

&quot;...in our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we need some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond.&quot;  <em>President Reagan</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>America (and other global superpowers) have been funding BOTH SIDES all along- the only difference now is that it&#39;s being posed as an above-board option.  Also, with the rapid economic decline, I&#39;m not sure funding rebels and terrorists is going to continue at its past scale, either.
About the magical/mystical aspect- I agree that no supernatural forces are at work, but I do think that many key figures in the &quot;power structure&quot; are practicing occultists/illuminists- hence New Age religion becoming so prolific in the last decade or so.  I honestly don&#39;t think this &quot;new spirituality&quot; shift is a human response to dogma, fundamentalism and &quot;the failings of the Church, but another manufactured control device.   </p>
