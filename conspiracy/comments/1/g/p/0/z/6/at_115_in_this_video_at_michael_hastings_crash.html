       Is that a pet goat, a lamb or a dog?  It looks like livestock to me, not a dog.  Why would someone bring a pet goat to a TV interview?

       How the hell does the engine block and half the drive-train shoot out of the hood and fly as far as it did?  Has
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       ever seen, or heard of, an engine block do this?  Yes, it does look like a movie-scene because it was clearly manufactured and not a simple crash.  Maybe he was taken into witness protections, faked his own death to go into hiding, or somebody really wanted to make it obvious that this was no accident..  I can't wait for more details to surface.

       Good point.  Any idea how fast his particular car would have had to been going?  Whatever the exact speed was?  Do you think he could, or even would, have been going that fast in this particular residential area?  Even if so, why?

       I can't even speculate on speed, but I would think it would have to be fairly substantial.

       This video shows him blowing through a red light moments before it happened at some speed, but there is no way for me to determine just how fast. As for why he was going that fast at 4 o'clock in the morning I couldn't say his motivations, but I know it's something I have done before when the roads were free of other traffic. I can see from all the videos available that he struck and sheared off a fire hydrant before impacting the tree, so I'm wondering if that initial impact could have helped hasten the engine departing the vehicle. I only hope that recovery of the vehicle "black box" info will be released.

       None of them were Mercedes direct injection turbo engines running 2900 psi in common rail fuel injection with extreme high pressure fuel pumps either. Have you ever seen the fuel systems on a DI engine before?

       Lotta fuel lines running around. I'm not sure if the 1.8 has the same fuel cooler that the Merc DI V6s do, but if it did then there would be even more of them snaking around.
I doubt the fuel management system had enough time like it does in typical head-on accidents to shut down and dump the excess fuel into the cylinders for disposal before 200 bar fuel came shooting out of that high pressure line. Dislodged engines are not a typical accident situation mind you.

       Nah, hardly an expert, just a car enthusiast. I remember reading about the upcoming direct injection engines about 10 years ago in a few different magazines, and one thing that kept coming to mind was the fear they had of these things becoming fiery death traps in accidents. One article in Popular Hot Rodding I think it was mentioned the high pressures these things run at causing a dangerous situation, so when I saw what type of car was involved I started doing some research on it earlier yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed on the video how the driver's side front wheel had been ripped off and thrown down the road a considerable distance on the right hand side, which would have taken a HELL of an impact to accomplish. A fire hydrant to the front end at high speed in the right spot could have both severed the wheel and the driver's side engine mounts, causing the engine to be loosened enough to come hurling out to the left when it struck the tree. A closer view of the car in some angles shows the damage I was expecting, the driver's side shock tower looks to be pretty mangled, with all of the corresponding suspension bits either bent underneath the car or scattered across the road. Things started falling into place from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just look for clues rather than immediately jumping on the bandwagon that believes goat-toting Zionist reptilian FEMA czars sending out their satanic alien pedo minions to plant bombs or call in drone strikes is more easy to believe than a young 30-something well off dude out joyriding in his new Mercedes at 4 AM lost control while driving fast. I don't get the same thrill out of making up theories than I do when I use facts and evidence to make rational conclusions.

       I was thinking its a bit over the top for car crash cover. I'd like to know what the front of the vehicle looked like buts it covered with blanket. i swear there was reports he was jack knifed...how the hell does that cause the engine to be thrown out of a car down the street...and what could possibly ignite the car..im no expert but its usually the engine that starts fires no?...it could be the other vehicle that started the fire but where is the other vehicle? Its gotta be a faked death....or a serious message being sent to other journalists....

       The jack knife comment didn't mean he was stabbed, but rather it was a terribly inarticulate description of the wreck.  A car can't jack knife, a tractor trailer can.  It means the trailer pivots at the hinge and the entire vehicle makes a V shape, just like a jack knife folds up at the hinge.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they meant the car folded up in a V shape around the tree, clearly that didn't happen.  Best I can think is that they meant the car went sideways or swerved. It seems to have hit head on.  Not clear why a sheet was draped over the hood. There was no body visible on the hood in the immediate raw footage.

       Clearly not the same guy, but the coincidences are entertaining, none the less. But is this kid the author of the missing lamb and goat recipes? It's possibly a somewhat common name, there are probably 100 people with the name in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Can't wait to go hintin' is a bizzare coincidental typo.  Lovely.

       This is all so damn strange. If we didn't already know about hidden messages, I'd just say it was some kooky hollywood type that has a lamb. But we know better.

       I think it acts as a criminal calling card. It probably helps with psychic manifestation too.
