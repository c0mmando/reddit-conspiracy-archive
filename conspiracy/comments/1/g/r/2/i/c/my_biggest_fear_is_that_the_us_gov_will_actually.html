       We march to the WH and literally carry Obama outside and plant him just outside the doors. Telling him he's been fired and not to go back inside. Do this on national TV/Radio to prevent any wrong doing and or twisting of the situation. No one as so much spits on him, and NO GUNS ALLOWED

       If I may quote Obama himself:

      <blockquote>

        Two words: Predator drones.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       What Kokesh planned was more benign than your suggestion, and look what happened to him. If you provoke the cowards in their backyard, the backlash would be incredible.

      <p>
       All politics are local. Let me say that again: ALL POLITICS ARE LOCAL. Start by informing the people you know and staging something in your home town. Invite the media. Make a ruckus but keep it fun and peaceful. Make it a celebration. Invite the police to attend. Show that you have nothing to hide, especially your voice.

       raise awareness. make this a common thought. talk about it with anyone you can and encourage them to spread the idea of our government pulling something like this off. the big thing here is for us not to fall for it. Yeah, for all of us here on r/conspiracy and the like, it would be easy for us to see it coming, but for all of the regulars out there who are brainwashed by the media and arent trained to think the way we do, would have a really hard time. so the one thing we can do is call it out before it happens, and not just on the internet, but physically everywhere. make it a common topic of conversation. make flyers, post signs around popular areas, etc. if enough of us actually do that, the word would spread really fast.

       You say you fear this, OP, and many responses on here are definitely chiming in w/you and saying "Yes.  I definitely fear this too."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the question though:  What would you as an American citizen prefer?  To have this country be turned into the fascist dictatorship that we are most definitely quickly becoming? or to fight to keep it from happening and, in the interim, possibly be open to the retributive vengeance of one or more of the countries that America previously terrorized?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's actually a tough question, I feel.  Either we become a fascist dictatorship like we're already becoming, or we fight against it and end up possibly getting attacked by some of the nations pissed off at us right now for being such a global dick to all the rest of the countries in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm personally not interested at all in having this country become a fascist dictatorship - even at the expense of having to deal with the payback that other countries might want to pile upon us for being such dicks.  I personally WOULDN'T clamor to have the United States "help us" at the expense of giving up our liberties.  If the U.S. said "Let me help you from the terrorist attack, but you'll have to let me enslave you as a citizen first." I'd likely say "No thanks.  Go ahead and let the terrorists do their worst." even if that results in my ending up in pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       My KNOWING that the U.S. would use this as yet another false flag attack just like they orchestrated and used 911 and
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DKOh1.png">
        all the others before it
       </a>
       would help keep me from reacting in fear to any demands they would have on the American people - even if not giving in to them might mean my getting killed in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I can tell you ONE voice amongst the masses that
       <em>
        wouldn't
       </em>
       be clamoring to bring back the surveillance state and signing off on their own privacy.

       In that case, let's make it 2 voices. And spread the word to the people we care about and believe in to join us in doing the right thing.

       They've effectively turned most of us into spinless, goo-brained sheep...but the sheep at least still have

       I have thought this as well.  But, like the other events that have been exposed, it would be a one-time loss.  The people would expose it and not tolerate it.  It would be the
       <em>
        last
       </em>
       time they would ever think about even trying to do something like that ever again.

       That's the government's fall back position and otherwise. Given the opposition to their spying programs, whenever there is an attack in which the government is complicit or not, they will always call for more security and say "SEE WE TOLD YOU SO"

       It won't matter, even if it does. People have learned to distrust the government on entirely new levels of contempt. If that shit happens, the burning wasteland won't cover up the smell of rat shit.

       It doesn't matter, we have people everywhere now, majority knows about false flag and after the fiasco with the Tsarnev brothers, everyone in the intelligence will be afraid he can be set up and they are not likely to go along with a drill, or at the very least record the drill and post the evidence if the drill turns real.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have the eyes everywhere, we see everything, we have the documents, we have the whistleblowers, we will easily expose a false flag if it happens.

       With everyone clamoring for an XBox One and being okay with cameras in their cable boxes, have you considered that PRISM is the program that was meant to be
       <em>
        decommissioned
       </em>
       , and that's why it's getting exposed now?
