<p>What Kokesh planned was more benign than your suggestion, and look what happened to him. If you provoke the cowards in their backyard, the backlash would be incredible. </p>

<p>All politics are local. Let me say that again: ALL POLITICS ARE LOCAL. Start by informing the people you know and staging something in your home town. Invite the media. Make a ruckus but keep it fun and peaceful. Make it a celebration. Invite the police to attend. Show that you have nothing to hide, especially your voice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>raise awareness. make this a common thought. talk about it with anyone you can and encourage them to spread the idea of our government pulling something like this off. the big thing here is for us not to fall for it. Yeah, for all of us here on r/conspiracy and the like, it would be easy for us to see it coming, but for all of the regulars out there who are brainwashed by the media and arent trained to think the way we do, would have a really hard time. so the one thing we can do is call it out before it happens, and not just on the internet, but physically everywhere. make it a common topic of conversation. make flyers, post signs around popular areas, etc. if enough of us actually do that, the word would spread really fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say you fear this, OP, and many responses on here are definitely chiming in w/you and saying &quot;Yes.  I definitely fear this too.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the question though:  What would you as an American citizen prefer?  To have this country be turned into the fascist dictatorship that we are most definitely quickly becoming? or to fight to keep it from happening and, in the interim, possibly be open to the retributive vengeance of one or more of the countries that America previously terrorized?</p>

<p>That&#39;s actually a tough question, I feel.  Either we become a fascist dictatorship like we&#39;re already becoming, or we fight against it and end up possibly getting attacked by some of the nations pissed off at us right now for being such a global dick to all the rest of the countries in the world.</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally not interested at all in having this country become a fascist dictatorship - even at the expense of having to deal with the payback that other countries might want to pile upon us for being such dicks.  I personally WOULDN&#39;T clamor to have the United States &quot;help us&quot; at the expense of giving up our liberties.  If the U.S. said &quot;Let me help you from the terrorist attack, but you&#39;ll have to let me enslave you as a citizen first.&quot; I&#39;d likely say &quot;No thanks.  Go ahead and let the terrorists do their worst.&quot; even if that results in my ending up in pieces.</p>

<p>My KNOWING that the U.S. would use this as yet another false flag attack just like they orchestrated and used 911 and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DKOh1.png">all the others before it</a> would help keep me from reacting in fear to any demands they would have on the American people - even if not giving in to them might mean my getting killed in the process.</p>

<p>So I can tell you ONE voice amongst the masses that <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> be clamoring to bring back the surveillance state and signing off on their own privacy.</p>

<p>To answer your question in the second paragraph: I am firmly of the latter camp. I believe no good will come without sacrifice and I am personally willing to sacrifice for this cause. </p>
