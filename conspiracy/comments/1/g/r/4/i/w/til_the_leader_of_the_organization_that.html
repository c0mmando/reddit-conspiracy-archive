       Sorry I don't have the link, but I'm sure many or at least some of you are familiar with Michael C. Ruppert's masterpiece Crossing the Rubicon. I'm almost finished with it. Its nearly a thousand pages and does a tremendous job of bringing credible information from a credible [but more importantly, unbiased] former LAPD investigator who dedicated years solely to 9/11 research. I highly, highly recommend it if you haven't already read it.

       [on a side note: members of the bin Laden family were meeting with certain members of the Carlyle Group in an upscale NYC hotel on the morning of 9/11 as well]

       I have to seriously doubt that most Jews are aware of the sordid history of modern Political Zionism from its birth at the turn of the century through Israel becoming a "nation" in 1948.

       If they knew what went on - what treachery was done to the world at large
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       to Jews in particular to make that "Zionist Dream" become a reality, they couldn't possibly support Zionism.

       Fact:  Mahmoud Ahmed met with Senators on 9/11.  NONE of them was Joe Biden.

      <p>
       The only source for the claims that Biden met with ISI's Ahmed is INFOWARS who claims that "Biden admits meeting Ahmed" post-9/11:

       Amazing what a 60-second search on a search engine will do.  Why post shit on Reddit if you have no links?  And then it ends up being not exactly factual?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.  Biden is a clown.  Anyone who thinks Biden was either a mastermind of 9/11 or part of any Neocon conspiracy must be a Tea Party type who likewise believes that a President who mandates citizens purchasing private corporate health insurance is a "Marxist" instead of a corporatist.

       Are you kidding me? Jesus, I was not even coming close to insinuating that Biden was involved in the planning. And no, Infowars is NOT the only source here. As I said in the OP, this comes from a book titled Crossing the Rubicon -- hence the lack of a link. I can't really link a page in a book. And yes, Ahmed and Biden did meet in the aftermath of 9/11, but it was after Ahmed had met with Senators Bob Graham and Porter Goss. He also met with the ambassador to Pakistan, Colin Powell, and Richard Armitage. So there's your fact check.

       Your title says Biden was with Ahmed on the morning of 9/11.  That's not a fact.  Posting things without links that aren't facts isn't helpful.  We all can post things and say "I once read it somewhere" and be incorrect and suddenly misinformation is out there.

       It is not disputable whether Biden met with Ahmed in the aftermath of 9/11. Its a fact. A known fact at this point. And whether it was on 9/11 or in the immediate aftermath of it: it implcates him all the same to at least some degree. He's among shady company being on Ahmed's agenda to meet with the likes of Armitage and Powell.

       Dates matter if you want to find the truth.  Serious researchers care about nailing down facts.  You don't really give a shit.  You're like a teenager with a bong in a basement telling his friends:  "Dude, I heard that like Biden is like a secret Muslim, I can't show you any articles but I heard about it man."  Kewl.

       That was a very significant 48 hours.  There are

         entire books &amp; websites devoted to the timeline of those 48 hours down to the minute

       on 9/11.

       That's why it matters so much exactly who did what at what minute &amp; their whereabouts.  Muddying the waters with false dates &amp; times does not help.

       You're a shill if you're defending a non-sourced claim of any type.  Hang Biden for treason if you've got the goods, but you don't give a fuck about getting to the bottom of 9/11.

       Joe Biden also submitted the first draft of the Patriot Act, called the Omnibus CT Act. The word 'submitted' is used instead of the word 'written', because Joe is just not smart enough to write a bill like that all by himself.

        Joe Biden also submitted the first draft of the Patriot Act, called the Omnibus CT Act.

      <p>
       Yes, he sure did.

      <p>
       Joe likes to CLAIM that this forerunner to the Patriot Act was written in "response to the Oklahoma City Bombing" tragedy.

       Joe lied. He does that often.

       I get the sense that Joe Biden is to Obama what LBJ was to Kennedy.

       EDIT TO THE OP: On September 11 - during both the WTC and Pentagon impacts - Mahmoud Ahmed was meeting on Capitol Hill with Senators Bob Graham and Porter Goss. Senator John Kyl and the Pakistan Ambassador to the US were also present. On September 12, Ahmed met seperately with Colin Powell and Richard Armitage. Tying back into the OP: On September 13, Ahmed had a one-on-one sitdown with Joe Biden. That same day, Condi Rice lied to the press by suggesting she had no idea he was even in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biden met with Ahmed on 9/13. He was meeting with different high-profile talking heads the preceeding two days.

       They did try to kill him at one point i think. Was during the Pat Tillman investigation he did;
       <em>
        -someone-
       </em>
       went to his offices and smashed all of his computers, and he decided it would be sensible to go hide for a while in Venezuela. Turns out they poisoned him while he was there, and he had to fly to Canada to make sure he didn't die. Took nearly a year to recover IIRC.

       I think he's just chilling out growing food and doing a radio show at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only issue i have with him is the idea that he puts across with regards to peak oil and collapse - not that i don't think those are both important issues that we seriously need to take into consideration, but his stance that it will
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       happen and it's very imminent, i think is slightly short sighted on his part. Nobody can predict when these things will become a serious issue, and we don't yet know if we'll be able to prevent it altogether. Once you get past the if and when of that issue though, he's right on the money; if we can't do something about global energy supplies, it will be as catastrophic as he proposes, no doubt about it.

       I feel like whatever generation it happens to, there will be complete chaos and unrest. The "there's no way this could happen to us" mentality will make it so much worse. Not to mention our government will undoubtedly lie thru their teeth for as long as they can to us. "Everything is fine."

       Absolutely. I think if it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       going to happen, it will be within my lifetime. There are still ways we can pull it back if we genuinely put our minds to developing the infrastructure of renewable energy sources, but it seems all they're interested in doing at the moment is digging oil and gas out of different places, rather than realising it might be time to have a big push at moving on to something else. By the time people realise it's a serious issue, it will likely be too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, the "not in my lifetime" rhetoric that i constantly hear gets extremely old. These are also people who have never read a single thing about it, yet somehow they're wise enough to make those assertions. This system of massive growth and energy consumption has been going on for just over 100 years, which is absolutely
       <em>
        fuck all
       </em>
       time, yet people assume this is a system that works and will just keep going. Errrr, no. That's like 2-3 generations - there is zero guarantee that this house of cards won't collapse at some point in the relatively near future.

       Well said. Oil running dry is obviously not an if, but a when. And when that time comes and the shithouse goes up in flames, that's a scenario where civil unrest and riots happen. When there's no gas, no transportation, no energy. Yet the executives that lined their pockets while they watched the ground become empty and barren will be rolling in millions and feigning concern; throwing their hands in the air. "Let's work together, we Americans are resilient." Please.

       This is the problem. All the people who
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       do something to change the system, and actually make the switch to better energy sources, are all getting way too rich off the current system. It's not in the interest of profit to stop using fossil fuels, so nobody put any real effort into it, regardless of the future consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that it's all about energy either, this whole 'infinite growth' ridiculousness is unsustainable anyway. If an energy crisis doesn't kill this system, something else inevitably will.

       It'll be a long time, maybe eventually there will be something concrete. Then i'll take notice of it. Right now it's too much, heard it from a guy who heard it from guy, whose mailman's cousin was staying at a hotel down the block from the WTC.

       I understand things are linked, but how am i to determine when someoneis legit? Because someone else said so? That's the problem to begin with isn't it?

       I put no faith or stock into it, because the easiest way to get duped is to trust someone who tells you they're telling the truth and have your best interests in mind. I trust noone.

       But,....GOD FUCKING DAMMIT.   Why's all the footage gotta always be so grainy.  ugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the way they flash the photos of the missle painted like AmericanAirlines for 0.5 seconds, and then all this grainy footage played to spooky music, intentionally tin foil hat style documentary voice over, even if this was legitimate footage and photos, it already discredits itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely, if this person has legit whistle blower footage and photos of the missle attack on the Pentagon, that few have seen.  Surely they'd present it in a better way than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it is legit, then it's someone on the inside fucking with us.

       I'm sure equally if not even more of an untrained eye, but something about it doesn't look like legitimate footage. The blast seems...off. Don't get me wrong, FLT 77 did NOT hit the Pentagon. But I'm not sure that footage is completely foolproof.

       It does look really off, as far as frame rate goes.  But the official footage of the Pentagon attack looks really off to me too in that same regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I do imagine that if this was legit footage of the attack, it would have made some major headlines by now.  So needless to say, I'm skeptical.

       Okay, maybe not major headlines, but it would have at least made it's rounds through the 'conspiracy' media by now, I'd assume.  I mean, if it's legit footage, it pretty much conclusively shows it was no commercial airliner.
