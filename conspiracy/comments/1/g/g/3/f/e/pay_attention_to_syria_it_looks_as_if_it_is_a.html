<p>Second: Syria and Iran have a mutual defense pact. </p>

<p>If Iran get&#39;s into the mix with US troops, I&#39;m sure there will be some trumped up reason to declare war on Iran, but that&#39;s the objective....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. They just like pretending to be noble. Sociopaths always need to pretend to be noble, regardless of how flimsy their guise is. It&#39;s creepy, but yeah... they don&#39;t care about fooling you per se, they just want a loud, unchallenged narrative that makes them seem noble. I say this to point out that they are absolutely without conscience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US will assuredly clash with Iran. But I think the other alliances prove even more interesting. For instance, the Syrian government is allied with Hezbollah, and also supported politically by Russia. And Hezbollah, of course, wants the complete destruction of Israel, who has already attacked Syria.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a tangled web of alliances pulling groups into this conflict, much like what led to the first World War. What other allies will join in before this is done?</p>

<p>My money&#39;s still on Syria becoming a world war 3 (4?) of sorts by the end of 2015.</p>

<p>Russia is a big ally of Syria, Iran, and Hezbollah. However they also have a military agreement with Israel - an agreement which expires in 2015.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bah, people have been predicting a so called imminent collapse of the economy for eons. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen. The financial powers know what they&#39;re doing. They get people scared, they stimulate shifts in currencies and commodities that benefit them, and then magically the problems are solved for another year. They&#39;re really good at this because it&#39;s pretty much all they do. The only way the economy will collapse is if all the suckers who pay for it get killed off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No country wants war, only the leaders or those who stand to profit do.  Iran has been able to avoid war for the past few years.  Ahmadinejad was able to keep US war propaganda at bay.  However Iran just elected a new president (Hasan Rowhani), and already he&#39;s talking of spilling the Syrian conflict into Israel, along with plans to send 4000 troops to aid Assad.  The US on the other hand is looking for any excuse to start war with Iran.  So either Rowhani is a plant/corrupt, or he&#39;s inept about sidestepping potential conflict with the US.  Either way, unless we keep people abreast of what&#39;s going down, the conflict will escalate because there is a desire to do so by those in power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying the far, far, far weaker nation has managed to deftly avoid war?  Are you kidding me?  It actually has a lot more to do with the general in charge of carrying out a war informing the political class that war with Iran would be far bigger than the war in Iraq.  </p>

<p>Here is the part where, were I a conspiracy theorist, I&#39;d be calling you a paid stooge of the Iranian government.</p>
