So, this bunch of jerks is harassing people and doing illegal stuff, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GMOMyths/comments/1fy5ww/the_irony_is_rich_with_this_one/caf44id"><em>and I can&#39;t see why this should continue.</em></a></p>

<p><strong>They banned me for pointing out they were breaking the law.</strong></p>

<p>Can their subreddit, where they deliberately culture lawlessness, be deleted now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more worried about the shady stuff like claiming to be an independent journalism website while loading your page up with shitty advertisements.</p>

<p>Seriously though, the guy you responded to was asking for a mirror, which wouldn&#39;t use their bandwidth. The other response to him was an ad blocker, which is widely accepted to use and not illegal in any way. I have the freedom to not view the parts of a website I don&#39;t want to view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The verbatim subject is how to view the content without contributing towards pageviews. A mirror accomplishes this without taking any toll on the content producer&#39;s resources. For purposes of advertising pageviews, an adblocker also accomplishes the goal <em>with</em> taking resources. An adblocker is perfectly legal, and a mirror is legal unless the content owner asks that it be removed. And given that NaturalNews has a disclaimer disowning all posted content to cover their asses in the event of lawsuits for the shitty advice posted, I don&#39;t see that happening. </p>

<p>adblocker doesn&#39;t block all of the ads for a reason.</p>
