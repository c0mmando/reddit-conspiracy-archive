       They keep deep linking images and trying to set up mirrors for content they don't own.  Basically, they want to read things they disagree with, but they don't want to contribute to the authors at all.  I'm offended because this little shill nest is stealing, in order to hijack discussions.  They don't actually teach science to the public, they just mock people fallaciously.  So, this bunch of jerks is harassing people and doing illegal stuff,

       I'm more worried about the shady stuff like claiming to be an independent journalism website while loading your page up with shitty advertisements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, the guy you responded to was asking for a mirror, which wouldn't use their bandwidth. The other response to him was an ad blocker, which is widely accepted to use and not illegal in any way. I have the freedom to not view the parts of a website I don't want to view.

       The verbatim subject is how to view the content without contributing towards pageviews. A mirror accomplishes this without taking any toll on the content producer's resources. For purposes of advertising pageviews, an adblocker also accomplishes the goal
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       taking resources. An adblocker is perfectly legal, and a mirror is legal unless the content owner asks that it be removed. And given that NaturalNews has a disclaimer disowning all posted content to cover their asses in the event of lawsuits for the shitty advice posted, I don't see that happening.

       Don't view those, sorry. Online news (with adblock), youtube (with a greasemonkey script that blocks ads), netflix (naturally ad-free as far as I can tell) and books provide more than enough media to keep me busy.

       edit for your edit: No, they were talking about not providing them a benefit for selling them to advertisers. As I've already pointed out at least a couple times, leeching their servers was never part of the discussion except in your head.

       Oh no you found out my evil Jewish ways because I said "oy vey!" Oy vey iz mir!
Actually atheist, but go on, mach schnel. Where is this standard form contract? I saw no such thing on natrualnews. You go there, and BOOM, content instantly pops up.

       I wasn't saying anything about evil.  You did use the yiddish vocative, and I am familiar with the culture.  I was making a joke about the early history of judaism and contracts, but it's even cooler to see how I've gone over your head.  I don't want to explain the business of running a website, in order to prove you even more wrong.

       On another note, what are some good types of pickle to put on matzah with hummus?

       I got your joke, it just wasn't a very good one. And you obviously have no clue what you're talking about when it comes to website business, so you might as well just drop the act. Shmendrik.

       So you don't want to admit you were wrong or talk to me about how to prepare epic matzah.

       When you have: a huge business, distributed malware, and ignored subpoenas,  then you are no longer talking about the general case.

       It shouldn't have happened that way, the major media companies commit the worst copyright infringement.  I just don't think it's cool when a shill nest targets and indie journalism outfit.  Kim dotcom is in a completely different league.

       No, they wanted to reproduce the content without permission and link directly to images.  I don't know why you are pretending that doesn't cause legal trouble.  This is one small instance, but I'm sure it's the tip of an iceberg, because of your persistent kvetching.
