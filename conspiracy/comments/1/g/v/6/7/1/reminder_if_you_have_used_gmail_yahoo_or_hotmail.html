       Honestly I don't even think you'd need to do that much. Without knowing the extent of PRISM, I'd assume simply being in a border country to ours would put you on the radar. If you've ever registered for a credit card of any sort, signed up with any of the major central banks, or filed taxes, then you're definitely on some sort of list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to be clear, that's not to say we're all being closely monitored 24/7 (although we could be for all we know now) but if you have a social security number, or social ID of any sort (which you do) then count that as your very own 'employee ID' number to the global corporate conglomerate that is the UN and associates. Corporations like to keep tabs on all of their workers, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole privacy issue is stemming from a misunderstanding of the system. Essentially we're all part of a multinational corporation, and if you work to the benefit of your CEO's (think taxes) they will continue to give you employee benefits (such as military protection, loans, etc). Sure we're being monitored but really it doesn't matter; we're all small potatoes. They could give two damns what porn we wank to, the problem arises when the structure of power is threatened. The "CEO's" of the global "corporation" don't want to lose their positions to others, and so we see what happens when people gain a lot of power/backing among the populace, when they don't side with the views and interests of the governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wouldn't worry. As long as you aren't trying to start a revolution to "overthrow the tyrannical gubmint" then you should be fine. Best thing to do is pay your taxes on time, get out of all debt, and make a shit ton of money each year to cover your ass and please the lords. And if you're lucky, one day you could become a lord yourself! That's the game anyway.

       Sure. It's really more of a public reminder, if anything. The common theme I've been seeing the last few weeks is the confusion and
       <em>
        surprise
       </em>
       that people are expressing over all of this privacy/NSA business. None of it should be surprising anyone if they understood how the system works. The interesting part of all of this is seeing how the governments respond to the reactions of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that people are finally snapping out of their safety bubbles, they're going to look harder. They'll find a LOT more, and the rabbit hole goes pretty deep...
      </p>
      <p>
       The future will be interesting to watch indeed.

       what people in this thread seem to have not realised/be forgetting is that PRISM works through the internet.. the physical location of a country means nothing on the internet. i don't think i'm any safer in the UK than yourself just because i'm further away..

       that does not sound logical.

       assume everyone is being tracked, because it makes the most sense.

       I think you may have misread what I typed. You are arguing in agreement with me. I stated that anyone who is any way associated with the US is probably being tracked to the ultimate extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a pretty large umbrella category that covers most of the world, you would be hard pressed to find anyone who isn't in some way related to the US, and if they aren't they probably aren't being tracked. But good luck with that - I think the number of people who aren't related in some way to the US are limited to those in remote regions and third world countries who haven't yet seen electricity. Oh but we're workin' to reach them too, eh?

       no. Anonymity online is an illustration of the rights afforded by privacy. It has nothing to do with "random people on the internet" but privacy in general.

       My whole point was that whether you think you have anonymity or not, whether you think it's a "right" or not, you don't have it, and you shouldn't kid yourself by thinking you do. You can be anonymous to the average person on the internet, but to the government, you're not.

       Not so much that I truly am delusional as to think so, but I was never so naive to believe that there has been a point ever where we have actually been anonymous. I write, blog, entertain and do what I do in the field of rabble-rousing without either illusion. None of us are anonymous unless we are some serious hackers, and money of us matter enough to give a shot about from they who watch, obviously, or we would have been disappeared long ago.

       So, don't feel bad that I wasn't shattered by your informative and pointed statements. I was being sarcastic, and since I don't know who you, nor you I, well, have a day Captain Obvious. I hope it gets better for you.

       I don't think people get how a system like PRISM works.  It's not 'recording everything'; that's not possible.  Rather, it's a back door into all the relevant systems (let's look at this system through the PRISM - geddit?).  I.e. at customs?  They will be able to access your Facebook messages or Hotmail or Skype call history without a warrant. (And I would assume, deleted messages (you honestly don't think anything is truly deleted when you press delete on such services do you..?  That goes double for Facebook with their stupid photo tagging system where anyone can tag you but you cannot prevent yourself from being tagged.  PRISM will likely have access to that facial recognition data and be able to run searches against it, using Facebook's own servers))

       which is what a lot of people do not get, its not a case where govt is going to spy on and '1984' everybody, they cannot be bothered and it would be a waste of their resources, BUT what does and can happen is corrupt local cops, corrupt local crooks can access all this lovely govt data and use it to do their LOCAL corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT is the biggest danger from an all knowing govt, they cannot be trusted to not let that data be used and abused by corrupt govt employees, and friends and blackmailers of those govt employees. Information is worth money and can be used for much nefarious purposes, people will pay to get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be honest big govt corruption is generally when organised crime of many stripes and hues, gets it hooks into and controls parts of big govt for their own purposes.

       Exactly - take the UK for example and 'terror' surveillance laws.  What do they end up being used for? Prosecuting people for dropping litter and in one case a family was put under surveillance because it was suspected they lied about where they lived to get their kid into a better school.
      </p>

       Under RIPA (Regulation of Invesgatory Powers Act) for some years now various bodies can get access to your email, web history and so on (and incidentally it's illegal for the hosting companies to disclose if they have been asked for this data, even if asked by a judge).  The problem is who can ask - this includes for example local councils which basically means that some small time civil servant could start nosing into your online activities should they come up with an excuse.  I always predicted PRISM which appears to simply be a direct interface to this data.  'Point and snoop'.

       While we're on the topic of reminders, I'd like to remind all of you that even having an entirely separate and meticulously un-identifyable second cell phone (bought with cash at a garage sale, prepaid sim card (also cash), etc) that you use for any private business, it's likely that someone with access to all the locations of all the cell phones in the nation could highly correlate your second phone to your first based purely on date/time stamps.
      </p>

       I'm not entirely sure how to take measures to reduce this possibility.

       those are all very good reasons IMO. Hell, even just 1 or two of those reasons makes PCs the superior platform. Not saying you should only game on Pc or console, but any multuiplatform (most) games should be bought on PC

       No I didn't miss that point. I just don't care about that point because I really hate playing on a computer. But as of now, no I can't afford a next gen console. In about 2 months I'll be able to afford one. Your probably going to say I should use that money to build a computer.

       I mean honestly, who gives a fuck? I was under the assumption that anything I do on the internet is being logged some way or another for 5-6 years now... I really could care less. I don't plan on physically hurting anyone or committing any terrorist attacks... the ones terrorizing us are the people who claim they're protecting us... so let them look in the mirror if they want someone to suspect.

       it costs money to target one person or a group, at the moment its a forest of low hanging fruit, too many people griping and talking, not worth their bother to go after internet talkers. things might change in the future if local cops and DAs use people's internet history as evidence in ordinary local matters. but what are they going to do with the million or more internet talkers, lock us all up in FEMA camps, that costs serious money.

       850,000 govt employees and associated contractors in private companies, all sucking on the taxpayer tit. its a grand life they make for themselves, great salaries, great benefits, abuse of govt credit cards (see the 2006 GAO report on it), great pensions.
