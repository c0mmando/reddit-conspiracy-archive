       I've compiled everything I have come across
       <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/06/compiling-important-anomalies-with.html">
        here
       </a>
       on my website. I'd love to add any more the community has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the bullet points (they are sourced in the link):
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wikileaks revealed that their lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, was contacted by Hastings just hours before his death claiming that he was being investigated by the FBI.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hastings sent an email to colleagues hours before his death stating: re:NSA... I'm onto a big story and need to go off the radar for a bit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         One eyewitness described the crash as such: "The Car Was Bouncing, Flames and Sparks Near the Gas Tank. When He Hit the Palm Tree That's When the Flames Were Higher. There Were Explosions and Everything... No One Could Approach the Car Because it Kept Exploding."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The accident only involved Hastings car, no other vehicles.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Another witness described the scene: "It sounded like a bomb went off." "My house shook, the windows were rattling." "I couldn't have written a scene like this for a movie."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hastings was driving a new Mercedes C-250, a car not prone to bursting into flames before a crash.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hastings had worked on numerous articles critical of the establishment, including: The Rise of the Killer Drones: How America Goes to War in Secret, Julian Assange: The Rolling Stone Interview, Another Runaway General: Army Deploys Psy-Ops on U.S. Senators, America's Last Prisoner of War.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         One of Hastings articles had resulted in the forced resignation of General McChrystal.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hastings had no reason to be speeding, let alone in a suburban neighborhood. He was a rising star in journalism working on major stories.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Mercedes' drive train was about 50-60 yards away from the crash site.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hastings had said in a 2012 Reddit AMA that he received numerous death threats.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When he died, Hastings was working on a story regarding current CIA director Brennan.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         DARPA has the ability to hack cars.
        </p>
       </li>

       Nice. Good list.
      </p>
      <p>
       One slight correction for you, it was a Mercedes C-250, not an E-Class.

       Here's something fascinating I found thx to a link from jimstone
       <a href="http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-oakland2010.pdf">

       " *with active experiments against two late-model
passenger cars (same make and model). We test these
cars’ components in isolation in the lab, as a complete
system in a controlled setting (with the car elevated on
jacks), and in live road tests on a closed course. We have
endeavored to comprehensively assess how much resilience a
conventional automobile has against a digital attack mounted
against its internal components. Our findings suggest that,
unfortunately, the answer is “little.”
Indeed, we have demonstrated the ability to systematically
control a wide array of components including engine,
brakes, heating and cooling, lights, instrument panel, radio,
locks, and so on. Combining these we have been able to
mount attacks that represent potentially significant threats
to personal safety. For example, we are able to forcibly and
completely disengage the brakes while driving, making it
difficult for the driver to stop. Conversely, we are able to
forcibly activate the brakes, lurching the driver forward and
causing the car to stop suddenly "
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, it's possible an automobile may be controlled, in essence is there a possibility Hastings vehicles' computer had been hijacked?

       That was only the first step in the testing, this was the next step here.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We also found that the entire attack can be implemented in a completely blind fashion— without any
capacity to listen to the car’s responses. Demonstrating
this, we encoded an audio ﬁle with the modulated
post-authentication exploit payload and loaded that ﬁle
onto an iPod. By manually dialing our car on an ofﬁce
phone and then playing this “song” into the phone’s
microphone, we are able to achieve the same results and
compromise the car.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So the answer to your question is yes, it's possible. And very easy to do if you have the knowledge and equipment.

       "Yes. Every once and awhile, I'll get a death threat from someone--like, "if we don't like what you write, we'll hunt you down and kill you" kind of thing.

       I guess there would be no way to know if that group tampered with any evidence such as the ECU and other stuff investigators would need to look into for foul play.

       If a car exploded in a neighborhood, wouldn't people stay inside, peek out of the windows and wait for police or firemen to arrive?

       one tow truck or similar, plus that compact car (not a cop car but had some stripe and logo on it), tow truck ('something' industries on its mudflaps) had masses of orange and red lights, the car just appeared to have orange ones, then there was that vehicle on the other oncoming lane.with the massive amount of white lights on the front of it. It dazzles the camera, appears to have four lights down low and at least four up high.

       three vehicles with a lot of lights on them, and that guy in black walking behind the compact car, he appears to have some logo/badge on his arm/shoulder.

       The most different statements were that the drive train was '50-60 yards' away, then a video was made where a man said he saw the whole thing and the 'transmission was a few feet in front' of the car.
