    <div class="md"><p>All I&#39;ve got are theories, but i don&#39;t think a country is the answer to this question. My best guess would be a handful of the elite from all around the world. The oil and weapon industries would love a world war, and honestly as far as the future of all mankind it would be very helpful to cut the population of the earth down as much as WW3 could. A few subquestions that i think are important: Do any/all of the wars going on on the planet have anything in common? Brazil, turkey, Syria, the entire middle east.
If one big gustapo tried taking over the planet to form a NWO, what would be the first tactical missions? Where would they go first? </p>

<p>This is little more than conjecture: i read an article in rolling stone probably 10 years ago about some guy that had the job of going to warzones in Africa. I don&#39;t remember the guys name or the articles title, but what he said he did was: find some poor countries that needed weapons for their war. He would trade them weapons for a chunk of land and a chunk of their opponents land once they were defeated. What do they care about a little land when they&#39;re about to take  whole country? Once this was done and he had his respectable chunk of land, it&#39;s time to start another war, civil or not. Rinse and repeat. Rolling stone asked him what value the land had compared to other assets. His response was that once global warming started to get really bad, Africa would be one of the last places on earth that would still be good for growing food. When you&#39;re the only mofo with food: name your price. This is entirely speculation and possibly easily disproven, but the amazon and the jungles of Africa don&#39;t have factories in them. They&#39;ve got nutrient rich soil. Could it be that they&#39;re trying to take over these territories to control the food? Could it be that tptb want to take over turkey, because of it&#39;s trade routes and political sway in all the areas around it? Maybe if they control the whole middle east they could control the transportation of the entire world in the not ao far off future? It could be, but i can&#39;t prove anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why you are being downvoted for posting about the most under-rated false-flag operation in the history of operations (maybe not a false-flag...but most ASSUREDLY an &quot;op&quot;) is anyone&#39;s guess.</p>

<p>My take on Sandy Hook? This school supossedly had this huge new state-of-the-art security system in it, right?</p>

<p>Show me ONE picture of Lanza in the school carrying a weapon. Just one. I don&#39;t want to see any dead kids, don&#39;t care about blood, don&#39;t care that the killed-to-injured ratio is higher than nearly ANY highly-trained mercinary in the entire world right now could ever POSSIBLY attain--I&#39;m letting them off EASY!! Just ONE PICTURE of that guy <strong>inside the school</strong> with a gun will do. </p>

<p>The best they can deliver is pre-positioned police, a triage area that remained empty, and NO pictures...when EVERY other school shooting (even waaay back in the Columbine days) has had pictures of the event itself and the aftermath--in Columbine&#39;s case even video!</p>

<p>Come on folks, you are fucking SILLY if you <em>actually read</em> and don&#39;t smell the high stink all over Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>Fucking Reddit. Have an upvote from ME anyhow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh shit-you&#39;re supossed to be banned.</p>

<p>As I said...show me ONE PICTURE with Lanza in that school with a gun and I will believe the ENTIRE story despite it&#39;s other 10,000 inconsistancies.</p>

<p>ONE picture. From a place with over 50 video cameras that are operational all the time, even when the school is closed, according to the MSM. I was seeing CCTV video of Kliebold and Harris mere DAYS after Columbine--and that was AGES ago.</p>

<p>Can you show me that ONE picture?? Or perhaps explain the kill-to-injure ratio that is FAR higher than a trained assasin can acheive? Or maybe tell me how kids were shot with a gun that police make a BIG show of showing us...in trunk of a known drug dealer&#39;s Honda where Lanza could not have accessed it? Or the messed up timeline? The second man? The EMPTY triage area? The reason for the crisis actors that were KNOWN to have been there (look up the Greenberg/Phelps family of crisis actors...they are related to Maurice Greenberg, ex-chairman of AIG)? ANYTHING AT ALL??</p>

<p>PM me ONE of those things, just ONE...and I will keep an open mind and look into it.</p>

<p>Until you can do so, kindly fuck off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, asking for proof. Good.</p>

<p>The thing is, though, the pictures may not have been released out of respect. </p>

<p>Example: after the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, during Operation Gothic Serpent, a photographer took a picture of an American soldier who had been murdered, beheaded, and dragged around the city. He said later that by doing so, he felt he had removed the last bit of dignity the deceased soldier had.</p>

<p>Think about it. You are the parent of a child who has just been murdered, alongside 25 others. Would you want the pictures out for everyone to see, passed around like museum exhibits? To be gawked at, searched through, manipulated into offensive pictures on 4chan, etc. ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait a minute--I&#39;m not asking to see dead kids. I&#39;m not asking for blood and gore. I&#39;m not asking to see the holes in little Johnny&#39;s head... Fuck that--I don&#39;t WANT to see that shit. I have a young son.</p>

<p>I am asking to see ONE PICTURE of Lanza at or near the school with a firearm. That&#39;s it. Oh...it might also help to tell us WHY exactly the coroner said that the kids were shot with a gun that the police showed to the entire nation, on national TV, IN THE TRUNK OF HIS OXY-ADDICTED FRIEND&#39;S CAR. Oh, and what about the guy running through the woods? What about the original scanner audio (I have it) where Newtown police put out a BOLO for a van and two to three men dressed in black seen leaving the school after the &quot;attacks?&quot; What about the killed-to-injured ratio? You have obviously never been called on to kill. Do you know how hard it is for ONE PERSON to kill that many people in that amount of time...and injure nearly NOBODY? I&#39;ll give you a hint--the guys over at <em>Paladin Press</em> (publisher of Soldier of Fortune) say that there are LESS THAN 10 PEOPLE KNOWN ALIVE that could have achieved that high of a KTIR. Who knew one of them was a semi-retarded wackjob KID from CT?? Where DID he get his training...because I can think of a LOT of Marines that would LOVE to shoot like that. Hell, I&#39;D love to shoot like that! I could win $250,000 on <em>Top Shot</em> and not even break a sweat!</p>

<p>Whoops, down the memory hole! Luckily I taped, myself, all of the scanner audio that day from right after police were originally called.</p>

<p>They had cameras outside and at the door, yes? They SAID that they did. Why no pix of Lanza? </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t anybody seem to care about &quot;respecting&quot; the parents of the kids that Kliebold and Harris shot??? THOSE pics (and VIDEO no less!) were all over the airwaves within days, if not hours.</p>

<p>Sorry--I&#39;m not buying it. That was an &quot;op&quot; all the way--and I feel VERY sorry for you if you cannot recognize this extremely simple fact. I mean...what will it take to wake people like you up dude??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually seen some comments about 9/11 getting upvoted in worldnews and politics over the last few months. I posted a comment about Michael Ruppert&#39;s book &#39;Crossing the Rubicon&#39; a month-or-so ago, and it got about 200 upvotes. Quite impressive. Lot of conversation in that thread about US imperialism and CIA drug dealing too, most of it upvoted.</p>

<p>Also, a lot of those topics you mentioned are pretty fringe even around here; Illuminati, vaccines, FEMA camps, chemtrails - all of that is stuff i won&#39;t really touch because i just find a lot of sensationalist crap with not much evidence to back it up. Especially the Illuminati, which is frankly a complete joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the problem with a lot of &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; and &#39;conspiracy theory deniers&#39; is that people are often talking at cross purposes - take the Builderberg conference as an example; people used to deny it exists and call people who talk about it nuts, now it&#39;s existence public and suddenly everyone accepts it exists but bizarrely many make the assumption that rather than being a conspiratorial club it&#39;s some kind of friendly, non-illegal, non-policy setting, do nothing holiday camp... the &#39;oh Bilderberg is real but it&#39;s not as bad as the worst thing anyone&#39;s said about it so let&#39;s forget about it....&#39; </p>

<p>one thing i actually heard someone say is &#39;and it turned out no mock human sacrifices happen there, it&#39;s just a load of meetings and seminars&#39; -which is ridiculous because Bohemian Grove is the place where people talk about mock human sacrifices because that&#39;s what they were filmed doing there! and the main complaint with Bilderberg was always that government people can&#39;t meet in private and collude on tactics and agree how to &#39;play things&#39; because that&#39;s illegal, immoral and absurdly stupid.   </p>

<p>but to your point; you say &#39;the illuminate&#39; is nonsense, yet it&#39;s a well documented fact the group was established on May the 1st, 1776; but of course you mean that the more extreme stories of world controlling and manipulation are nonsense, which likely they are - and maybe also you consider the &#39;illuminate&#39; the same as the &#39;masons&#39; and a hundred other similar groups, a thing which the conspiracy theories are wrong about so should be ignored...  This is very obviously a mistaken position, the Masons were hugely powerful and the core dogma includes lots about the importance of burying symbols in things they make - this is very obvious in historical monuments especially churches, they are a secret society which thrives on publicity -and for good reason...  </p>

<p>These two groups and many others were spawned as a means of protection against the power of the church, the free masons starts with very literal masons who were building the towers and spires which allowed the catholic church to dominate people so - and no doubt with their special access to churches and clergy they soon realized that it was all a sham -just like anyone who works with celebrities or politicians today is soon debunked of any staryeyed notions.  I mean just look at the reasons the Illuminate were established &#39;to oppose superstition, prejudice, religious influence over public life, abuses of state power, and to support women&#39;s education and gender equality.&#39;  </p>

<p>These were secret groups which established themselves to fight against the other, also very real, secret groups of the time - the many catholic inquisitors, Jesuits, etc...  And certainly the Masons do still exist today, in some form - and likely the systems designed to protect them have become used to protect the power-base from other threats.  Do they rule the world? doubtful, but could they be a far reaching criminal conspiracy with tentacles in law enforcement, policy making, industry, etc? certainly.  </p>

<p>i could tell you some sensationalist horseshit about the US Congress or Al Capone - it wouldn&#39;t be true but that wouldn&#39;t mean there never was an organized criminal, gangster or bootlegger in America.  likewise down your list, yes the anti-science crowd are retarded to boycott vaccines however there are legitimate questions on the quality, safety and effectiveness of some areas our vaccination policy, and big questions about it around the world -questions which we simply can&#39;t afford to sweep under the rug with the nuts worried about autism.  </p>

<p>are they filling all jet liners with mind control poison? very unlikely, have there been instances where they&#39;ve dropped substances from planes over populated areas in the name of science, public health or similar concern without having a full, open and informed debate on the subject?  Certainly, repeatedly -and sometimes simply because they&#39;re scared of getting sued they keep it all secret, like when the British government cloud seeded before and during the Olympics to try and stop any rain ruining it but kept this secret presumably partly so they wouldn&#39;t be a laughing stock of they fail but also partly because they don&#39;t want people having other events that were rained off because of their seeding to complain, or people to complain about the rain of chemicals which caused it.  </p>

<p>So to the question of the FEMA camps, we can&#39;t answer what the actually existing fema buildings are because it&#39;s almost entirely secret -for national security grounds - just like the cloud seeding in england no doubt, national security...  </p>

<p>the point i&#39;m trying to make is that you can&#39;t discount the real and problematic nature of these things you talk about just because they aren&#39;t as bad as the worst thing you heard about them - the fact is world politics does involve many long running secret societies (and many new ones like the CIA) and our governments are well practised at telling us lies for our own good, at keeping truths which might offend us from our eyes, at doing what protects their power-structure...  </p>

<p>we need to move to a more open way of doing things, we need to more into a world where such conflicting special interest groups no longer have such a huge advantage in the world.  </p>

<p>There are other possiblities. The &#39;white knights&#39; from within government could be starting to flush the corruption out too. When these stories get picked up by the MSM, I totally get why we get skeptical, but I think it means positive things. Let&#39;s say the NSA was using their dragnet to also spy on the president and other agencies within government; if they were discovered and the administration decided to stop that practice, why not throw it to the media and create another problem/distraction for the public wing of government to have to deal with? </p>

<p>So when these things come to light, I take it to mean that they are no longer valuable to the TPTW (i prefer The Powers That Were, as I do believe we&#39;re going to see a &#39;changing of the guard&#39; quite soon). These are good things. I think Snowden even hinted at it by saying he could spy on the president himself; you cannot discount that there is both good and bad within government as well. My opinion is that the public side of government is working with half-true information almost all the time; those with power control the channels of information in Washington rather than trying to control the representatives themselves. Why depend on a person that may or may not switch out every 2-4 years when you could just find the people in the bureaucracy who give them their information and corrupt them instead? They are typically lifers who never leave the position, and if nobody knows any different, how can you really be caught?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lately I&#39;ve been playing with the idea that the good elites are themselves bound by the simplistic and narrow range of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton window</a> and with the punitive retaliation of other elites.  In math classes I learned how to prove some things with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem">squeeze theorem</a> and although real life is not so simple I&#39;m trying to imply that the good elites are squeezed into acting a certain way.  You have to admit that the imagination of the people has been abysmal so there hasn&#39;t been much cover for the good elites.</p>

<p>haha thanks for that, I enjoyed it :P</p>

<p>and yea, I totally agree. I don&#39;t understand why people can&#39;t imagine duality within things like the government or elites; nothing in this world is absolute. To think that all people at the top of the ladder or all the people in government are corrupt is foolish, IMO... it&#39;s much more likely to be as you say, where we have multiple factions within each paradigm fighting it out. There are just advantages and disadvantages of both.</p>

<p>To build on my idea put forth earlier, let&#39;s say that Obama is somehow part of the &#39;good guys&#39;. He gets into office and everything seems peachy, but his intelligence reports start to come in different from how things ultimately turn out. He suspects he may have a mole or kink in the system that is giving him bad or muddy information on a daily basis, but he has no idea where the source is. Everyone they look into denies everything and everyone is clean (as Obama&#39;s pocket men don&#39;t have technical access to things like PRISM).</p>

<p>Again, this is all hypothetical, but what is he to do in that circumstance? Go public about there being corruption in DC within his innermost cabinet/intelligence peoples? How quickly would that turn into a no-confidence impeachment? Meanwhile, Obama&#39;s having to answer for the CIA&#39;s drone actions (of which he has very little part of), the NSA spying scandal, mass shootings/bombings, and every other distraction or speed bump they can throw his way. Throw threats against his family and himself on top and I can see how Obama becomes a willing whipping boy pretty quick. He has no moves when people are not willing to dig past the surface.</p>

<p>Again, much of this is not fact but theory, but I think the &#39;good elites&#39; really are working on these problems. The problem is, as you say, their tool belt of options in dealing with their counterparts is not quite as impressive or robust in their upheld respect for other beings. They have to fight with awareness and by unleashing the free will of the people, while the negative elite fight by limiting the same factors. Either way, the status quo is unsustainable; people are figuring it out. I don&#39;t think salvation comes through the American people tho; they are too far invested. The change will come from the &#39;rest of the world&#39; rejecting the current direction and forcing a new one, causing the american people to have to accept the corruption and fight to do the same. We&#39;ll see how it goes tho; I do expect things to start moving in the next few years. Hopefully so!</p>

<p>All of those poor people around the world who are keeping their small savings in twenty year old hundred dollar bills instead of dealing with their local corruption are also part of the problem.  They are allowing themselves to be part of a several percent a year global taxation scheme and to some degree they are holding the US policy captive, even though for the moment we are benefiting in our lifestyle.  Its been difficult to get this monster under control because most of the world has been doing backflips to keep the federal reserve system intact and then the nations that directly oppose the US dollar system are taken out by the CIA and the military.</p>

<p>My opinion is that the public side of government is working with half-true information almost all the time; those with power control the channels of information in Washington rather than trying to control the representatives themselves. Why depend on a person that may or may not switch out every 2-4 years when you could just find the people in the bureaucracy who give them their information and corrupt them instead? They are typically lifers who never leave the position, and if nobody knows any different, how can you really be caught?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The control of information is clearly the key to CONTROL - whether micro (politician) or macro (public).</p>

<p>For instance, the info that was fed to us regarding the Iraq WMD lies was certainly believed by (most of) the politicians that endorsed the Iraq Attack.</p>

<p>Most.</p>

<p>So yes, baffling with bullshit is the stock in trade of the shadow government, but when necessary, they will happily use force, coercion or any other means at their disposal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the Plan B, I guess:</p>

<p>Civil unrest will happen when the middle class get poor enough.</p>

<p>Students mobilized by social networks will march on all principal cities, probably not knowing on what to claim, its vague demands will be even more diluted as more people join them. </p>

<p>The pacific protest becomes entrenched by destructive mobs inciting police violence. The first person is killed during a confrontation, people start to burn cars in anger, national monuments are victims of depredation, supermarkets are invaded. The police lose control and the army prepares to fill the streets. </p>

<p>In the name of restoring order they will shut down the internet, people are scared and blind, the president put the state under siege, and while the population is licking their wounds, an &#39;nonpartisan movement&#39; will arise. It will say that it is apolitical, that doesn&#39;t belong to the right neither to the left. That they just hunt down corruption and to attend every other demand of the population if they are granted absolute power to restructure the government institutions.</p>

<p>All three powers converge to a single one, the country will have a huge economic growth and so the population not only will accept the new structure of power, they will embrace it.</p>

<p>Like myself, I have been trying to get friends to become HAM operators.</p>

<p>In the (possibly very near) future the internet WILL be shut down or become heavily censored...this electronic web is one of the only things holding &quot;their&quot; power in check right now. &quot;They&quot; have the power to kill it and &quot;they&quot; will.</p>

<p>Seems to me that HAM radio and BBS systems are &quot;the future&quot; in a sense. I will be doing both when the plug is pulled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No...BBS relies on telephone lines (POTS lines, as we called them). I should know--I ran one of the bigger ones in Chicago as a kid. With the advent of FidoNet the Internet was slowly integrated into the BBS world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely nothing at all. That right there is the inherent weakness in BBSes.</p>

<p>You can also run a BBS using packet radio (I did this as well) but it is SLOOOW and not super-hard to jam. The ideal situation would be spread-spectrum freq-hopping on an &quot;illegal&quot; band--but ANY radio signal can be jammed.</p>

<p>You know, there was actually a &quot;white paper&quot; put together a few years ago that described a protocol based on &quot;avian transmission of packet data?&quot; Yep...that means data carried by pigeons. THAT would be a LOT less &quot;jam-able&quot; than either radio or phone lines. ; &#39;)</p>

Power inevitably seduces those with good intentions to keep playing the game for one more round and then another and then another.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting to think that once Mr.Snowden blew the whistle on something that concerns anyone who uses the internet, more people are joining the whistle blowers side rather than the untrustworthy government. </p>

<p>Not nearly as many people were as concerned when the wikileaks cables were first released by Manning. One could assume that since it dealt with &quot;terrorists&quot; and civilians in another country, nobody wanted to be seen as though they &quot;hate the troops&quot; by condemning their actions for unnecessary bloodshed. Now that it&#39;s the government spying on it&#39;s own citizens, people suddenly care. <em>Our</em> people actually care. I just hope we don&#39;t shrug it off this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when was the last time you saw a conspiracy from another part of the world here? Do you think there are no conspiracies in the rest of the world?</p>

<p>Besides just look at the sidebar. The caption next to the photo says &quot;Go back to bed America&quot;. And the part which says &quot;From JFK, UFOs, gulf of Tonkin and of course 9/11. This is a forum for free thinking - not hate speech.&quot; - all American. Then look at the sister subreddits listed just below.</p>

<p>All this give me an impression that this is only for and about Americans. In the rest of the world, tyranny and censorship is not a conspiracy theory - it&#39;s happening outside the window right now.</p>

<p>Ninja Edit: Although to be fair, I think this reddit did mention Syria, Egypt, Turkey, etc. when trouble started there, so I have to give you that one.</p>
