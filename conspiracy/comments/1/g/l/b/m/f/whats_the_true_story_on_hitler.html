       I just got out of Highschool. I plan to go for a History major, maybe become an archivist and devote research and time to cracks in History. I also want to reveal the lies, the downplays, and collaborate with Historians and researchers to get valid events in history more widespread. The one thing that has really been boggling me lately is  the "true" story of Hitlers life and death. I've heard many different stories about how he escaped the war and that his suicide was a manipulation tactic. He then went on, lived his life and died in the 80s. I have heard much more obscure stories surrounding the mysteries of Hitler. I thought this may be a good place to start. If any of you have any articles leading to good finds it would be very well appreciated.

       The "true" story on Hitler is readily accessible everywhere.  But I think there's a reason why you asked this in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and not
       <a href="/r/history">

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, everyone knows Hitler was a reptilian Jewish double agent who was carrying out a false flag operation to justify the creation of Israel.

       Good point, we should be allowed to correct misinformation and disinformation about Hitler and National Socialist Germany just as we would any other topic. How will we learn if we don't get both sides of the story?

       When doing your research bear in mind two points:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Any official explanation for any event must instantly generate at least one opposing conspiratorial explanation, probably more. This is a law within Paranoid Conspiracy Theory and is absolute. If there is an earthquake it's not plate tectonics, it's HAARP. If there's a bomb it's not Al-Quada, it's a false flag attack by the Illuminati etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The official explanation is that Hitler committed suicide, his body was partially cremated, and what remained was buried under a car park in East Berlin. Therefore there has to be a conspiratorial explanation that he did not commit suicide, was not cremated, and was not buried, and must somehow have escaped. This does not mean the conspiratorial explanation has to carry any validity or weight, just that it must exist, just as Yin cannot exist without Yang..

       Also see how he himself calls them ‘National Socialists’ rather than ‘Nazis’. True, they were National Socialists but clearly he uses that word as it does not carry the same connotations of inherent nastiness as ‘Nazi’.

       So you believe in kosher approved conspiracies like Nazis and radical Islam right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just not non kosher approved conspiracy theories like Team Israel International's involvement in 9/11.

       Truth is hard to find on this subject..After economic warfare collapsed the German economy for the second time in 20 years the Nazis really targeted the Jews of Germany, who were in powerful economic positions. This wiki is biased because it ignores the 1920s economic collapse that was also attributed to Jews in powerful economic places. But it does show that Jews basically declared an economic war against Germany causing Hitler's movement to really pick up steam.

       The previous economic collapse was in the early 1920s which caused the anti-semtic mind set to start to take shape.

       The war it's self was highly manipulated from all over and hard to figure out. Maybe someone else can help you with that part.

       Hitler became obsessed with occult knowledge and forming a European Union by force. Later in history Hitler's plan was carried out in a different way which resulted in the EU and UN.

       This. No understanding of Hitler is complete without an understanding of his dealings in the dark side of the Occult.

        Trevor Ravenscroft's "The Spear of Destiny"
       </a>
       is a good primer on this. One cannot, for instance, understand Hitler's hate for the Jews without first understanding that many of his racial purity beliefs come from Hitler's obsession with occult lore like the Norse legends or The Spear of Destiny (

       You seem to have a good plan set, but remember we live in a crazy world and People like you who want to find the truth and change history are always going to be scrutinized by others. Don't let that stop you or slow you down. Remember there are always two sides of a story and if you only view one your results will be Biased.

       Yes, I do believe Irving explained what happened quite well according to close associates of Hitler. I have also previously heard Adrian Salbuchi talk about this myth. Salbuchi is from Argentina.

       Totally serious here. Were it not for Hitler (or someone doing what Hitler did), Israel could not have gained the population base necessary to form a viable political State. There just weren't enough Jews that were interested in abandoning their comfortable and secure lives in Europe to

       This is true. Many non Zionist and non Communist Jews in Germany and Europe were put between a rock and a hard place by the elite Jews in the USA agitating for war. I am sure many did not want to move to the desert to live with Arabs.

       Some people have described the Holocaust narrative as the ultimate defense mechanism to prevent criticism of Jewish power and control. I now think the main purpose of keeping alive the Holocaust is to protect Jewish banking and financial practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ADL formed the same year as the Federal Reserve. Quite a coincidence don't you think? Nathaneal Kapner has pointed out that that Jews grow up with the understanding that the Federal Reserve is run by Jews and a source of Jewish power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Powerful Jewish Zionists were the ones who influenced Woodrow Wilson into the Federal Reserve Act and WW I via the Balfour Declaration to Lord Rothschild.

      <p>
       Hitler never attempted to destroy Judaism but rather to isolate it and perhaps remove its adherents from Europe.

       1897: The Rothschilds found the Zionist Congress to promote Zionism (a political movement with the sole aim of moving all Jews into a singularly Jewish nation state) and arrange its first meeting in Munich.  However due to extreme opposition from local Jews, who are quite happy where they are, this meeting has to be moved to Basle, Switzerland and takes place on 29 August. The meeting is chaired by Ashkenazi Jew, Theodor Herzl, who would state in his diaries,
      </p>
      <p>
       "It is essential that the sufferings of Jews….become worse….this will assist in realization of our plans….I have an excellent idea….I shall induce anti-Semites to liquidate Jewish wealth….The anti-Semites will assist us thereby in that they will strengthen the persecution and oppression of Jews. The anti-Semites shall be our best friends."
      </p>
      <p>
       Herzl is subsequently elected President of the Zionist Organisation which adopts the, "Rothschild Red Hexagram or Sign," as the Zionist flag which 51 years later will end up as the flag of Israel.

      <p>
       Wanna hear my theory? Well you asked so here it is:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler fought nobly in World War I, defending the land he grew up in from the powderkeg lunacy that was random madmen asserting land grabs. During his time in France, he and Harry S. Truman had one of those stare-down moments in the trenches or wherever, and they each recognized in the other mortal enemies - Truman, who gunned down some of the last Germans in France (and then dropped atomic bombs on a Japan offering a
       <em>
        conditional
       </em>
       surrender), and Hitler, there to defend his homeland. They say the eyes are the windows to the soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wounded but having survived, thanks to providence - a British soldier very near fired at him while he was escaping with a wound, but decided to let him go as he was escaping while wounded (he had a portrait dedicated to this occasion in one of his outposts), he returned to a war-weary Austria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon hearing of the boxcar deal, in which essentially America blamed the whole of the war on Germany and decided that Germany will pay for the whole thing, and also exorbitant royalties on the Maxim machine-gun, and whatever else they could come up with, Hitler thought back to that smart-alecky, Harry Potter looking fellow he'd seen scared shitless on the battle ground as he saw through his glasses into his soul of blackness. He pondered why on Earth would these Americans want to completely demolish and ruin Germany, a country of industrious people with a noble mercenary tradition and fine beer?
      </p>
      <p>
       He pondered, and Germany was impoverished. The Weimar marks devalued, and soon people carted wheelbarrows of them to and fro for a loaf of bread. He pondered, and he acted - having failed at a coup attempt, he was imprisoned, giving him time to do little but ponder and write.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he pondered, I'm imagining, goes something like "In this time since World War I, these damnable communist regimes have popped up elsewhere, with their yellow hammers and sickles, impoverishing those countries as well. Where on Earth could they have come from?" His answer to his question was likely found in his austere Lutheran Bible, which he studied thoroughly in his youth.
      </p>
      <p>
       His answer likely came in the form of Babylon. THE Babylon. Not a metaphorical one, the real one. Those same brickstacking morons that tried to dominate the world so many millenia before had been at it for the last few thousand years, having a second go at their self-defeating goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       He read Jeremiah 50, he drew some parallels, and he got PISSED. There's nobody gets pissed like Hitler got pissed, and Hitler got pissed. He got pissed at everybody for just buying into the sweet babble, the empty promises, the irrational rationalizations for insane decision-making and economics, and imperialism, and war - but most of all he got pissed at the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know WHY he got so pissed at the Jews? Because those noble Jew warriors he'd read about in his Lutheran bible were nowhere to be found in his day and age. They were busy making dreadful hollywood pictures for the "Americans," they were busy participating in fraudulent financial schemes, they were busy jewelling and drawing and photographing and whatever else they were busy with. But for thousands of years they hadn't killed a single Babylonian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a Jew (arguably) himself, he decided he'd set the world straight on some things, like for example the ten commandments. The one banning idolatry - images - is the THIRD ONE. NOT THAT HARD TO REMEMBER. So he slapped a swastika, an ancient geometric decoration used by Aryans (dark people) for thousands of years before on his white circle of a delimited pan-Germania, put that on a background of red, vibrant, bloody red, raised up those nazi standards, and went blitzkrieg on Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't waste time babbling about how we need to babble more, he did what he needed to do to get the chancellorship and he went to war, and he did a damn fine job of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Americans sent out nasty pictures on stupid flyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler sent them back, with clever retorts written on those pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the world was busy being brainwashed, Hitler went to work unbabbling the Babel and slaying Babylonian-brainwashed commies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he knew he couldn't do it alone - he needed those Jew warriors to finish Babble off for good. So he taught them a lesson they'd never forget - don't just make decisions based on stupid bullshit that someone says without thinking about it, and don't think that sitting around not standing up for one another will fix it. And so, refusing to give the Babylonians or their communist minions any more fodder for their propaganda machine and God knows what else, he killed his wife Eva and then himself, in a final act of martyrdom reminiscent of certain other Jews holed up in a mountain fortress roughly two thousand years before his time.

       Bernie Ecclestone is also a man who is desperate to make as much money as possible, to the point where he is investing in the royal families/governments of countries with oppressive authorities, ie Bahrain. I wouldn't use him as a role model. I wouldn't take what he normally says, unless he has his head under the bonnet of a F1 car, seriously, let alone when he's talking about Hitler.

       Germany issued debt-free and interest-free money from 1935 and on, accounting for its startling rise from the depression to a world power in 5 years. Germany financed its entire government and war operation from 1935 to 1945 without gold and without debt, and it took the whole Capitalist and Communist world to destroy the German power over Europe and bring Europe back under the heel of the Bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such history of money does not even appear in the textbooks of public (government) schools today. And because it was a debt-free currency , there was no inflation in the Reich . What cost one Deutschmark in 1935 , cost one Deutschmark in 1945 . The International Jewish Bankers had to destroy the Reich and vilify National Socialism , so as to detract from the National Socialist principles of economic freedom for the people , which would show the entire world that the parasitism of Capitalism and Marxism both , were nothing less than a destructive assault upon the world . The root of the world's turmoil .

       The borrower is in servitude to the lender. Hitler kicked out the Rothschilds and freed the German population from odious debt and financial manipulation.

       Once again I like so many people I experienced the Hitler and Nazis as MONSTERS indoctrination process in high school, college, media and entertainment for many, many years. After delving into 9/11 I finally got the guts to ask the hard questions about that era. Thanks to the internet people can now look into the other side of the story. Really prior to about 1995 this was nearly impossible. Even now great efforts are made to suppress information about that era.

       I never considered looking into it until about 6 years ago. Investigating 9/11 has opened millions of eyes. The Jewish Zionist  elite screwed up because this has lead people to question and investigate many other issues.

      <p>
       No group in the history of the world has had it as good as the Jewish have had it in the USA since WW II. I think Americans are starting to feel like Germans did after the Treaty of Versailles.

       When you're in debt to someone, they have control over you. They can use it as means to manipulate you. Money is often interchangeable with labor, so someone who is trying to climb out of debt often looks like someone who is under the influence of forced labor - or slavery.

       That is not the same thing as slavery. If I enter into a completely voluntary contract with you and promise to perform certain services for you, then you have control over me and can use it as a means to manipulate me. That is not slavery.

       What do you mean by "often" and "interchangeable"? I can't go to the store and trade labor for food. I can't pay my employer a week's wages and not do any labor for a week whenever I feel like it.

       Jewish engineered banking and capitalism is all we have ever known. Unfortunately it is a very exploitative form to it host populations.

       We live under economic conquest. It takes place when nations are placed under "tribute" without the use of visible force or coercion, so that the victims do not realize they have been conquered. "Tribute" is collected from them in the form of "legal" debts and taxes, and they believe they are paying it for their own good, for the good of others, or to protect all from some enemy. Their captors become their "benefactors" and "protectors".
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this is the slowest to impose. It is often quite long lasting, as the captives do not see any military force arrayed against them, their religion is left more or less intact, they have freedom to speak and travel, and they participate in "elections" for their rulers. Without realizing it, they are conquered, and the instruments of their own society are used to transfer their wealth to their captors and make the conquest complete.
