       QNX like most software has bugs, e.g. zero days(non patched security bugs).

       is a zero day on the QNX neutrino kernel allowing one to overwrite files which normally are blocked from being overwritten. It's design allows for quick restarts of any subsystem if a system is to fail, possibly loading the new changed file. There are probably more bugs in QNX, as there are in any system.

      <p>
       Any Mercedes Benz software is likely easier to attack, but breaking QNX means you have the upper hand on

       Isn't QNX NOT Linux?  Seems to me I remember this OS, it's hallmark was that it was clean room from the bootstrap up, utilizing no other existing code, and it could boot and load the whole OS off of a 1.44 MB floppy.  The idea was that it was lightweight and good for embedded controllers, and would have less vulnerabilities because it was not on the radar for desktop usage.

       Understanding QNX
      </p>
      <p>
       The main differentiating feature of QNX is that, it is a microkernel-based OS. To understand microkernels, we first have to understand kernels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, kernels are the little Lego pieces that make up the operating system. The operating system allows the user to use applications on a phone/tablet because it is the bridge that manages the communication between the applications and the hardware of a device. The operating software is responsible for many functions, including managing memory, process and task management, disk management, device driver, protocol stacks and file systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       When operating software is being developed, there are different philosophies the designer can adopt within a spectrum. At one end is the monolithic kernel, whereby all the responsibilities of an operating system are lumped into a single operating system file.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the other end of the spectrum, in a microkernel-based system OS, only the minimum functions of the OS are included into the file. The microkernel is considered to be more compact, portable and agile because it performs only the basic functions required to run the device. Typically, the functions included in the OS are those that are universal to all computers. The more traditional functions of the operating system not included in the microkernel are those such as device drivers, protocol stacks and file systems, which run in the user space (outside the microkernel). For this reason, the microkernel OS system is described as minimalistic, clean and logical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, advantages a microkernel has to offer over a monolithic kernel are therefore quite obvious; one can replace and restart drivers, file systems and so forth on the fly, without having to shutdown the entire system. Also, when part of the operating system crashes, it does not bring down the entire system, because the crashed part is outside of kernelspace.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an analogy, imagine a large steak that has to be served in a week. In a monolithic kernel system, the entire steak is put into a fridge to store (a single operating system file). If the steak were to spoil, the entire steak would be no good, and have to be thrown away. On the other hand, when the steak is divided into several pieces and placed into different fridges, even if one of the pieces spoils, the other pieces will be still be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The benefits of a microkernel based OS system have far-reaching implications. For mission critical processes, having a crash-proof system is absolutely vital.
      </p>
      <p>
       "A day of reckoning will come. Because as more and more of our lives migrate from desktops and laptops to mobile devices, we will have to solve the problems around security, privacy, anonymity, access to data. If we want this true seamlessness between devices, it means that the underlying plumbing has to share all this data and the only way to do it is going to be to actually solve these hard problems. I am sure there will be some spectacular security breaches - and then people will wake up."
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, we see the use of microkernel-based OS prevalent within the corporate community for enterprise planning systems, hospital equipment such as MRI scanners, military applications, nuclear power plants and parts of the International Space Station.
      </p>
      <p>
       QNX has stood the test of time and its microkernel is easy to understand. "If you look at the microkernel architecture, the microkernel is the only trusted component in the system," he explains. "It's the one thing that can never fail and it gets to control access. In the case of our microkernel it's about 100,000 lines of code, give or take ten thousand and that's the core code that has to be absolutely bullet proof. If you look at something like Linux, I don't know what it's up to today but it was up to 14 million lines six months ago. That code all runs in privileged space and one line in that can take down the whole system or be the vulnerability that people exploit. It's very difficult to test to prove that that amount of code is secure and bug free."

       Obviously the first thing investigators should do is check for a compromised ECU.  They should also look into CCTV footage of anyone accessing his car recently.  The ECU could have been maliciously programmed months ago so it's a long shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could "they" have sent a signal through his cell phone telling the compromised ECU to accelerate?

       For those that don't understand - the gas pedal is drive-by-wire meaning that there is no physical cable connected from the pedal to the engine and the throttle is fully computer controlled.

       I know i seemed to have shit on this post a bit, and that wasn't my intention, but i figure now i'm here i'll ask a question that might help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we try to get a picture of the route he took in the minutes before the crash? It would be interesting to see which streets he was on, and whether it was feasible that he got up enough speed to cause such massive damage to his car.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think i've ever seen a whole

        engine and transmission
       </a>
       completely leave a car after a crash before, but then it does look like a fairly wide/straight road from

       , so maybe it's possible he was travelling at a fairly high speed. Just throwing my thoughts around - take it as you will.

       Seems you've already come to a conclusion before you've done your "research". Not the way to do it, sorry. It looks dodgy for sure, but it's two days after the event and r/conspiracy has already decided it's murder. Just... no.

       All of the evidence points in an obvious manner. There is nothing pointing in a contradicting manner. If there is, I would love to see it.

       But what I am looking for is information to further my theory. If Mercedez-Benz did not ship QNX with the exploit, then that section is incorrect. Not to say there isn't a shitload more of exploits as the video posted above demonstrates.

       I don't know what sort of evidence you expect the police who have ruled it an accident, and a government hell bent on covering their asses will release as "evidence". Instead, during these times people should investigate themselves, as the monopoly on investigations, justice, and criminal proceedings is corrupt.

       I work in auto engineering, we make factory accessories for just about every company you can think of. My boss and I have been fascinated about this story. This is what I can tell you - our products have to hook into the vehicles power. Every car has an inner working of power harnesses with various multi pinned connectors. This meaning many functionalities can be sourced from one power harness. We recently had a few warranty claims on our products (which I am not naming) and it turned out it was from a glitch in the installed sound system - our products have NOTHING to do with sound systems. Basically the one screwy accessory was messing with all the other items attached to that power source. We also have developed some blue tooth functionality for our products and had to go through lots of engineering roadblocks to make sure our product wasn't using the same wavelengths (or whatever magic transmission wireless things use) that the car was using for other things. Total point being it is WAAAAAYYYY easier to manipulate vehicles than most people think. Everything is connected and if you have a knowledge of the cars engineering it would be fairly easy to manipulate things. I have always thought that 4:45 am is not coming home from bar time that is more "I am a journalist in LA and have to get to a meeting to remote in to the East coast" or some other business thing. Honestly I think he parked wherever he was staying went to bed leaving ample time for someone to come in and screw with his car (even if in underground secure parking like most places in LA have it wouldn't be difficult) he gets up gets in his car, heads down Highland which one of only fairly wide flat streets in LA and the powers that be who have messed with his car put their plan into action. It really isn't that mysterious I would think the real "conspiracy" is people trying to explain how this was an accident! Oh and full disclosure I am fairly new to reddit, read lots don't post much - so any advance apologies if I am doing this wrong! :)

       Absolutely agree, but like i said, putting "murder" in the title shows that there is only one conclusion you're interested in. Hey, it's probably the right conclusion, but it's still not what you do when trying to investigate something (good on you for trying btw). That's what NIST did with the collapse of the towers on 9/11, they came to a conclusion and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       did an "investigation" to back up their preconceived ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, i completely agree that
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       needs to do an alternative investigation to the official one, because if it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       murder, then we can't trust the authorities to tell us.
