    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a <em>secret court</em> that rubberstamps everything with no accountability except from those that support and control the program.</p>

<p>Secret courts are a <em>fucking</em> bad thing, jump off the system&#39;s dick and go read a history book. </p>

<p>It&#39;s becoming very clear that the prez or party simply doesn&#39;t matter, both parties are beholden to outside interests that have more influence than voters.</p>

<p>Organizations want to survive and grow. People want to keep their jobs. Corporations want to post good quarterly numbers. After the Cold War ended there were a lot of intel and mil organizations that were facing obsolescence, but lucked out when 9/11 happened. They&#39;re pushing fear as hard as they can because they want to keep their jobs and projects. I get the why they&#39;re doing it, and I don&#39;t even really think it&#39;s <em>evil</em>, any more than a wolf eating a sheep is <em>evil</em>. It&#39;s organizational survival.</p>

<p>It&#39;s completely fucking unacceptable in America, regardless of weather the talking head supporting it has an R or D next to their name, and both &quot;sides&quot; are very well represented.</p>

<p>Except its not a &quot;secret&quot; court.  Because the wiretaps requests are official record.  Nice try but failed.  If it was a secret court we wouldn&#39;t even know they were approving wiretaps.  Just using the word secret doesn&#39;t make it secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that it may be that they are <em>supposed to be</em> court approved but there is no way in hell that we can be sure they don&#39;t happen without court approval anyway. Information gathered that way certainly couldn&#39;t be used in court but it could be used by the president to declare someone an &#39;enemy combatant&#39; and consign them to indefinite detention or for assassination. There&#39;s no oversight at all for those kinds of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Changes for the better?  What country are you living in bro?  If they can&#39;t even stop Boston Marathon, which they had a terrorist, ON A TERROR watch list, who learned how to make his bomb online, reading TERRORIST training materials, and tipped off by the Russians, and THEY STILL DON&#39;T STOP HIM?  Or how about that war that Bush started, you know WMD&#39;s in Iraq that Obama was going to stop?  Well he did.......ONLY TO TRY AND MAKE THE SAME ARGUMENT in another billion dollar, decade war in Syria ! But we&#39;re better off?  I&#39;d like to know what is better then 8 years ago?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s the whole reason why they are collecting the data right, to stop terrorism.  If they can&#39;t catch &quot;lone wolf&quot; terrorists then why do they collect every email, text message, phone call, and data on my grand mother who uses Verizon Wireless?  If you are going to blanket survvail everyone, but not surrvail a suspect who was in Russia for months meeting with known terrorist groups, we know the Russians wiretapped him talking to his mom about jihad, so we can now safely assume the NSA also had this call as well, and not only when he comes back is he able to self radicalized himself online via YouTube videos (remember he&#39;s on a no fly list), and purchase all parts to a pressure cooker bomb from buying the components online, but not only do they not stop him, THEY ALSO DIDN&#39;T IDENTIFY HIM! They asked for the public&#39;s help in identifying &quot;suspect 1 and suspect 2&quot;?  </p>

<p>On a side note, how much is the government paying you to troll here?  Is it good money?  I lost my job and wanted to see if I could work with you and make some extra money. Is there a sign up sheet or application you filled out?</p>
