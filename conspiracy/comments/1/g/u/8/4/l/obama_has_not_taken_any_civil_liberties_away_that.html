       Couldn't have said it better myself. I think the biggest difference is Obama came to office preaching change, I'm going to stop this and change this, and be the most transparent administration, blah blah.  I'm not afraid to admit, he fooled me, I had no clue this was change, I would have told him keep the change had I have known.

       Secret courts are a
       <em>
        fucking
       </em>
       bad thing, jump off the system's dick and go read a history book.

       It's becoming very clear that the prez or party simply doesn't matter, both parties are beholden to outside interests that have more influence than voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organizations want to survive and grow. People want to keep their jobs. Corporations want to post good quarterly numbers. After the Cold War ended there were a lot of intel and mil organizations that were facing obsolescence, but lucked out when 9/11 happened. They're pushing fear as hard as they can because they want to keep their jobs and projects. I get the why they're doing it, and I don't even really think it's
       <em>
        evil
       </em>
       , any more than a wolf eating a sheep is
       <em>
        evil
       </em>
       . It's organizational survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's completely fucking unacceptable in America, regardless of weather the talking head supporting it has an R or D next to their name, and both "sides" are very well represented.

       Except its not a "secret" court.  Because the wiretaps requests are official record.  Nice try but failed.  If it was a secret court we wouldn't even know they were approving wiretaps.  Just using the word secret doesn't make it secret.

       wow that absolutely does not disagree with me.  That just says whether they are "transparent" whatever that means.  all I said is that there is no warrantless wiretaps.  They are all approved by a court now.  You are the liar.

       Obama hasn't give anyone's liberties back. But what the teapaty asholes fails to realize is that the presidents job isn't to please his people. The system is corrupt. The only reason there is two options on election day is to make you believe that you are in controll, like your vote counts at all.

       I consider myself to be extremely liberal, in fact this is why I supported Obama in 08 , and because of George Bush, but now Obama and Kerry, and Biden, the same guys in 07 running up to the election were calling for the Bush administration to be transparent in the warrantless wiretapping, ARE NOW THE SAME GUYS THAT HAVE EXPANDED AND GROWN the program.  I  truly believe that Obama is not in charge right now, the intelligence / military are having a hay day right now, I don't think Obama could even stop it if he tried.  The entire system is broke, if my only choices are Obama or Romney, It's the worse of two evils. We have no choice in America.

       I want to be with the winning team attitude.....uh I was, I just said I voted for Obama, and if it were Romney on office, we'd probably be in the exact same place in time as we are today, if not worse.  The only difference I guess is Romney already was a billionaire before being president, Obama will be after he leaves, both are run by Big Bankers, and wealthy corporations, you pick which you want.

       My point was that it may be that they are
       <em>
        supposed to be
       </em>
       court approved but there is no way in hell that we can be sure they don't happen without court approval anyway. Information gathered that way certainly couldn't be used in court but it could be used by the president to declare someone an 'enemy combatant' and consign them to indefinite detention or for assassination. There's no oversight at all for those kinds of things.

       Changes for the better?  What country are you living in bro?  If they can't even stop Boston Marathon, which they had a terrorist, ON A TERROR watch list, who learned how to make his bomb online, reading TERRORIST training materials, and tipped off by the Russians, and THEY STILL DON'T STOP HIM?  Or how about that war that Bush started, you know WMD's in Iraq that Obama was going to stop?  Well he did.......ONLY TO TRY AND MAKE THE SAME ARGUMENT in another billion dollar, decade war in Syria ! But we're better off?  I'd like to know what is better then 8 years ago?

       that's the whole reason why they are collecting the data right, to stop terrorism.  If they can't catch "lone wolf" terrorists then why do they collect every email, text message, phone call, and data on my grand mother who uses Verizon Wireless?  If you are going to blanket survvail everyone, but not surrvail a suspect who was in Russia for months meeting with known terrorist groups, we know the Russians wiretapped him talking to his mom about jihad, so we can now safely assume the NSA also had this call as well, and not only when he comes back is he able to self radicalized himself online via YouTube videos (remember he's on a no fly list), and purchase all parts to a pressure cooker bomb from buying the components online, but not only do they not stop him, THEY ALSO DIDN'T IDENTIFY HIM! They asked for the public's help in identifying "suspect 1 and suspect 2"?
