I go into pretty good detail on a lot of important issues showing how Obama and Clinton have followed the same policies of Bush I,II and Reagan. I use 40 or so mainstream sources. Some of the research was really surprising and fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is an incredible article, and it sum up so much of what I&#39;ve always said to people. I especially love the part about how pointless the gay marriage debate is.</p>

<p>You know this is very very special, and your name will go down in history - that is not an over statement. This article represents the complete manifestation of the lifting of the information veil. The Dark Ages are officially over - though operationally are still in place. This represents exactly what the elite have been trying to get the common man not to know or read for hundreds and hundreds of years.</p>

<p>It is going to be a very very interesting near future now that the veil is lifted. I&#39;m sharing this.</p>

<p>After the last decade-plus of Republican clusterfucks, the Patriot Act, the Tea Party, legitimate rape, gay bashing, Rush Limbaugh vs Sluts on Birth Control, the giant &quot;oopsies&quot; of letting people like Palin, Santorum, Perry, etc. take the main stage and shit all over it, politicians blaming weather on God&#39;s wrath and other generally unpalatable religious overtones it&#39;ll be a good while before any privacy, small government, states&#39; rights types are allowed to make much noise because, well ... they done made errbody look crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right? its actually a polyocracy. A 1 state dictatorship with 2 factions, democrats and republicans, which are actually pretty much the same. people recently have been blaming the NSA, obama and others etc. for these actions and the pretty much &#39;downfall&#39; of society. I myself am just sixteen years of age and can already see its not this that is the problem its the education system plain and simple. ever wondered why people are so politically unmotivated? education system. ever wondered why people just dont care and see government as something that rules them and not vice versa? education system. the education system is the root of all this. it teaches kinds to not care. kids who dont care make teenagers that dont care and teenagers who dont care make adults dont care and thats when you get a whole lot of problems. Me myself, can vouch for this, being from the generation who&#39;s top priority is how kim kardashians baby is doing i can see we&#39;re on a road to nowhere. fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, we have to get more people to realize that whatever the government tells them isn&#39;t necessarily true. I get teased when I talk about these things, and when I show proof, they ignore it. People look away from what makes them uncomfortable. That&#39;s a problem with everyone, especially some of the previous generation. I talk to my mom and she says she just doesn&#39;t want to hear it because it makes her uncomfortable- I&#39;m glad my dad likes to talk about it, and my grandpa, at least (I&#39;m 16, too)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very true and has been for quite a while. Its good to see people waking up to the corruption that is endemic of our political process. It is sad how brainwashed people are into thinking they have a choice. With our knowledge we can wake people up to the machinations of the elites&#39; divide and conquer schemes, and fear based control mechanisms, through predictive programming in various forms and mass media hypnosis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.  It&#39;s just crazy how long it took most Redditors (especially those in r/politics) to become disillusioned by Obummer.  Even crazier is that we&#39;ll end up with another Republcrat prez come 2016 as if none of this ever happened.  </p>

<p>The president is just a salesman put in place to sell us bad policies; a PR person for the three-letter gangs that hold all the power.  (NSA, FBI, DEA, CIA, IRS, ATF, etc).  Changing the salesman&#39;s face every 8 years gives people the illusion that we have a choice.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is here that you cannot control what other people are going to do. The only person that you have control over is yourself. You can develop yourself to your full potential or at least some part of it. You cannot study for another person. You cannot tell them what to be interested in or what they should do with their lives. It is up to each individual.</p>
