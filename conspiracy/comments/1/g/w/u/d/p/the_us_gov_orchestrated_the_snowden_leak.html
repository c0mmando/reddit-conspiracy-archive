       Just a conspiracy hypothesis, that's all.  Assume the US gov is relatively immensely powerful; they can fight large scale wars, build advanced robots, use quantum cryptography, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have influence and control over media.

      <p>
       They are allowing the Snowden leak.  Why?

       when being watched, i feel like people will be less likely to propose extreme views or ideas. we also know we lack the element of surprise, and will be met with opposition. they also have a chance to put in an inside man to provoke violence, which will result in a swift crackdown. the first uprising will be made a harsh example for future ones.

       You may be on to something with that one...  It does seem like a potentially effective way to engineer societal docility.

       Well... In a sense they are... BUT they seem to be a bit arrogant and foolish at times and are absolutely
       <em>
        riddled

       with mistakes, 9/11 for instance, which leads me to believe they are nothing more than an ignorant cabal that has stolen OUR POWER through the banking system and are attempting to wield it against us. Mark my words they will fail... And although it won't bring back the millions of lives that have been destroyed, their heads will roll and the pillars of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness will be restored.

       Unfortunately, we need to all be able to identify the problems in the world and SEE a future where these problems are eradicated. Cut off at the root. We are creating this reality and it starts with what we perceive and then translates into our actions. I hope you will become more optimistic about our future in time.

       i agree that they are allowing it. why? your guess is as good as mine. maybe so they can get the mainstream media to demonize him as a traitor a la emmanuel goldstein style (from 1984, remember?). the problem for them is that everyone i talk to thinks he shouldn't be prosecuted for spying since it's the nsa doing the real spying.
this information (that the nsa spies on americans) has been around since at least 2006. it could be inferred through logical deduction since the patriot act was passed. it's only when the mainstream media starts jamming it down people's throats that anyone thinks about it as anything more than a paranoid delusion. it's hard for me not to say 'i told you so'. it's so tempting

       Yes excellent response, and just to expand a little, people when they hear the term 'mind control' immediately think of someone acting like a robot totally submissive to someone else's command.

       In fact the term mind control can be so broadly applied to so many different circumstances, from the simple control of media feeding people's minds with sanitized information in order to control debate, to the overt 'talking in your head' ala Google Glass and some other CIA/alphabet agency technologies.  People don't think about it in this way though.  Once they start to see it, it looses it's effectiveness, at least through the more subtle and less overt methods.

       If they can make people afraid to talk to each other, even in private, it doesn't actually matter whether they're

       under surveillance or not.

       Fear is a management tool. So some aspect of the effectiveness of weapons is demonstrating them, to establish a sense of "shock and awe", and persuade people that change is happening. Hastings is a capability demo.  Snowden is to establish new rules a "everyone is being watched at all times."
      </p>
      <p>
       As Dorner, Tsarnaev and Hastings events show, "There is nowhere you can hide anymore, so you might as well not try to resist."  Along with Snowden, these events also serve to help the "bad machines" to expose themselves with their comments and concern online, which feed right in to their precog profile.  Baiting the fools is also effective, have you seen these "What would it take to get you to overthrow the government" posts?  Just honey pots to help flush out the loonies.

       I feel the Snowden leak is a farce. It's just a way for the bank controlled media to show the american people that they are still looking out for Americans best interests. In the background the banks are still stealing our wealth.

       How about because the government actually wants to stop the spying, but are being blackmailed by the intelligence community into officially supporting it. So they "accidentally" let the Snowden leak pass by, but now they're being blackmailed into prosecuting him.

       Not really. I think they were at one point, but the intelligence agencies were allowed to become autonomous institutions during the Cold War. And once they were able to blackmail one president, one influential politician, it created a cascading effect where they could perpetually secure for themselves more power. The more power they are given, the more dirt they have to blackmail the politicians. And they likely even now have power to influence the decision of who gets put into positions of power, ensuring that they'll be able to have their hands on the strings.

       People talk about "Illuminati", and they're partially right, but the Illuminati doesn't exist anymore. What people think is the Illuminati is actually the shadowy meta-government of the CIA and NSA.

       Lately I've fallen into the line of thinking that I question everything. But to avoid becoming the crazy man living in a shack afraid of the government I've also decided to commit to nothing unless the evidence is sufficient. There is scant evidence to prove this is controlled dissent but that doesn't mean it is not so. Keep an open mind.
