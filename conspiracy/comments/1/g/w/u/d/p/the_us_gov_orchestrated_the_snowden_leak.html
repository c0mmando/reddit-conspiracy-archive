    <div class="md"><p>i agree that they are allowing it. why? your guess is as good as mine. maybe so they can get the mainstream media to demonize him as a traitor a la emmanuel goldstein style (from 1984, remember?). the problem for them is that everyone i talk to thinks he shouldn&#39;t be prosecuted for spying since it&#39;s the nsa doing the real spying.
this information (that the nsa spies on americans) has been around since at least 2006. it could be inferred through logical deduction since the patriot act was passed. it&#39;s only when the mainstream media starts jamming it down people&#39;s throats that anyone thinks about it as anything more than a paranoid delusion. it&#39;s hard for me not to say &#39;i told you so&#39;. it&#39;s so tempting</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes excellent response, and just to expand a little, people when they hear the term &#39;mind control&#39; immediately think of someone acting like a robot totally submissive to someone else&#39;s command.</p>

<p>In fact the term mind control can be so broadly applied to so many different circumstances, from the simple control of media feeding people&#39;s minds with sanitized information in order to control debate, to the overt &#39;talking in your head&#39; ala Google Glass and some other CIA/alphabet agency technologies.  People don&#39;t think about it in this way though.  Once they start to see it, it looses it&#39;s effectiveness, at least through the more subtle and less overt methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear is a management tool. So some aspect of the effectiveness of weapons is demonstrating them, to establish a sense of &quot;shock and awe&quot;, and persuade people that change is happening. Hastings is a capability demo.  Snowden is to establish new rules a &quot;everyone is being watched at all times.&quot;</p>

<p>As Dorner, Tsarnaev and Hastings events show, &quot;There is nowhere you can hide anymore, so you might as well not try to resist.&quot;  Along with Snowden, these events also serve to help the &quot;bad machines&quot; to expose themselves with their comments and concern online, which feed right in to their precog profile.  Baiting the fools is also effective, have you seen these &quot;What would it take to get you to overthrow the government&quot; posts?  Just honey pots to help flush out the loonies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. I think they were at one point, but the intelligence agencies were allowed to become autonomous institutions during the Cold War. And once they were able to blackmail one president, one influential politician, it created a cascading effect where they could perpetually secure for themselves more power. The more power they are given, the more dirt they have to blackmail the politicians. And they likely even now have power to influence the decision of who gets put into positions of power, ensuring that they&#39;ll be able to have their hands on the strings. </p>

<p>People talk about &quot;Illuminati&quot;, and they&#39;re partially right, but the Illuminati doesn&#39;t exist anymore. What people think is the Illuminati is actually the shadowy meta-government of the CIA and NSA.</p>
