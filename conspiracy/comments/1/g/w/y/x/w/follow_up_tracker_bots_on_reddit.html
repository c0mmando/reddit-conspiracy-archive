<p>Politicbot collects posts and the users associated with them in order to record patterns in user behavior.  It dumps them onto r/POLITIC which is self described as &quot;Politics Without Suppression&quot;.  I think the image of &quot;unsuppressed&quot; media is a ruse.  I performed a few tests, and politicbot chooses what to mirror based on trending keywords.  I was able to get pure nonsense posted to r/POLITIC.  It doesn&#39;t seem to ignore spam or propaganda.  Most importantly, politicbot chooses only a fraction of what&#39;s posted to r/worldnews, r/conspiracy, r/canada, etc..  What exactly is it filtering if it&#39;s not filtering out my incoherent posts and the occasional blatantly biased article?  I suspect politicbot functions as a tracking device used on targeted users with r/POLITIC serving as its reservoir.  If you&#39;ve ever posted to r/worldnews, r/conspiracy, r/news, or other places for current events, check to see if your post was mirrored.  You can do this by checking &quot;other discussions (#)&quot; inside of your post.  The creator of this bot, u/go1dfish, is in disfavor with much of reddit for some reason.  After reading dozens of discussions with u/go1dfish, I still don&#39;t know what to make of him/her.</p>

<p>u/funnymanisi, u/conspiro, and u/fringebot5001 are other bots with questionable purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That actually makes me doubt my theory.  r/politics is notoriously heavy-handed with moderation, and r/POLITIC claims to support the posts that are being actively suppressed.  r/POLITIC may be exactly what it claims to be with some intrinsic flaws in chosen content.  I&#39;m willing to remain open to that possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PoliticBot will post pretty much any post it finds in its monitored subreddits.  There are a couple of ideologically neutral filters in place to prevent reposting of personal information though.</p>

<p>Some examples of things that shouldn&#39;t get mirrored:</p>

<ul>
<li>Links to Facebook domains.</li>
<li>titles with phone numbers or emails.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also if your original post is filtered/removed it can take some time before it will show (if it does at all)</p>

<p>Very young user accounts also don&#39;t get mirrored as this helps prevent mirroring the small amount of true spam at makes it through reddits spam filters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just not true... I created accounts just to get posts mirrored, and it worked.  The accounts were minutes old, and they got mirrored.  Also many posts are ignored by your bot even when they don&#39;t have personally identifiable information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may have removed that filter at some point been a while since ive looked at this code.</p>

<p>The bot isn&#39;t perfect, it will miss posts on occasion.  They may or may not show up later if it encounters them at a later date. </p>

<p>It&#39;s much more likely to miss posts that are removed btw, if your test posts are getting removed/filtered the bot may not be seeing them all.</p>

<p>The bots trying to mirror a lot of content, and is constrained by reddit API request limit guidelines.  It&#39;s the 4th most active sub by submissions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the subreddits that your bot harvests content from are known to be corrupt, and even you voiced this opinion.  How can you create an unadulterated source of political discussion when all the information seems to cater to the same agenda?  There are very few people who generate new content for r/POLITIC. And when they do, your bot buries them.  You understand why I&#39;m skeptical right?  It&#39;s a huge subreddit that&#39;s just as capable of of manufacturing opinions as r/politics.  It may be more powerful because people probably believe they are privy to pure truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the mirrored subs are proffering diametrically opposed viewpoints.  I don&#39;t see a single unified agenda among them as a whole.  My complaints with the subs you mention is more to do with moderator removals than the content of the sub.</p>

<p>My goal isn&#39;t to create a happy medium of balanced content, it&#39;s to give any submissions a chance of exposure based on the votes alone and unimpeded by moderator removals, regardless of the viewpoint offered.</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of both good and bad content there, that&#39;s what voting is for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying the moderators have an agenda.  I mean look at the moderators in worldnews, news, politics, conspiracy.  It&#39;s largely the same people.  Granted I can&#39;t attest to the social dynamics involved in groups of moderators, but there has to be some cooperation in determining what stays and what goes.  The unofficial rules for acceptable posts is similar among these subreddits.  Users either recognize the bias and unsubscribe, or they choose to stay and take part in the circlejerk.  They are self-regulating systems that discourage institutional analysis that&#39;s deeper than superficial issues.  r/conspiracy is the exception in that it is on the other end of the spectrum of institutional analysis.  I feel it largely, not entirely, functions as a system for users who abandon rational analysis due to their contempt for the power systems that rule their lives.  I think I&#39;m just disenchented with all forms of mass media, but that&#39;s a different discussion.  Thanks so much for indulging my curiosity.  Just know that you&#39;re not off the hook just yet. ;)</p>
