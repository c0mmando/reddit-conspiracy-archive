       I have been monitoring the situation in Brazil closely, and what is happening there surprises my ever apathetic position that the masses will forever remain ignorant and easily manipulated. What is happening in Brazil right now is not simply a protest to ask for better services and end corruption. What is happening is the complete collapse of the current system, the complete collapse of the ability of mainstream media and government to shape the minds and behaviors of the common man. There were numerous instance that this has been shown to them, LIVE. The tools available at their disposal are proving to be simply ineffective, and the population is displaying that by incredible, spontaneous and creative means which I never though I would witness. It is a general mock of the establishment, ALL political parties, the mainstream media and the "democratic institutions".
      </p>
      <p>
       The President of the country made a discourse addressing the issues of the protesters in television.
       <strong>
        Look at the reaction of the public, at their own homes:
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZoZ6al0U8w">
         http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZoZ6al0U8w
        </a>
       </strong>
       , just after the discourse. It is a magnificent sight, the people have truly awakened, they are no longer believing on the bullshit and crap that has been fed to them, and are quick to point out the fakery on the political discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this is an inevitable end to all nations with access of the internet and a "democracy": the social media (such as reddit) is tearing apart the veil, and once confidence is lost, it can be no longer be restored. I think people should notice these events closely, it already has began to spread in South America (Paraguay began to do manifestations), and will sure knock on the doors of USA. We are already seeing it manifest in reddit, there was already distrust toward corporation, oil related issues, and now, the core of the government itself, where most of the posts who try to defend its institutions tend to be downvoted even at main subs.

       What we need to do, before this happens... is secure a means, like the Brazilians have, of televising it for the american public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn how to operate and keep the internet afloat, we may have to seize communications centers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Become innovative - The protesters were putting tear gas canisters inside of water cooler jugs and sealing them, learn how to make gas masks (even if you have to use the world war one method -eww) ext
      </p>
      <p>
       STOP giving any credit to mainstream news, If we take a news center for ourselves I'm sure we'd be able to tell that that news broadcaster was one of us or not
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be afraid to attack the riot police, we will end up drastically outnumbering them, WE WILL rule the streets. If they don't realize they need to stand down and stand down quick they
       <em>
        ARE
       </em>
       your enemy.
       <strong>
        <em>
         DO NOT ATTACK COPS THAT SURRENDER OR IT WILL STOP THEM FROM SURRENDERING.
        </em>
       </strong>
       They are on your side IF they stand down! I'm not saying kill or beat them to a pulp, just subdue and cuff them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start peacefully but escalate ONLY if necessary, no need to instigate bloodshed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and locate your nearest national guard armory and/or military base. I highly doubt that the US armed forces are going to want to willingly gun down already pissed off citizens. Take what you need and GTFO
      </p>
      <p>
       Go buy a mask IMMEDIATELY
      </p>
      <p>
       Buy any supplies you may need now, I'm not talking about food. I'm talking about riot gear, gas masks, collapsible/shock batons, shit you won't find in a brick and mortar store.

       Soap Box is viable on a community level. COINTELPRO is stong, but it has no community legitimacy. The national and regional dialogues are compromised by the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ballot Box is rigged. See videos regarding the hacking of electonic machines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jury Box is a death sentence. Look no further than the treatment of Manning, Assange, and Snowden.

       You can fill balloons with paint using an old mustard bottle. ALWAYS use bright happy neon colors. This will help to blind and mark riot cops clearly. Don't carry a cell phone. DO carry a camera.

       an effective way to treat the effects of tear gas is to create a mix in a spray bottle made up of 50% water and 50% malox (sp?)  antacid.. apply to eyes, nose, mouth. i think this infos been spread but it doesnt hurt to keep it circulating.

       This always bothers me when reddit blindly supports a protest movement just for the sake of supporting a protest movement...if indeed the people are "waking up" to the inherent injustices of our current global-economic system at large...and I truly hope they are...then when the "awaking" is complete and the old system is torn down...then what?  For instance, if the American public were to rush the gates at D.C. and we fought through the tear gas, batons, and water cannon, and after months maybe years of struggle we can finally wave our flag atop the steps of the capital building...then what?  Do we sort of all look around and awkwardly realize we haven't really thought about what comes next?  In that case, I see a situation where people try to go on with life with out government or global corporate control...fair enough, and fine enough for me, my only problem being that anarchy was the original global form of human organization, which seems to have inevitably led to our current situation...Make no mistake, I'm not arguing for or against anything. I'm only asking the most logical question I can think of at the moment...what comes after the revolution?

       I believe that the founding fathers of the USA thought of this too.  They intended for the US people to rise up against their government when it became tyrannical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just follow the Constitution.  Remember the evils of private central banking, remember the lessons of your own history and the history of others up until this point and move forward.
      </p>

       Eventually things will flourish and again become corrupt.  As long as the core documents are held above all, it is the perfect blueprint or template for making and remaking government.

       People are not against the democracy, they are against the
       <em>
        farce
       </em>
       . I believe it will not be a sudden, violent revolution deposing all the institutions and starting from ground zero. I simply believe that there will be political momentum to address issues such as "money wins election", excessive corporate control over "democracy" and and lack of transparency among all public institutions and their contractors.
