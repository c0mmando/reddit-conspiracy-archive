       I really don't know what to say. Turkey and Assad have both caught the rebels with chemical weapons and the UN has even declared that the rebels have, most undoubtedly, used chemical weapons. In spite of this, this article claims that Assad has used chemical weapons on multiple occasions and flat out says that there is no evidence that the rebels have used, or have even been caught with chemical weapons. It has come to this. Here is the Obama administration's new tactic, ignore the fact that our proxy army broke international law, wait a couple weeks and then rewrite recent history.

       This will be the end, as Russia has no intention of backing down. This will be the start of WWIII, this will be the war to end all wars... if it is allowed to happen.

       I think there's a multitude of reasons, not just the four or five major scandals that Obama is currently engrossed in. One of the main reasons is Israel. The US and their little,  Zionist slave master really fucked up by attacking Syria. This 'civil war' was supposed to be over in a year to two years, tops but it has dragged on long enough that Assad has gained the upper hand, destroyed the rebels supply routes, acquired more recruits and weapons from Russia and has been able to establish and impregnable anti air system. This rules out the option of an actual no fly zone, as it was reported that Assad took out multiple Israeli aircraft when they attacked Damascus. Since then, Israel has sat the fuck down and minded their manners.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has been left with only two options, continue supporting rebels, in hopes they somehow win, or intervene directly, in spite of inevitable war with Russia. Since Assad and Hezbollah have the military capabilities to strike Israel, after the war, and probably will, they only have one option, get the US involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there are all the other, obvious reasons such as gun control, American economic woes and Obamas many scandals but I believe these are the main reasons.

       We already know where they got them. Documents were leaked sometime last year outing a military contractor called 'Britam' that planned on committing a false flag to draw the US into Syria.

       A military contractor called Britam more than likely provided the sarin gas to the rebels. There is no evidence that Assad has chemical weapons. The idea that he might have them is based off the idea that 'Saddam hid his chemical weapons in Syria before the Iraq war'. There is no evidence for this as it was already known, even before the Iraq war, that Saddam almost definitely did not have chemical weapons.
