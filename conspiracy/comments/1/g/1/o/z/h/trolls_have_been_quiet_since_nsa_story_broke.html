    <div class="md"><p>I am 48 and must sadly, agree with you. This &quot;numb&quot; is happening in Canada too. I wrote this comment yesterday ...</p>

<p>This is the best time to be capable of free thought.</p>

<p>For me, it is also a sad, lonely, dark time to purge the spent aspects of one&#39;s life. Extended family, business associates and acquaintances who are &quot;friends of the brown shirts&quot; are not helping the cause. Think about all of the stale, old ideas we cling to, based on religion, propaganda and tradition (some of statism&#39;s most powerful tools) and you will see the amazing opportunity to illustrate personal integrity for our children to model.</p>

<p>The time is over due to stand up and speak the truth in our social circles and communities. Since 9/ 11, I have discovered a personal truth. Anything you fear losing is already gone.</p>

<p>It may be that this is their way of saying &quot;imagine what the Stasi could have done, had they <em>actually</em> had a complete record of everybody&#39;s life -- let it sink in that we do -- then think very carefully about what you will do about it&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard that one too many times since 2009.  Apparently, presidents&#39; only job is to take credit for stuff they didn&#39;t do and to speak at graduation ceremonies and stuff.</p>

<p>Which kinda leads to the question of who is responsible for our regulatory agencies and military and such, but according to the shills, whoever it may be, the people responsible are the actual people responsible.  Nothing to see here, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>public information on the Zazi case shows that he actually caught investigators&#39; attention because of an email flagged via good police work--not good NSA programs. According to these records, &quot;the path to [Zazi&#39;s] capture began in April 2009&quot; when British police found emails between various accounts and an Al Qaeda affiliate on computer they had seized.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with Prism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, did you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When The Washington Post carried Senator Dianne Feinstein&#39;s (D-CA) claim that NSA surveillance programs had successfully thwarted a terror attack by Najibullah Zazi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m quoting a senator, you&#39;re quoting a journalists buddy.  But let&#39;s take it a step further.   At the time of the arrest, o you think it more likely that they credit a top secret program who&#39;s known existence would spark the shit storm we&#39;re seeing now?  Or do you think they would pass the credit off to local detectives?  Don&#39;t answer that because you&#39;re an idiot and I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re answer is.  The only reason I am replying is to further marginalize you.  </p>

<p>That being said, you aren&#39;t here to learn. You aren&#39;t here to pass on knowledge.  Which means that you are only here to troll people so that you can garner some small amount of attention in order to feel good about yourself for a moment.  That is sad.  I wouldn&#39;t give a thimble full of worm piss to know the details of your life, but I feel confident in saying that you could benefit greatly from an eharmony profile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please: tell me more about me and my reasons for being here. You&#39;re adorable. </p>

<p>I&#39;m overjoyed that you will be ignoring me from now on. Perhaps now a true discussion can be had without resorting to infantile schoolyard name calling from over-opinionated nutters like yourself that refuse to entertain the notion that they may, in fact, not know everything there is to know.</p>

<p>Now for the rest of us who are interested in discussing the issue...</p>

<p>I think part of why there were no convictions based off of PRISM data would be because it was a classified program, and since court proceedings are public record, they would have to admit in public that they were using this classified source to find convictions. </p>

<p>As such, if PRISM is/was being used in Law Enforcement, it&#39;s purely as &quot;deep background&quot; basically raising flags on people to investigate using traditional means that can be substantiated in a court of law. </p>

<p>That probably doesn&#39;t change immediately, since having information revealed doesn&#39;t immediately convert a classified program to an &quot;open&quot; one. They will still almost certainly try to maintain what secrecy there is around it.</p>

<p>The truth is we will never know for sure. Now that the information about PRISM is out there in the public, Im guessing that everything will change in how it all works.</p>

<p>It may be that this is their way of saying &quot;imagine what the Stasi could have done, had they <em>actually</em> had a complete record of everybody&#39;s life -- let it sink in that we do -- then think very carefully about what you will do about it&quot;. </p>
