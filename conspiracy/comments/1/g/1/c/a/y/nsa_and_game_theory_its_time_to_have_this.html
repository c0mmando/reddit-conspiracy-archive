        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m choosing this subreddit because an unbiased and accurate historical look back will show conspiracies have shaped the modern world. </p>

<p><em>Game theory uses maths to study strategy. Game theory studies more than just board games, sports, and games of luck. It also studies things like business and military decisions. In game theory, people call all of these situations &quot;games.&quot; In other words, you can use game theory to study any situation where more than one person makes choices.</em> </p>

<p>But more than that, game theory is a philosophy. It shapes our society as a fundamental part of mankind. Here&#39;s an example.</p>

<p>Starting out, as a utopian race one might suggest that we&#39;re all truthful and kind to each-other. So lets get a thought experiment going where there&#39;s a confined village or town and there are communal resources. There are apple trees, fertile soil, a river, a mine, a forest and fields of cattle. </p>

<p>One outcome is the humans are let into the village and people enjoy the land and the spoils of the resources. At some point the village evolve and those who work best with wood go to the forest and provide wood for others, those who can work with meat and cattle become the delegated butchers and farmers. Miners will mine and jeweller will polish and the village starts working like a machine with gears and kogs where everyone is working complimentary together. </p>

<p>Though, a second stage of evolution will come. Game Theory. Where the butcher notes that the Jeweller has a very big house and lives right by the side of the river. And he see&#39;s that the baker gives more goods to the woodsmen and carpenters than to him because he needs wood more than meat.</p>

<p>It&#39;s around the stage that the human who, through evolution is vigilant about having enough - stuff. About being able to collate or own the best he can in the environment he&#39;s in. It&#39;s why we pick up money on the floor, we don&#39;t even consider it, we automatically pick it up. <em>It MUST be a good idea to pick this up, there&#39;s no harm in owning more than I did a few seconds ago</em>.</p>

<p>When we look at the system we&#39;re in as the butcher looks at the village he&#39;s in. He may pass judgement and say there&#39;s inequality in this village. All of the stuff is not spread evenly and that people living on the river that are good friends with the carpenters have nice big mills and houses with wash rooms. </p>

<p>The butcher can then put in place a scheming plan to win over a nice big house by the river. One day he passes the woodsman and says &quot;Good morning&quot; he then tricks the him and says he knows of his affair with the blacksmiths wife and will tell everyone unless the carpenter builds him a nice big house near the river. The carpenter afraid to be exposed and shamed complies. </p>

<p>To prevent a TL:DR... before long the butcher&#39;s got a huge big house with Jewels and ornaments and a lovely wife a fat stomach and a good name. He has a way of finding information on people and manipulates others with that information to get what he wants. But he did it all only because he wanted things to be fair right?. He just wanted a big house like the Jeweller did. </p>

<p>However, now he looks at others and he says, <em>&quot;well I know there are people that still live in small houses but I worked hard for my house and I had the vision and ethic to achieve it. Why should I distribute my wealth to others who didn&#39;t manage to improve their position.&quot;</em> It may even strike the butchers mind that he is better than then - or that he is more ambitious than them and some men do not want much.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>The NSA</h3>

<p>Game Theory is heavily linked with information. Someone like the butcher would succeed in their plan <em>a lot</em> easier if they had spies and access to all information.</p>

<p>In the cold war we saw a great example of Game Theory behind Russia and USA. Spies, reports and the possibility of a nuclear attach made each country paranoid. Using Game Theory the USA would hold strategic points in the world near Russia <em>just in case they needed to attack Russia in an emergency</em>. This pre-emptive move was strategically defensive but Russia don&#39;t know that and <strong>had</strong> to assume is was an offensive move so reacted to it as it was. Their move to cuba was more or less the same.</p>

<p>The NSA, spying on the world and their citizens give them a HUGE advantage in any implication of Game Theory. With information they can manipulate other countries to do as they bid. They can manipulate their population to keep them in power and able to continue. </p>

<p>Now the NSA <strong>could</strong> very well be a benevolent natured organisation that every day make <em>for the greater good</em> decisions. But we as humans sharing this world with them have no option than to take their word. And the problem itself isn&#39;t the NSA. The problem is Game Theory and how we tackle the problematic implications.</p>

<p>What can the NSA do now? I agree something should be done, but what? There&#39;s <em>definitely</em> ZERO chance they will stop, <em>&quot;If we stop, how will we know that China have stopped, and if we stop and they don&#39;t they will have an advantage over us and we will be at risk&quot;</em>. </p>

<p>Why should a king get off his throne and declare that being a King is an unfair thing to be and we should all be equal, when someone (especially an enemy) can take the empty throne the moment he resigns? </p>

<p>Last paragraph now, by no illusion, we are alive today as we survived evolution where you need to adapt to survive. Our entire make up and being is here now at the expense of a billion failed systems. Take island &#39;Ghalelle&#39; for example, when civilizations started forming armies, ghalelle reluctantly followed suite and had a reserve army in case of any issues. But when other countries started flying and sailing creating navy fleets and air-forces Game Theory said that Ghalelle needed too. The king of ghalelle didn&#39;t want to invade or attack anyone and he certainly didn&#39;t like the proposed budgets to create a navy or airforce. So he put his foot down and decline. Ghalelle got invaded shortly after and the new owners used the natives as slaves.</p>

<p>Game Theory is an intrinsic problem with our society and humanity and is the core issue of an abundance of problems including the NSA and Global Market (apply game theory to the market where companies need to patent technology they don&#39;t even plan to use yet because of competition, they need to double their marketing budgets each year and they need to head-hunt talent constantly and <strong>generally undertaken unethical business practise JUST to survive and keep their position</strong>). By all means rebel against this privacy monstrosity, but do not forget the bigger issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it essentially boils down to one problem: information can&#39;t be transmitted fast enough and with enough context for multiple parties to make a decision from the same frame of reference. Your entire post really hit the nail on the head, and in my opinion is probably the motivation for everything they do. </p>

<p>If you look back on the history of the Rockefellers, the Warburgs, the CIA, the NSA, and the groups involved in this plan we see movi forward today, it is nowhere near as solid and unified and most make it seem. </p>

<p>The Rockefellers and their ventures into eugenics, honestly, were very possibly horrible things done with the best intentions.</p>

<p>Both Paul and Max Warburg sat on the board of IG Farben. Paul also designed the Federal Reserve system. Paul died before World War II, a dispute over Zionism or the Nazi party? note the Fed was used to pressure America into the war.</p>

<p>The CIA is such a fragmented group doing so many things at once multiple agendas can be seen at work through numerous actions. Unless the entire Internet was a trap from day one, many branch offs into the tech sector show much more altruistic long term goals than what birthed them. Some see Google at Bildeburg recently as a confirmation of it being an NSA/CIA tool, I see it as possible serious headway made in using their leverage as such an intel gathering giant. </p>

<p>You see all the string pulling and misdirection used on us, the masses, to pull and pluck strings to get us to do this and that, and a growing minority are aware of this. Isn&#39;t it a very real possibility there are other layers of puppets and strings we don&#39;t see, so concerned we are with tracing our own strings? I would hope if that were true, it would be to an end. In that circumstance to me, that end would seem to be an attempt at solving this fundamental problem you highlighted.</p>

<p>EDIT: there has to be a specific form of dyslexia that involves being visually blind to misused homophones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a little bit flawed to assume that it necessarily has to be a series of explicit decisions in a hierarchical organization. </p>

<p>I believe a nefarious culture/religion with a positive feedback mechanism combined with an enabling monetary system could create a self-organized system such that perfect organization and explicit commands are not needed to move things forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sayin that couldn&#39;t happen, but there is more than enough evidence to show organization of intelligent nature in my mind. But either way the natural outcome of both systems after gaining total control is internal disintegration wrestling for control over power.</p>
