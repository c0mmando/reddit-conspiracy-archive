       From everything that's been going on recently, I took a step back for a moment, and realized, it's only been 6 months since Obama was re-elected. It seems that after he was assured of his next term, they decided to push their agenda much harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Already we've had the Benghazzi Scandal, SOPA, IRS, (insert other stuff here) and now this (Although I realize PRISM started way before Obama).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless this begs me to ask the question, if he's already done this, how do you think the next 3 1/2 years are going to play out?

       They now control the financial system, most of the mega-corps in the US (oil, cars, and now tech), and are now working on conditioning the public to accept that the government has every right to be Big Brother and spy on them at every turn.

      <p>
       <em>
        Hey if you aren't doing anything wrong, why do you care if we are watching you?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The next stage is to fully implode the system. Blow up the stock market, destroy the pensions, sky rocket unemployment, hyper-inflation perhaps, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the cherry on top of all that will be some massive event comparable to or larger than 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       At which point people will be begging the government to take over everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I laugh when people say that they will fail in the end... they know exactly what they are doing and it's going perfectly according to plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only hiccups are when people leak info... but the leaked info is never enough to wake the population up.

       It seems to me that the plan is to have full dictatorial control on or before the time Obama leaves office.

       Sometimes I feel like it doesn't matter where I go on this planet because at some point every country will slowly follow suit in some form or another. No matter how diplomatic other countries may appear now, I feel that this is only the beginning. I have never felt so uncomfortable on my own planet before, and it saddens me that it has come to this. Nothing but greed and power is what drives people these days, and it's only going to get worse. What will happen when money or power just isn't enough anymore? I'm starting to wonder if the people who "think" they have control over us are actually being controlled by someone else, and so on. Who really knows who has control anymore, and what is it going to cost us to find out...
