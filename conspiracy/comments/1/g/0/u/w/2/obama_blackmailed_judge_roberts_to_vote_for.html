<p>Some of you might recall him <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/toobin-chief-justice-roberts-was-red-eyed-and-unhappy-when-he-read-the-obamacare-ruling-2012-6">looking rather stressed</a> the morning the decision was passed down, and the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/07/01/the-supreme-courts-john-roberts-changed-his-obamacare-vote-in-may/">awkward opinion</a> that appeared to have been changed and written at the last minute.</p>

<p>Apparently the leaking of this story has been given <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rLZDRB7QADQ">official go-ahead</a> as Glenn Beck is already talking about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well Obama is a Chicago politician and in order to succeed in Chicago you must be well versed on discrediting your opponents and adversaries or using their weakness to your own personal gain... how do you think he got the Illinois senate seat in the first place? He got all the other democrats kicked off the primary and won by revealing what his campaign made out to be &quot;deviant&quot; sexual practices of his GOP opponent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well aware of the shady dealings that went on in his Illinois elections.  It is interesting that he never won a clean election.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tarpley.net">Tarpley</a>, a guy that is usually insightful, claims that Romney was the establishment&#39;s choice for 2012, but I find that quite bizarre and weakly supported.  Why run the only man in America who can&#39;t beat Obama, if you want Obama out?  It&#39;s quite difficult to find anyone besides Romney who is both for and against so many issues.</p>

<p>Could the attendance of someone like Rick Perry at Bilderberg prior to Romney and eventual selection of Romney indicate a severe lack of triple digit IQ citizens still willing to work for them?  The best they can find that isn&#39;t mentally retarded (ie Perry) is a pariah (Romney)?  Is the pool of available talent finally drying up for them?  Consistent with what we see in Syria, where Assad and Putin have beaten back an attempted regime change and the CIA terrorist squads suffered a devastating blow.</p>

<p>These guys are no doubt acutely aware of Obama&#39;s electoral shortcomings.  McCain was unpopular, though not quite the laughing stock that Romeny is, and still they had to crash the market and try to make a fool of him in the press for the few weeks immediately prior to the election if you recall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it doesn&#39;t seem like it seeing as how you give no credence to Roberts opinion and just refer to other&#39;s unqualified assessments of it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean unqualified in that they don&#39;t provide credentials or proof of expertise, but that they don&#39;t provide the actual assessments for the suggestion that roberts went against his original intent at the last minute other than the suggestion that his face was red. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; Chief Justice John Roberts’ reasoning was incoherent. The conservative’s dissent read like it was originally meant to be a majority opinion. Now, we know why. According to Jan Crawford of CBS News, John Roberts switched sides in May, withstanding a “one-month campaign” from his conservative colleagues to change his mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Excerpt from the third link I proved in the OP.</p>

<p>You can take expert opinion at face value or read the opinions yourself.  Either way you will arrive at the same conclusion that everyone else has.</p>

<p>You seem to have misunderstood me as you think I didn&#39;t read what you just quoted. It is that, in fact, that I&#39;m referring to. That&#39;s not an analysis of his opinion, it&#39;s assigning a bunch of personal feelings to it. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t source his text, nor any legal concepts. So excuse me for not finding &#39;what everyone else has&#39;. So much for maintaining criticality on this subreddit, huh? You are literally telling me to follow the &#39;hive mind&#39; on this one </p>
