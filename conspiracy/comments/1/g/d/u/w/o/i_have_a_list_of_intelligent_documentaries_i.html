          "Carl Sagan Cosmos"
         </strong>
         -  Carl sagan approaches the history of science in a sort of spiritual scientific way that is different from anyone else.  I would say Neil deGrasse Tyson comes close in a similar way.  Also he says how the ancient greeks with pythagorus would worship the dodecahedron, forget where though.

          "Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking and Arthur C. Clarke - God, The Universe and Everything Else (1988)"
         </strong>
         - Haven't watch it all, just found it while looking for a working cosmos link, but looks like a really interesting panel discussion with the people in the title.

         - Reasons why I am against nuclear energy...
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Economic reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       The safer you want your nuclear plants the more expensive they are, and therefore not economically viable. Also new designs are not any safer, but they are more expensive. They claim to be safer, but infact they are just more complicated and prone to disaster. Before you even say thorium, its not any safer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carbon math:
      </p>
      <p>
       They produce a lot of co2 in the mining of uranium and building and dismantling of the plants. So they are incapable of dealing with global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philosophical reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       If something can do good, but can put power in the hands of a few, it will only be used for evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sociological reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       We actually need energy solution that can't be made into a bomb so that africa and the middle east can use it, like solar wind biofuel, etc. If you have a nuclear power program, at any moment you are 1 month away from a nuclear bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Industry is corrupt:
      </p>
      <p>
       They try to say more people have died from solar (falling of their roofs) then nuclear power. But they don't want to admit the 300,000 chernobyl cancer deaths that greenpeace reports.

       Nuclear produces way more CO2 than solar and wind: Lifecycle greenhouse gas emission estimates for electricity generators, according to Benjamin K. Sovacool's comparison
      </p>

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wind -- 9 (g CO2/kWhe)
      </p>
      <p>
       Solar PV -- 32
      </p>
      <p>
       Nuclear -- 66
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural gas -- 443
      </p>
      <p>
       Also realize that the industry says different numbers, but they are probably lies, its hard to get concrete numbers because a lot of the stuff is classified.

       Question: Would you not need to have a completely different technology to be able to use uranium from reactors to enrich it to make bombs, or do you mean a type of "dirty bomb"?
Answer: NO i mean the real deal atomic weapons with nuclear fission. Hiroshima style. Highly enriched uranium is made using an atomic reactor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question: have i seen "
       <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/experts-foresee-no-detectable-health-impact-from-fukushima-radiation/">
        http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/experts-foresee-no-detectable-health-impact-from-fukushima-radiation/
       </a>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer: I have not read that specific article, but of course it is complete nonsense. The only people you can trust on the subject are cancer doctors, everyone else is just noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also i didn't even mention the massive cost of radioactive waste, and that all the US nuclear plants leak tritium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also didn't mention that we are still receiving radioactive fallout from the weapons testing era, when we shot radiation into the stratosphere. Hilariously wine bottled before this time, does not contain new atoms that were created in the atomic bomb blasts, which are now everywhere including in your body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Im very for cold fusion and deep depth geothermal which are technically "nuclear". The energy bank of deep depth geothermal is way more than all of the uranium mines, ironically we would need the oil companies' drilling technology to accomplish this. Also geothermal can be bad for the environment if its not a closed system (don't want to release poisonous gases from within the earth.). Well also solar is also nuclear because the sun produces the energy from nuclear fusion. (Random Side note: all the fusion reactions in the sun are from quantum tunneling, because there is not enough activation energy to make hydrogen into helium)

      <p>
       Comment:I do not agree that power in the hands of a few will only be used for evil though.
      </p>
      <p>
       My response: Well nuclear energy concentrates power in a society, where as solar energy distributes the power to each person. There is inherent properties of energy generation that are not immediately apparent to people.
