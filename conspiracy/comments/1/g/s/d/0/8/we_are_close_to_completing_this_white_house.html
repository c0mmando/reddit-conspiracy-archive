<p>Yes.  Some do indeed.  That is not the most pertinent question, however.  The most pertinent question is &quot;SHOULD people really expect this petition to do anything?&quot; or, just as pertinent &quot;Will signing this petition actually do anything to help Edward Snowden?&quot;</p>

<p>and the answer to that is a resounding NO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a state wants to secede, the correct path is not through a &quot;We the People&quot; petition, but through action within the population of the state and with the state government.</p>

<p>Texas <strong>did</strong> succeed in telling the world they wanted to secede. But that&#39;s all that particular action accomplished.</p>

<p>If you want to secede, secede. Follow the proper process to vote yourselves out of the union. I&#39;m not from Texas, but I would support it wholeheartedly. Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>slavery was the reason why they wanted to secede, but the war itself was fought mainly to prevent the union from dissolving.  As Lincoln himself said:</p>

<p>&quot;If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.&quot;</p>

<p>hence why I (and others) refer to the war as &quot;the War to Prevent Southern Independence&quot;</p>

<p>Slavery was a MASSIVE economic influence and ethical conundrum. Remember, at the time, most of the world had already abolished slavery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no such thing as winning a war IMO the choice of war is a loosing strategy. IMHO this is a spiritual battle far more than a physical one and thus is a battle of choices. How can you expect me to take you seriously when you claim that choice in the bill of rights is stupidity. The second only acknowledges that use of force is not the sole domain of the government but emanates from and with the people. That in no way means that force of violence should be used but highlights the responsibility of the people to hold the government accountable for such use of force. Ignoring the reality of our current situation in no way absolves us of the responsibility to hold our own govt accountable for abuses on US soil and abroad. And the fear/futility of violence in no way excuses us from the duty of taking the responsibility personally.  It is by our mandate that this entity exists, and by our complacency that it continues down this ever darkening road.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, they think differently than you therefore they are default racists. You should perhaps open yourself to the possibility that your opinions and worldview are not your own but your reaction to a scripted play of sorts. All the world is a stage, do not be merely a player but take up the pen and commence with the re-write.  The pen is far mightier than the sword and the black/white world of given options are not the only ones available to you. Your imagination is the greatest threat to tyranny. There are all kinds of people everywhere, given a better chapter by those bold enough to tear up the script and write their own destiny who know where future chapters will be written.  I for one will not discount the possibility out of hand that those chapters will not come from Houston, or El Paso or San Antonio. </p>

<p>Prejudice is formed in the womb of fixed perception. Unloose the fixed points and let your imagination be free to be open to what might be, not what you presume must be.</p>

<p>They are just laughing at this as joke around the office. The president doesn&#39;t answer to any of the laws. Neither does Congress as apparent Obama has outright violated with criminal acts against USCS, and not called for impeachment.</p>

<p>Snowden has no chance of getting a pardon ever unless a complete removal of the current Presidency and Congress by a more righteous set is not done, and we all know that is not going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they pardon him and not Bradley Manning it would be suspicious.  </p>

<p>I think people might be on to something saying that the NSA leak was strategic since any negative news about the government has to be approved through Washington.  I remember when Connie Chung was fired for saying this over a decade ago.  </p>

<p>1.) People already &quot;knew&quot; that either the NSA or CIA listened to phone calls</p>

<p>2.) Confirming this to the public would make people suppress their talk about the government on the phone and internet due to fear (a way to force nationalism like N. Korea does but not as extreme)</p>

<p>3.) This makes Obama look bad since he was &quot;caught red handed&quot; spying on people.  Now he has almost no choice but to do something &quot;good&quot; to appease the Right such as going to war with Syria and eventually Iran. He has to be a hero once again and do something equal to killing Bin Laden.   </p>
