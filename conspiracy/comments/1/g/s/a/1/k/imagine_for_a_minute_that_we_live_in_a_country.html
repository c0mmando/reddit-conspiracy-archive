    <div class="md"><p>Very true.  We out-source our decent paying manufacturing jobs on a whim but defend these positions with the TSA and NSA because we are in a recession and don&#39;t want to displace the workers who are &quot;just doing their jobs&quot;.  We came dangerously close to not having a war to fight...so what would we have done with the displaced soldiers?  Then Syria.</p>

<p>I take a harsh position on this topic.  I have zero sympathy for people who could do this work anyway.  I could never spy on people, I couldn&#39;t detain and pat down children at airports.  The people who do these things to their fellow Americans are not decent people to begin with and I dislike them for what they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you kill a pedophile, they have to live somewhere.</p>

<p>Do you think these agents belong in prison? Or is simply stopping doing these jobs sufficient?</p>

<p>Do you think that none of these people will fight against the system getting shut down if they&#39;re faced with being hungry? It doesn&#39;t matter if you sympathize or not, if they have nowhere else to go, they&#39;re going to fight tooth and nail to keep their jobs. And there&#39;s a lot of these people who would be fighting. People who have access to sensitive information, if just the idea of that many people getting upset all at once doesn&#39;t deter people from canceling the program wholesale.</p>

<p>Who said anything about sympathy. Is your solution to tell them to starve and have them happily quit their high-paying jobs? How effective do you think that is?</p>

<p>Unless you think these people should be dead or in prison, we&#39;re going to have to figure out a solution to such a massive displacement of workers if you don&#39;t want the program around anymore.</p>

<p>What about all the people who never worked for the NSA that are going hungry? Do you have any sympathy for them? How would you suggest these people get the means they need to survive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are asking in all honesty, I will try and answer these questions.  I don&#39;t think that agents should go to prison, as they have broken no laws.  But that doesn&#39;t make what they choose to do moral and doesn&#39;t make them exempt from making the immoral decision to go to work week after week.  The only punishment I feel these people deserve is the crumbing of their financial stability as they have crumbled our civil rights.  I would not be opposed to allocating a portion of the freed up budget to adapt their training to a more reputable and less intrusive occupation.  TSA for example could become private security for airports, why should we, as taxpayers, supplement the airline industries security?  Especially considering the indignities we suffer as a result.  The DEA could be assimilated into local law enforcement, which are small and underfunded as is...but make no mistake I feel that law enforcement as a whole needs to be redesigned and demilitarized.  I want to see the return of public servants with badges instead of paramilitary with violent tendencies.  The NSA would be hardest to relocate.  But at the same time these employees have computer science backgrounds and experience so I think they would do fine.</p>

<p>But all in all I would have no sympathy for these people if they lost their jobs and experienced hard times.  I would feel no sympathy if a foreign spy or threat, and make no mistake these agencies are a threat to the citizens of the U.S., were to experience financial hardship...so why would I feel for any U.S. citizen who would do these atrocious things to their own people??</p>

<p>As for hungry people in general, which is entirely off topic as they have done no harm to their fellow citizens, if focus was taken away from ridiculous military and security budgets...maybe we could house and feed them.  Or equip them to be able to provide for themselves.  We send weapons to heart eating mad men in the middle east to destabilize the region for elite private interests, but can&#39;t provide education to the masses?  I&#39;m not even talking about the failed college system...but a basic training for some kind of skills to enter a troubled workforce.  Trade skills, short duration tech schools, or even apprenticeship programs.</p>

<p>These are large problems created by government run amuck and would require vast system overhauls...even at the cost of the comfort of the people involved in the current system.  I do feel that the sooner we eat the shit sandwich and move on, the sooner we can get back to building a stable, just, and prosperous society.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think we could get a bill through congress either disbanding the NSA and firing those working there, or reassigning the NSA workers to do something positive instead of objectionable? If we hire them, we don&#39;t have to go through congress. But we&#39;d have to have enough money and incentive for them to quit the NSA en mass, or some means of ensuring that quitting their job doesn&#39;t mean starving. Maybe tech firms could recruit to have them secure data on their servers. They&#39;re good at that, right? Or... hell, I dunno. I&#39;m sure we could find something they&#39;re good at for them to do.</p>

<p>Or do you think protesting or similar would help them reconsider their choice of employment, and they would leave on their own?</p>

<p>What would be your strategy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great question.  What do we do with all of these control freaks who have been subverting the constitution of their own country?</p>

<p>In my opinion they should all be jailed.  Also, In my opinion people who buy or sell illegal drugs should be freed.  Doesn&#39;t matter what my opinion is.  Doesn&#39;t matter what your opinion is.</p>

<p>They (the government) are the criminals.  They use their power to oppress and exploit the population to their advantage.  That&#39;s how power works.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dictatorship is a word that&#39;s been thrown around here for a long time.  We often wonder why the policy makers continue to make decisions against our common interest and continue to actively subvert the rule of law in our country, itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious that something&#39;s wrong when your elected officials are not allowed to talk about or even review their own government&#39;s activities.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if our government charged a U.S. senator with espionage in the next year or so. </p>

<p>I think a covert effort to install a totalitarian regime has been largely successful in our country over the last few decades.  They&#39;ve been very clever about it as to not alarm the public.</p>

<p>I still think that our government can rebel against itself before it completely turns against its own people... but I&#39;m not sure it will happen.  </p>

<p>The most likely outcome from our government&#39;s actions will be WWIII, conscription and worldwide economic depression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here.  When a leak becomes this big I&#39;m always a little worried that the spying network goes into overdrive to figure out who&#39;s a political dissident, who&#39;s actually on their side, and who doesn&#39;t give a fuck either way.</p>

<p>So do you remember the wikileaks spy files?  They exposed all kinds of terrible things the DOD was doing to the internet a few years ago.</p>

<p>There was a little outrage, but very little media coverage about that back then... now we&#39;re seeing the same thing happen.</p>

<p>It&#39;s as if the media accepts these new powers our government has seized as the new normal.  They report on them and show a few people criticizing the new power a little... then they move on to the next story.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got our work cut out for us.  I don&#39;t know what to do anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that, but things have gotten a bit worse and more overt actually.  In case anyone in the MSM had any ideas about NOT towing the party line and doing what they&#39;re being commanded to do, you have TPTB blowing up the cars of reporters that get too close to the truth in order to make sure <em>everyone</em> knows their place.</p>

<p>Sure a lot of the sheep are thinking &quot;It was just an unfortunate accident.&quot;, but 1) a lot of the people that have even a mild clue know what that was (i.e. a hit), and 2) they also know what the message TPTB were sending was too.</p>

<p>We do indeed have our work cut out for us.</p>

<p>How do we change the system?</p>

<p>What channels do we use to find people who are in positions to affect things, and have them change them?</p>

<p>Or how do we change things ourselves?</p>

<p>Is there any action you would recommend?</p>

<p>I was pushing people not to get the XBox both for they way they screwed over gamers, and because of their camera/internet connection requirement looked like a privacy nightmare.</p>

<p>I need something concrete I can do to affect change.</p>
