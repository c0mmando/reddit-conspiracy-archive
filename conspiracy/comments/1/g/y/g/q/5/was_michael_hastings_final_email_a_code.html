        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Subject: FBI Investigation, re: NSA
Hey (redacted names) -- the Feds are interviewing my &quot;close friends and associates.&quot; Perhaps if the authorities arrive &quot;BuzzFeed GQ,&quot; er HQ, may be wise to immediately request legal counsel before any conversations or interviews about our news-gathering practices or related journalism issues.</p>

<p>Also: I&#39;m onto a big story, and need to go off the rada[r] for a bit.</p>

<p>All the best, and hope to see you all soon.</p>

<p>Michael&quot;</p>

<p>Given the mysterious and oddly timed death in comparison to what he was working on I believe that not only did Michael Hastings knew he may not have a long time left on this earth. </p>

<p>I am not going to delve into the specifics of his car crash but rather the words of the man himself. 
First, he was a writer and even an email as short as this he would choose his words and mostly his phrasing rather carefully. I&#39;ve seen others posit as to why he would email something like this when he and everyone else knows our emails are being mined. Some one like him specifically were probably being read on a daily basis. He knew that, he also obviously knew that things were heating up for him, so leaving a trail, a lead for others he trusted to follow would make sense, even if it was just a fail safe. </p>

<p>[1.] &quot;Close friends and associates&quot; -</p>

<p>he put this in quotes because in my opinion he quite obviously was referring to his sources many of which are most likely in the government. Those sources could be facing queries that the FBI an no other agency would have to make public. Refer back to the AmA he did a year ago and Michael states that despite what people may think he had a very loyal large amount of resources within the government and military who respected his work.</p>

<p>[2.] &quot;Buzzfeed GQ&quot;, er HQ </p>

<p>Again, this man wouldn&#39;t put something in an email as serious as this as a joke or typo and leave it in, would he? The GQ thing could have a simple explanation that I may just be too dumb to realize right now and I&#39;m sure some one will point it out if it does. However, what does GQ stand for?</p>

<p>[3.] Legal council and news gathering practice and related journalism issues. </p>

<p>This line was NOT referring to Buzzfeed in need of attorneys but most obviously he was talking about himself. This makes sense knowing that he had contacted wiki leaks about representation. News gathering practices to me is again a subtle reference to his sources and possible document leaks. </p>

<p>[4.] &quot; Also: I&#39;m onto a big story, and need to go off the rada[r] for a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>This makes almost no sense to me. To think this Would be the first time and way he is telling his editor that he is working on a story?
No way. Michael laid out his writing process in his AmA specifically saying that he always pitched a story first. 
He wasn&#39;t informing them of a new story, he was rather obviously hinting at a huge break in the one that they knew he was working on &quot;re:NSA&quot;
His line about needing to go off rada[r] is another puzzling bit to me that might have an obvious answer that I don&#39;t see. Why the [r] in brackets? What is the significance of that. </p>

<p>[5.] &quot;All the best, and hope to see you all soon.&quot;</p>

<p>This final line is the most disturbing once you put it all into context, that he was working on a huge story, that the Feds were onto his sources, that he needed legal help, and finally that he was so concerned by all of it that he specifically says he needs to go off the radar. Once you look at it that way &quot;and hope to see you all soon.&quot; Has an lingering eeriness to it. An almost finality and somber thing to say after the seriousness of what he had just briefly said above. </p>

<p>So, I&#39;m sure some of you will say I&#39;m looking far into a simple email, and maybe I am. But context and subtext is huge in this situations. A world renowned writer and journalist chooses what they say very carefully. So please let me know what all of you think and please expand upon this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post saucyrossy07. There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that Michael Hastings was murdered, but his final email may be no more than a hurriedly sent message from a mobile phone, whilst on the move?</p>

<p>This would explain the typos and the clunky wording - people choose words for brevity rather than nuance when texting or sending emails from a mobile.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that this email is a decoy - a hacked message sent from his account after he had already been murdered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks but this email was not at all clunky and had only one typo with nearly perfect grammar. </p>

<p>The man was a journalist. I&#39;ve worked in the media before, journalists and editors ridicule each other for typos and grammar mistakes in even simple things such as emails. </p>

<p>Maybe radar was misspelled but it is my opinion that the entire email when put into proper context was saying far more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you may be right! However it appears to me to be a hurriedly written email, with a couple of prepositions omitted as well as a typo.</p>

<p>The [names-redacted] recipients will know if the email included a coded message, because a protocol will probably have been agreed between them. Let&#39;s hope one of them has the courage to come forward, and that they don&#39;t have a brand new, remote-control, spontaneous-combusting Mercedes, like Hastings.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t agree more that a protocol would have been agreed upon with the recipients in case some thing happened to or if he used specific words or phrases in a message. </p>

<p>My main theory now is that this email was sent and subsequently leaked to the press as a fire bell alarm to his sources that might still be working in an for the government. A very simple sure way to reach all of his sources who were all probably only reachable by Hastings himself. </p>

<p>This may sound dumb...but is there proof, or is simply the fact that he died in a car accident all the proof there is?</p>

<p>I mean, it <em>does</em> seem more than coincidence that he said he was working on something big, and died in a car accident, but really there&#39;s no &quot;proof&quot; that I&#39;ve read?</p>

<p>You&#39;re calling it an &quot;accident&quot; but you have no proof that is what it was, do you? </p>

<p>If a journalist or whistleblower who has made powerful enemies (in the process of revealing important information to the public) dies a violent, unexplained death, we owe it to them to investigate what happened. </p>

<p>Because if it was murder, the perpetrators weren&#39;t just silencing Hastings, they were sending out a warning to other journalists who might be thinking about telling the truth about their activities. </p>

<p>If the action movie-inspired fireball that engulfed Hastings&#39;s Mercedes looked real to you, perhaps you should consider that it took place virtually in Hollywood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buzzfeed is mostly banal, sugary crap, the equivalent of the &quot;junkfood&quot; of news media. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all if they have employees paid by the government to spy or direct or whatever....</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget, NBC had a whisteblower who exposed MSNBC for taking bribes from the government to push certain agendas, run certain stories, and quash others</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m not bashing or dismissing <em>all</em> of Buzzfeed. Certainly, they had some quality and investigative reporters, like Hastings, with journalistic integrity.</p>

<p>And if so, then perhaps he got some specialized training at the Academy that would allow him to stage his own death and make it look believable.</p>

<p>HE&#39;S A SHILL! HIS DEATH IS A FALSE FLAG!! He&#39;s still alive and hiding in the home of one of the Jewish neighbors that secretly took him in. Notice that there was a guy in a yarmulke hosing down the burning car? How is that possible???</p>

A world renowned journalist who was extremely smart and knew things that none of us probably never will who said on video that the context of his communications was one of the ways he kept things closer to the chest perse, does not send an email, to his close friend and editor as well as bcc a friend that was in the military, with such serious subject matter the same way you and I would. He would know that his editor would be able to understand the underlying points he was making. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure it&#39;s conjecture but I&#39;ve given examples all through out on how he thought about the surveillance his was probably under and he even specifically talks about the context of messages in this video. 
<a href="http://youtu.be/Y1z5_c6JSH8">http://youtu.be/Y1z5_c6JSH8</a></p>

<p>It is by no means a huge stretch to think that an investigative journalist who was working on a huge story who had suspicion he was being monitored would put subtle clues in the last email he sent to his editor. </p>

<p>He talks about in the video how the people doing the monitoring are not that smart. </p>

<p>If this email is real, and unless buzzfeed is too scared too, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised that within a week they post a HUGE story about his death and what he was working on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, so I went on a binge of information and I&#39;m not so sure any of it actually pertains to this email or this case, so bare with me. The first thing I did was look and the &quot;close friends and associates&quot; and thought, well if you just take the first letters you get the CFAA. Unless I&#39;m incorrect Aaron Schwartz was subject to these insane laws on computer hacking. </p>

<p>My next thought was that maybe he&#39;s telling this person via email who leaked his sources and/or who betrayed him? See this ones a stretch, but GQ was the original place he tried to get his article &quot;The Runaway General&quot; published(source1). They turned him down and put Miranda Kerr, a model, on the cover instead. It&#39;s not impossible that he gave names of potential or wanted sources to indicate what he was looking for in a story. But once again, that&#39;s a stretch. </p>

<p>So now when I look at Radat, I think to myself that he obviously meant to spell radar, but on the last letter failed to get it right. What if he meant for you to pay attention to the right part and not the error. So I googled Rada and found an israeli company called Rada Electronics Industries(source2). What I found interesting about this company was that Boeing, you know, the planes, demanded that the acting CEO stand down and be replaced by a very... accomplished? general of the Israeli air force in 1998(source 3). He took over the american subsidiary IMC, these companies work in radar work for unmanned flight as well as other micro systems that track and balance aircraft controls. In 2007 the company was bought by ITT Corporation and absorbed because of their strong abilities in the field. ITT would later break up into 3 branches, the one of interest to me was Exelis(switch 2 letters and you get exiles ;). Its a company that works for the government for all it&#39;s wartime and military needs(source4). Just recently they were given a nod for their global satellite communication system and it&#39;s army electrical jammer equipment. So an Israeli company specializing in military operations is absorbed and used as one of our major military companies. They create a worldwide communication system and are recognized for it in the same airtime as Snowden. It would make for a great story, would it not? Especially since Israel just got a brand new fighter jet courtesy of the american taxpayers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also strange that the car he was driving had ESP breaks, which slow you down and control engine emissions if you suddenly deviate from your normal driving patterns. Warnings, bells and whistles would have made Michael very aware of how dangerously he was driving. When he impacted the tree he would have been surrounded by 12 airbags and immediately contacted by the dealership, or at least the dealership would be aware of his sudden crash. (source5) The car literally alerts you to a lane shift. So the car has incredible extrasensory capabilities that, if hacked, would have given full control of said car. It would have cancelled his breaks, his airbags, it could block his cell signal and because it&#39;s WIFI streaming you could hack into it from anywhere. </p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s all pretty flimsy but it came together pretty well, I thought. Without confirmation on the last story he was working on there&#39;s no way to be more than flimsy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is some solid work you&#39;ve done. </p>

<p>The CFAA thing is a great catch. The rest of it is some good spit balling. </p>

<p>This is the way to look at this email, in full context. You have to think of who wrote it, how he wrote it, and why. Then remember the recipients. </p>

<p>I am not specifically saying that every third letter in this email subtracted by 42 equals CIA or what have you. My original intent with this post was to look at the subtext of what he was saying and consider what the man had discussed in the public before it. </p>

<p>The distraction that people are focusing too much on is was he assassinated. 
That&#39;s nearly irrelevant and if he was it surely had three goals. 1. Silence him. 2. Distract people from the story he was working on. 3. Warn others to not follow in his foot steps. </p>

<p>So, lets follow in his foot steps, lets find out what he was working on. That&#39;s what is important.</p>

<p>I am beyond sad that such an amazingly original and truthful mind was taken from our society so soon but let&#39;s make sure that we know what he was working on and do it as a way to honor his memory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few relevant quotes from his AmA </p>

<p>On sources. Which refers back to his associates and friends IMO. 
&quot;There are people in government (military included) who have responded quite positively to my work. And the opposite ended up to be true--I have more sources now than at any other time in my career. I&#39;ve found that if people know you&#39;re trying to get as close to the truth as possible, and the analysis is correct, and what you&#39;re writing is intellectually honest, then they are willing to engage you as a reporter, even if you&#39;re critical of their policies.&quot;</p>

<p>On the surveillance state that he knew we were in a year before Snowden leaked.
&quot;We&#39;re living in a national security state. I would like to see it rolled back. I don&#39;t want the government storing all my communications, and it&#39;s pretty twisted that they are doing so and so few seem to care about it.
 Yes, it&#39;s all very serious, but unfortunately the national security state is bipartisan.&quot;</p>

<p>In summary he talks about how he is very careful with anything he says especially &quot;context&quot; because he knows or has been told he is being monitored. I don&#39;t believe I am grasping for straws when I say that this shows his final email could of been a sort of coded message. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t mean the message was some huge secret in the email. It could of been an SOS. 
Why else would he BCC a friend that was in the military. </p>

If you don&#39;t think that he had key words and phrases worked out with his editors to make sure he could get info across to them without leading others to his sources, you are absolutely naive and beyond reproach my friend. </p>

<p>Michael Hastings isn&#39;t the first journalist to be investigated, followed, and monitored by the government, ask any reporter that was working in the late sixties and seventies if they ever thought the same. </p>

<p>Hell, take five minutes reading J. Edgar Hoovers wiki. </p>

<p>That all related back to the fact that there Is an extremely high chance that this email did have hidden meanings. </p>

<p>What do you think a good fail safe would be to WARN your sources if you have not revealed who they are to anyone else and you fear for your life. The ingenious way for a writer to make sure his sources knew that his death was no accident would be to have his editor release something like this if he died. </p>

<p>Think outside the box and outside of yourself and its quite easy to connect the dots. And NONE of this is wild and crazy theories. It&#39;s a logical hypothesis given the context of who the man was and what he did for a living. </p>

<p>Wha?  Why?  Wouldn&#39;t any of his sources immediately shit their pants when the reports of his death came in, <em>regardless</em> of the true cause of death?  His death accomplishes the message pretty succinctly without any secret codes in emails.</p>
