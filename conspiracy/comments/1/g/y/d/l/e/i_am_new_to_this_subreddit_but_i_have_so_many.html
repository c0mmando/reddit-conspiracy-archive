    <div class="md"><p>Seen a lot of &quot;brave&quot; men put their own lives and the lives of their &quot;friends&quot; in utterly needless danger just because someone with shiny brass told em to. This is no morally different then firing at angry &quot;threatening&quot; civilians. It&#39;s easy for everyone to talk big. I&#39;ve seen that. But very very few can deliver. The military selects yes-men and weeds out the independent thinkers. The result is that the very few people who want to resist won&#39;t be able to make a difference. Hell we&#39;ve already seen it happen at Kent State.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree but that only increases their impulse to follow orders. Imagine: US in chaos, food scarce, money scarcer, riots in the streets, both activists and looters. Common service member has food, stability, family is safe. He&#39;s told to go stop the chaos. From his limited perspective it&#39;s impossible to separate the activists from looters and rioters. The choice is to kill a chaotic angry threatening stranger or sacrifice the security and lively hood of his family. Pretty easy choice at that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, yes, because no one has to fire on fellow citizens it&#39;s of course easy to say fuck you! But I feel as though history defies the idea that it&#39;s impossible. The holocaust would be a good example of successful demonizing of a minority in order to make the very thing you deny possible. Look how the media looks at gun nuts, conspiracy theorists and even foreigners. The amount of disdain is to make you see them as an enemy no? I mean, officers across the country fired on and killed plenty of black people when we felt they were &quot;less than.&quot; You even see how police officers treat peaceful protestors. Are you telling me that military officers would never act with such impulsiveness? Because the terrible pictures that came out from Iraq of those boys torturing prisoners doses me with a heavy amount of doubt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would have to demonize the majority of america, and the Military is a micro-chasm of those demographics. Some people propogate the &quot;brainwashing&quot; that american soldiers and sailors undergo, but all of that &quot;brainwashing&quot; is just making each individual soldier / sailor feel responsible for US Citizens. </p>

<p>As the defining order in the military is to &quot;protect and defend the constitution of these united states&quot;, no, I do not think they would blindly shit on their own ideals just because they were asked to. The military today is vastly different than it was in the 60&#39;s and is largely &quot;instep&quot; with american political trends on both sides of the aisle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Should&#39;ve noted the two family members I was specifically speaking of, one is my uncle who was a career Marine in an air wing unit, he said conversations like that took place mostly during the Clinton administration between he and fellow Marines in his unit.  The other is a cousin in a medevac unit currently serving a second tour in the Stan, then there is one of my good friends who is in the 101st serving his fourth tour overseas, two in Iraq two in Afghanistan, they&#39;ve all talked about it and feel confident that most of the guys they served with would not follow orders to harm fellow Americans, now that&#39;s under the assumption that the administration says &quot;hey these protestors are terrorists, shoot them&quot; it&#39;s easy to say NO, but if lines are blurred and there is chaos there is no telling how people would act, I think DHS would be used to deal with American unrest as opposed to our military. </p>

I think a lot of people who are in the military are disheartened by how the government is out of control, and thats not what they joined for. .</p>

<p>also the fact the the most campaign contributions from the military went to ron paul, I think shows that there&#39;s a lot of patriots in the military.</p>

<p>Snowden gave out proof of wrongdoing against the highest law of the land that was being covered up. You giving out classified material just because it&#39;s classified is likely to end with you in trouble with little support by the public.</p>

You guys should be lining up to demand proof that this joker is active duty <em>anything</em>, let alone someone with TS clearance who&#39;s guarded NORAD, generals, celebrities, and worked with SO.  I&#39;m smelling gorilla warfare here, I only hope he doesn&#39;t come after me with his personal network of spies to make me his OVER 301ST CONFIRMED KILL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just FYI, there are different types of weed.  Some are bred to have a maximum amount of HTC, and those that aren&#39;t.  Those that don&#39;t have the maximum amount of HTC have a natural amounts anti-depressants.  Those that have the maximum HTC don&#39;t have any natural anti-depressants.  So, if you have any friends on the medical anti-depressants (which are highly addictive) you may want to let them know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you are proud of your country and proud of the position you achieved. It must be an honor to reach such a level.</p>

<p>Yet.</p>

<p>Is it fear, cowardice, pride or what that makes people who are meant to be fearless allow such scales of injustice? </p>

<p>How do you ignore the constitution? Does your training make you feel that &quot;the greater good&quot; is more important?</p>

<p>But what makes you not question those in power? Question those orders? Is the hierarchy system so strong that to rebel would be soul destroying?</p>

<p>As honestly I feel snowden has shown more courage without a gun then those who hide behind one. I think you would like to be the same, to be a real hero and not just a neutered guard dog. Trained to kill, even kill its own kind for a few scraps and a hearty pat on the nose. </p>

<p>Neutered in mind and soul, as you have to give up your own perceptions to allow those who know better than you to tell you what to do, when to do it, and never to question.</p>

<p>What the word now is people like you who have served and proved themselves loyal to stand up and say no more.</p>

<p>To regrow the balls you had chopped off to prove you can obey. And come out and say, I have served my country, I would die for my country but what you people are doing isn&#39;t for my country but for your own ends. I will not stand for it anymore.</p>

<p>I am sure there were a lot of awesome and morally strong Gestapo and speznaz soldiers in 1940&#39;s </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they felt that while disagreeing with their superiors there needs to be order. But it&#39;s not the generals that get disgraced after a war. It&#39;s people like you. The heros as long as it goes right. But if you are on the losing end, they throw you to the dogs.</p>

<p>Stand up please. America needs you more in the front leading than it does in the shadows. </p>

<p>Any scathing animosity I have towards those who remain silent is not at the soldiers, but at the soldiers who put orders of those too obese, too cowardly too craven above those of the people. And the soldiers who keep those idiots in power. </p>

<p>If you are a hero, be one. Not with a shiny medal to keep puppies happy, but by admiration of those who can&#39;t do what you do, or unable to as they are being destroyed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had a few friends who, after high school, went into the military.  Every one of them, upon returning, were entirely different people.  They had this undying sense of self-superiority.  Kind of like they were looking down upon you, like they knew something that you didn&#39;t know, or weren&#39;t worthy of knowing.  These were normal people that you&#39;d go drink a beer and bullshit with before, who came out with this &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality.  I knew one guy who was an exception - he became extremely religious, or a preacher or something, but he was a mechanic; he never saw action.</p>

I personally know people who are spec ops and they take the secrecy side of their profession VERY FUCKING SERIOUSLY...honestly dude, you sound like some &quot;conspiracy&quot; regular who wanted attention, and even more honestly, most of the comments in here sound like you all are working together...they&#39;re just blindly taking a completely anonymous stranger on the internet at his word...really people?  Even if you were spec. ops...you would only know specifics that we wouldn&#39;t...yet all of the questions and all of your answers are about generalities.  So if you are spec. ops...what was your specific role?</p>
