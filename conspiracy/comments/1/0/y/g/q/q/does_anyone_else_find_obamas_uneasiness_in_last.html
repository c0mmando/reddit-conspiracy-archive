       They're trying to make it interesting. All polling previous to the debates shows Obama leading Romney by many % points. They can't have that. The "two" party system needs to be propped up by both sides being near even, 8 years of bush, down to the wire, eight years of Obama, down to the wire. Make it seem (and it is) like a constant struggle between the two parties, neck and neck.

       I think they want to make it seem closer to get more people behind the two main parties (to keep people from voting 3rd party). Before it seemed to me like Obama pretty much had it. If they make the race closer between them two, then you'll have more people saying "well I hafta vote for Obama now so Romney won't win" (or the reverse if you're in a red state). Think about it, if Romney lost the debate it may have been the nail in the coffin. They needed to bring him back up to keep the false left-right paradigm balanced enough to keep people interested (in one of the two main candidates). If everybody thought Romney had no chance, they'd probably have the courage to vote third party. They get Romney back in the game and now you have a lot more people voting for Obama not because they like him, but because they're scared shitless of Romney.

       agreed. I have no interest in watching the debates. As I'm sure you would also agree it is nothing but theater.  I hope people wake up soon and realize their sense of "free-choice" when it comes to choosing the next American leader is a sham.

       I heard that he was uneasy on facebook and then just watched the highlights. He's such a good speaker. So good, in fact, that he convinced ME to vote for him last time around. There's no fucking way he fucked up last night's debate.

       Obama was definitely 'off'.  I was thinking he was pulling a Muhammed Ali 'Rope a dope' move and then maybe try to crush him in the next debate.

       He was literally begging for votes at the end during his closing segment.  Thats not how you debate.  Obama

       I'm still betting that Obama is their pick. He's keeping mainstream liberals quiet for the time being. If the MSM tide turns for Romney, I'd bet it's all because of his unconditional support for Israel, and his eagerness to commit Arab genocide.

       Did you notice how Romney and his family stayed on stage longer than Obama as people cheered him on?  Right now, it feels like Romney might be our next president BUT it does not matter because as we all know - presidents don't make the important decisions.

       I thought something similar today. If Romney wins. In the interim of Nov-Jan maybe Obama with the backing of OWS and others says that it was rigged. They are already pumping the issue of voter fraud. Then with the arm of the DHS Obama could just shut shit down with the backing of the left wing of america. Enter authoritarian police state?

       25% of "the republican" half of America will never vote Romney because of the fraud in the republican primaries.

        (After what he did to the Massachusetts delegates, he couldn't carry that state if you put it in a bucket, and that's his home state!)

       I chalk it up to him being unprepared for being openly insulted by Romney in the first segment and for Romney changing his positions now he has to appeal to a wider audience.

       Not really. I think they leave it up to the two finalists because the trolls are both owned to begin with. Just Obama didn't have a teleprompter so he wasn't prepared for the onslaught. He had to think for himself to answer for a change. Romney prepared better.

       It makes me wonder.

      <p>
       It was obvious that RMoney was wired to the gills yesterday; probably on Adderall. Rude, pushy, interrupting...all the signs of amphetamines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama just did a SHIT job. He could have hammered RMoney on SO many things...yeah, he held the high road but RMoney totally outclassed him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember people, RMoney was given HUNDREDS of millions of dollars by Israeli donors in exchange for a war...so he's gonna try his damndest to win this or Uncle Binyamin and Uncle Adelson (the Godfathers) may break his skinny Mormon legs! :-)
