       Dear fellow truth seekers, I think I've figured it out. Of all the years I've spent researching alternative subjects in a quest to get a bead on this whole reality business, I think enough pieces just finally fell into place that explains perfectly so much of the bizarre, and perplexing behavior and events we've been seeing and have been subjected to now for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is highly unlikely that, what with billions of primates all banging on keyboards simultaneously across the planet, that this particular epiphany is entirely and originally mine. However, I will lay it out as it has originally come to me, and I can think of no other place to "throw it out there" then here (In other words, I apologize if you've heard of this all before, or have come up with it in some form or fashion on your own)
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, here is my conspiracy theory that glues it all together:
      </p>
      <p>
       Our dependence has been deliberately engineered and our economy, as we understand it today, is a contrivance, conjured from thin air. The whole entire thing is a sham; a sham that has been deliberately rigged from the start that we have all been forced and conditioned to participate in. And that is the heart of this conspiracy theory: we can't NOT participate in their contrived socio-economic game. Well, we can, it's just very, very difficult to live in this country without playing some small role in the game they've all engineered. The exit doors to independence have all been sealed shut - they've seen to that, and that's what I mean by rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I say Forced Participation, for, if we do not participate in their economy, their contrived game collapses - so they've done everything they can to keep us "on the field," as it were. Of course there are people who are living off the grid, but you need a very special skill-set to live effectively that way, and guess which skills we AREN'T taught in public school?
      </p>
      <p>
       The captains of industry from around the time of the Great Depression needed grubs to manufacture their junk. They needed monkeys smart enough to push the buttons and run the machinery but not smart enough to start asking questions. For the ones smart enough to ask questions, they instituted the standard 40 hour work week to keep us too busy and tired from scrambling around to ask questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Public schooling was instituted to indoctrinate us into a culture that submits to authority and discourages critical and free thinking. History class was notoriously all about memorizing names and dates. By deliberately instilling the notion that history was always very boring to the student, curiosity was retarded, and further study into the subject by the individual on their own time was all but squashed. Mathematics is the same way. They couldn't do anything about the students who just naturally "got it," but they made sure that the material was delivered much in the same way. They deliberately designed mathematics to be so unapproachable, that anyone who didn't "get it," would never return to study the subject further. To those students who got math, maybe the 40 hour work week, families and mortgages would keep them too busy to ask questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, what are the two most dangerous subjects for ANY government's citizens to be effective with? History and mathematics. From history, we learn to spot the mistakes governments have made before, and mathematics helps us to spot when we're being lied to. (You see, governments LIKE making mistakes, as I get into further, and they need to be able to lie in order to make them)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, by controlling the curriculum, they controlled the narrative. For example, Edison was a thief, and a dropout who hated book learning. Tesla gave us the 20th century on a silver platter and studied hard. How else do you explain Edison being lauded as a hero and never even hearing of Tesla in school? That's certainly the narrative
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       They engineered a lot of racial tension as well, because any population that is united is the only real threat to any powers that be. We are deliberately kept fragmented and divided, and the 3 social classes were engineered to protect them from us all wising up to their vile scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people in lower class would be too busy getting shafted and blaming the middle and upper classes to be asking any questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people in middle class would be kept too busy at their salaried jobs and mortgages to be asking any questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people in upper class would be too busy shafting the lower and middle classes, and keeping their money from the government, to be asking questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the way the CoD's want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our exits to independence from the shackles of this game, have effectively been welded shut with a laser-like precision on just the right doors. Look how hard it is to generate your own power. To grow your own food. To stitch your own clothes. To live without a car or a residency. Convenience becomes mandatory in a nation with a 40 hour work week, so we're also in large part discouraged from becoming self-reliant. Who has time for that?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we crafted everything we needed, we wouldn't need to be paying the captains of industry for their junk, that they have all effectively forced us to buy. THIS is why hemp is illegal. Notice there, that I used the word "hemp," not marijuana. If you could grow everything you needed in your back yard, (fiber, fuel, food) you could effectively decouple yourself from their contrived economy. If you could stitch your own clothes with hemp, you wouldn't need to drive your car to the mall and buy clothes that the captains of industry expect you to buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to have residency to do anything. In order to acquire residency, you have to have credit, and in order to get credit, you have to prove that you are able to manage and live in debt. That's because our economy can conjure wealth out of thin air - not for you, but for those who are in charge of it. And if we're all too busy being in one of those economic classes, armed with a hatred of history and mathematics, being pissed off at each other because of the color of our hides, no one will ever stop, and look up to see who's really doing the shafting, and unite under a cause of putting an end to the game that enslaves us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it's generally in every government's best interest to continue existing, it therefore stands to reason that they will manufacture problems to justify their further existence (and funding). That's why nothing ever really changes. There really wasn't a big difference between Bush and Obama. It's still business as usual. Sure, they put up a good facade about an issue here and there, but at the end of the day, nothing changes. The government's job is to create and exacerbate problems, because it is in any government's best interest to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government solved our problems, there would be no further need for government. It's just like any organism that wants to survive, and will do anything it can to continue doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, our problems are here to stay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's the gist of my "Mother of All Conspiracies"...I'm running out of space and I'm sure no one's read this far anyway. If you have read this far, thank you for your time and consideration. I know in my heart of hearts that even if all of this is patently untrue, I am, nonetheless, onto something here. At any rate, I do believe that whether or not I'm right, the veil is indeed beginning to drop..

       Yeah, I agree. When you get high it pulls you away from a comfort zone. I have this "theory" you can say about smoking weed and how certain people are effected by it. 15 years old, smoked weed, tripped out; had existential crisis, insomnia, severe headaches, and severe constantly rushing thoughts. All of this sent me to the my Dr's frequently and I was considered for psychiatric evaluation, most likely schizophrenia. I'm 20 years old now, have slowly gotten over my problem through self guided metitation, reading, studying philosophy, and deep introspective self reflection spiritually. This helped the panic attacks cease. I noticed that certain people do have an anxietal response to marijuana, but I was wondering what it was that actually triggered it. I don't think it's the marijuana itself, a drug's effect is never soley responsible on the drug, it takes a reaction; several variables. I was wondering if smoking weed broke through several spiritual boundaries, ans caused sever anxiety in those who weren't able to cope with the reality yet, because they've ignored it. I'm not saying those who can comfortably smoke weed are "awake," but maybe it's that these people are better at safeguarding the fagility of the humam mind by retaining the illusion of safety.

       True. The expansion of civilization is symbiotic. Education is, for the most part, a positive thing. Math isn't as accessible because higher math is actually quite difficult, and it should be. Do you want someone who doesn't know how to take the area under a curve to be building your bridges or pace makers?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't like the OP's constant use of
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       . Who are they? It's not one secrete organization or cabal controlling the world.  It's lots of people who have power that fight to gain more. Many of them aren't even aware of the evil they do. Some of them are even nice people (watch The Corporation, 2003 -- with the CEO of Shell). But the group think mentality of a corporation or government, plus the separation between leaders and workers, tends to create conditions where people are shit upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the 40 hour work week was fought for by labor unions. Some countries are even down to 37. A lot of startups try to push to 45 hours, but studies have shown extending the work week is often counter productive. Before 40 hours, people would work over 80 hours a week (and in some factories in China, they still do)
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation is a lot more complex than people give it credit for. We need education, everyone should be able to read and write and do math, but we don't need indoctrination. The desire for more wealth leads to taking wealth from others (or convincing them to give it to you willingly). We make stuff that breaks so we can see more of it, instead of making things that last forever so we can move on to new ideas without worrying about having to replace the old ones every five years. There is so much we could do...

       I don't think its about the labor unions, or marriage for gays, or any other thing that occurs in society that seems to be a win despite numerous devastating losses in every other facet of society. I know it may not be a great way to live but you really have to judge people and situations by motive. Having a hidden agenda and doing one thing to achieve a complete other is a perfect tactical move in acquiring any goal. For example. Creating a war on terror allows us to fight a war that has no clear end, and helps justify the means of strengthening our force and morale for doing so. The fight between good and true evil lies in POWERS and PRINCIPALITIES, the people who run the world satisfy the evil in them by being ingenious psychopaths. It's quite very possible there is really only one group of individuals is running the show and you don't need to really look far as to how that's working. Just look at a power structure of any company, club, university, secret society and the most potent of them all "family". Bloodlines are sometimes kept in pristine order and you can see enough about these families if you look deep enough. We do have to be more CRITICAL of our government. 11 states have more people on welfare then they do working, those primary states won obama his selection and says one huge thing. The government is winning at capturing the minds of those who are 100% dependent on them. In a real world where we could actually evolve as a society and as being we would have free energy, no government, and complete independence from the tassels of what we know today. Star trek is a great example, Free unlimited energy was established and food was no longer an issue. Fuel was not. Energy as a whole was not. People were free from the mundane to pursue their dreams. Now if someone was in control of you. Do you think they would let that be invented? Do you think they would let you arm yourself and do you think they would let you grow marijuana to satisfy your majority of medical needs. Do you think they would destroy religion and convince you to stop having kids? To destroy the morals of the natural world. The point is our world could be much more free and we could thrive however thats not what THEY want.

       It's true that "a group of people can produce more overall if each person specializes in what they are good at", but we're not producing more for ourselves, we're merely producing more profits for the people who own us, those who "call the shots". I understand how important communities are for allowing people to specialize, but at the same time they can grow too big (like the global "community" you see today) and we can forget why we would have wanted to form a community in the first place. Basically, I think that the "comparative advantage" has a point of diminishing returns when it grows too large. Yes, we will continue to "produce" more but eventually we lose control over what we're producing and become enslaved by the system we built.

       Couldn't you also argue that a person that lives off-grid is also a slave, but to those circumstances? You have no choice but to go fishing or hunting or growing your own food, or you will DIE. You have no choice but to &lt;insert thing here&gt; or you will DIE. How much time would you have for craftsmanship and/or intellectual pursuits in a situation like that?

       No, because being a "slave" implies that someone else is exploiting the work you are doing and making money (or gaining power) from it. I would be happy to be a "slave" to nature because I owe it everything for my existence. I can't find anything to back it up now, but I've read (and believe) that indigenous people have more leisure time than "civilized" people. Obviously they're all different so I can't make generalizations... but I mean, they obviously had music, and art and stuff... they must have had some time to do it. And then people always say well blah, they had short life expectancies and had to kill their kids when they couldn't feed them and they fought each other and they weren't perfect... yeah obviously, they're people, I don't fall for the "noble savage" thing. I'm not saying we should go back to the stone age, I'm just saying it is possible to live in accordance with the laws of nature.

       Good point. It would be nice if we could combine the two. Being able to chose to live 'free' and at the same time contribute to the greater whole in some way. Either offering services like craftsmanship or teaching to trade for something you desire. Then the people who would be considered rich would be those with actual skills and knowledge.

       You want that to be the measure of true wealth? Then actually believe it. you can certainly do that today. easily in fact. however, if you are too afraid of what others may think, or worried about not being able to get that sweet new gaming console youve already attributed wealth as having a lot of money and a lot of stuff, and you have lost.

       There is a difference between an exploitative system and a sustainable system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument is one-dimensional; Sure, groups do better. This is why we evolved civilization!
      </p>
      <p>
       Civilization is a positive system - its where we derive civil, civics, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       A parasitic system is one that hides within a host and feeds on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our current position is that of a civilization hosting a parasite (greed) and being exploited in dramatic fashion.

       I wanted to post a wall of text similar to this one, except that it was based on science, physics, biology, philosophy and metaphysics, trying to explain the state of humanity, our limitations, the real world, hierarchy of species and meaning of life. Half way through I realized that only Philosophers, Buddhists and New-Agers would find my reasoning NOT crazy. I have some scientific arguments as well, but regardless there is and always will be room for skepticism unless one day we'll wake up with abilities to read each-others minds. If anyone cares to hear the 'mother of all conspiracies', I wouldn't mind explaining it.

        Edit:
       </strong>
       Oh wow. I wrote this quite late. There wasn't anything here so I went to sleep. Woke up to this sea of comments. I'll make a new post on the subject as soon as possible, because it might get discussion going. I would also want to apologize to ninjas333 if this derailed the conversation too far away. I appreciate and respect the views presented here; these thoughts could have very well be my own now and many years ago. I found this all interconnected on many deep levels and decided that I should offer an opportunity to take a look down the rabbit hole as I see it.

       I'm a mod on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       . I was raised on a commune. I am a techie in silicon valley. I am apolitical. I am an objectivist and humanist. I am a member of the Mayan Order. I am a seeker of understanding and through my understanding a seeker of wisdom. All of these are traits, not labels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was lucky - the commune was corrupted after we left and was consumed by drugs and other things. It lost its meaning and its center.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Uneducated humans encroached.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MOST important thing in this life is education. Information is a component of education - education is a process by which a human digests information and builds an emotional/intellectual/spiritual body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food feeds your physical body, and the ingredients in that food are crucial to your physical health.
Information feeds your intellectual body. Poor ingredients fail to nourish your spiritual body. 
Introspection feeds your spiritual body. Poor thinking ability fail to nourish your spiritual body.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Do not mistake spiritual with 'religious' - spiritual is the understanding of your relationship to all that is, in every facet and dimension. The following may help you understand what spiritual represents: "Everything you are is made from this universe, but the universe is not made from everything you are - know your relationship to this universe as it is the sum of your parts. The beauty of existence is discovering more and more about the sum of its parts!" - this is the basis of all science.)

       We should create an experiment, and pitch as if it's "for science!!!" but in reality, it's a place where we can live as truly free humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we find a nice plot of land and gather say 1-3 thousand? This plot of land should be undeveloped. We all set a date, and we move there. Then our scientific experiment begins. We build our own world. No power over others, just collective communication for te advancement of our society.

       Haha would be cool. Hopefully it would work and show the rest of the world what bs they live in.

       It is very common for people to quote scientists, scientific studies, and ask the same whenever any proof is needed on a 'science' related topic. These people have no idea how dependent scientist, labs, journals, and entire departments are on grant money. Who doles out this money? Are there strings, or directions, attached? Yes, frequently, especially in some fields.

       This is the most intelligent thing I have read all day. Thank  you Op. 
More and more people need to understand that this is our reality. Perhaps not 100%, but beyond a shadow of a doubt there is truth in your words here. 
Orwell's 1984 is on the horizon. We need to stand together as a people. Do not be afraid to reach out to others. Do not be afraid to seek the truth.

       I think I am more afraid of the brave new world than 1984. 1984 seems so distinct that its us vs them. While a brave new world seems to play on the suddle nature of destruction.  Too be honost I think it starts with a brave new world leading up to 1984. I wish the powers that be werent so suddle about control other wise more people would wake up then again these powers arent new to the game and know how to play the angles. Its when ppl start to organize is when we can get the ball rolling and not anarchy just local pride.

       I agree. We're nearly in the same state as Brave New World currently, but I think that the powers-that-be are going to become more 1984-esque as soon as that ball starts rolling. It really needs to soon.

       I think you are correct in your sentiment here..
There needs to be a revelation among the people; a genuine grass roots movement. I feel that is the only way that we will attempt to get anything done. And not rioting or anarcy as you said. We need organization and unity. Not mindless mobs.. Although with the NDAA and the Trepass act.. I feel things are only going to get more difficult for us. Thats what they want after all.

       Living alone would not be the way to do it. If you had a decent sized group of like-minded people, and you had access to necessary resources, after establishing a settlement, life would be pretty easy. You would need to work around four hours a day to maintain a colonial standard of living. At which point you could sell goods like the Amish do to cover expenses.

       We are going to be in servitude forever, except servitude to God.  But it's not depressing unless you don't believe in God and His Mercy.  If you don't believe in His Mercy, then you don't benefit from His Mercy meaning heaven after death.  Are you Muslim, AliceHouse?

       i'm sort of a muslim maybe. probably not by a lot of people's standards. i can't read or speak arabic. i don't salaat. i eat pork and drink. but at the same time, i do pray in earnest to god. and i believe there is no god but god and that Muhammad was his final prophet.

       When you look back over history you find that this sort of thing is inevitable, expected even, after we stopped being hunter gatherers and domesticated ourselves. That there will always be people at the top, people at the bottom, everyone else in between and that those above will, more than likely, mistreat those beneath them to maintain their position. Truthfully, after you've pained over the direness of our species' seemingly long &amp; protracted incarceration throughout history, long and hard, have done all the research, wrestled with difficult concepts and such, you invariably arrive at the conclusion that what we have, in the most part, is a natural order being naturally manipulated by those who find themselves at the top of it, and that everyone else is just as responsible for it as the next person - and that includes the minority of individuals resting atop the shit pile we triumphantly label civilisation!

       I think you are right on all points. And I'd like to add that the federal government and any centralized corporate run government like it, has been carefully designed by the elite to be a massive and insurmountable maze of bureaucracy.

       This is how they are able to hide the massive fraud, corruption, and siphoning of wealth within the system. It is all just a foil, a distraction to keep the masses from realizing that the power exists within them to govern themselves simply and fairly. People are enslaved to this system, because it gives them just enough freedom and prosperity to hang themselves with.

       I think one thing you have left out is that the masses that are too stupid to figure this out are actually too stupid to find things like math or history interesting.  They can't think for themselves which makes them in need of being told what to think and what to do.  They are dependent because they are incapable of independence.  They like their servitude.  You ever notice that the poorest people are the ones with the God, Guns, and Country bumper stickers?  They'd also get furious if you try to wake them up and tell them all wars are just rich people using poor people to get stuff - they're too dumb to get this.  The weird thing is that these people actually do need to be controlled - they are stupid herd animals that get violent very easily (think "Walmart Christmas Riot").   So the whole system actually works out pretty well except for unfortunate people with IQs above 120 that have read a book on their own from time to time.  I guess what I am saying is that in my opinion there is no formal conspiracy - no secret meeting took place in which they decided to make history boring anymore than they decided to get the country fat so that no one could runaway.  Its just the natural outcome from most people being dumb and in need of being led.

       Complete junk. If you think there is a conspiracy to buy "junk" like say clothes, chairs, TV's, etc... you really need your head examined.
      </p>
      <p>
       We buy "junk" because we can't produce "junk". This is because we have one body and can only do so much with it. Second we can only have certain amount of knowledge and third we can only have certain amount of materials, because materials and finite.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your whole realization is based on falsehoods and complete lack of understanding of basic human and natural concepts.

       Today such consumption patterns isn't enough to sustain profits, leading to today's unproductive speculation, e.g. stock markets account today for over 30% of US GDP (up from 17% circa 1970), and cyclical crisis / bubbles.

       You have been downvoted for justice!
      </p>
      <p>
       Reason: I think part of the point is that we don't
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       junk in our lives, meaning there is no need to create it. Some things, for sure, are important. Certain medicines need to be constructed in a laboratory setting, and can't be done by know-how alone. One could argue that those who need such care are destined to die, and truly, we are attempting to play god by defying mortality. I'm not here to speculate on that point, but I will acknowledge that it is there.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not, however, need television. Computers. DVD players. Certainly, these things are great in and of themselves, and provide us with art end entertainment but they comprise part of a much larger problem; rampant consumerism. Technological advances are fantastic. No one is arguing that architectural and electronic technology isn't a beautiful and wondrous thing, but the extent to which these technologies are used and abused far outweigh the amount to which they are actually needed in most cases.

       Hmm... Need, want... We may not need TV or computer per say, we are not going to die if we don't have it, but we want one, its not like we are being forced to buy a TV or computer, we want one and in this day and age I'd say we also need them.

       You seem to think that things get produced and then consumed, but you need to understand that things are first wanted and consumed then produced, I mean I can list you thousands of things from gadgets to furniture that has failed and hasn't been consumed.

       Everything I've read comes down on the side of Northern Europe being the most mature and stable countries, both in societal and economic terms.  The last list I read ranked the Netherlands as being the #1 country in the world.  Socially stable, economically stable, and culturally stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that we are a young country with less than two hundred fifty candles on our birthday cake.  Europe, northern especially, has had thousands of years of existence.  Granted, an early existence of warlike vikings for several centuries, if all early history is to be believed.  America is barely a teenager growing pubic hair against the completely shaven majesty of a mature Tantric Goddess.
      </p>

       I'm sure that most of the world looks on the US with quiet amusement as America disregards the events of the planet to focus on only the Owner-created rat race here that distracts the peons.  Witness the current political theatre.  The only difference between Obama / Romney presidencies would be who has a majority in the Supreme Court.  Democrat vs. Republican.  Rationality vs Insanity.

       I think the whole deal is a bit more organic than you make it out to be. There are lots of levels of control in society, but this is just the natural way of humans. Life for people was short and horrible until this 'big conspiracy' took place. Quality of life IS worth the price of giving up some freedoms.

       This post starts out wrong and ends slightly correct...
      </p>
      <p>
       This current incarnation is NOT the natural state of a healthy civilization. It is true that quality of life COULD justify giving up of SOME freedoms; though the freedoms we give up are NOT the ones we should be giving up for this level of quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look arounf the globe - quality of life vs reduced freedoms has not been evenly/equally distributed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are countries that are so much more "free" than the US, have a fantastic quality of life - but "suffer" from far greater government involvement in their lives in the form of taxes.

       I agree, I think the problem with your theory is economics though. OP's post argues that well working economy's give higher profits to those in control. Yet he's forgetting that working (as well as commute) hours have decreased while leisure times have increased steadily over time. 
OP, you need to read into economics a little more because, even though I agree with you, your argument sounds slightly naive. 
Once you get an understanding of free-market economics, figure out how large banks and corporations can influence what people think (through mass media), and how they can use government policy to gain more for themselves. THIS is the oppression you're speaking of, not 40 hour weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're on the right track, but keep going to build a better argument!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, love your idea on the school system! Perhaps schools ran by the state and not federal government would be a start... 50+ people in control instead of 1 small group with clearly an agenda.

       Very good analysis, I couldn't join all my thoughts into something so coherent as you did, congrats.

       Besides Edison, we might include the Wright brothers, US's WWII victory (how can you call Hiroshima and Nagasaki victory ?!), they're merely symbols of American "ingenuity" and "greatness", historical frauds yes, but
       <strong>
        history is always written by the winners
       </strong>
       ("The Man in the High Castle").
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do disagree on the "working hours". We are, thanks to technology,
       <strong>
        working less than ever before
       </strong>
       , and even during our "working hours" 15% of it is non productive (e.g. reddit, solitaire, facebook).
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's where
       <strong>
        Entertainment
       </strong>
       comes in, this is how society is maintained satisfied and under control (
       <strong>
        panem et circum
       </strong>
       ), no wonder it's such a profitable industry.

       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/confirmed-psychiatric-manual-dsm-iv-tr-labels-free-thinkers-non-conformers-as-mentally-ill">
        As for the "non-conformists" who won't subdue themselves to mass entertainment, the Diagnosis and Syndrome Manual (DSM) offers prompt help, either through mood suppressors or the psychiatric wards.

      <p>
       History and Math are fundamental but most important should be
       <strong>
        critical thinking
       </strong>
       (i.e. philosophy), something not emphasized in American public schooling, but very high in regard in private schools. The ability and right to question, and not simply accept the facts as they're given. Many great thinkers were silenced for this simple yet feared right.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the main criticisms of capitalism is its unsustainability (
       <strong>
        contradiction between never ending surplus in limited resourced world
       </strong>
       ; read
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_Grossman">
        Henryk Grossman
       </a>
       ) and what we're seeing today is the result: unproductive speculation, wars, unemployment, devaluation...
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the individual living a self-sustainable life, this also not an option for the whole humanity, first, there simply
       <strong>
        isn't enough terrain in the planet to hold 6 trillion self subsistence farmers.
       </strong>
       Urban society has its many advantages over agricultural, unfortunately today's western stratified consumption led capitalist society is not beneficial to mankind nor the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We urgently need a new, more responsible, and egalitarian society, that doesn't revolve around consumption and exploitation. A balanced society, based on ethics, reason, and knowledge, where both science and religion can flourish, both in their own ways without interfering with one another....

       It gets into the capitalism side, and how there is a scheme by those in power to make sure they have ample resources to survive and profit from before they are gone.  In capitalism, everything must be commodified.  Look at water- in 1950 it was free, now it costs money.  Information- you pay to learn.  How does learning and gaining knowledge harm anything? It doesn't. It actually improves the world.  But the powers that be must continually find things to profit from because the world economy must perpetually grow to maintain the system.  But as they have said, the world economy is a living thing, and as proven by observation, no living thing lives forever.

       touche.  I was talking more about the need to go to college if you want to be "somebody," aka make money and buy shit you dont need.  Information being commodified is awful.  But I do agree the internet (and sites like wikipedia) are helping transition away from that.  But wikipedia doesn't give out degrees that employers look at like a college does.

       My contribution (and it fits within your hypothesis) is that children are voluntarily signed up for the income tax. Because the parent pays income tax they want to get every deduction they can. One of the biggest deduction is for dependents. In order to claim a dependent you need proof they exist hence your child's social security number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along the same lines corporate tax incentives and deductions for employees. In order to prove the employee exists they need the employee's social security number. A corporation (if they have a choice) between an employee with a SSN and without one will go with the one that has one.

       Most of this resonates with me. One thing I should definatly be learning is how to be more resourcefully independent:
Crop Growing
Clothes manufacturing
Natural Medicine ... ect.
I think it would be very interesting to live in more of a agrarian type society where people at least have a small patch of their yard growing some kind of vegetable or fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the underlying nature of our education system is defiantly to weed out the few who need to do more important work than turning knobs and levers, and they skew the concepts just enough to be slightly confusing but for others to understand it as having an intention to benefit us.

       Everything about your conspiracy is spot on, however, the amusing thing is, we have always been slaves, even before governments, even before kings, we're always a slave to time... always.  Do you think items can craft themselves?  Growing food, making items, traveling, etc, all takes a LOT of time... it's wonderful and all that we're so free these days actually.. I can go give someone else a few bucks and bam, new t-shirt, or I can spend the next few weeks harvesting the materials, preparing them, and then crafting a new shirt... which will be hideous of course... so yes, you're right.. and I'm glad for you realizing all this but the fact is, we're no more a slave now than man has ever been.

       I think that if you really wanted to look into so-called "conspiracies", then you would need to first do your history.
      </p>
      <p>
       By simplifying hundreds of years of individuals' actions, desires, failures, and beliefs into a single narrative with a specific purpose, you ignore all of the very real data and evidence that corroborates people's firsthand accounts that describe the development of society, politics, law, and social contracts, in general.
I recommend the greats in political theory: Smith, Adams, etc. They explain how societies necessarily operate through and because of the combined force of the people that make up its governance and who are also governed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, you will never, ever, ever identify "them". If you want to demonize a particular individual, then it would be far more constructive to understand what exactly is oppressing people. Is it the NDAA? The Patriot Act? Now, who instituted those? Who were the
       <em>
        stakeholders
       </em>
       ? Who operates the military-industrial complex or who is behind the media oligarchy?
Now, those are serious questions that have specific answers. Look into that, rather than hypothesizing on your own.
It's good that you experiment with thought, but without
       <strong>
        FACTS
       </strong>
       , it's all conjecture ie bullshit.

       I've heard this term from somewhere else here, but I think it's a good description: Involuntary Civilization. We are a part of an involuntary, highly artificial society. All of this truly is a contrivance. Along with that, human beings are far more than we have been allowed to be. We have been stunted, crippled &amp; have endured a forced retardation of our true nature &amp; abilities for a very long time.  I believe there is an entire branch of our true (read: forbidden) history that we have NO CLUE of. Actually, it's more like WE are the branch. We have been taken off our natural path by those who truly
       <em>
        know what they are doing
       </em>
       &amp; I think the top of the pyramid goes faar higher than a bunch of braniac banking dynasties. This was done with such
       <em>
        deftness
       </em>
       , with such an eye towards long swaths of time, that it seems like the doings of evil time-travelers from the future.. whatever the truth of their identity is, it's more than just mortal men.
      </p>

       To call it the "The Mother of All Conspiracies" you need to take it one step further. You need to ask
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       it is like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've gathered - we may not be at the top of the food chain, we may be food. We are locked in a prison of the mind, because we have been given their mind. Just as psychopaths feed on fear and chaos, they may feed from what happens here.

       <em>
        Don Juan:
       </em>
       (Carlos Castaneda, The Active Side of Infinity)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We have a predator that came from the depths of the cosmos and took over the rule of our lives. Human beings are its prisoners. The predator is our lord and master. It has rendered us docile, helpless. If we want to protest, it suppresses our protest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we don’t do so… You have arrived, by your effort alone, to what the shamans of ancient Mexico called
        <strong>
         the topic of topics
        </strong>
        . I have been beating around the bush all this time, insinuating to you that something is holding us prisoner. Indeed we are held prisoner! This was an energetic fact for the sorcerers of ancient Mexico.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Why has this predator taken over in the fashion that you’re describing, don Juan?” I asked. “There must be a logical explanation.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “There is an explanation,” don Juan replied, “which is the simplest explanation in the world. They took over because we are food for them, and they squeeze us mercilessly because we are their sustenance. Just as we rear chickens in chicken coops, the predators rear us in human coops. Therefore, their food is always available to them.”
       </p>
       <p>
        I felt that my head was shaking violently from side to side. I could not express my profound sense of unease and discontentment, but my body moved to bring it to the surface. I shook from head to toe without any volition on my part.
       </p>
       <p>
        “No, no, no, no,” I heard myself saying. “This is absurd, don Juan. What you’re saying is something monstrous. It simply can’t be true, for sorcerers or for average men, or for anyone.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Why not?” don Juan asked calmly. “Why not? Because it infuriates you?”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Yes, it infuriates me,” I retorted. “Those claims are monstrous!” […]
       </p>
       <p>
        “I want to appeal to your analytical mind,” don Juan said. “Think for a moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradiction between the intelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems of beliefs, or the stupidity of his contradictory behavior. Sorcerers believe that the predators have given us our systems of beliefs, our ideas of good and evil, our social mores. They are the ones who set up our hopes and expectations and dreams of success or failure. They have given us covetousness, greed and cowardice. It is the predators who make us complacent, routinary, and egomaniacal.”
       </p>
       <p>
        ‘But how can they do this, don Juan?’ I asked, somehow angered further by what he was saying. ‘Do they whisper all that in our ears while we are asleep?’
       </p>
       <p>
        ‘No, they don’t do it that way. That’s idiotic!’ don Juan said, smiling. ‘They are infinitely more efficient and organized than that. In order to keep us obedient and meek and weak, the predators engaged themselves in a stupendous maneuver — stupendous, of course, from the point of view of a fighting strategist. A horrendous maneuver from the point of view of those who suffer it. They gave us their mind! Do you hear me? The predators give us their mind, which becomes our mind. The predators’ mind is baroque, contradictory, morose, filled with the fear of being discovered any minute now.

        Q: Do the many laws under whose influence we are produce the different “I’s” in us?
       </p>
       <p>
        A: Yes, very many. Forces pass through man and he takes this as his own desires, sympathies, and attractions. But it is only forces passing through him from all directions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Q: How can one extricate oneself from bad influences?
       </p>
       <p>
        A: Before we can even think about “doing” we must try to understand what these influences are. This is a constant mistake that everybody makes always to think they can “do”. We cannot “do”,
        <strong>
         but if we know, we may change something
        </strong>
        . [And we can begin to know when we open ourselves to higher forces]… Higher forces or higher influences are normal, cosmic; but we can open ourselves to receive them, or shut ourselves off from them. If we are asleep, we are more closed to them, and the more we are asleep the more we are closed. If we awake, we open ourselves to higher influences.
       </p>
       <p>
        Q: Can we get free?
       </p>
       <p>
        A: We can — on conditions. The Ways enter here. The four Ways are ways of liberation from unnecessary laws. You can be shown the Way… but you must work yourself. Most of the laws we have to obey are the result of our sleep and our unconsciousness.
        <strong>
         Every step we make in becoming more conscious sets us more free
        </strong>
        . Suppose a man is satisfied with mechanical life; then he cuts himself off from higher influences [that could teach him how to awaken] and receives only influences [from lower levels, including his own inclinations]. Certainly he is then in a worse position than a man who receives influences from higher worlds. Many influences can be received mechanically, but many others
        <strong>

       This gives a new meaning for "If you want to change the world, start with yourself". Focus on changing the inside, and the "outside" will follow, because when you change your mind, you will perceive

       I'm not saying you don't have valid points, but just because you sucked at history and math does not mean there is a government conspiracy against people learning. There are millions of people who spend there lives and careers studying history and the fastest growing jobs in the world are tech jobs, which require solid math skills. Again you have valid points, but that part was ill thought out.

       Here's another peice..
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine all humans in a vacuum (separated from our cultural evolutions).  We're all the same, with a few tiny differences..
      </p>
      <p>
       One of those differences involves the degree to which we are either capable or feeling it necessary (mostly, IMnsHO, due to (lack of) nurture)) to gain and retain power over the lives of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Power like that is mostly granted in human cultures to those who want it the most because they work hardest to get it and keep it.  These people are mostly hungry for certain kinds of attention the didn't receive as infants or children, but I digress..
      </p>
      <p>
       So the decisions which most greatly affect the most number of humans in the species are all delegated to one subgroup, those who are (emotionally) hungry.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the systemic cause of this problem.

       take the word clandestine.  it means done secretly, unidentifiable, nebulous.  split the word.  clan.  destiny.  is it strange that this word is literally clan destiny?  No, that's because a nebulous, unidentifiable group of beings has been shaping human culture globally for some time now.  this is why history is erased and re-written everywhere they go.

       Before I offer you this shit storm of a rebuttal.. just know that I am happy that you are opening your eyes and learning how to think critically. Everything I say is meant to help you on your journey, no matter how crude and straight forward I may put it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't say the system is rigged, I would say it was conquered.. When the 40 hour work week came about, it was actually a good thing compared to what we were used to and not some sinister plot to keep people busy. History really is just a bunch of names and dates with context. And not everyone finds it boring =). Your arguments about mathematics don't even make any sense. You are trying to force correlations together to support your argument.. "To those students who got math, maybe the 40 hour work week, families and mortgages would keep them too busy to ask questions." Most people take the majority of their math classes before they have to worry about a 40 hour work week or families/mortgages. Speaking of mathematics.. how does it help us spot when we are being lied to liked you say? BTW, Tesla lost his place in history (in the short term of history that is) because he wasn't as greedy as Edison. Racial tension wasn't engineered, its been in existence for as long as history dates back. Here in the United States, racial tension from Slavery still has deep roots. The racial tension between the different Asian ethnicity's is astounding and came about from the very eventful history of their culture as well. Let me see you craft your computer.. but wait.. you also have to craft your own computer language too because you want to be self reliant right? Are you a farmer? Growing your own food is damn hard work. You talk about people being trapped in a 40 hour work week and then you say people should be more self reliant where they grow their own food and craft everything they need. This is called delusion. How would there be no need for Government if the Government solved our problems? Is the Governments purpose to solve our problems? You are constantly begging the question.

       I was pretty much entirely with you until this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The government's job is to create and exacerbate problems, because it is in any government's best interest to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the government solved our problems, there would be no further need for government.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When you say government, are you referring to the idea of government in general, or the reality of the U.S. government today (corporately-owned politicians that are forced to rely on campaign financing &amp; corporate media exposure in order to maintain their positions of power).
      </p>
      <p>
       In my view, just because our corrupted system of governance has created massive problems for our country/the world doesn't mean that the concept of government itself is inherently evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the problems that you described above can be traced back to money in politics.  What we have is a system of "democracy to the highest bidder", and right now, the industrial class is the highest bidder, and their using their financial (and thus political) clout to maintain this society that they've helped create.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way to take back power from the financial/industrial class is to demand publicly-financed elections (where small dollar contributions by citizens are then matched by public funds with a multiplier).  Candidates who refuse to run these publicly financed campaigns should be shamed by poor and middle class voters from both sides of the aisle.  It's as bipartisan an issue that there ever will be, and I'm starting to think that it's really the only way to fix the multitude of problems that face our country, many of which you've described above.

       Right on all points. I can see why the concept of the movie The Matrix went over so well. Anyone still locked in the system was
       <em>
        a part of that system

       and, for the vast majority, willfully blind to reality.

      <p>
       Full disclosure: The guy is selling silver coins or something, but this particular playlist is chock full of good ideas and eye openers and is commercial free. His other playlists focus more on precious metals and coins etc whatever skip'em.

       Living alone would not be the way to do it. If you had a decent sized group of like-minded people, and you had access to necessary resources, after establishing a settlement, life would be pretty easy. You would need to work around four hours a day to maintain a colonial standard of living. At which point you could sell goods like the Amish do to cover expenses.

       We should create an experiment, and pitch as if it's "for science!!!" but in reality, it's a place where we can live as truly free humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we find a nice plot of land and gather say 1-3 thousand? This plot of land should be undeveloped. We all set a date, and we move there. Then our scientific experiment begins. We build our own world. No power over others, just collective communication for te advancement of our society.

       I'm a mod on

       . I was raised on a commune. I am a techie in silicon valley. I am apolitical. I am an objectivist and humanist. I am a member of the Mayan Order. I am a seeker of understanding and through my understanding a seeker of wisdom. All of these are traits, not labels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was lucky - the commune was corrupted after we left and was consumed by drugs and other things. It lost its meaning and its center.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Uneducated humans encroached.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MOST important thing in this life is education. Information is a component of education - education is a process by which a human digests information and builds an emotional/intellectual/spiritual body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food feeds your physical body, and the ingredients in that food are crucial to your physical health.
Information feeds your intellectual body. Poor ingredients fail to nourish your spiritual body. 
Introspection feeds your spiritual body. Poor thinking ability fail to nourish your spiritual body.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Do not mistake spiritual with 'religious' - spiritual is the understanding of your relationship to all that is, in every facet and dimension. The following may help you understand what spiritual represents: "Everything you are is made from this universe, but the universe is not made from everything you are - know your relationship to this universe as it is the sum of your parts. The beauty of existence is discovering more and more about the sum of its parts!" - this is the basis of all science.)

       The difference is that you are serving only yourself/family vs. a boss, board, stockholders, etc... But I agree with your overall point. At least as a slave we have Reddit. And Reddit is all we really need :p

       Well, the shahada is the most important thing imo.  I was eating pork and drinking too when I said the shahada but then I eventually stopped after I started salaat.  Join us in

       Yeah, I agree. When you get high it pulls you away from a comfort zone. I have this "theory" you can say about smoking weed and how certain people are effected by it. 15 years old, smoked weed, tripped out; had existential crisis, insomnia, severe headaches, and severe constantly rushing thoughts. All of this sent me to the my Dr's frequently and I was considered for psychiatric evaluation, most likely schizophrenia. I'm 20 years old now, have slowly gotten over my problem through self guided metitation, reading, studying philosophy, and deep introspective self reflection spiritually. This helped the panic attacks cease. I noticed that certain people do have an anxietal response to marijuana, but I was wondering what it was that actually triggered it. I don't think it's the marijuana itself, a drug's effect is never soley responsible on the drug, it takes a reaction; several variables. I was wondering if smoking weed broke through several spiritual boundaries, ans caused sever anxiety in those who weren't able to cope with the reality yet, because they've ignored it. I'm not saying those who can comfortably smoke weed are "awake," but maybe it's that these people are better at safeguarding the fagility of the humam mind by retaining the illusion of safety.
