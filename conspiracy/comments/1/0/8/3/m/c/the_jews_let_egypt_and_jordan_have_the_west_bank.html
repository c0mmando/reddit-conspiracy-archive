    <div class="md"><p>actually the Palestinians had been demanding statehood since around 1918. Every year, since the Balfour declaration had been signed the Palestinians protested on the year anniversary of the day it was signed. Aside from the Saudi descended Heshimite king of Jordan, a majority of the population is native Palestinian (as Jordan was proposed to be part of the Jewish state, the people were Palestinian until they suddenly became Jordanians). The Palestinians in the west bank lost their Jordanian citizenship in 1989? The gulf states are all USA backed and will no nothing to help Palestinians. Check out the hell the Chief of Dubai Police went through just to be able to get evidence, in his own country, to prove Mossad murdered the Hamas dude.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel started the war of independence by attacking the native Palestinian population and forcing them to leave. Most of the neighboring countries were in a state of their own turmoil, that is another reason why it took so long for neighboring countries to send help to the Palestinians. Israel had begun a military push for statehood in 1947. The native populations fled to the West Bank and Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon because basically the Palestinian Arab population didn&#39;t get much assistance. Nobody was really coming to help them, and the Zionists had too many bigwigs in high enough places to keep the native population silenced.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Levant/Palestine was settled originally by Zionists who wished to create a Socialist community, with no intentions of interfering with the Natives. A term was used: &quot;To become part of the Ottoman Parliament&quot;. in 1917 the Balfour was addressed to Walter Rothschild, in which the Rothschild would help fund the British, and the Zionists were guaranteed Palestine. In 1920 the British Mandate began and was suppressing two bids for statehood. The Palestinians, and the ever radicalizing Zionists. During this time, neither group could be guaranteed statehood. In ww1 the British promised the Zionists a state in exchange assistance. As ww2 came around the British found the need to brown nose Iran and other oil producing countries, so they issued the White Paper. After ww2, the British needed neither groups anymore, and handed the whole situation to the UN. In that time, Zionists begin actively stealing and purging Native villages. Then they declared independence. The Zionists were well funded by rich diaspora Jews. The acquired weapons and strategy from Diaspora Jews... The Palestinians didn&#39;t get this option until it was too late.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both occupations were considered illegal as far as I remember. Jordan had given West Bank citizens Jordanian citizenship until I think 1989.  </p>

<p>Zionists had hoped that the Palestinians would assimilate into Egyptian and Jordanian societies and abandon their ethnicity. However they didn&#39;t. If Egypt or Jordan gave the Palestinians the ability to statehood, helped them build an army etc. What would the response be? The Zionists would assume (rightly) that the first thing an organized Palestinian army would do is attack Israel to reclaim their ancestral lands. If the Zionists crushed them, what would they do next? Why, attack Egypt and Jordan to prevent them from helping the Palestinian cause again. What if the Palestinians succeeded? America would butt in to keep its balance in the middle east from being crushed... by crushing Egypt and Jordan. (lets not forget Israel fought the war in 1956 on behalf of French and Anglo Suez interests and captured the Sinai!)</p>

<p>You also forget the Palestinian populations residing in Syria and Lebanon. None of these countries expected the Palestine partition plan from the UN. Nor did they expect the world to just give Palestine to Zionists. These populations took refuge in other countries. Refuge. Not residence. Jordan considered the West Bank as it&#39;s own territory (and Golda Meir&#39;s famous backdoor deal with King Abdallah). Gaza was considered Egyptian land to the Egyptians, since they captured it. The Golan is considered territory to Syria. The Palestinians were expelled between 1947-1950. 17 years later Israel gained control of the West Bank and Gaza and Golan from Syria. Palestine belonged to the Palestinians. Less than 20 years after the fact, there was still an expectation that Palestinians would be able to return home. Giving the West Bank and Gaza to the Palestinians technically would not be giving people expelled from Tzfat or Tiveria or Haifa their homes back. </p>

<p>I hope this is clearer! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the Palestinian natives didn&#39;t have guns. They didn&#39;t have tanks or an army. They lived under British occupation. However, Zionists had better means of getting around the British. Plus they were preparing for statehood by stockpiling weapons, something which the Palestinians didn&#39;t do. When the 47-48 war began, the Zionists were well better prepared. Ever hear of the Machal unit? It was comprised of demobilized Jewish and non-Jewish ww2 veterans who joined the Zionist cause. This allowed for the influx of well trained soldiers... The Palestinians had only those who they could muster up at the last minute. The Zionists also had steady arms flowing in. Check out how the American Jewish mafia assisted Zionists in using dock connections to divert weapons to Israel, or away from Arab states.   </p>

<p>People who support the Palestinians and blame Israel for their plight without a doubt are lying to themselves, or just ignorant of the facts. I&#39;m impressed to see this posted here in r/conspiracy...</p>

<p>By the way, the Palestinians did not &quot;fight for their independence&quot; in 1967, because as you point out, that fight would have been against Jordan not Israel. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t know what to tell you about israeli refugees. there are thousands of zionists around the world who would i&#39;m sure be happy to let the israelis take their land, right? since they propose that option be forced on others. at least abolishing israel would set a precedent that it&#39;s not ok to genocide your way into some property, then subsidize immigration. speaking of which, the US should belong to the natives too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel, again, has been a country for decades. By your definition of &quot;taking land&quot; we should pretty much all be refugees since we all live somewhere where someone was once driven out! </p>

<p>Israel did not &quot;genocide its way&quot; to it&#39;s own property, they were given it by the british in the Balfour declaration of 1917. The British controlled the land then, and they divided it between Jews and Arabs. In 1948, the arabs responded to partition by trying to genocide the Jewish population, and lost. I&#39;m supposed to feel sorry for people who tried to commit genocide and lost? </p>

<p>Come the fuck on now. Pam Geller says it best: &quot;In a war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man&quot;. Israel is the civilized man in this fight, the second-best educated country in the world with more Nobel prizewinners per capita then any other country. Compare this to the arabs... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you think that bothers me that all land would be returned to a global native trust? that&#39;s the best thing that could ever happen. fuck private property. that leads to capitalism you know. </p>

<p>oh sorry they were &quot;given&quot; the land by the monarchs of a country in europe. sounds legit. all these arguments you&#39;re using apply equally to the US. by fighting our expansion did the indians commit genocide? i guess maybe. but they didn&#39;t start it and were acting defensively. some empire lands on my shores and says one tribe gets all the land that my tribe has been living on in peace at length? no way jose. you&#39;re acting like the brits forced the israelis to declare independence, and they just went along with it. the israelis are responsible for the creation and maintenance of the apartheid state. imperial support from the US and UK is secondary (but necessary) for that. who pushed all the former residents into other countries? i&#39;ll give you a hint, they still keep checkpoints around the open prisons where the grandkids of displaced people now live.</p>

<p>what does &quot;civilized&quot; even mean? using white phosphorous bombs and bulldozing civilian homes?</p>

<p>the israeli culture is no older than the cultures around it. jews and arabs are genetically similar. so what makes one civilized and the other not? did you know many arabs like to sit around drinking tea and discussing current events? sounds pretty damn civilized to me. sounds like uneducated arabs need an education, not to be killed. just because israel can afford fancy educations that allow them to pursue nobel science, doesn&#39;t make them civilized. civilized people know that land grabs are a no-no.</p>

<p>the saying should be &quot;in a war started by the richer tribe against the poorer tribe, support peace and justice&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no! We are speaking two different languages here. As you can imagine, I believe in private property and capitalism, but especially private property, which is utterly essential for a functioning modern society. </p>

<p>The argument from my perspective is simple. The UK controlled the land, it was their &quot;property&quot;, and they decided to give this to both Jews and Arabs. The arabs allowed the british in, in order to fight the Turks. You can&#39;t hand control of an area over to someone else, then respond murderously when you don&#39;t like that they let someone else live there! Israel didn&#39;t &quot;push&quot; the arabs anywhere, they didn&#39;t even exist yet! In 1948, the arabs rejected partition and tried to completely genocide the Jews of the region, again, technically before there even was a state of Israel. There&#39;s only so many times you&#39;re going to put up with massacres and attempted massacres, by a group of people, before you for example put a wall up to keep them out... </p>

<p>It&#39;s irrelevant to morality whether or not one side is &quot;richer&quot; then the other. The arabs would be doing much better if, like Israel, they focused on improving their countries, and not just killing Jewish people and rioting over silly crap on the internet. Notice Jews don&#39;t behave that way... Sort of goes along with the whole civilized thing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well which is it? you can&#39;t believe both in private property rights, and also that a country should get to keep stolen land. it&#39;s one or the other.</p>

<p>i noticed you put property in quotations. is that because it was illegitimate possession? do you think i&#39;m stupid enough to believe that anyone in the world is happy to have an empire occupying their land? the british had no right to partition the land. therefore the state of israel is illegitimate. if you&#39;re not aware of the genocidal dispersion of palestinians by the pre-israeli fighters, i can provide some sources for you.</p>

<p>were arabian people killing people who were jewish en masse prior to the partition? maybe that&#39;s what was pissing them off. another solution to pissed off natives trying to kill you when you &quot;partition&quot; AKA take their land, is to leave or live peacefully without a partition. israel simply has no right to exist, let alone to kick others off their land.</p>

<p>what would be so wrong with accepting our jewish friends into america where they can live with people of all races and religions? why take someone else&#39;s land by force? to me, jewish people should refuse to live in israel due to its illegitimacy, not blame the british while enjoying the fruits of the land theft. </p>

<p>what makes you say that people who are arab don&#39;t improve their countries? that&#39;s quite a stereotype. i&#39;m sure the palestinians would have nicer digs if they weren&#39;t under siege, with their houses bulldozed and no supplies allowed in to rebuild. </p>

<p>you really need to define civilized, because i don&#39;t find apartheid oppression to be very civilized. now that i think of it, mutilating the genitals of children isn&#39;t cool either. i won&#39;t even mention all the outright genocide mentioned in the old testament.</p>

<p>the elephant in the room is that if people would give up the ridiculous notion of being &quot;chosen&quot; by a bearded sky fairy, we wouldn&#39;t have any of these problems. </p>

<p>killing people and displacing people from their rightful property is pretty much the opposite of property theory. </p>

<p>It depends. The goal of any property regime is the efficient allocation of scarce resources. Sometimes that requires force. </p>

<p>In the USA this is accomplished through eminent domain. Israel is basically doing the same thing.</p>

<p>You said &quot;occupy&quot; dummy. </p>

<p>The economy is shit in every arab country that doesn&#39;t have oil. And even the oil rich countries are only prosperous when they have an authoritarian ruler to keep arab passions in check (see: Iraq, Libya). Every time the &quot;arab street&quot; takes over a country they wreck the economy and make everyone poorer.</p>

<p>lol, blocking off some roads = Nazi Germany now? Christ you&#39;re delusional. </p>

<p>You do realize Israel treats the Palestinians 1000x better than Palestinians would treat Israelis if the tables were turned, right?  No country treats its enemies better than Israel. If Russia or India or China had to deal with the Palestinians they would have genocided them 50 years ago. When Japan occupied Korea it forced everyone to speak Japanese and take Japanese names -- there are hardly any books or magazines written in Korean from the 1920s and 1930s because Koreans had to get permission before they could write anything in their own language.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the only one talking about race. I don&#39;t even believe in the concept of race. &quot;Race&quot; is something intellectually lazy people use to describe arbitrary and superficial physical distinctions. </p>

<p>Palestinians are basically Mycenaean greeks, not anything I would ever call a race. They&#39;re not inferior because of their physical characteristics. They&#39;re inferior because of their shitty, backwards culture.</p>

<p>It would be good if they stopped ACTING like subhumans. It&#39;s 2012, not 712. Time to get with the program. They should emphasize education and scientific inquiry like jews and europeans and asians do. Not stone age religious nonsense.</p>
