    <div class="md"><p>To you and everyone on this thread, have we not been witness to an increasing hivemind? I also joined Reddit to keep tabs on major political issues in the U.S. and abroad: massive protests, occupy wallstreet, European Union economy, U.S. Economy, umemployment, police handling the massive protests, important-possibly constitution shaking- legislation, but Reddit is changing. I don&#39;t see that on the front page anymore. All i see is intolerat, ignorant, and racist people. There was a post about a little muslim girl in germany where she refused to swim so close to bare-chested boys in the same pool, which eventually made its way to court. The intolerant and bigoted comments were the most upvoted, people were spewing out hateful comments about muslims that were unjustifiable, yet had the most upvotes; reddit agreed with these people. It&#39;s like watching FOX news; bullshit stories, bias, and coverage that the hivemind is blindly agreeing with. I used to have so much faith in Reddit for keeping me on top of news. /r/ world news is out of touch with the protests or at least the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;hot&quot; pages aren&#39;t showing. I don&#39;t know what popularized Reddit with a new, close-minded population: Obama&#39;a AMA, or whatever, but I&#39;m depressed that this happened. I&#39;ve hears rumors of a possible DDoS on Reddit, a group of people out there, who understand the subtly of dying liberlism on Reddit, are pissed. Hopefully they knock this bitch offline for weeks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been lurking Reddit for 4+ years and while intelligent discussion used to happen more frequently, these circlejerks and general &#39;hivemind&#39; have been around the whole time. The internet is a place where people can typically say anything and not care, so there are plenty of trolls, and people who are extremist because they couldn&#39;t get away with saying things like that in real life, that or they have no one to talk to that will listen. It&#39;s a pretty unique experience to be able to say something and know that <em>millions</em> of people could be reading it, it can really change how people act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that it&#39;s not always the case, but I&#39;ve had numerous people who&#39;ve been agitated at discussions I&#39;ve had with them message me and say they&#39;ll down vote every post I ever make. How dedicated some people are is another question, but I imagine some people just down vote me because when I first came to this sub I made a lot of very negative anti-sub comments, and people still see my name and not my posts.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone just disagreed with my sentiment about how some people act on the internet though, I know I say things sometimes that go against the grain and get down voted for that stuff /shrug</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m tired of the &quot;Today some random person did something extremely rare and nice. What other things have people done that restored your faith in humanity?&quot; posts.</p>

<p>I SWEAR to god, I&#39;ve seen that last part: &quot;Faith in humanity&quot; about 6 times in the last few months. It&#39;s just the same shit. I know that no matter how important a thread is, the joke posts and puns will ALWAYS be at the top. It&#39;s just becoming repetitive.

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree more with you.</p>

<p>Reddit has changed heavily for the worse since the rise against SOPA, and even more after the Obama AMA. The site is barely worth visiting if going to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> as I always did before. It is just so much of unimportant crap really.</p>

<p>The blind Obama circlejerk and Romney hatetrain of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has long ago reached a point where it is clear there is a propaganda machine working there, to keep people from thinking about the real issues.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the U.S. government acknowledged the power of reddit when they couldn&#39;t force through SOPA, so they&#39;ve put a lot of money into ruining the site.</p>

<p>This is not ONLY the result of &quot;reddit becoming mainstream&quot;, as some try to say. There is a big propaganda machine working in the background with increased power here, and it&#39;s sad to see such a good site go bad so quickly.</p>
