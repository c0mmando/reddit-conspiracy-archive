       I absolutely fucking agree - but it makes my conspiracy filled head fill up even more when I wonder why they haven't already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: You know, I just had a thought. I wonder if the Muslims need help. You know, there's only one way to fight an asymmetric war. Guerrilla warfare. And there's only one way to fight guerrilla warfare properly - it's a political way to fight. You show the world the atrocities of your attacker, and let politics of the region/world fit in.
      </p>

       Maybe they are being blocked from communicating their voice to the world, or don't know how....maybe someone needs to help them.

       I agree 75%. Although nothing has provoked a problem with Iran at the moment, they are not "innocent brown people". Iran is full of hate and war bringing. They are a strong, powerful people who won't take any shit from the US. The afghanis, the Iraqis, they were innocent as civilians. But Iran HATES us. I had a friend from Iran once and he said it is taught there: "Death To America."
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that the government and US Military stick their nose in places it doesn't belong, but Iran wouldn't hesitate to drop the fucking hammer on us at any given chance. I'm not thinking of the same typical redneck mentality and saying "drop the bomb on 'em!" I say stay away from them. Don't provoke it.

       (By saying this, I'm not challenging anyone's opinion. I'm just speaking as if I were sitting here speaking with the powers that be.)

       I was surprised how well the Bengazi thing got the sheep baaa-ing for blood. So yeah, probably just about anything. However, when the draft papers go out attitudes will change rapidly.

       That's what the US counter-insurgency apparatus is being built for. To give citizens no choice but to die for the petrodollar and Greater Israel, like the Germans who had no choice but to join the German military.

       Most likely yes, along with economic collapse. They don't need a flase flag to goto war but if they want to draft and have any chance of it succeeding they will need
       <em>
        something nasty.

       I know I'm going to get down voted into oblivion for this, but is even a single person getting tired of everyone just saying 'sheep' to refer to
       <em>
        everyone?
       </em>
       I honestly just have a hard time even reading a reply once it starts with "sheeple" or "all the sheep." There are people who are 'sheep' on both sides, who blindly believe misinformation/disinformation.

       It will undoubtedly involve a US Navy ship since we have half the fleet currently in the Straits of Hormuz trying to create an incident. Israel will attack or sink one of our ships and make it appear that Iran was the culprit. Netanyahu is doing all he can to start a war before November.

       Not saying that it WILL happen, but if it does this is
       <em>
        precisely

       i dunno, it probably depends on what part of the country, but here in the pacific NW people are just waiting for a reason to escalate OWS. remember before iraq when millions around the world came out and marched? i expect something similar, with the possibility of a battle of seattle WTO kind of escalation.
      </p>

       with the marches that happened before iraq, what makes you say that nothing would happen?

       true. we've seen the growth of viable international news sources like al jazeera and RT since iraq. iran is also much less of a pariah than iraq. it has allies (like russia- RT) and the ability to counter western propaganda with propaganda of its own through presstv.ir.
      </p>
      <p>
       at this point i should probably mention that if israel attacks, iran has already said that it will attack american installations. otherwise what disincentive is there for an attack? so i'm not so worried about a false flag, as a legitimate retaliation for our (israel/US/UK) aggressive attack. therefore the american population's response should be against the aggression rather than some kind of false flag denial march.

       aljaz is fairly kosher these days isn't it? RT is the most balanced I think, once you dial out the russian propaganda there is usually still some truth remaining. can't say the same for many other mainstream sources these days...

       yeah both of those orgs have done some great coverage of OWS.

       it's easy to take RT with a grain of salt when they talk about georgia or chechnya for example, but they're a great counterpoint to western media. they actually question capitalism, wow!

       Millions marching against the Iraq war? Maybe, though I doubt it. I must have missed the millions against the Iraq war march. Even if it actually occurred, it was totally ineffective. It took years for folks to realize the lies and follies it was based on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recall the ubiquitous "support the troops" yellow magnetic ribbons on cars. Millions in the street? Nope.

       Late 2003: 69% of Americans fully supported the war. The opponents uniformly labeled as unpatriotic.
