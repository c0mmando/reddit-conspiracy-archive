    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely fucking agree - but it makes my conspiracy filled head fill up even more when I wonder why they haven&#39;t already.</p>

<p>Edit: You know, I just had a thought. I wonder if the Muslims need help. You know, there&#39;s only one way to fight an asymmetric war. Guerrilla warfare. And there&#39;s only one way to fight guerrilla warfare properly - it&#39;s a political way to fight. You show the world the atrocities of your attacker, and let politics of the region/world fit in.</p>

<p>Maybe they are being blocked from communicating their voice to the world, or don&#39;t know how....maybe someone needs to help them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 75%. Although nothing has provoked a problem with Iran at the moment, they are not &quot;innocent brown people&quot;. Iran is full of hate and war bringing. They are a strong, powerful people who won&#39;t take any shit from the US. The afghanis, the Iraqis, they were innocent as civilians. But Iran HATES us. I had a friend from Iran once and he said it is taught there: &quot;Death To America.&quot; </p>

<p>I understand that the government and US Military stick their nose in places it doesn&#39;t belong, but Iran wouldn&#39;t hesitate to drop the fucking hammer on us at any given chance. I&#39;m not thinking of the same typical redneck mentality and saying &quot;drop the bomb on &#39;em!&quot; I say stay away from them. Don&#39;t provoke it. </p>

<p>(By saying this, I&#39;m not challenging anyone&#39;s opinion. I&#39;m just speaking as if I were sitting here speaking with the powers that be.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>true. we&#39;ve seen the growth of viable international news sources like al jazeera and RT since iraq. iran is also much less of a pariah than iraq. it has allies (like russia- RT) and the ability to counter western propaganda with propaganda of its own through presstv.ir. </p>

<p>at this point i should probably mention that if israel attacks, iran has already said that it will attack american installations. otherwise what disincentive is there for an attack? so i&#39;m not so worried about a false flag, as a legitimate retaliation for our (israel/US/UK) aggressive attack. therefore the american population&#39;s response should be against the aggression rather than some kind of false flag denial march.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for Europe. I was in BDU&#39;s more than a decade before Windows 95, so no I&#39;m not too young to remember. What went on here in the states was pathetic as far as opposition to the war. Nice try. </p>

<p>i was in SF with about a million others on that day. i don&#39;t know what you expect from people that mobilizing a million people in each of several major american cities in addition to globally is &quot;pathetic&quot;. you did read the part about it being the biggest march in human history right?</p>

<p>what would be a reasonable expectation for war opposition that you wouldn&#39;t call pathetic? what actions have you personally taken that meet the criteria you are about to lay out for us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What actions did I take?</p>

<p>I informed everyone in my network and family.</p>

<p>I wrote scathing letters to every politician I could think of.</p>

<p>From Bush to Cheney to Rumsfeld on down to Congress.</p>

<p>I read articles and analytic pieces every day for 3 years and passed on the info. I posted my findings on social sites and generally made life very uncomfortable to any one I knew that swallowed the narrative.</p>

<p>In the end, my efforts were just as pathetic as yours though... They changed nothing.</p>

<p>Let me repeat 69% of Americans were war cheerleaders in late 2003. Hard to overcome that when professional propaganda and a complicit media are in play.</p>

<p>I&#39;m truly ashamed of how we reacted as a nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no need for a false flag.  Iran has already stated, that if Israel strikes their nuclear facilities, they will launch strikes upon Israel, as well as US military bases throughout the Middle East.</p>

<p>Israel has this one all locked up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be a nuclear war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most likely yes, along with economic collapse. They don&#39;t need a flase flag to goto war but if they want to draft and have any chance of it succeeding they will need <em>something nasty.</em> I just don&#39;t see young men marching off to war as readily as they did in WW2 in this day and age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah both of those orgs have done some great coverage of OWS. </p>

<p>it&#39;s easy to take RT with a grain of salt when they talk about georgia or chechnya for example, but they&#39;re a great counterpoint to western media. they actually question capitalism, wow!</p>
