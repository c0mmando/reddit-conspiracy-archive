    <div class="md"><p>You want to know the best way of remaining relatively anon on the internets? Buy a cheap laptop off of CL (and not using your home computer or real email addy, duh) and yank out the hard drive. Grab a couple of USB sticks, one containing a copy of Ubuntu Live or other non-BSD linux build such a Knoppix, and another to be used as an encrypted storage container. Boot your OS using the first stick, and store files on the other. Only use publicly accessible wifi hotspots, and run a MAC address spoofer that allows you to change the MAC address of your wireless NIC every time you connect to a wifi hotspot. Don&#39;t use the same hotspot very often. Run TOR and switch identities between every site you visit. Commercial VPN&#39;s are not to be trusted. If you are especially paranoid, you can find more info here: <a href="http://billstclair.com/matrix/">Network Forensics Evasion</a>.</p>

<p>However, unless you are a terrorist or a CP trader, I wouldn&#39;t be overly concerned with such things. Common sense practices are best. Just don&#39;t get yourself involved in any shit that can really get you in trouble, or cause you to become so paranoid that you think the preceding steps are necessary to cover your tracks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple weeks ago some one posted a thread in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> asking about Duck Duck Go...here is what I posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be honest it really doesn&#39;t matter which search engine that you use. All telecommunication traffic (and I do mean all) <strong>can be</strong> subject to capture by governments, the intelligence community, corporations, or even a properly motivated individual regardless of whatever steps you take. At the time of my post there is simply no alternative to this fact. I know it sucks, and I wish things were different but that&#39;s the world we all live in...at least for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Telecoomunication traffic may be <em>monitored</em>, but I doubt that all telecommunication traffic is recorded. That would take crazy resources (they&#39;re apparently building the mother of all data centers in Utah so maybe they can record, but I still doubt it). And even if is was recorded, they&#39;d need filtering logic to make sense of it.</p>

<p>Google records your information and likely has domain-specific ways of filtering it. This makes them way more useful to the state for when the state wants to know everyone about you. So using something like Duck Duck Go makes sense.</p>

<p>If you want to be extra cautious, use Duck Duck Go from Tor or some other anonymizer (realizing that even Tor isn&#39;t a silver bullet: the state likely runs plenty of Tor nodes).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point, I can tell you (since I&#39;m not using my real name) that virtually all telcom traffic is indeed recorded. This is what I do for a living.</p>

<p>Internet traffic (especially overseas traffic) has been being tapped and stored for <em>years</em>. If you research the AT&amp;T Folsom Street Incident this is precisely what they were doing--they were tapping the Internet right at the fiber switch. Years ago.</p>

<p>Telephone traffic is a bit different. AFAIK voice traffic is NOT being recorded (yet--it will be once the new NSA center in Utah is online) but text messages are stored. </p>

<p>This is being done even lower down than the ISP level--this is being done at the <em>backbone</em> level. There is no getting around it.</p>

<p>Use a VPN, encrypt everything.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, came here to say that I like the idea of DDG--it just sucks, unfortunately. I use &quot;darkle&quot;--it&#39;s great on tablets. If you want to search a lot it pretty much doubles my battery life..just like RES &quot;dark mode&quot; does!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, that is precisely what I&#39;m doing also!!</p>

<p>Seems that you know what you are talking about my friend. Only problem with running Ubuntu from a live filesystem stick, of course, is that it is SLOW. I only work from the command line though so it doesn&#39;t bother me.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting that for others though...it is GREAT advice. I owned a pretty large regional ISP and I now do the same thing.</p>

<p>What kind of storage technology is being used for that? I would think that the volume of information would make conventional storage tech impractical. I suppose there may be classified storage tech that trumps what&#39;s available on the market.</p>

<p>YouTube (owned by Google of course) is a complete joke. They won&#39;t take down this famous Muslim-annoying video...but just try to post one video on, say, holocaust revisionism. Your entire account will be suspended within a day for &quot;hate speech&quot; and the video removed.</p>
