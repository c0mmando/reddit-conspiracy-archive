    <div class="md"><p>/rant If the police were after you then they would execute a no knock invasion rather than give you a heads-up by calling you under the guise of being 911 dispatch. /end rant.</p>

<p>Something similar happened to me back in the 90&#39;s. It&#39;s extremely unlikely that the same happened to you but here&#39;s the story:</p>

<p>Middle of a weekday and hanging around the house. Knock at the door. I open it to find Officer Friendly. He says that 911 received a hangup from my address and asked if everything was ok while making unintentionally hilarious gestures. He was trying to communicate to me to give him a sign if I was being held hostage but to verbally tell him that everything was fine. I don&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t write it out on a notepad prior to knocking on my door. Would have made things easier.</p>

<p>I told him that everything really was fine and invited him in to have a look. He declined but chatted me up at the door and we speculated as to why and how the call was made. He radio&#39;d dispatch to triple check phone number and address were a match. Dispatch read the information to him. We had been speculating on the assumption that the house line for family use had hung up on 911. The number that dispatch read was for my second line which was dedicated for dial-up modem internet. I lived in area code 913 at the time. All we could come with was that the modem &quot;stuttered&quot; the 913 from 913-555-5555 to 911-355-5555-5.</p>
