       Credit unions aren't that great because they play with the same dirty monetary system that allowed the pathological banks to prosper the first place. They don't protect against inflation, the FED, or tax havens for example. If the underlying machinery hasn't changed then why on earth should it be different this time. I see credit unions as a form of weak protest rather than a viable solution.

       Yeah, you are certainly correct that the credit unions still operate using the Federal Reserve Note (banks using fiat money via fractional reserve banking), which is probably the primary cause for our fallacious global economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real solution is to stop using FRNs as much as possible. It's not an option as far as I know to conduct transactions at any large corporate chain with an alternative currency(I think that's safe to say)...I'm not even aware of any alternative currency-based loaning services either(could be a cool business model).. But, anyway, seceding your participation from the use of the counterfeit money is the key principal here...
      </p>
      <p>
       So each of us must be "inconvenienced enough" to 1)research and discover the most appropriate alternative currency for any particular situation... 2)invest some effort into manifesting a currency or collaborate with any running in your local area 3)approach local vendors/organizations/talented persons (farmers, restaurants, doctors, alt-energy small companies, tutors/teachers, ect ect) and request that they exchange goods or services with you using said alternative currency... and 4)Make such arrangements for as much of the necessity goods or services in your life (housing and energy are very difficult)
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that fundamentally disassociating ourselves from the fallacious FRN is the biggest step in superseding the Establishment Status-Quo.

       find themselves out of monetary influence due to people going to smaller, more independent business. That isn't how the system they've created works.

       This is the conclusion I came to, actually because of Alex Jones.  The fact that he screams against the bankers and the immorality inherent in the system, while at the same time constantly screaming for more green paper to grow his operation, seemed inherently contradictory.  The system that currently exists is one in which the controllers of the fiat cash basically own everything that is being bartered with cash, no matter how much you scream about the bankers.
      </p>

       However, an outward revolution won't solve anything.  It'd end up being just another group to begin the cycle of oppression over again, UNLESS individuals en masse start having their own internal mental and spiritual (moral, whatever) revolutions so that we may begin to cooperate instead of compete for scraps.

       Violence isn't the answer. Look at what specific goods are most necessary to your survival and attempt to acquire those using alternative means of exchange from localized sources... The 7-11's business model is not sustainable and will collapse with the rest of the Status-Quo, eventually. A fallacious existence can't be papered over forever, so just do what you feel is holistically good (mutually beneficial, voluntary exchanges), relish your successes in an open-source manner so that others can emulate where you have made achievements, and be prepared when the unsustainable Establishment collapses under the weight of its own bullshit.

       Violence is generally not the answer. The above was said in jest, obviously. However, it is important not to take any tools off the table, particularly when the term "violence" has not been defined.

       My apologies for misunderstanding your comment. I believe that self-defense is not an act of the initiation of force, and therefore that situation of "violence" is justifiable. I don't believe that the destruction of property(regardless of the entity) is a viable solution because it is not long-term in the slightest... As I mentioned before, a long term solution would be to form an alternative business model that doesn't support the general Establishment's economy... not even mentioning here the question of what medium of exchange would be used to truely be anti-establishment-- it's probably not the place for that conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand however, that one(nonpropertarian-anarchist?notsure) could define the very business model of some Status-Quo Establishment operation to be "violent"(or I have at-least heard that before). I don't necessarily subscribe to that definition of violence/aggression, but I can sympathize with its lament of the fallacious business model. (note:i'm not suggesting at all that you subscribe to that definition either)

       We could play the "this ideology would say/do this" game all day...
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill play though..Depending on the level of destruction..I suppose I would say that it would still be ultimately counterproductive. Perhaps the destruction would hasten a systemic collapse because it would require capital to be both reallocated and created(out of thin air)- which could (if large enough) cause some inflation and thus social unrest... But a Keynesian would just say that the destruction would stimulate the economy,  because new capital would just replace the broken stuff...(I can't stand keynesians) So I guess it just depends-- that would take a shit-load of destruction IMO... NOTE: I'm not advocating the destruction of property.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best option in my opinion would be putting the cartel out of business by peacefully using voluntary arrangements to make the business model obsolete, eliminating those aspects of contradiction in the new formation/association.

       you're making the same faulty assumptions that lead me to post that in the first place. my point was that many of us don't think in capitalist terms like inflation or business model.

      <p>
       i.e. to say that a post-capitalist proposal is wrong because it does not include a new business model is judging the new system by the rules of the old failed system.

       Personally, I've focused on alternative currency, because I feel that the FRN(really any fiat money from centralized, fractional reserve banking) has been the primary means of controlling and manipulating the livelihoods of economic participants. We could look at virtually any aspect of the economy; however, following the money, and bare witness to any number of contradictions and aspects of malinvestment that just continue to be papered over with this counterfeit money.

       Force doesn't necessarily mean violence. Redesigning the tools and environment at hand are the only proven methods of altering behaviour. Hoping people can "just do the right thing" hasn't been the most successful strategies. A simple example would be some one who wants to learn French. Moving to France would make the new language acquisition unescapable rather than relying on whimsical self discipline. The problem remains bridging self discipline to something infectious that can lead to change, so frameworks have to be created where doing the "right" thing is easier that the "wrong". The current ideological battle is largely lost and perhaps something un-winnable through "preaching" alone, especially when its a fight at every new generation. The current state is that the majority just don't care, so who do we amplify the minority into a critical mass that drives the herd away from the cliff?

       Initially the complaint was "convincing most people". If you can't convince then the only solutions is to not try, but if the goal is important enough then force seems the only viable option.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer the new question: because if you haven't got some other utility that produces the same function in uncorrupted form, you are doomed to get another machine of a similar nature. I think it follows from this logic that "they" could throw a wrench into your machine, so you end up in an arms race of sorts. I think the only solution would have the quality of being forcibly constructive making change inevitable. Wrenches usually lead to panic, and we've seen what the shock doctrine can achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the machine is profit driven though, at least not entirely, because so many things are ideological. If you go back to read Rockefeller's memo 200 he's on about population control. Then if we look to Zionism so much "profit" is wasted to meet some other end. It makes sense that profit is a behavioural determinant, but it would only be part of the picture. If anything the economic system is theft driven, so perhaps attack that problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only solution I can come to is a monetary system where each unit is a record of the debtor/creditor relationship, any two identities can create currency, all transactions are public record, all accounts are public, and bankruptcy is allowed in some degree (or at least there is some graceful failure). Currency becomes an un-tradable social contract and the purest of fiat systems. Risk should also be proportionate to account balance to prevent hoarding. The ideal is a zero state where you average little owed and little credited. If the system can be designed such that taxation is made impossible as well that might be a good thing.

       To do this you look to where the most direct profit comes from for that business and attack there. Then you have to wait them out. Most people are not willing to do this save for exceptional reasons ala civil rights etc. Even then, the amount of organizing required is beyond liking on Facebook so outside of the those in the OWS movement,what do you propose?

       OR, start incorporating the extrinsic costs of Chinese labor (ala pollution and human rights abuses) via taxes so that no one cheats by exploiting workers or lax environmental regulations. One reason the labor is so cheap is due to 1920's America factory conditions (on steroids).

       I do agree that it is virtually impossible to "shop" exclusively locally. There are not many examples of communities that highly value the concept of circulating capital more locally. I think Asheville, NC is a good example of a community that holds to that philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For most communities, without having a completely different lifestyle than the mainstream consumerist culture would entail, this does seem like an impossibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a couple suggestions/insights that I hope you'll lend an ear to... 
Firstly, the economic foundation is crumbling, as virtually every aspect of the economy is based on debt-based, fiat money, and a reliance on non-renewable resources. Although these huge companies are more efficient than local organizations currently, due to the benefit of economies of scale, their overall business models are not viable in the long-run. 
Secondly, it is very important that each of us attempt to acquire as many necessity items as possible via alternative means than the mainstream options. If each of us can utilize his or her own unique interests and talents, than a culture of "mutual-aid" and resiliency can arise to hopefully make the collapse of the Establishment paradigm irrelevant. Alternative currencies are trending upwards at a fantastic speed, and historically, they have shown to be used to sustain a population's ability to transact voluntarily, when the fiat currency fails. Using alternative means of exchange, ones ability to get necessity items (sans housing and energy-- that's really tough) outside of the current economic paradigm is becoming more and more possible. I believe this is out of a perhaps subconscious awareness that the current Establishment economic is very susceptible to collapse, as its volatility is becoming ever more present.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize this is not some universal, pinpointed solution to the overall problem of a holistically unsustainable economy... I think this is my point; however. For too long, "civilization" has attempted to separate the particulars from the universals, socially engineering the populace to be most susceptible to the suggestions of "leaders" or the marketing of companies... The particulars cannot be separated from the universals. I believe that if each one of us could learn about and follow certain principals, such as: non-aggression, voluntary interaction, and non-violent communication communication, for example, then the particulars of any given community can form organically in the most holistically sustainable ways, without contradiction.
      </p>

       greed is in large part responsible.  i try to go to true value stores, but it is getting out of hand.  for example my cousin bought a toliet mounting kit 2x(bolts, nuts, washers) and it was more than $4.  i understand that they need to make more money in order to keep good employees and stuff, but they make it very hard.  when you go in and see that the markup on known goods is 4x (like batteries, screwdrivers (from china i might add)...) it leaves a very sour taste in your mouth.

       Thanks for posting this. That community is growing and it's wonderful to see. This may be a discussion for another time, but it seems as though people using alternative markets and media of exchange to conduct transactions will arise out of necessity before too long. An example of this already happening comes from

       I've mentioned this before, but I believe that if something is contradictory or, via empirical evidence can be proven to be holistically negative over time, then we should secede our association with that entity and create an arrangement or organization that has no contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The philosophy is simple, here. Don't support what is bad, and use your unique knowledge and talents to create something better. This is similar to the concept of "dual power"... However, I'm not really interested in overthrowing the establishment. I'm interested in setting up resilient communities so that WHEN the establishment collapses under its own weight of bullshit, then people will be able to sustain themselves and create a more voluntary society.
      </p>
      <p>
       A
       <em>
        singular
       </em>
       fallacious arrangement cant last forever, because that "malinvestment" will crash eventually. What will take its place? Hopefully the diverse, mutually beneficial, voluntary transactions that each one of us conduct will arise organically within communities, spreading risk around and espousing a culture of healthy cooperation and competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may be a good place to discuss some specifics if you like...

We would have to stop shopping where we're shopping.  We would have to change around a lot of things we've grown comfortable with.

      <p>
       Na.  We're willing to "fight the power" so long as we don't actually have to change anything in order to do it.

       I agree with this insight. It is very difficult to operate outside of the watchful eye of the controlling Establishment. I attempt to advocate a general nullification of the contradictory system by attempting to use alternative currencies or media of exchange to acquire as many necessity items.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly agree that rallying around this cause is virtually pointless on a large scale because people will not stand to be inconvenienced, generally. However, I think that at a localized level, alternative means of transacting with others, perhaps in "gray" or anti-establishment markets, will arise out of necessity when enough people feel the weight of the bullshit from our economy pressing on them. We see Greece doing this ever-more-so because of their collapsing system. I'm sure there are many other examples...
      </p>
      <p>
       So generally, it is very important that those of us who do give enough of a shit actively try to make our communities more resilient. I do as much as I can, but I still have regrettably been unsuccessful, aside from influencing 10-15 families that I know personally... Overall, my town is still utterly un-resilient... But, perhaps when things get bad enough my work and the work of others will gain traction.

       Yep.  They make their enslavement paradoxically enticing to many by making it (seemingly) easier and "better" for you to "go along" with the system - go along with all its conveniences, and color TVs and entertainment and media and glitz and glamor - so long as you are willing to give up your freedoms at the hands of a covert few controlling everything.

       Have you had much success in that manner?  I think this could be very promising to many if you found a certain level of practical use out of working with alternative currencies.  It could be a methodology that others might be able to follow and use as well.

       I agree.  I admit that I'm not really too aware of many such anti-establishment or "gray" markets.  Are you?  People have indeed grown their own food, etc, but I wonder if there are areas that people can go to generally where can barter or get goods and services without going through the "establishment" route.

       I see.  I guess here in America, things are not there yet because of 1) the obstinate stupidity of the masses, and 2) the persistence of the establishment here to continue bullying other countries while simultaneously lying to its complicit and complacent population.

       Perhaps this is not a horrible suggestion initially.  I think this should occur, but when the community gets enough numbers and strength, it should no longer stay silent.  It would seem silence will allow TPTB to continue their nefarious ways.  Their power should be actively and directly (but not
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       violently) fought against and resisted.  While it is true that the more open you are about it, the more opportunities this gives the establishment to devise ways to stop you, it is also true that the more open you are about it, the more of an opportunity it might give you to gather other people on your side that would have otherwise been ignorant of the reistance.

       the only people getting rich were the ones that took the risk and dove in; anyone could have done it, for very little money (at first) but it was still a risk and is getting riskier by the day, for example BFL orders.

       Like the historical gold rush, the early adapters did get rich, yes. Bitcoin is modeled, to some extent, after gold. The more Bitcoins get mined the harder it in to mine Bitcoins. Like gold you can hide it from the government, which is very useful.

       speculators add liquidity to the market, which is a very good and important thing.  you are correct that they also cause fluctuations, but many people that deal with bitcoin are holding it since for the most part it is deflationary, and ultimately will be strictly deflationary.

       What about a cooperative community farm? Where the farm will produce much of its own food, and sell the excises for profit to benefit the community. Amish life style but with out the religion.

       "Buy local" is better than nothing, but the problem is you are still using 'their' currency.  You/we give the bankers power by giving their money value.  Money they can give themselves for free or near free.  That is massive power to control other humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately even shopping local means you have to pay taxes to pay off the government "debt" = the money goes back to the bankers, who "loaned" the government their funny money.  It's an outrageous scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real solution to "go local" is to use local currencies.  Every town, city, state, country should have their own currency, to keep local economies strong and independent from global control.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, not only is this illegal, but incredibly hard to do.  There is a reason that Federal Reserve Notes are the only legal tender in America, there is a reason the media is awash in propaganda urging you to crave their money, and there is a reason the education system hides the history of money and pounds in the belief to never doubt it.  Try questioning people's faith in money sometime.  It is the rock-solid foundation of the pyramidal control structure.
      </p>

       actually just deny everyone money.  Money is WORTHLESS. It is paper.  It has no actual value, you can't eat it for nutrition, can't use it as fuel, can't water plants or build things out of it.  It is a complete scam benefitting the rich.  Look up the documentary "Collapse," a beautiful talk about how money works is in there.  But if you can't heres a paraphrase-
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is created in debt.  Interest creates money out of thin air.  That money was never there and now it must be to pay off the debt.  So your credit cards and mortgages, etc, create more money.  We must live in debt to sustain the system of perpetual growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perpetual growth- as long as the system grows, its ok.  More debt, more interest, more money that can be returned the top of the system.  Debts must be paid in order to keep the system just above crashing.  Take the money out, and the whole thing collapses (hint: you have the power to not pay your debts, assisting in the crash of the system).
      </p>
      <p>
       Perpetual growth cannot last forever in a world of finite energy and finite resources.  So stop letting them lie to you, it can never happen, because man cannot overturn the physical laws that govern our universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the pyramid scheme of Bernie Madoff, then look at the way money
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       flows in the world.  The entire fucking economy is a pyramid scheme. But the whole thing can be brought down by the bottom, because we are the ones who feed it.  It would take roughly 30% of people to stop paying their debts and the system would go through radical change that legislation, governments, nothing could stop.

       Unified, co-operative communities may provide a starting point. As with all things, there needs to be a person/group that instigates the change they envision. I believe the linked video enforces this, is relevant and inspires change.

       as i see it the only "local" places to shop would be those that are offering something that others will not.  an example of it done right: we have a really good kitchen store in the mall here that i get a ton of stuff from, and many times it is cheaper than amazon even after tax, and a lot of it isn't made in china (some isn't made in the us either, but typically is made in countries with fair labor practices, which might make it better than the US if you are working for humanity and not for a specific country).  we also have farm stores that offer many products at very fair prices, and the workers there are very helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       i would really like to find stores that sell:
      </p>
      <p>
       good tools, that will last a lifetime, i'd like wood working and other hand tools that are made by a human, as well as brands like stihl or whoever hasn't sold their soul, and companies that you can actually get parts for their tools without price gouging (fuck sears for this).
      </p>
      <p>
       shaving shop / knife shop that carries good brands.  the markup on these things is huge, and they could make a killing, too bad clothing from impoverished areas selling for $80/piece has driven commercial rent up.
      </p>
      <p>
       old radioshack style businesses.  when ever i have to fix anything i always have to order the part or go to RS and pay at least a 10x markup to a store that now specializes in playing agent to the cell phone companies.  i would like a combo of monoprice mixed in with digikey, with some arduino and radio specialty stuff as well.  monoprice is making a ton of money selling cables for less than 25% what any local or B&amp;M sells them for, why couldn't someone do this locally? monoprice even offers bulk rates, i'm sure they would love some local sellers.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm sure there are others that i am forgetting, like toy stores that no longer exist, but i think that one of the key things that any of these businesses have to remember is that people will come to your store because you are local, but don't fuck them over (tube cutter from china is $2.50 and EXACT same design from US is $8.50 (in same big box store) doesn't make me want to buy american, especially since it is a simple mold with screw and a carbide wheel that doesn't cost very much to produce even if you are paying your workers $100k).

       First off, buying locally, or buying from someone in California isn't the problem.  You can buy 'small' over the internet, and still avoid giving money to companies you don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bigger problem, however, is once you get to any sort of main stream civilization device, TV's, cars, computers, etc.  You're not buying small.  Even if you buy from a local store, it's still a product from a chain, from a corp.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if you get the chance, yes.  Buying small is ideal, local is better, but not sustainable for a well rounded life.

       You could, but most people are much more content to enjoy the fruits of the company's labor, and then ask the government to point guns at the company and steal their property so that they can have more free goodies.

       i've long said if you want to collapse the power structure, just sit in your home and only support local goods. if everyone did this for a week, which would also involve not purchasing gas, it would be a global catastrophe. that being said, probably not going to happen in a unified manner. the best we can all do is live the change we want to see, and influence others by example of a better lifestyle.
      </p>

       i gave up my car, i don't shop at walmart or target, all of my clothes are either made in my neighborhood or 2nd hand, all of my food is either from restaurants that are local sustainable organic or from local farmers i know.. i live cheaper than i used to, and my friends have seen it, it's had an impact on them. they are curious about organic food, i take them to the farmers market, show them how to talk to farmers about food, we buy food that is local organic, no GMO, and i cook a meal. i show them the benefits of this personally, and they taste it and a light switch goes off.

       Yep.  They make their enslavement paradoxically enticing to many by making it (seemingly) easier and "better" for you to "go along" with the system - go along with all its conveniences, and color TVs and entertainment and media and glitz and glamor - so long as you are willing to give up your freedoms at the hands of a covert few controlling everything.

      <p>
       Have you had much success in that manner?  I think this could be very promising to many if you found a certain level of practical use out of working with alternative currencies.  It could be a methodology that others might be able to follow and use as well.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree.  I admit that I'm not really too aware of many such anti-establishment or "gray" markets.  Are you?  People have indeed grown their own food, etc, but I wonder if there are areas that people can go to generally where can barter or get goods and services without going through the "establishment" route.

      <p>
       Perhaps this is not a horrible suggestion initially.  I think this should occur, but when the community gets enough numbers and strength, it should no longer stay silent.  It would seem silence will allow TPTB to continue their nefarious ways.  Their power should be actively and directly (but not

       violently) fought against and resisted.  While it is true that the more open you are about it, the more opportunities this gives the establishment to devise ways to stop you, it is also true that the more open you are about it, the more of an opportunity it might give you to gather other people on your side that would have otherwise been ignorant of the reistance.
