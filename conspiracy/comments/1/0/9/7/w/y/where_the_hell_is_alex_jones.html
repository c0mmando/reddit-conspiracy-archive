<p>Edit-A question to you people. I see lots of people pointing out this guys faults, which like all of us are many. You people with the redditor douche attitudes that probably spend most of your time getting off to your witty remarks in r/politics, what have you people done for the cause? Who do you know that is reaching more people? How many people have you woken up? What have you accomplished in your lives? The fact of the matter is that most of you have fallen into society&#39;s trap. You focus on what makes us different as opposed to what makes us alike. This guy is a man who is stuck in this hell hole like the rest of us, through all his faults (which are many), who in here can say that they are waking more people up? Contributing more to the cause? It&#39;s easy to bad mouth people when you are some pussy behind a computer screen, but what are you doing in real life? Who is going to miss you when you die? What effect are you making in the world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His Zionist master has probably still got him standing in the corner after the interview with Dr. Pieczenik Last week.</p>

<p>Alex couldn&#39;t talk over him enough, and Dr. P let it be known that Israel is responsible for 9/11.  And when this guy speaks, people listen.  Tha is why Jones cancelled this weeks interview with him, and that is why he isn&#39;t on the air today, he knows people will question why Dr. P isn&#39;t allowed on any longer.</p>

<p>Kosher Jones is a Zionist shill.   There are plenty of other unbiased sources, that do a much better job getting this type of information across.</p>

<p>As far as 9/11 and the ME quagmire, <a href="http://www.rys2sense.com">www.rys2sense.com</a> and <a href="http://www.warbydeception.com">www.warbydeception.com</a> are definitive, though if you still haven&#39;t &quot;woken up&quot; as Kosher Jones would say, you may find some of the content &quot;offensive&quot;.</p>

<p>That said, Jones doesn&#39;t actually wake anyone up, he just sings them a different lullaby.  If you are unable to accept that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Israeli Mossad, you may want to stick with Jonestown. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree but being that the myth for Israeli nationalism is Zionism (pursuit of the holy land not &quot;The Articles&quot; mind you), I&#39;m not surprised about the conflagration and bigotry- I don&#39;t condone it, but it&#39;s a two way street in my opinion. the Israeli government is using the national religion as a nationalism tool to justify all sorts of heinous crimes- if the world conflagrates that bigotry with the separate, actual religion- hell most of the western world is doing that with Islam. It really becomes a difficult problem to understand what people are saying, and what people mean. Also a difficult problem to understand who an enemy is and what&#39;s a malicious tactic. I&#39;m not defending bigotry, I&#39;m only trying to point out how all leaders today are using all religion as a world-wide rallying call which makes it a more complicated murky topic- for that very reason.</p>

<p>What I mean by &quot;not real&quot; is he isn&#39;t telling us anything real, because if he <em>did</em> have an inside line on this info, he would be dead by now. No government, IDC how peaceful it is, would have him executed by now.</p>

<p>Not so true. Much easier to <em>discredit</em> or make him seem nuts. They would only kill him if more people would be apt to believe him. The day you see Alex Jones giving speeches in front of thousands, like MLK Jr did, that&#39;s the day his assassination is put in motion. As long as he&#39;s limited to the internet and radio he&#39;s not a threat. </p>
