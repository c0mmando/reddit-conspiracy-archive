What are your thoughts on having the mods volunteer steeping down? What are your thoughts on the clusterfuck that is r/conspiracy?

<p>As near as I can gather from today&#39;s activity alone....</p>

<p>The last few days have been quite tumultuous here, it seems. Most of it appears to be due to some of the current and former mods. I suspect that much of it is trollery. Sadly, however, it appears that some of that trollery has been done by current moderators. This doesn&#39;t speak well of this subreddit.</p>

<p>So, your suggestion of having the mods volunteer to step down makes a little bit of sense. The problem, though, is that some of them wouldn&#39;t. And the ones that did step down would be surrendering control of the subreddit to those who didn&#39;t step down.</p>

<p>I can only assume that illuminatedwax isn&#39;t displeased with any of it or he would have intervened by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take a stab at your questions.  <strong>Note:</strong> I am only speaking for myself and these are just opinions.  I hope you find at least some of it useful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why the fuck are there even moderators on a site that was designed to have the users generate and moderate their own content (unless in cases of obvious and extreme abuse)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been using the Internet for 15 years now and there are always people that have the keys to the kingdom (or at least some keys).  The vast majority of websites do not run themselves despite attempts at automation.  Websites as large as Reddit simply don&#39;t function without admins, mods, etc performing various tasks.  We don&#39;t live in a perfect world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts on having the mods volunteer steeping down?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t really care if they stay or go.  I come here because I enjoy looking through the links and comments that are posted.  I am an adult and thus capable of ignoring or not participating in things I feel are propaganda, disinfo, cointelpro, marketing campaigns, or just undesirable in general.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts on the clusterfuck that is r/conspiracy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t feel <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a clusterfuck.  Nearly everything in life has ups and downs.  Perhaps you and others like you are experiencing a temporary down moment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can we better discuss and share alternative ideas and media without all the BS that is going down?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit is not the only website on the Internet.  A few minutes spent at your favorite search engine looking for conspiracy topics that interest you will yield a plethora publicly available websites, discussion groups, IRC channels, forums, etc.  Another option you might consider is exploring the deep web and privately run communities.  If those options don&#39;t work out then start your own website and manage it the way you feel is best.</p>

In one of those videos, he tells how the FBI arrested him at gunpoint -- in the shower. Then, they asked him to tell them about any crimes he knew of, so he ratted out Bush and Cheney. LOL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a debunker troll, though. I am only asking the questions a lot of people don&#39;t wanna answer. And you know why they don&#39;t?? Because it blows their theory to shit. As well it should because any theory that is well thought out and possibly true has hard evidence to back it up. 9/11 sounds like OpNorthWoods so sure, it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>When someone hangs on every word AJ says, I ask the same question: Why haven&#39;t the Federales whacked him out? Why just arrest him (Binney) in the shower? Why not trump him up on some false charges, you know, like they did to James Holmes because his father was gonna testify in the LIBOR case <strong>that was never gonna happen in the U.S., ever, and no one is able to produce a witness list for a European inquiry.</strong> </p>

<p>I do it because someone needs to keep this subreddit subjective and relevant. Because before you know it, r/conspiritard trolls will be all over us again like Ethiopians on a cheeseburger. Remember that? This place fuckin <strong>blew</strong> at that time because of it.</p>

<p>But, the speed with which you responded after I provided you that list of about 10 links indicates that you didn&#39;t look into any of it before firing off another debunker question. This makes you, at least in appearances, a troll. You could have at least watched one of the short videos and then asked a real question. Instead you chose the short, fast, fire-back-another-quick-question route so commonly associated with debunker trolls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because I didn&#39;t have enough time to watch videos doesn&#39;t make me a troll. Just because I can skim an article enough to ask a question doesn&#39;t mean I am a troll. I will have you know I have been reading about him in another tab on my computer, while I interact with others here, and I still gotta ask the first question again: Why?</p>

<p>I know you don&#39;t have an answer. I also know that you (and others) usually call the person a troll when you don&#39;t have those answers. It&#39;s easier than admitting that maybe you were wrong about something. This is the problem in this subreddit. We are losing objectivity by the buckets when we automatically call someone a troll for asking the hard questions.</p>
