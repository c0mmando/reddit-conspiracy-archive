Are you asking:

2) Which conspiracy is a sensible course of action for the conspirators?
3) Which version of events is actually true?
I doubt it on this occasion due to your account activity, but a shill would ask this kind of question to broadly start <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">NLP</a> on the community, so be careful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very rough sketch of ideas that I&#39;ve been kicking around. The idea is that education is intentionally tiered and that your level of education and enlightenment to how the world works directly affects your level of success. By that I mean that there is a steep scale of education quality and the amount of people in the world who have access to each level of education is roughly controlled through a mostly self-perpetuating system of ignorance, over-consumption, and false illusions of power and happiness. </p>

<p>Level 1- The people in third world type areas(I say &quot;areas&quot; because the conditions have overlap with some first world countries) whose education mostly consists of how to farm or do manual labor in a factory. These are the people who make your electronics, clothing, etc. There is a strong pride in the value of work and religion in these areas. people who aspire to more are usually looked down upon. These places have(or had) natural resources that needed to be exploited. As the amount of resources decline, the area transitions to level 2. Both level 1 and 2 are where wars take place.</p>

<p>Level 2- This is your standard grade school level of education in third world areas. It may extend as far as college but the attrition rate is severe due to poverty. The main function of this level of education is to keep some semblance of hope among the young worker class and to select and export any exceptional talent. These areas consume a lot of Western media which creates in them a cultural envy and desire for material goods. This and the lack of local higher education institutions ensures that most of the useful talent of the area will be exported.</p>

<p>Level 3-First world lower class. An example of this are the poorest school districts in the US, where the standards are very low and don&#39;t usually prepare the students to succeed in higher education or in life. Most from this tier will go into manual labor or crime. This class of people, through the media and pop culture, are given an anti-education and pro-drug use message. The pop culture also instills an intense desire for material possessions with no real value which are usually just barely out of financial reach. Obtaining the right material possessions will give the individuals of this class a temporary satisfaction with their life and a slightly higher status among their peers which creates a false sense of power. This media-taught desire for material goods replaces crucial common sense financial education. </p>

<p>Level 4- Lower middle class. About half will go to college but most of this half will go to low ranking colleges that don&#39;t leave them with the connections or the knowledge to build successful careers. This is the group that more than any other buys into the degree=success formula and they spend their time at college drowning themselves in drugs(think party atmosphere) and debt. They graduate but quickly find that doing the bare minimum at State University isn&#39;t good enough. This post-graduate debt ensures that their future actions will be focused on making money for at least the next decade. This money-obsession period has strong overlap with the culture-promoted child rearing period which builds further money obsession. There is still a high level of preoccupation with material possessions with this group, mostly in the form of entertainment.</p>

<p>Level 5- Higher income areas. These are the people who come from enough money to feel financially secure. Sons and daughters of doctors, investment bankers, etc. In their culture, going to college is expected. A higher proportion of these people will go to prestigious universities but their focus is still on the &quot;get a good job&quot; mentality which smoothly transitions into a lifetime of work-obsession and over-consumption. They make a lot of money but still tightly fit into the existing institutions. This class also serves the important purpose of the model of success for the lower classes. That level 4 kid is putting himself two hundred grand in debt because his culture told him that lawyers make a lot of money and therefore must be very happy.</p>

<p>Level 6- These are the people who were taught how the world works at a young age. The &quot;at a young age&quot; part is very important because a lot of people figure things out later on but they&#39;re already stuck on the hamster wheel. This class has financial security, not only in the form of inherited wealth but also in the knowledge of how to obtain and build wealth. Many choose to coast off the inherited wealth but those who make the choice can inherit power. </p>

<p>A few clarifications-</p>

<p>Education does not only mean what school you went to and what you were taught there. Education encompasses everything that you have ever learned in your life. When a poor kid in the ghetto sees his mother stick a needle in her arm, that&#39;s education. When a kid goes to visit his family&#39;s company and sees how many people his father controls, that&#39;s education. Your education early in life not only affects your intelligence, but it affects your goals and expectations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was more talking in the sense I don&#39;t think that conspiracy is a driving force of history, and most of those events strike me as just Business As Usual (well tbh I haven&#39;t heard of BCCI or the last two).</p>

<p>Anyway, in the last 40 years you mentioned 5, vs all the many theories and the general fact that with the possible exception of Iran-Contra none of those events really were pivotal in a historical sense. Of course by the time I was alive the notion that the government sold arms to regimes it claims to disapprove of in order to fund right-wing terrorists had become the kind of fact everyone takes for granted.</p>

<p>So how do you explain the existence of organized crime?</p>

<p>The behaviour of Roman emperors pose a fine example which shows the sociopathic character of past leaders. Most of those emperors who were not murdered in conspiracies used their power-network to act ruthlessly against everybody who could pose a thread to their power. </p>

<p>Often these ruthless men even killed lots of members of their own families.</p>

<p>About halve of the emperors were murdered in conspiracies and Machiavellian power-grabs.

    <div class="md"><p>I think organised crime is what it says it is, business, that it happens to be illegal is immaterial really since it&#39;s about a risk benefit calculation. People do in business many things they wouldn&#39;t do to their friends or family not out of evil but just because the business logic of making money tends to make people blind to other considerations, and everyone&#39;s gotta pay their mortgage...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people have empathy and are unwilling to step over dead bodies, because they seek power for powers sake. But some people have such a great lust for money and power, that it makes them blind to the suffering and death they cause to other people.</p>

<p>Criminals who were responsible for organisations like murder incorporated, the Mexican drug cartels, the Russian Mafia or the Sicillian Mafia never stopped with their crimes when they have enough money to pay their morgages and provide for their families, and the same is true for many leaders in politics and the business world. </p>

<p>If the exploitation of a group of people can be done in the open like slavery in the past or the opium trade of the British Empire, sociopathic people are willing to do so. But if the shady aspects of their business model would bring negative consequences they are also willing to conspire to hide their deeds. </p>

<p>Big tobacco knew what it was doing when it tried to hide and discredit information about the health risks of smoking. The Phoebus cartel knew, that the public wouldn&#39;t accept their business model and most leaders who are willing to use propaganda lies, death squads and torture against the people organise the vilest elements of the hidden state in secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not as warm as it is Herzliya, Israel now. Remember Stalin&#39;s Jews?</p>

<p>We mustn&#39;t forget that some of greatest murderers of modern times were Jewish. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a particularly forlorn historical date: Almost 90 years ago, between the 19th and 20th of December 1917, in the midst of the Bolshevik revolution and civil war, Lenin signed a decree calling for the establishment of The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, also known as Cheka. </p>

<p>Within a short period of time, Cheka became the largest and cruelest state security organization. Its organizational structure was changed every few years, as were its names: From Cheka to GPU, later to NKVD, and later to KGB. </p>

<p>We cannot know with certainty the number of deaths Cheka was responsible for in its various manifestations, but the number is surely at least 20 million, including victims of the forced collectivization, the hunger, large purges, expulsions, banishments, executions, and mass death at Gulags. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how that pertains to the conversation but anyway I am opposed to the state of Israel, I believe in a one state solution in which the population all have equal rights and the government is similar to that of Lebanon in the sense all local religious communities must have significant positions in the government, I am really not sure what should be done with the Israeli&#39;s, they don&#39;t belong there but most of them are no longer first generation and it becomes messy to move people after that point.</p>

<p>For instance the fact that it takes more Zyclon B to kill parasites than to kill a human due to insect physiology being very different to ours, but he uses a comparison between the two chambers and the higher presence of cyanide in the delousing one to the trace levels in the other one as evidence it couldn&#39;t be a gas chamber, even though the other one had been exposed more to the elements and the presence of any cyanide at all is if anything a confirmation of the gas chamber thesis.</p>

Alex Jones is controlled opposition, spreading the news that those who make the news want him to, just like Fox/CNN/Etc.

Is something the most logical explanation? Can a jet bring down a building by hitting it at the top? Could there be sick fucks who get off to getting what they want no matter the cost to other people? Do these questions all have the same answer?
Conspiracies I could reasonably see happening: Onassis and Johnson worked for the same people, WWI wasn&#39;t really started by Panslavic bullshit, The Reichstag was a false-flag pretext for WWII funded on both sides by the same banking cartels, 9/11 was just another pretext, Paul is dead, MK Ultra was or still is a research project that may or may not have succeeded, Mystery Schools still exist, and groups of people with similar goals (and lack of scruples) who have plans for this world and how they want to inhabit it and what the rules should be exist as well. And they won&#39;t let me in on their plans, though this could be said for any business, large or small. It&#39;s not my business, it&#39;s their business.
This is all a circle jerk because if any of it is real, I can&#39;t do shit about it anyway. Ever hear of Finger of God technology? Y&#39;know, chemical lasers on a satellite? I got nothin&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking for the source which got me questioning the Holocaust but can&#39;t find it.  Hopefully ttttottt can.  However, what made me doubt the lucidity of the Holocaust was the population survey of Jews conducted before the Holocaust and after the Holocaust.  Before WWII around 1935, the poll showed there were around 15 million Jews worldwide.  After WWII around 1950, the poll showed there were around 15 million Jews!  If 6 million died, shouldn&#39;t there be significantly less Jews?  I do believe in the Holocaust though, I just believe that only roughly around 250,000 Jews actually died instead of this grossly exaggerated six million.  I could be wrong though.  But I don&#39;t think I am.  </p>
