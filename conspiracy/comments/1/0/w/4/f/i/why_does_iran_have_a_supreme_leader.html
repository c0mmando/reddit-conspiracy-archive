       No; a republic is government operating within a framework of law (in this case Islamic law). A democracy is what Iran is not, yet wants to appear as; sound familiar?

       He is actually head of a panel of clerics who wield quite a bit of power in their own right, and can remove him should he stray from the path of Islam and the good of Iran. Not unlike a king and his barons, or a president and his super-committee; except for being far more tightly bound by religious law.

       Because you searched for supreme leader. But a search for guardian council indicates they are in-fact appointed by the supreme leader, and he doesn't appear to be subject to them. So... yeah; you're right, he's a tyrant.

       The Assembly of Experts[1] (also Assembly of Experts of the Leadership) of Iran (Persian: مجلس خبرگان رهبری, Majles-e Khobregan or Majles-e Khebregan-e Rahbari‎), also translated as Council of Experts, is a deliberative body of 86 Mujtahids (Islamic scholars) that is charged with electing and removing the Supreme Leader of Iran and supervising his activities. Members of the assembly are elected from list of candidates by direct public vote to eight-year terms

       Perhaps because the average Iranian has experienced significant improvements in living standards despite the BULLSHIT you're led to believe. And the "most hated" country has been supported by the vast majority of the nations of the world repeatedly, just recently again by the Non-Aligned Movement which strongly backed Iran's nuclear rights -- again.

       Actually, Iran's nuclear program started under the Shah, with the encouragement and support of the US, because Iran needs nuclear power.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the cancer patients -- the rely on medical isotopes that are made in a research reactor that the US gave to Iran back in the 1960s. This reactor runs on fuel that is made from 20% enriched uranium. The US has since prevented Iran from buying the fuel for the reactor -- even though the reactor in question is far too small to make nukes and is constantly monitored by the IAEA anyway. So, Iran had to start enriching Uranium to 20%, to make those isotopes. In fact, rather than making nukes, Iran has started converting that stockpile of 20% enriched uranium into fuel plates, thus making it impossible for the material to be used for nukes. In fact the world -- including the US-- just experienced a shortage of medical isotopes too. If you'd like to actually LEARN something instead of tossing out these idiotic-sounding snarky comments which make you sound like a fool, I suggest reading something like this:

       Well, Iran should not have to make a choice between "buying food" or treating cancer patients, should it? Had you read the article I mentioned, you'd see that there is a good reason why Iran makes its own isotopes. As is its legal right to do so.

       You may not care about Iran's legal rights but the government of Iran is obligated to care about it. And now you're jumping to another point: the so called offer of Russian nuclear fuel to Iran -- which as a precondition, required Iran to give up her right to make her own fuel. It is quite funny, that, considering that just months before Vice President Cheney accused the Russians of exercising "energy blackmail" and yet here is Iran expected to rely solely on foreign sources to power its economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, would the US agree to stop exploiting its own oil in places like Alaska and the GUlf of Mexico and instead agree to solely import oil from OPEC, and only as much as OPEC says that the US needs, and at prices that OPEC only sets?
      </p>
      <p>
       OH BTW did you bother reading the article you've linkd to? Because it doesn't support your point at all, so I'm curious why cited it, especially when it says:
      </p>
      <p>
       "While expressing "serious concern" over continued Iranian uranium enrichment in defiance of the UN Security Council, the six nations say they back the "inalienable right" of countries that have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
       <strong>
        That is a bow to arguments by Iran, an NPT signatory, that it has a right to enrich uranium.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The resolution "stresses" that the
       <strong>
        IAEA has not reported any nuclear material missing from Iran sites it is monitoring
       </strong>

       No one's violating Iran's legal rights. If they want to refuse to let inspectors into certain their facilities they have the legal right to do that. Accordingly, the rest of the world has the legal right to call them liars and refuse to do business with them.

       You seem confused. No one is actually stopping Iran from building is 2000+ centrifuge facilities in hardened bunkers. They're free to keep doing that while its people go hungry and broke.

       That's great. In the meantime I wonder why they hell Iran won't let anyone near the Parchin facility. I'm sure there's a perfectly legitimate explanation for hiding whatever they're doing there while their economy disintegrates.

       Iran has not "refused" any inspections it is required to allow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site at Parchin, which Iran has recently refused to allow inspections, is 1 - not a nuclear site, and 2- was already inspected by the IAEA in 2005 anyway, since Iran agreed to allow greater inspections than legally required and 3 - it was in fact inspected twice, and 4- nothing was found there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admit it -- you dodn't know that Iran had already allowed Parchin to be inspected, twice, did you? And you didn't know that Iran was not required to allow ANY inspections there at all. No, because you rely too much on the latest media scare headlines and haven't been following this stuff close enough. You THINK you know something, but you really don/t.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, this is what Hans Blix, the former IAEA head, had to say about that:
       <strong>
        "Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site," Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. "In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be."

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And former weapons inspector Robert Kelley dismissed the allegations about Parchin too:

       OH and PS: Iranians would actually go hungry if Iran did not develop its nuclear program -- which is why the US encouraged Iran to go nuclear in the first place back in the 1970s. Since then, Iran's oil exports have halved, its population has almost trippled, and it uses 40% of its oil domestically. See, Iran has to EXPORT oil and gas and so needs to diversify its energy resources.

       Actually the US sanctions violate all sorts of international laws. For example, the sanctions on the sale of spare parts for civilian airliners violate the Chicago Convention, and an ICAO report criticized these sanctions for placing the lives of innocent travelers at stake.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what you still don't seem to get is that the "iran nuclear threat" is just a pretext used by the US -- just as "WMDs in Iraq" was just a pretext -- and so even if Iran totally gave up its nuclear program it would still be sanctioned since the real goal of the US is to impose regime change. In fact, the sanctions laws where specifically written to prevent them from being lifted even if Iran gave up her nuclear program:

        http://original.antiwar.com/yousaf-butt/2011/08/25/iran-sanctions-built-to-fail/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, Iran has repeatedly offered compromises already, and even suspended enrichment entirely for 3 years. Nothing changed, and instead goalposts were moved and US demands were increased.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Iran has never "hid" any important facilities from anyone (and before you cry "BUT WHAT ABOUT PARCHIN" note that Parchin was already inspected by the IAEA -- twice in fact -- with nothing found, even though Iran was under no obligation to allow ANY inspections there at all.)

       What's wrong with you letting me come and look through your stuff? 
Countries tend to be kinda wary about letting foreigners traipse around in military sites, and this is true of Iran as well as any other nation on the planet. Iran has said that it will allow yet another visit but this time it wants to see the evidence against it, and it wants assurances that once this visit is done, there won't be yet another and another demand.

      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and if by "7 years later" youre trying to imply something, note that the allegation is that Iran conducted nuclear
       <em>
        related
       </em>
       (?) experiments there until 2003, so if there was something to be found, it could have been found in 2005 when Iran allowed the IAEA visitors to select any group of buildings they wanted and inspect them.

       Because they want to make sure that'll be the end of it, instead of one long series of repeated demands to visit yet again and again. That's one reason. It is a perfectly good reason, and I don't think you're so dumb that you don't get it, so drop the act.

       We simply don't know, because Iran steadfastly refuses to let anyone examine the site. If we knew for sure whether Iran had done anything incriminating at that site, there would be no reason to inspect it.

       Parchin is a working military base, and there are buildings constantly being built and destroyed there.  The IAEA has not "shown" anything to Iran and in fact the US has specifically prevented the IAEA from sharing, furthermore the US has not even shown its full evidence to the IAEA. Former IAEA head ELbaradei complained about this in his book.
Secondly, if there were any nuclear experiments conducted there, there is no way to get rid of them by tearing down stuff. The inspectors' tools can pick up SINGLE ATOMS of uranium. A former weapons inspector has explained that the work alleged to be occurring at Parchin cannot hide nuclear material:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Since November 2011 there have been press reports that the Parchin site has been ‘sanitized’ to remove traces of uranium. Uranium signatures are very persistent in the environment. Stories that bulldozers are being used to sanitize the chamber are irrelevant. If Iran is using hoses to wash contamination across a parking lot into a ditch, there will be enhanced opportunities for uranium collection if teams are allowed access. If an explosion chamber has been used with uranium and explosives, uranium will be detected no matter how hard the Iranians work to clean it. If a chamber using explosives and uranium has been used inside this building, the IAEA will find the particles as surely as they did in the aftermath of the Syrian reactor bombing.
       </strong>

       No, sorry but the building in question is still there. The allegations of changes made based on satellite imagery clearly show it is buildings next door. And like Robert Kelley pointed out, it is irrelevant anyway since you can't hide nuclear work. The previous inspectors, in addition to inspecting various buildings, took environmental samples which would have shown ANY nuclear work ANYWHERE. Heck some technology is so advanced they can sense it from space.

       From the most recent IAEA report:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A number of satellite images of the location since February 2012 show: large amounts of liquid ‘run off’ emanating from the building in which the vessel is housed; equipment in open storage immediately outside the building; the removal of external fixtures from the building itself; and the presence of light and heavy vehicles. Significant ground scraping and landscaping have been undertaken over an extensive area at and around the location, with new dirt roads established. Satellite images from August 2012 show the containment vessel building shrouded.
       </p>

       Thanks for proving my point that the building itself is there.
Furthermore, the IAEA has never "revealed" anything. It was ISIS that did so. And like I keep pointing out to you, even if Iran totally razed the building, you still can't get rid of traces of nuclear experiments IF they happened (and they would have been picked up in the 2005 inspections too.)

You really should go sort this out with him personally LOL.

       As for the claims about neutron triggers -- note that Elbaradei wrote in his book that the claim came from Israel, and he returned the documents to the Israelis because they were obviously forgeries (but then Oliver Kamm at The Times got ahold of the documents, retyped and edited it, then tried to pass it off as genuine and from the IAEA...until commentators pointed out that the document didn't even use Farsi fonts.)

       <strong>
        The neutron generator could then produce isotopes for use by other laboratories, hence the reference to market samples. UD3 is not known to be used as a neutron initiator in nuclear weapons

       They took environmental samples specifically to see if there was any such activity, and if there was any activity involving nuclear material it would have been picked up. And you didn't answer my question: If Iran was hiding something then why did they allow inspectors to come in and pick any 9 random buildings to visit?

      <p>
       "nuclear material" can refer to a multitude of different substances that exist in a multitude of molecular states. There's nothing in the quotes you've provided so far to indicate that IAEA inspectors were testing for evidence that Iran was testing neutron triggers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact the IAEA has flat out said that it was unaware of the existence of the containment vessel during those previous visits. If that's true the IAEA would have had no reason to test for evidence of the types of activities associated with such a facility.

       Yeah now who is making up crap? I think the IAEA itself knows best what sort of tests its expert
       <em>
        should have
       </em>
       been conducting. FYI the tests look for all sorts of atomic particles of fissile material. The initiators themselves are made of a few grams of fissile material.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, had you been paying attention, you'd know that according to IAEA head Elbaradei, the claim that Iran tested neutron initiators came from a document sent by the Israelis, but that Elbaradei returned the document to them because it was such an obvious forgery. (The Israelis then "leaked" the documents to Times writer Oliver Kamm who printed a lurid story about this -- until commentators on the Times site pointed out that the document didn't use Farsi fonts but used Arabic fonts and that the author didn't have a good grasp of Farsi...at which point Kamm admitted that he had edited and retyped the document himself.

       I don't know what "claim" you're talking about. The only claim care about is the claim that that facility COULD be used for neutron triggers, and the claim that Iran began modifying the facility (and now apparently covering it in a shroud) immediately after the IAEA started asking questions. I don't know what Iran actually did at that facilitiy because it won't let the investigators go there and find out.

       The IAEA may say that it didn't know about a containment vessel, but it knows all about nuclear tests and when it sends its investigators to conduct tests, they do know what they're doing. There is no specific test for one thing that wasn't conducted there. They wipe down areas with cotton rags, which they then subject to broad analysis to find traces of fissile material. Doesn't matter if a tank did or did not exist, the point is whether fissile material was found -- and the IAEA said no, no fissile material was found.
      </p>
      <p>
       And ANY facility "could be" used for any thing. The IAEA doesn't have authority to go around on fishing expeditions. In fact the access that Iran provided to the IAEA at Parchin in the past was for this very reason way beyond what Iran was legally required to allow. The IAEA's investigation authority is limited, according to Iran's safeguard agreement, to measuring declared nuclear material to ensure non-diversion. That's is all. It does not function as an investigative agency. Iran nevertheless allowed it to go to Parchin, pick any 5 buildings at random, and chek them. If Iran was hiding something, that would not have happened. The fact that Iran allowed it -- no other country has -- shows that they're being transparent. In fact the former IAEA head said so:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site," Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. "In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be."
       </strong>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that even today, Iran has said it is willing to allow yet another visit to Parchin, but this time Iran wants to see the source of the claims, and an agreement that this will be the last time that the IAEA will ask to see sites that fall outside of its legal jurisdiction. These are perfectly reasonable demands by Iran considering it is under no legal requirement to allow yet another visit to Parchin.

       Nope. It's discussed in every report they've published since April 2011 when they first learned the facility existed. They never examined the containment vessel building and they have no idea what was done there.

       Those are direct quotes from the August 2012 IAEA report so don't bother telling me that the IAEA actually said something else.

       The IAEA has no business inspecting contaainment vessels. Their job is restricted to measuring fissile material. There is no fissile material, as multiple environmental samples have shown. In fact such containment vessels are normal industrial gear and you can find many photos of them for sale on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
       The IAEA would like to have access, but it legally has no authority, sorry. Nevertheless Iran already allowed the IAEA to pick any 5 building at random and visit them anyway, because Iran is generous and transparent. If it was hiding something, it wouldn't have done that

       Yeah see the LAW is on Iran's side in both cases. The IAEA's inspection authority is limited by the safeguards agreement to measuring fissile material -- that's all. Iran has offered nontheless to allow this THIRD illegal IAEA visit but only under the very reasonable condition that it see the proof against it.

       Saudi Arabia doesn't have an islamist government. They have a bunch of rich old sheikhs who drink cognac and gamble. We can reason with those guys. They're smart guys, by Arab standards.

       lol Saudi sheiks play their dumb Islamist population like pawns on a chessboard. I just read Ahmed Yamani's biography a few weeks ago. Ibn Saud was a baller pragmatist who hired the brightest western-educated technocrats (like Yamani, educated at Harvard) to build his empire.

       You sound like one of the ignorant sheep who thinks the Saudi royal family are good muslims because they let clerics babble on TV. Saudi royals send their kids to study in England and the USA while their shithead citizens go to madrassahs. They chug single malt scotch and race ferraris in Monaco while you bang your keyboard and defend their Muslim bona fides.

       Shut the fuck up and stop embarrassing yourself, you've been proved wrong countless times.

      <p>
       Nuclear enrichment is an "inalienable right" of all sovereign states which is expressly recognised in the NPT. Iran is perfectly entitled to say "no, fuck you" to any offer which includes compromising its legal rights and become dependent on foreign entities for its energy needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, Iran has in fact offered to cease enrichment to 20% if it is allowed to buy the fuel for its medical reactor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And stop referring to half a dozen states as "the international community", Iran's nuclear programme is supported by 120 member states of the Non-Aligned Movement as well as the 57 members of the OIC which constitute the vast majority of the countries in the world.

       Blatant manipulation of a former ambassador to Lebanon's words who claimed Hezbollah "has used" Zelzal-2 missiles. Moreover, if Iran indeed supports Hezbollah then good for Iran, it is supporting a legitimate group of resistance against Israeli occupation of Lebanon which has been constantly elected to the Lebanese parliament, regardless of whatever Netanyahu wants to call it. Israel happens to be funded by the US, and both of them happen to support the MEK who is responsible for kidnappings, assassinations as well as other acts of terrorism inside Iran.

       Iran gives weapons to Hezbollah which shoots rockets into Israel. What has Israel ever done to Iran to deserve that?

       They took environmental samples specifically to see if there was any such activity, and if there was any activity involving nuclear material it would have been picked up.
