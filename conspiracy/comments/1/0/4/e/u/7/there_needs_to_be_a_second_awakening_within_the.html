       I believe it is the next step. I was just thinking about it all day... It is so amazing and (slightly) encouraging that so many people are waking up from the induced slumber of not only this country (US) but the world, by the machine that seeks to enslave us all. But I began thinking while having a conversation with a friend (but in all honesty I've thought of it for a while). He is very very hopeful of change, and a "brighter tomorrow" to put it in a nutshell. I absolutely disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do I mean by the second awakening within the awake? I'll keep it simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative branch is bought and sold. The judicial branch is bought and sold. Don't even get me started on the executive.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I hear of talk and change, be it from anyone, I ask "through what mediums do you propose to implement this change, and how do you go about getting it?" And the response is usually "through legislation!", or some form of "the pen is mightier", technique. This discourages me further. Do people honestly not see that the very system they seek to operate within is working against them? There is absolutely nothing we can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like saying that you are going to race your rival in the upcoming important foot race but you've also given him permission to make it into a race in water, while he gets to be on a boat - he controls the judges - and no cameras will be on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The awake need to become awake again and realize there is nothing they can do to restructure the government and world the way that it needs to be done for all of humanity, to erase nationalism, to rebuild a world without such an extrinsic value and dependency on currency (and possibly do away with it but that's fantastical), and truly truly exercise futility day in and day out. Using our own system that's built against us is not going to work - and every day we live that lie they gain more power. I'm just going to come out and say it. There is nothing we can do but one thing, and one thing only:
      </p>
      <p>
       Armed conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seek yourselves and come to terms that there is no other way. I equally must partake in the contradiction, out of decency, and say that I wish it never comes to that, even while I know that there is no useful alternative, for the status quo is evil.

       I think it's funny you people think you can reason with pure evil. As if winning a legal battle against them is going to change how they think or not participating in their game will fix them. When really you just give them more control les players on the field is easier to corrupt. The only way to fix these people is to threaten the only thing that matters to them.... living...

       exactly.... if you had a plan to take over the world and before you could finish your plan the people started to wake up... would you just say "oh ok i guess we'll stop now"...fuck no...and if they did stop, how much mercy would you be willing to show them if everyone knew the truth....
      </p>
      <p>
       -one more thing... weather it be an uprising or a coup, it needs to happen a lot sooner than later. you think by putting off a violent uprising is a more humane/innocent way to go about it, well your wrong. you forget that it is not about your country losing its sovereignty its the entire world, 7 billion people in chains, millions starving daily. SOONER THAN LATER.

       Ironic that you should use that example, since it was orchestrated by Hitler - and ultimately did lead to his rule, one of the most brutal ever, not by revolution, but through manipulating the system.

       Violent resistance only gives them more power and an excuse to use it. Not participating, not cooperating, and circumventing official channels is enough to break the system. And I see more of it every day - I am pretty optimistic for the future honestly.

       But not confronting the system is beyond even condoning it - it's acknowledging that it has, indeed, ran away.

       The reality that is new systems popping up left and right annihilating old systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at dwolla and square - what they are doing would have been impossible a few years ago - to build a network to compete with the credit card companies would be ludicrous yet here we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same is happening with transportation - electric vehicles, carshareing, casual carpool, the bike backlash in response to gas prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operating systems - have you seen ubuntu lately? it's incredible - works better than windows 7 ever did and it's FREE and it's only getting better. And there are easily 2-3 competitors/cooperators to ubuntu for free as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Music - I haven't listened to a mainstream music group in ages because there is so much out there that is good and dirt cheap/free if you spend 5 minutes trolling the waters on youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idea sharecropping - (kickstarter, indiegogo) takes the control of goods from mega corporations and distributes them to people who actually want to make the products. Best part about this is the people making most of this stuff have no desire to implement planned obsolescence.
      </p>
      <p>
       News - only old people get their news from CNN, FOX, MSNBC, CBS anymore - most people I've met under 35 agree that news is just fluffy propaganda and dismiss it for the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheer number of people I meet who are enlightened about the reality of the world. It's easily 4 times what it was in 2008 and I notice people are much more receptive to the possibility that they live in a manufactured reality than they were in 2008. People know the wars of the past 20 years are a sham, so much so that there aren't enough people willing to signing up to fill the ranks of the next war.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's game over reset for the dinosaurs of control and we are in their death throes.

       I used to be super optimistic about where we were headed as well, specifically with technology. I thought that we could solve all the problems since we were rapidly expanding on our capabilities.  But then I realized that TPTB had these technologies, too, if not more advanced versions of what "the common man" has.  Yes, those good ideas are out there, and they would do great things, but everything is in the wrong hands. :/ This is the exact point of OP. You need that second awakening.  It'll crush your soul. I'm still going through it. Just hang on to whatever part of that soul you can, but recognize that it's bad out there.

       Consider what happens when those that are wealthy and connected enough to afford genetic enhancement begin enhancing themselves, further leveraging their power?
      </p>

       It is easy to see all the crazy awesome science "we" are doing, but if you yourself cannot do it, then it is still another dependant technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, many people seem to think that there will be some deus ex machina to allow high tech globalizing society as we know it to continue. This is naive, and shows how we depend on high technology, when some novelty and self control/discretion can go a long way.

       Exactly. I've discussed this a lot with a friend, and the conclusion that we've come to is that even if we perfect some new technology, the human race isn't even remotely close to being ready to wield such a power, ESPECIALLY those with the power.

       I see it in a similar light to the nonsensical 'normal' levels of unemployment when automation should require people to work less. As technology, resources, etc change you need to reassess what 'normal' is. That is, motion requires a change in perspective, lest you drive off a cliff. Which seems to be the defacto plan against many of the issues civilization faces.

       I've never heard of that, and while that may carry little water in that I'm one person, I hope you get the point. Extrapolate. In any case, it still does nothing with the future generations that are both born into debt slavery and continue to do so. To say the majority is the contrary is an understatement.

      <p>
       Electric vehicles are for the rich, or over-willing to get into debt slavery, as well as terrible for the environment. Carpooling and bicycling are responses to more manipulation and oppression - a reaction, not a solution. It's me putting a sharp object on your seat, and instead of removing it you just change cheeks. You only have two of them.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What does that have to do with inflation, globally induced slavery by banks, the hijacking of our constitution, a private banking printing our currency, war-time treatment of citizens at the hands of their own government, a housing crisis that was, in essence, a planned attack for banks to own more land on this planet? That was so irrelevant that it's almost incoherent - or at the very least, a head deceivingly in the sand.

      <p>
       This is yet another reaction and really, when you look at the fact that atleast we're (supposed to be) a free market there is nothing profound about that.

       That's the most undeniably positive point, but I reiterate my original topic starter.

      <p>
       It's really not. Really. Do you think our government which knows no bounds won't respond accordingly to anything you've mentioned? All that's going to happen and all that IS happening is that people from the same generations of the people doing all the things you just mentioned will also be filling the positions in that same oppressive government - but the kicker is that it's a whole lot more. Again I reiterate that, every day that goes by living this lie is giving them more power.

       Your heart and soul are in the right place and I applaud you for that, but I think it's quite evident your mind isn't. You're soap boxing. And at the end of the day, that does nothing. Face the loaded carbine rifle held by the militarized policeman with the laughing, fat, rich judge behind him, and wake up. Again.

       First, don't patronize me.

       Second - it's gradual steps. Most of this things I state are firstworldproblems but thats where all the power is. Things are breaking down and it will start with taking control away from mega corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think government is the problem? Hahahahaha - No. It's corporatism. They have all the money, all the lawyers, all the lobbyists, all the regulatory committees, custom tailored laws, essentially all of the power. Politicians, and therefore government, are just the sockpuppets of these greed machines. Everything you are talking about are merely symptoms of what is really wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you don't think Ubuntu is a big step? Bill Gates is one of the worlds richest men and the means of his wealth has been outdone by something people volunteered to build and give away for free. Do you know what the real world ramifications of this are? Seriously, do you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single example I've given leads back to corporations that wield immense control. You don't think the music industry is a relevant example? How about them lobbying to censor and control the internet? I don't contribute to them in any way because there are good if not better alternatives. Do you still think "this has nothing to do with anything that matters."?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think people don't know about debit slavery and can't escape it why is bitcoin going up in value every day? Sure, it might not be the final system the breaks fractional reserve banking, it very well may fail - but there will be another one. Smart, ethical people are working on making the old system obsolete.

      <p>
       When you see the stories of DHS buying billions of rounds of ammunition you think "They are planning for the martial law". When I see that DHS has bought billions of rounds of ammunition I think "Someone on the DHS planing board is also on the bullet manufactures payroll"; I'd bet dollars to donuts this is the case for almost everything that is currently wrong with our world.

       The debate between crimethinc and hedges really clinched this for me. I was hoping hedges would have some kind of point, but he kept touting his experience as an emotional appeal instead of using logic.

       As a native of Britain I agree 100% friend, for too long the new age bullshit has got in the way of REAL change, the last great fight must be fought this way! 
Why do People think this can be talked about, did they ask your opinion on 9/11 no, what about mine on 7/7, fuck no! Or how about palestines opinion on Israel destroying them and comiting acts of genocide? Oh is that a no also! 
It's about fucking time we gave them NO option, about time we gave them NO choice on how we want OUR world to spin!!!

       I heard someone here a while ago say, and what I agree with, that a revolution without focus or planning could end up causing chaos instead of change. If there's no "What next" moment, then there could be serious ramifications of any major steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it ever truly comes to an armed revolution, it will because there is no other option exhausted. While there is still even a single breath of air in any other option, being hasty is not necessary.
