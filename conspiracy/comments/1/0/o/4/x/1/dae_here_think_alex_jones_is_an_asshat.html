He attracts people who are interested in real theories and then makes bogus claims while spouting some of the same stuff as those of us who actually research in order to discredit the message.  Notice how he really never breaks stories but regurgitates 3 day old stories with a sensationalist twist to make anyone who would be interested think he is a crackpot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine with me. I have to say that at first I didn&#39;t mind when he was selling food and gear but now he is selling &quot;weight loss&quot; stuff. he claims that he isn&#39;t selling it for weight loss but he brings it up every time the ad plays.

<p>If the commercials were a bit less numerous I wouldn&#39;t mind. But hell, <em>weight loss</em>??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My feelings are that Alex Jones is in fact an asshat. He&#39;s worth a few million dollars because he has turned what he does into a big business, and capitalized on a trend. </p>

<p>That said, I never throw the baby out with the bath water. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you guys have read the book Dune, but it&#39;s a sci-fi novel about the far distant future of humanity. There are individuals in it referred to as &quot;Mentats&quot; who are trained to be a sort of human computer, who take in all possible information available to them in order to calculate out the truth of a situation, or formulate a prediction of the future. </p>

<p>I try to apply that reasoning to my own life, taking in as much information from as many different sources as I can, and using it all to piece together the big picture. The trick is to be fearless in your endeavor. Never be afraid to have what you know challenged, even if it&#39;s an understanding you have held to for many years. That may sound like an easy thing to do for us &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, however, what if we were exposed to information which was solid evidence that supported the governments story of 9/11? I think many of us would have a hard time accepting that, unless we fearlessly approached it.</p>

<p>(Of course, no such evidence has arisen for that particular event, and I think we all know that it never will. I was merely using it as an example for what I was saying. Perhaps a poor example, but you get the idea.)</p>

<p>My point is, even a loudmouthed blowhard like Alex Jones might have a few bits of truth. And aside from that, understanding that he may in fact just be a disinformation agent, or simply a business man who markets fear, is also a valuable piece of the puzzle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s straight up rude to people that call in, even if they agree with him. Then he has the nerve to call them nuts. He&#39;s just as bad as politicians but from the complete opposite side. He thinks he&#39;s firing up his listeners by ranting but I predict that&#39;s a small population. More and more people are sick of the violence in society and I see nothing positive that he&#39;s doing for society. </p>

<p>Is there a show out there like Alex Jones but without the rudeness? </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>He&#39;s a fear mongering idiot. He thinks to beat the globalists we all must arm ourselves, buy his products and fill ourselves with hate. I see that strategy no different than what our politicians preach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think he has some sort of mental condition that has gone untreated and has gotten progressively worse over the years.</p>

<p>You can pull up clips on YouTube from the 90&#39;s where he comes across as more rational, more coherent, and less crazy.  As time goes on, his theories get wilder and he gets more aggressive.  Lately he&#39;s been on a kick where he seems to use loaded language during his show to illicit a emotional response from listeners (many of it including raping, molesting, beating, etc. the young &amp; old -- those seen as powerless).</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s not a sell out or a disinfo agent... it&#39;s someone who has a mental disorder that has gone untreated.  At this point I doubt he&#39;d seek help for it for obvious reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a repost of mine from earlier:</p>

<p>Alex Jones is a Zionist shill. </p>

<p>Yes, if you can deal with his maniacal ranting, cutting off guest&#39;s answers, etc. there is some good information to be had there. But also remember that this is the very same bullshit artist that told America, on the eve of the millennium, that Russian ICBMs had been launched and worked his listeners into a panic.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones&#39; boss, ultra-Zionist Jeffrey Smulyan, dictates what he says, when he says it, and which ads for water filters and scammy gold dealers go in between.</p>

<p>Mr. Smulyan, the man that signs Alex&#39;s checks every week (and the man who&#39;s invitation Jones was riding on when he &quot;crashed&quot; Bohemian Grove) is the owner of Emmis (Hebrew for &#39;truth&#39;) Communications, located in Indianapolis, Indiana. Ultimately, Alex Jones will only talk about subjects that are pre-cleared with Mr. Smulyan. This is why I jokingly refer to his show as the &quot;Kosher Konspiracy Klub&quot;--&#39;cause if it ain&#39;t kosher to Jeff Smulyan, Alex won&#39;t talk about it. Just remember to NEVER send the guy one red cent of your money. It&#39;s a total lie that he is &quot;running the show&quot; at InfoWars. He&#39;s a paid employee, just like everyone else.</p>

<p>Listen, I&#39;m not hating on AJ. He&#39;s a dude doing a job that has an asshole boss. Yes, he sold out, but it was probably with the best of intentions. I believe that, in his head, he figured that he could get a lot of information out there <em>even though</em> he had to nearly totally refrain from ever speaking ill of Israel or particular Jews specifically. At this point in history though, with the Jewish backed global financial collapse, the growing realization that Israel (with great help from the neocons) was behind 9/11 and Israel trying their damndest (as usual) to get American kids to fight and die in a war that they&#39;re about to touch off, people are getting sick of always hearing about &quot;globalists&quot; and &quot;bankers.&quot; They want Alex to name names, and as much as he tries not to he somewhat has to. This is why I believe that he has a guest like Dr. Pieczenik on--he&#39;s Jewish and has no hesitation talking about Jewish crimes--thereby taking Alex (somewhat) &quot;off the hook.&quot;</p>

<p>He&#39;s still a complete bullshit artist though--I lost any and all respect for him after the little &quot;ICBM&quot; incident. Still, I am grateful to him for being the person to encourage me to open my eyes. Him and Art Bell are what made me start questioning.</p>

<p>So yes, Alex Jones is most assuredly an &quot;asshat.&quot; He discredits the very movement that he claims to serve.</p>

<p>Any monies lost or gained belong to Mr. Smulyan (AJ&#39;s Zionist boss and owner of Emmis &#39;Hebrew for truth&#39; Communications).</p>
