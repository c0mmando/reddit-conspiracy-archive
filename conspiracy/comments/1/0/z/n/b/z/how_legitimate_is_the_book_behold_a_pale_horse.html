Everyone I know that is big into conspiracy highly recommended this book saying that it would blow my mind. So far, it has only made me think the author was a lunatic. </p>

<p>The author claims that Catholics and Masons are a major threat, he claims some major cosmic event was to come that never happened and he is claiming that there are secret moon bases. Sure, these things could all be true, but in general, it seems that he may have been a little insane. Can someone who has read the book fill me in? I bought another book about the declassified files on MKULTRA that is calling me and would much rather not waste my time on the rantings of some schizophrenic loony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what makes it interesting is who Cooper was....his links to the military, how he died, these are all novel things that makes his data point on most conspiracy theorist&#39;s reality matrixes heavily weighted...</p>

<p>also, he was one of the few thinkers who would spend a ton of time and effort presenting a point of view, only to later admit he could be completely wrong and being intentionally misguided by the the Powers That Be.  for example, he often warned of aliens, but later in his life admitted well maybe aliens have been presented as this &quot;real&quot; thing to intentionally create paranoids like him so it is easier to pull off a new world order, etc.  </p>

<p>conspiracy theorists enjoy guys who consider all the angles, so even though cooper was deep into some shit and ventures into almost david icke like territory sometimes (who actually is pretty good also, if you can look at the reptilian thing as more metaphorical and less literal), he absolutely is worth a read and listening to a lecture or two.</p>

<p>i dont feel like grammar checking so sorry if this came out like word soup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Cooper knew what he was talking about, much more than a lot of people want to accept. <em>Everything</em> he says about mystery schools and societal control mechanisms is <em>markedly accurate.</em> However, he was fed some disinfo, particularly about extraterrestrials - he was led to believe there were dealings between aliens and world powers, which is presented to be truthful in <em>Behold a Pale Horse.</em> He later determined he was being intentionally misled, in order that false information about aliens would then be spread to the general population by his whistleblowing.</p>

<p>His later conclusion upon discovering this is as follows: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enANOIZPWlk">a false alien threat is being manufactured by world powers.</a></p>
