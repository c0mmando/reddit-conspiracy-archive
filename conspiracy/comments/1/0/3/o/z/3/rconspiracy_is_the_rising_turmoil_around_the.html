<p>Islamic protests, the war in Syria, relations with Russia, the China/Japan standoff, failing global economics etc. etc... show that the Illuminati/NWO are losing their grip, or is this part of the plan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Losing it.  They have undertaken an enterprise too far flung and overseen by power grabbers, not power sharers. </p>

<p>In part it is their plan because it is of their doing.  But not all is well.  I expect the people will prevail but first the elite will have a global power struggle like this world has never seen. Thats when the thing will go bust.  The good people will not rise up and do the good things needed to recover.  When they are hungry enough to kill, they will.  Some will lay down and die. The elite would have us believe we can do nothing when they are the ones who bit off more than they can chew. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both. Islamic protests may be a result of food prices rising as a result of climate change an unintended side effect of fossil fuel use. Attack on Syria is a method of control by Israel/US while Russia wants to remain in control of Syria because Syria owes Russia billions of dollars for arms. China is becoming stronger which is changing the balance of power which makes for an unstable system so they are losing some control there or the control is shifting to China. War will stimulate the economy so they will make money regardless of where or when it happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the level of control has risen steadily with the level of publicly available technology.</p>

<p>The counter side to this is that the level of public awareness rises at a relative rate.</p>

<p>Ultimately, to answer your question, I think the level of control and the ability to control has risen sharply over the last fifteen years. The level of resistance hasn&#39;t risen as much, but there will be a critical mass at some point. There has to be. I still maintain that I will probably have to be able to grow food and find water for my family at some point in my life.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, somewhat.</p>

<p>Technology is a tool for the elite. While it&#39;s great that everyone has an iPhone5, and twitter helps protesters/resisters organize, the real advances  in development belong to the military and the powers that own them.</p>

<p>You say you&#39;re not a survivalist/doomsday prepper but admit you believe you&#39;ll be fighting for resources for your family within our lifetime. While that seems at odds, it does seems possible. More and more you see groups (like those who&#39;ve bought Mitt Romney) looking more toward make money from war and destruction rather than a strong middle class.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more about short term profit it seems. Almost as if there is more of a fraction within the elite and they have begun fighting for resources. </p>

<p>China isn&#39;t going to do shit to Japan. They simply don&#39;t have a navy that can take on Japan.  Japan has the 2nd biggest blue water fleet in the world after the US.

<p>I think the Chinese government are idiots if they&#39;re organizing these protests on purpose. They will either be forced into  a naval confrontation with Japan, in which case they will be curbstomped by the JMSDF, or they will be forced to back down, in which case they will look like weak little pansies and everyone will know they&#39;re toothless phonies.</p>

<p>Those are the only two possible outcomes and both are horrible for the government. I mean China <em>might</em>be able to pull this off in 5 to 10 years, but right now they have no real force projection capability.</p>

<p>Yes, China is forever bragging about its &quot;plans.&quot; We all heard about how China&#39;s &quot;plans&quot; for its Ukranian rust bucket carrier. Even if they had a modern aircraft carrier their escort vessels are at least a generation behind the times. The 053H3 is based on a hull design from the 1950s!</p>

<p>That&#39;s right. China just put a circa 1985 aircraft carrier in the water in 2012.</p>

<p>But wait, it gets better:</p>

<p><a href="http://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/idUKBRE87R15Z20120829?irpc=932">http://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/idUKBRE87R15Z20120829?irpc=932</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite public anticipation in China that the carrier -- a refitted, Soviet-era vessel bought from Ukraine -- will soon become the flagship of a powerful navy, defence experts say it lacks the strike aircraft, weapons, electronics, training and logistical support it needs to become a fighting warship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please tell me more about the aircraft China will deploy against Japan from their Ukraine vintage.</p>

<p>That&#39;s something for India or some other inferior navy to worry about. Not navies with advanced Aegis capability like Japan. We&#39;re about 3-4 generations into cruise missile defense systems now. The SM-3 has been intercepting medium range ballistic missiles in the terminal attack phase since at least 2009. We can even fuck up Chinese targeting satellites with those things now. The Chinese will be lucky if they don&#39;t end up hitting their own ships.</p>

<p>Also, unlike China the japs actually TRAIN their navy. They actually know how to operate their most advanced weapons systems. Chinese training is terrible, in part because their too scared to find out whether any of the weapons systems they&#39;re constantly bragging about actually works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we should be leaning more towards them losing their grip...just look at the amount of people that seem to notice bullshit right off hand lately. Remember the Batman Massacre? The next morning people were already hot on the interwebs releasing and releasing information critical to the situation that was full of the truth. </p>

<p>Also, we keep seeing easter eggs popping up about what&#39;s going on and they don&#39;t last long, which means SOMEONE wants us to know that maybe there is a bunch of factions within the main faction trying to gain enough manpower/people power to get the upper hand. </p>

<p>This is just my theory, but this awakening is accelerating at an alarming rate to them...which is why you can see them trying to beat the war drums ever harder. In the end, are we ready for whatever is coming? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, somewhat.</p>

<p>Technology is a tool for the elite. While it&#39;s great that everyone has an iPhone5, and twitter helps protesters/resisters organize, the real advances  in development belong to the military and the powers that own them.</p>

<p>You say you&#39;re not a survivalist/doomsday prepper but admit you believe you&#39;ll be fighting for resources for your family within our lifetime. While that seems at odds, it does seems possible. More and more you see groups (like those who&#39;ve bought Mitt Romney) looking more toward make money from war and destruction rather than a strong middle class.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more about short term profit it seems. Almost as if there is more of a fraction within the elite and they have begun fighting for resources. </p>
