       I was banned for breaking the abusive language rule a couple of days ago by him (I got into it with a known troll), no warning or anything. I think he's too quick to use the ban-hammer.

       I just find it reprehensible to create a list of those who participate in debate but do not agree with your own opinion. If these people on that list, myself included, simply get heckled because of that list, would that not justify defending yourself, instead of being labeled trolling?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just laughable, the state of polarization we have created for ourselves. I'm thinking the conspiratards where right in labeling a lot of folk around here paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's always been my opinion that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       should do away with their judgements of each other, instead work together to gather source material and challenge each others opinions, instead, we get lists like this justifying each side, while a class war rages all around us. Divided.

       There is a difference between playing devils advocate, or genuinely inciting conversation and discussion, and trolling. Maybe you don't deserve to be on that list, but there are plenty up there that do, by citing bogus sources, by parroting known lies, by forum sliding, and general manipulations.

       Care to post why I'm a troll?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been on this sub with this account for nearly five months, over 99% of my posts are here, and I've amassed nearly all of my karma here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it because I tend to ask questions instead of instantly believing titles and a single article?
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I just on this list because you've disagreed with me in the past, and that personally upset you in some way? I vaguely remember your username but I really think you've added me to some giant list of trolls because you may have gotten into a spat with me and didn't like what I had to say to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's frustrating to be a part of this community, have real discussions with people in here about real things, come here every day really one of the only subs I belong to, and be put on some 'troll' list because some guy is upset at something I said to him in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit;
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I made your list in the first week that I was here, due to summing up this thread as a GLP/ATS clone due to the popularity of the threads when I first got here? Chalk that up to judging a book by it's cover and being aggressive, but calling me a troll for that just seems like you have some sort of personal beef with me.

       All I do is defend the official narrative? Is that why I'm constantly insulting the U.S. government, supporting Anonymous, bash the MSM and major news outlets?

       read my posts.

       I ask a lot of questions when I don't know something, and I don't know how questioning an alternative story is the same as defending the official one. I like to keep an open mind and have my mind changed on things weekly.

       You're kidding right? You're basing all of my posts off of a single thread I made
       <em>
        the day I signed up for Reddit?

        Though, something strange is going on here. I used to debate with someone that shared your name almost exactly to a T. And, this was around 8 months ago. You know what I think? I think you changed your name by one character, and have adopted a new strategy.
       </p>

      <p>
       What am I supposed to do about this? How can I
       <strong>
        possibly
       </strong>
       prove this? This seems like the most ridiculous reasoning to label me as a troll and dislike my posts.. Because my name is similar to an old users when you know there's no way I can actually prove that I'm not that user.. Outside of the fact that nearly none of my posts are as arrogant as that thread I made, which I can't do anything about now.

       It is reflective of a very long time lurker making an account. Not everyone makes an account the day they show up to Reddit. And I didn't feel the need until (at the time) I felt pretty embarrassed because I'd been (like most theorists) labeled as your average YouTube comment instead of as a truth seeker.

      <p>
       Yeah, and almost none of my posts are along those lines.. When I first made my account here, it was after noticing a string of conspiracy posts that made this place seem like every other conspiracy forum I ever have been to. So in an immature, childish lashing out, I mocked the sub because I was baffled by how much confirmation bias I saw upon entering this thread.

       You calling me a troll and being personally upset with me because you think I'm someone else, which I can't even prove is just ridiculous. I admitted that my actions were childish and that I shouldn't have been so quick to judge a long time ago, and I can't do much else about it now. I don't even get the comparison.. Those are the posts you're "used to." So you just made a judgment based on my first post and refused to change your views based on my continuous posting throughout the last 5 months?
      </p>
      <p>
       You doing that is exactly what I did with this sub, and why I made that thread. I saw a few threads and made an assumption that the entire sub was like that. I just fail to see how you can say that you're used to posts like that, because one post was like that. It just seems like you saw that thread, made the call that I'm a troll, and refused to actually read any of my posts from there on out...
      </p>
      <p>
       I really think you're being a bit hyperbolic by saying that my posts all reflect a thread I made
       <em>
        five months ago
       </em>
       when I first made my account... I know it shouldn't matter, but it really bugs me that you're labeling me like that because my name is similar to a different person's name, and because of a thread and a few posts I made a long time ago, and have since acknowledged were petty on my part and I should have given more time to judge before making any rash judgments. I mean hell, if the moderators can do it, have them trace my ip for past reddit accounts - you won't see one from eight months ago with a similar name, and certainly won't see anything other than this account in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like it's a little unfair for you to make that judgment about me and then ignore any future posts I make. I feel like we share a lot of the same opinions but you don't take anything that I say for what it is, but for posts I once made.

       I think it's because you used to be much more sceptical in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several months I noticed a tendency of you to gradually move away more from that stance. Just my opinion of course, so make of that what you will.

       He probably flagged you back then and never re-evaluates his opinions.

       Being skeptical is good. I hate it when people use the term skeptical and skeptic in a derogatory fashion. It is much different than someone who ignores evidence, just makes crap up because they dislike a stance or theory, sidesteps legitimate discussion and/or trolls and belittles rather than thoughtfully exchange information.

       I think I'm still just as skeptical, just much less of an ass about it (my own opinion I suppose)
      </p>
      <p>
       I like being skeptical because truthfully I think it's necessary. You can't really search for and find the absolute truth if you're afraid to be skeptical of any story, and just believe whatever it is based on a source or anything like that.

       Well, if it was a known troll, then you shouldn't feed the trolls. A ban is very heavy handed, so I must reiterate the mantra, don't feed the trolls. Down vote if you must, ignore above all else.

       I'd agree with that, and I'm a "known government shill" who posts from an underground concrete bunker along with some other people. Apparently.

       Yeah, you need to keep spam at bay, so I'd say at least two or three human mods are always advised, especially in a larger subreddit like this.

       Well, my big guess...and this is just a guess...is that it was one of the other moderators throw away account. I mean, who is a redditor for 2 years and hasn't comments or posted a single thing? Also, without having posted anything or showing interest in subject matter pertaining to this subreddit, how does that give him cred enough to be a mod. So, like i said, it might be a throw away account because i can't believe the mods would be stupid enough to just let some random person who hasn't even contributed...to be a mod.

        I mean, who is a redditor for 2 years and hasn't comments or posted a single thing? Also, without having posted anything or showing interest in subject matter pertaining to this subreddit, how does that give him cred enough to be a mod.

       What is even more disconcerting, is the sudden removal of the AIPAC(r/AmericanJewishPower) link from the sidebar, with no explanation, during the same timeframe.

       This isn't the same r/conspiracy we had this time last year.  At 80k users, growing by the hundreds everyday, we have gotten too big for our collective britches.   The number of dormant shill accounts is likely a high percentage of these new subscribers, AutoModerator ensures that "Forum Sliding" is a highly effective tactic, and now a new moderator that hides all of his comment history.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub has been compromised; that should be abundantly clear to anyone paying attention.

       Well, I just created a thread where emanunnaki admits to tricking you into making him a mod.   So, you tell me, what harm can it do?

       This is kinda how I feel, except I would replace 9000sins with ambiversive:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It seems like its getting uglier, less friendly and ambiversive is on a power trip, tinkering with looks and making it look like shit, appointing mods that have no interest in this sub or maintaining it, and is not allowing anyone to make any decisions at all. He wants a "hands off" style of moderation, which is to say, no moderation at all unless he is doing it. He has removed a few links since he has become a mod, for no apparent reason. [...] I just want to see our sub moderated from within rather than people who never visit/comment/actually moderate here. Being a mod isn't about playing with the way your sub looks, it's about being a leader within the community.

       have always been a problem, could it be a false flag in order to make us accept your changes, idk. And then a week later Automoderator gets put on and that makes it a hell of a lot easier to remove stuff with keywords that are  not desired in discourse on this sub.

       Several months I noticed a tendency of you to gradually move away more from that stance. Just my opinion of course, so make of that what you will.
