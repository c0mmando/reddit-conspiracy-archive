    <div class="md"><p>Your point is based on the belief that some elite controls 100% of the technology on earth and no one else knows about it or can develop it.</p>

<p>I mean I&#39;m sorry to say, but you are delusional. There are over 7 billion people on this planet, hundreds of millions are scientists, tens of millions know pretty much the same information and millions have invented various things or came to breakthroughs. If you think that some group of 10 or 20 men, some body can control all technology than you are absolutely 100% delusional and have no clue how the world operates.</p>

<p>Now is it possible some group is hiding possible 1 technology and dozen groups hiding dozen technologies that may be quite advanced, sure, but how are you enslaved?</p>

<p>I mean for god&#39;s sake what you expect to just sit home, watch TV all day and for it to rain money? You must produce something, that someone else finds of value and you sell it and that is called markets and work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what will happen when technology reaches a point where menial human labor like farming, assembly, and transportation can be replaced by machines? All slaves, even wage slaves, will become obsolete. The machine will always be more efficient than an organism, but the elite still need humans around until those machines are created. After that, a large population will only be a drag on the system. As technology advances, it becomes much easier to kill large amounts of people than controlling them through propaganda and fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Did humans become obsolete when the car or airplane was invented?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those inventions replaced human and animal power, but not the need for skilled, complex labor, so the human is still around and not the draft animal. Planes and cars still needed men to build, operate, maintain and repair them. They are not autonomous, which is the kind of technology I am speaking of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its almost always better to have a free flow of ideas/knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There can be a free-flow of ideas in a population of 7,000 just as there is in a population of 7 billion, perhaps a better one since resources originally allocated to feed the &quot;excess&quot; uneducated population would be spent on research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>clean safe technologies are being suppressed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you there. And think about how much easier it would be to transfer that raw energy directly to machines. No farms to grow food, no water to clean, no waste to collect and dispose of.</p>

<p>The goal isn&#39;t to raise the standard of living. The JASON Society could do that right now by releasing all of that suppressed tech. The goal is efficiency, these people are in a hurry for whatever reason. This is the sick vision of the future that the elite have.</p>

<p>I was talking about the quote that you submitted and how Emperor Vespasian was more worried about his idle slaves. The socio-political dilemma that he faced would be negated when technology could fully replace the slave. I think this is the basis for the population reduction goals that the UN desires for their false sustainability program, Agenda 21. The program being false because it doesn&#39;t take into account the suppressed tech we were talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you convert corn into ethanol you are performing a non-sustainable transfer of energy. It runs backwards.</p>

<p>Corn ethanol requires 10-15 calories of energy for each calorie it generates. Therefore the &quot;corn ethanol&quot; scenario is most certainly a pipe dream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mentioned it taking 15 calories to make 1 calorie of fuel.  Without knowing if this is accurate, I assumed that it is unlikely they were burning gasoline in order to make a gasoline replacement (and at a loss too).</p>

<p>More likely they were using another energy source-- like coal.  Using coal to power a car is undesirable because of the weight/volume of the fuel.</p>

<p>However, you could use coal (or solar, or wind, or hydro...) as the input energy for your ethanol.  Converting it to ethanol makes it more energy dense, and thus portable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In theory I totally agree with you.</p>

<p>However, most of the energy &quot;input&quot; into the ethanol equation, by design, MUST be fossil energy. I know that 10:1 (or 15:1) sounds high, but consider:</p>

<p>We start with an unploughed field...this field needs to be turned and furrowed. Enter gasoline or diesel-powered tractors. The fertilized with anhydrous ammonia--sprayed from a tank pulled by the tractor. The ammonia is made from natural gas. See the problem here?</p>

<p>Of course, we could run tractors on natural gas most likely...but there is still the cost of growing the corn, re-fertilizing, pesticide spraying, irrigation, harvesting, processing, getting the corn to an ethanol facility, grinding, fermentation, distillation (which uses HUGE amounts of heat meaning huge amounts of fuel), more transportation, mixing it with gasoline. testing it, then transportation to a fuel hub, where it is then sent (by truck) to a gas station to be dispensed...by a pump running from either coal or nuclear energy.</p>

<p>THIS is where the 10-15cal per 1cal of ethanol figure comes from.</p>

<p>If the ENTIRE system was overhauled, we could probably get this number down to 5cal:1cal...but it would require HUGE amounts of money to do. </p>

<p>Ethanol is a pretty crappy fuel anyhow, as fuels go. It has an extremely low energy content so cars burning it get utterly shitty mileage. It doesn&#39;t work too well when its cold and it &quot;goes bad&quot; quickly. Still, it IS a start.</p>

<p>If we humans are going to keep using internal combustion engines, we&#39;d be wise to start using natural gas or propane (both of which we have HUGE amounts of)--or, better yet, really start pushing the new &quot;clean&quot; turbo-diesel technology. A diesel can run on anything even remotely flammable and, better yet, they can run on things that we would &quot;normally&quot; waste (such as used frier oil, distillation byproducts, oil created from algae, etc.) I have an old Mercedes 240D that I can fuel with nearly ANYTHING...from vegetable oil to cologne to vodka, it will happily run it! I actually use the used oil from a few local restaurants--if I filter the oil I can use it &quot;straight&quot; but I never do so--I just perform the methoxide reaction and turn it into perfectly good biodiesel. All for the &quot;cost&quot; of pumping the nasty oil from the restaurant&#39;s reservoirs! ; &#39;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You articulated that well, and I feel a little foolish for overlooking the agricultural expense of energy.</p>

<p>That said, there are solutions we are not implementing such as electric farm equipment which could be powered by coal or solar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to look at it this way. </p>

<p>No matter how much better we make the wheel and improve our lives, nature will find a way to balance things out. </p>

<p>An excellent example I can think of is the rise of cold medicines the Japanese take. When they urinate the waste from that cold medicine out, birds are exposed to it in waste treatment plants. Those birds then build up immunity to avian flu because of the cold medicines. Eventually the birds develop a method of resistance to the flu and pass it to humans creating an avian flu outbreak. All from our so called improvement of the wheel. Nature has found a way to balance things out. </p>

<p>As much as most in here call Contagion a propaganda film, it&#39;s a tl;dr of how the world balances things out.</p>
