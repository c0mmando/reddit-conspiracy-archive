    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps because Iranians don&#39;t like to be bombed and Arabs of the neighbouring countries which harbour US military bases also wouldn&#39;t appreciate preemptive acts of war.</p>

<p>You cannot attack a country and kill it&#39;s citizens and then just say: &quot;OK, now  it&#39;s over. Let&#39;s have peace, stay at home and be happy.&quot; </p>

<p>The violent backlash against the US would be much more severe, than what allegedly happened in response to the shitty <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> trailer. US citizens would be killed, business deals would be terminated and perhaps even some of the puppet dictators would be toppled or US military bases attacked.</p>

<p>The US has it&#39;s puppet dictators, but Iran has also proxies and allies in the region.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many things wrong with this...so much ignorance. Hoping it&#39;s a troll, but if not...</p>

<p>Fallout from the destroyed facilities would then spread to neighboring countries. They didn&#39;t do anything wrong, why should they suffer the health costs? The Iranian people would suffer from it as well. The vast majority of them don&#39;t agree with their government&#39;s practices. Why should they also have to deal with the fallout?</p>

<p>Other countries (including Russia) have a defense pact with Iran, just like we do with Japan. If we&#39;re duty bound to aid Japan in the case of a Chinese attack, then Russia&#39;s duty bound to aid Iran. This no longer becomes a regional strike, but a world war.</p>

<p>The only way a strike like this would ever work is if EVERY party involved, even those you don&#39;t realize are, simply turns their backs and covers their ears and let us do our thing. That simply will not happen. The stakes are too high for other nations to let it.</p>

<p>But by all means, let&#39;s do it. Let&#39;s blow up their facilities without invading. It&#39;s only war when you invade, right guys?</p>

<p>Nah, we don&#39;t have to use nukes even. Or we can use nukes that only disperse negligible amounts of radiation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why would Russia want to start a war with the US over Iran? Russia can make far more money by just capitalizing on the high oil prices with its domestic refineries and oil wells. The money Russia makes off Iran is miniscule compared to what it makes from the US and Europe.</p>

<p>Also Russia has no real force projection capability. They can&#39;t launch any kind if invasion against the US. It doesn&#39;t even have a real blue water navy.</p>

<p>This is a very trolly question. First you are painting me into a corner, and putting words/concepts into my mouth. </p>

<p>We started with the question &quot;why not just attack iran&quot;. I offered what I think may be the reasoning. These are not my beliefs, just my understanding of what the power elite may be thinking. </p>

<p>It has turned into some kind of weird &quot;gotcha&quot; conversation, where now it is </p>

<p>Which is kind of annoying, and only barely related to the conversation. Should people support war with Iran to oppose the people in power? That is kind of a stretch, and not at all what I implied or said. Also, I would say no, supporting war with Iran is stupid on all accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;ll repeat what I&#39;ve just said and it still stands. Iran has no Nuclear weapons program and nobody has presented any evidence to the contrary. It has allowed all sites that they agreed to be inspected to be inspected and there has been nothing found to suggest otherwise. Do you not think people are trying their hardest to find something? They have spies and inspectors trying to find something and yet nothing has come up. As soon as they did find something it would be presented and plastered over every single newspaper you can think of. NOTHING has been found so they are relying on lies to push the agenda forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because no one has got a legitimate reason to to do it you idiot. You think people can just go and bomb Nuclear installations on the premise they might at some point create a Nuclear weapon?</p>

<p>There is no Nuclear weapons programme in Iran.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not just my opinion. Try the CIA, NIE, MOSSAD and the IAEA. No one has got anything credible to say about Iran and its ambition to create a Nuclear weapon.</p>

<p>Sure, as long as those facilities are only useful that purpose</p>

<p>That&#39;s funny. I keep hearing about how Iran is supposedly &quot;justified&quot; in having nukes, how that&#39;s okay because Israel has them etc. I guess Iran disagrees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well can you show me any evidence they have one or intend to make one? No one has. People make the case for Iran making one but that doesn&#39;t mean they have one. So you believe that it&#39;s ok to bomb another sovereign countries Nuclear sites based purely on bullshit and not based in any factual reality? I guess it&#39;s ok to just go and blow up a US research reactor not because I have evidence, but just because it&#39;s ok to me and other people agree.</p>

<p>This is exactly what US and Israeli politicians are doing. They are ignoring their own intelligence assessments and making the case to bomb another country based squarely on nothing.</p>
