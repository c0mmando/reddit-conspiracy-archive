<p>(from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods</a> )</p>

<p>James Bamford wrote on Northwoods:
“Operation Northwoods, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they needed to launch their war.&quot;</p>

<p>I love me some Bamford but you have to understand he&#39;s sensational as all-fuck, it&#39;s what sells, you can get a better grasp on the document by reading the primary text. The scope of any of the suggestions in the document go up to (verbatim) </p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>This</em> was the limit of non-material(everything else is &quot;drone&quot; or &quot;simulated&quot; damage to be done by the project, tiers below crashing fully packed jetliners into office towers. You can argue that collateral damage could happen in the first two scenarios listed, that&#39;s likely, but the intent is not to kill. If 9/11 was a waterfall Northwoods was a faucet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>JV was a bit blundery -- didn&#39;t answer the questions as well as he could have, but he is right about the BBC report.  That&#39;s public record:</p>

<p><strong>BBC Reports Collapse of WTC Building 7 Early-- TWICE</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0qdLoobkUI&amp;amp;feature=fvwrel#t=25s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0qdLoobkUI&amp;amp;feature=fvwrel#t=25s</a></p>

<p>(And not very savvy of Piers -- obviously wrong.)</p>

<p>edit/ps.  i just wanted to say that i am really not a fan of this anti-jewish shit.  cheney (at the very <em>LEAST</em>) was (also) obviously involved -- just as much as barak/netenyahu/silverstein, etc.  and <strong><em>CHENEY&#39;S CHRISTIAN!</em></strong> (by practice) </p>

<p>in any event, please stop hating on the jews.  9/11 has nothing to do with religion.</p>

<p>in &quot;TRUTH&quot;, 9/11 was economic/political thing -- a trans-national neocon/zionist thing. (a fear &amp; greed thing.)</p>

<p><strong>please shout down the jew-haters.</strong>  the jew-haters are disruptive (and <strong>paid &quot;agitators&quot;</strong> in most cases).  shout them down.  <strong>start a new dialog.</strong>  </p>

<p>christians, jews and muslims have <strong><em>NOTHING</em></strong> to do with 9/11.  the 9/11 criminals are white-collar, and we know who most of the key figures are.</p>

<p>There could be a very informative, polite thread going on about 9/11, and then someone comes in and says, &quot;Damn Zionists Banking Cartel NWO Illuminati Fucks&quot; and really derails the conversation.  What could have been an emotion-free discussion about WTC7 instead turns into jew-bashing, and it&#39;s perhaps intended to make the 9/11 Truth community seem like a bunch of anti-Semites...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree...but sadly the majority of people involved in the machinations of that day were, unfortunately, Jews. </p>

<p>What&#39;s funny is that a Jewish guy tried to warn the FBI that Israelis were going to take out WTC that day...and was twice ignored. See:</p>

<p><a href="http://wikispooks.com/wiki/9/11:Israel_did_it#Gomel_Chesed_Cemetery_Incident">http://wikispooks.com/wiki/9/11:Israel_did_it#Gomel_Chesed_Cemetery_Incident</a></p>

<p>There are &quot;rotten apples&quot; in every bunch though. Its not just a Jewish thing.</p>

<p>Many key 9/11 ringleaders were Israeli.  There is no doubt about that.  (Just as many other key ringleaders were American.  There is also no doubt about that.)</p>

<p>But I am not talking about nations.  I am talking about religion.</p>

<p>My point is that 9/11 had nothing to do with Judaism.  Yes, 9/11 was (en large) about Israel (the political State) and perpetrated (significantly) by Israelis.  But just as Cheney does not speak for all Christians, Barak/Netanyahu/Silverstein clearly do not speak for all Jews.</p>

<p>Bottom Line:  9/11 has a lot to do with Israel (the political State), but nothing to do with Judaism. (And nothing to do with Islam, nor Christianity.)  </p>

<p><strong>9/11 was NOT a religious thing. 9/11 was a political/economic thing.</strong></p>

<p>Well, there is certain evidence supporting Israeli involvement.</p>

<p><a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fiveisraelis.html">http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fiveisraelis.html</a></p>

<p>Israel has also been caught in the past planning terrorism against the US that&#39;s supposed to look Muslim.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair</a></p>

<p>Ironically, in an article from Sept 10, 2001, the Army School of Advanced Military Studies characterizes the Mossad as &quot;Ruthless and cunning. Has capability to target U.S. forces and make it look like a Palestinian/Arab act.&quot;. The Mossad can do this easily as it has many arab assets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/sep/10/20010910-025319-6906r/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/sep/10/20010910-025319-6906r/</a></p>

<p>Personally I think it was a collaboration between the CIA (in collusion with politician assets), the ISI, and the Mossad. I think the Mossad wired the buildings, the CIA/politicians provided cover for the event, and the ISI managed the hijackers. Not sure what motivation the ISI had to participate: perhaps just cash.</p>

<p>EDIT: If you&#39;re going to downvote, kindly explain why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s very close to my thoughts, too.</p>

<p>However, I think Mossad managed the hijackers... and that the ISI was simply paid to supply the hijackers (and subsequent cover for the fake OBL).</p>

<p>in fact, that is the exact opposite of what i am saying.</p>

<p>i am clearly saying it was a neocon/zionist plot.  clearly.</p>

<p>zionism != judaism</p>

<p>i am saying that Christians are not to be blamed for Cheney&#39;s involvement, just as Jews are not to be blamed for Barak/Netanyahu/Silverstein involvement.</p>
