       So, I've been lurking here for a while, and I haven't seen anything written up on it. Does anyone remember this? Around 2000, 2001, there were upwards of 25-30 highly renowned biologists, with several different specialties, that were either murdered or died under very strange circumstances. Anyone ever get any recent information on it? All I can find on google is pretty old.

       yes rememeber it well one commiited suicide on bridge?etc...the best one i know about was the one that died in geelong australian animal health laboratory..he died in airlock..which has fail safe mechanism..my cousin who was draftsman at the time and worked on the plans of the anhl..he said it had back up that prevented such things he was at an loss to explain how it happened...the scientist died when the airlock failed and vacated all the air..very strange as backup failed..what he was working on was classified even stranger still..so i guess that in an wa there is an conspiracy using that definition found in the oxford dictionary....dont know if that is what ur looking for...

       One conspiracy theorist website said the researchers were concerned if a similar manipulation was discovered for smallpox, it could unleash a deadly weapon."

       It was Dr. Don C. Wiley who went off a Memphis bridge.

       Wiley was a structural biologist (x-ray crystallographer) who had published the structure of the Ebola envelope protein. It's a super cool structure, but was just like the influenza envelope structure, whose mechanism was already well understood. He seems to have been blown off a bridge when he stopped to change a tire. My friends said he was pretty tall and his high center of gravity may have contributed to his going over the railing. 
I didn't think that his death was very suspicious, since he didn't even work with pathogenic material. He just expressed a single protein in bacterial cells to purify it and get the structure. there used to be a website that catalogued all of these microbiologists who died around 2000, but I haven't seen it for years.

       No, that's nonsense. He did NOT blow off the bridge. You've been here too long for me to accuse you of being an agent, but that's really nonsense.

      <p>
       And yes, his death was always suspicious. And knowing the unclassified projects he worked on, does not tell us about the classified projects he worked on.

       Don Wiley was a professor at Harvard, not a spy. I was working with a structural virology group when he died, and absolutely no one who knew him thought that he had been murdered. Don was not involved with classified research, he was a professor. We didn't even have the Select Agent registry when he was working, so there was very little Federal oversight of the use of pathogenic materials in the lab. But, like I said, Don didn't even have a BSL-3 laboratory at his disposal, and I've never heard any one talk about him working for the DoD. Check his publications, scientists with clearances publish from DoD facilities, he wasn't one of them. He was a structural biologist who worked with bacteria. I followed his story pretty closely, since it happened when I was starting in the field and we knew some of the same people. His papers constitute about 10% of the references in my thesis :-).

       So no Harvard professors have CIA links? And no scientists have ever worked in a CIA lab and never published their results but knew things that were very secret?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your assurance that his field was structural biology and that he would never be involved in studies of anthrax may be correct.

        Secret or questionable biodefense projects tend to be given to the CIA, DOE or other agencies and contractors instead of to DOD, in order to maintain deniability (for example, only DOD programs have been reported by the US in the annual information exchange about biodefense activities, under the Biological Weapons Convention). Many contractor scientists work in government labs. A CIA spokesman says that CIA scientists work with other government agencies and contractors on the biodefense program.

       But I'm from Memphis, I've been on that bridge and you don't fall from it accidentally. Though I know of one out-of-town fool and thrill seeker who deliberately dived from it and lived. He only broke his back and ended up paralyzed. No one in Memphis thinks Dr. Wiley fell accidentally including the coroner (despite the fact that he didn't have much credibility). Either he was murdered or killed himself. No idea which is more credible.

       First, wiley was not working with anthrax, we seem to agree about that. Secondly, he just didn't have the facilities to have been producing pathogens, his research was with small fragments of the viral genome expressed in an unrelated bacteria. E. coli. Thirdly, there ARE scientists in the US who do secret work and work with highly infectious organisms. FAS is a good place to find out about them. Harvard, prior to the establishment of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories at MIT, Boston just didn't have any place to do that kind of work. Even if there were a hidden CIA lab, Wiley didn't have that capacity in his facility, nor would he be a good choice for a weapons engineer. Structural biologists are more physicists than microbiologists. I have read speculation that his expertise in phylogentics may have uncovered signs that viruses in the population had been engineered by US scientists and released accidentally, in contravention of the 1972 biological and toxin weapons convention. This is also far-fetched, since any of us can go to pubmed and analyze the same sequences that wiley had access to. Mostly it just sucks that this talented man died in his prime. I would have enjoyed his continued contributions to virology.

       They are the Class I viral envelope proteins, and Don helped to broaden and define the class. It was an exciting time to study viral envelope proteins, and the homology between envelope proteins from diverse viruses does suggest that there has been gene sharing between viruses during co-infections. These were all apparent from the structural work on viral envelopes and capsids done in the 90s and also the past decade. If someone intended to suppress basic biochemistry knowlegde by killing a couple of scientists, I think that they failed miserably. It's an awesome field, BTW, if anyone is interested, chekc out google with "viral glycoproteins" viral capsid structure" and "class I viral envelope protein"

       Yeah, I think I know where you were coming from. The sequence data that Wiley had available to him was no different from the data that any of us could analyze from pubmed. Insights along those lines would be the stuff of undergraduate theses by now. The homology between envelope proteins from diverse viruses is extremely interesting from an evolutionary perspective, as is the co-evolution of viruses and eukaryotic organisms. I, for one, think that the conservation of membrane fusion machinery between viruses with divergent morphology is probably one of those things that could shed light on the forces governing virus-animal co-evolution. And, I love conspiracy theories more than most people, but I know the sequence identities and don't see anything indicating that modern biotech interventions have given rise to Filoviruses in primates and man in sub-Saharan Africa. the answer is forest/jungle encroachment and the bushmeat trade.  I wish it were more exotic, but the real answer is pretty interesting too.

       It's easy to say that it's the bushmeat. But that's ignoring a lot of evidence. If you are interested in conspiracy theories and viruses, I think you know what to type into google to find out.

       ok got a new one I'm not sure this isn't a hoax and what the source of the information is.  I cannot be sure it's not a hoax...just like I can't be sure that the official story about 9/11 isn't a hoax and that the current presidential race isn't a complete hoax

       RED ALERT: FUKUSHIMA SPENT FUEL POOLS EXPLODED, ON FIRE NOW, MASSIVE RADIATION SPIKING AND MASS-PANIC UNFOLDING.
This IS extremely serious ...WAY worse than what has come already because of the amount of plutonium in unit four pools.

       After the anthrax attacks a lot of microbiologists who worked for the government, directly or as contractors, suddenly died from some kind of violence. There was speculation that they knew that the anthrax came from government sources and that, if they had been closely questioned, what they knew could have been traced back to the real perpetrators and from them to the orders being given by Bush and Cheney. Which, or course it was.

       considering it leads down a slippery slope of ethics, practicing a bit of restraint could be a good thing. Discipline is a value that has been lost upon north american youth. Practicing respect of other cultures amid tumultuous times should be a priority, instead of fanning the flames.
      </p>
      <p>
       No perceived harm can come of it here, and there is relatively little consequence for having placed a joke when somebody gets offended. With all of that said, what gains come from placing said joke? An empty laugh with no benefit?
      </p>
      <p>
       In essense, what is the purpose of a joke? In this case, nothing but malice and spite, which corrupts even further the view of islam by those preaching said jokes. Just because you don't give a rats ass about the degradation of society does not mean others are sharing that same nonchalant attitude towards life.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a slippery slope that will bite us in the ass.

       Actually I was just turning what friendlysoviet said on its head. If you notice, he responds to someones comment in which mossad is implicated with "Jews did it". He then implicates muslims in another comment. My joke was actually an attempt to show how absurd his reasoning was. I think in Latin this technique is called "reducto absurdum" or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as you see, my joke actually had a purpose.

       Couple of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a very well put argument, until the end. Number one, you put words into my mouth. I very much care about the degradation of society. However, to me freedom of speech trumps everything. Without it, we will no longer have a society to speak of, or one that bears any resemblance to what we have today. Number two, the slippery slope is a logical fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps-no, undoubtedly-I came off like a dick when I said, "fuck them if they can't take a joke". I would never purposely insult someone, in any way, unless I did so to their face so they could at least know I was doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all of that is moot. Words mean things, they are not however a license to cause violence or destruction (I'm not putting words into your mouth and saying you were suggesting they are, I'm just saying in general). There may be a debate about whether inflammatory language leading to violence days, weeks, or years after it is made, can be considered "yelling fire in a theater".
      </p>
      <p>
       It was wrong when people demanded Salman Rushdie to retract The Satanic Verses under penalty of death (of which an Iranian cleric this week has now raised the monetary reward for finally delivering). It was wrong when the worlds media cowardly refused to print the Muhammed cartoons. South Park, etc. Freedom of speech and expression are the only thing separating us from every other tinhorn dictatorship in the world, and one that I would expect many of the millions of immigrants who try to come to this country every year believe is the best thing about it.

       I'm all about laughing but you do have a point about knowing when and when not to make jokes. The youth do need discipline, unfortunately one of the best places to learn it from will probably get them killed (military).
Tolerance and respect are what we all should practice to keep from letting tptb divide &amp; conquer.

       Oh sorry, that was a joke about terrorist sympathizers who sympathized with with the recent outbreak of violent and murderous Muslim riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a riff on them citing that "emotions got in the way" causing them to kill a bunch of people.

       It was rhetoric that flew over your head, sorry buddy.

       I haven't seen anything on it recently either. Either Mossad has taken out everyone working on things near what Israel has, or the lid is on. Funny how few if any Israeli scientists in this area died.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you no doubt know, Israel does extensive bioweapon research and even some effort targeting the idea of killing  people if possible using genetic selectivity in the weapon. However, what will kill Arabs will kill those of Jewish descent too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure the intelligence services have carefully reviewed and analyzed the papers written by these people, looking for links in the subject areas. That would show what areas someone would want progress in, blocked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just saying, you don't see masses of plumbers dying mysteriously.

       "what is the purpose of a joke? In this case nothing but malice and spite"
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually I was just turning what friendlysoviet said on its head. If you notice, he responds to someones comment in which mossad is implicated with "Jews did it". He then implicates muslims in another comment. My joke was actually an attempt to show how absurd his reasoning was. I think in Latin this technique is called "reducto absurdum" or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as you see, my joke actually had a purpose.

       Couple of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a very well put argument, until the end. Number one, you put words into my mouth. I very much care about the degradation of society. However, to me freedom of speech trumps everything. Without it, we will no longer have a society to speak of, or one that bears any resemblance to what we have today. Number two, the slippery slope is a logical fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps-no, undoubtedly-I came off like a dick when I said, "fuck them if they can't take a joke". I would never purposely insult someone, in any way, unless I did so to their face so they could at least know I was doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all of that is moot. Words mean things, they are not however a license to cause violence or destruction (I'm not putting words into your mouth and saying you were suggesting they are, I'm just saying in general). There may be a debate about whether inflammatory language leading to violence days, weeks, or years after it is made, can be considered "yelling fire in a theater".
      </p>
      <p>
       It was wrong when people demanded Salman Rushdie to retract The Satanic Verses under penalty of death (of which an Iranian cleric this week has now raised the monetary reward for finally delivering). It was wrong when the worlds media cowardly refused to print the Muhammed cartoons. South Park, etc. Freedom of speech and expression are the only thing separating us from every other tinhorn dictatorship in the world, and one that I would expect many of the millions of immigrants who try to come to this country every year believe is the best thing about it.

       I'm all about laughing but you do have a point about knowing when and when not to make jokes. The youth do need discipline, unfortunately one of the best places to learn it from will probably get them killed (military).
Tolerance and respect are what we all should practice to keep from letting tptb divide &amp; conquer.
