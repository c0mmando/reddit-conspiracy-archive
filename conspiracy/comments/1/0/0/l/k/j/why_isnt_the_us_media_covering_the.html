       thank you. I am genuinely interested. Being 23 years old with no parents i barely know how to wipe my own ass and im really trying to learn as much about this crazy world as possible. Also, i figure i might as well try to make it easier on myself while i'm here and in tune to whatever the f is going on. Unlike soooo many of those around us.

       The whole thing seems very fishy. First a bunch of Zionists make a hit-and-run video to provoke Muslims against U.S. and then conveniently at the same time  appears a "private owner" who sells the islands to Japan's government resulting in riots in China. Then when the matter is attempted to settle down diplomatically,
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/16/japan-china-envoy-idUSL3E8KG07F20120916">
        Japan's ambassador mysteriously dies
       </a>
       . And of course most these things are missed by the Western media because all attention is concentrated on the rioting Muslims. The right questions to ask in a situation like this is not 'how' but 'why' and 'who would profit from this'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw. Does anyone know who was the private owner who sold the islands?

       Heres my answer...
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S Dollar is failing, the chinda and russian markets are pushing it farther and farther away from a point of return, and we are about to go into a war. The only smart economic choice the U.S has is what we did during the great depression. We need a massive war, so big that it will jump start our economy or completely destroy us. If we leave China and Russia out of this war, they will reap the profits, and leave us to hang. We need something that draws them in. The U.S used Japan to provoke china, hopefully japan and china will start fighting (this isn't very hard to do, with their backgrounds..) Between china and japan, india will jump in, since it has such a huge amount of money linked with the two, russia will jump in when we go into iran, Britain will help us and Israel, France will stick with Syria and iran, Lebanon and Kuwait will help us, because we have them by their balls.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is going to lower the amount of oil we are consuming, by directly raising the cost. I'm sure with the skyrocketing prices the U.S will probably do another save gas program like during WW2. People will start losing jobs, the dollar will start to crash. But then, as every economy slows down during war, our dollar will decline at a slower rate, allowing more time to build up by offering jobs for the upcoming war. I have a feeling Obama cannot do all this, it has to be Romney. He will most likely  start by supporting israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who profits? The same people that always do, the banks. 
Why? To slow our economic downfall.
How? Poking at the beast

       Thanks. I looked quite a bit into it. What I found is just greed and a mountain of human stupidity.

       It seems that islands were first time officially explored and claimed in 1900's by Koga Tatsushirō, from who the islands were seized by U.S. during the WW2 and returned back afterwards. This also marked the end of WW2 (it would be very ironic if it would also mark the beginning of WW3). In the 70's Tatsuhirō's descendents sold some of the islands to Kurihara family, who
       <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/303520/japan-owner-of-disputed-islands-wants-to-sell">
        have been leasing the islands to Japanese government
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The dispute here is all about money and resources.
       <a href="http://jcp.or.jp/english/jps_2010/20101004_senkaku.html">
        No one made any objections for 75 years against Japan claiming the ownership
       </a>
       until in the 1969 potential oil and gas reserves were discovered. China then began claiming that Senkaku islands belonged to the Island of Formosa (Taiwan) which Japan unjustly seized during
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War">
        first Sino-Japanese War
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The conflict that is going on now started some months ago when a
       <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/719973/China-holding-back-strength-over-Diaoyu-Islands-for-now.aspx">
        Taiwanese ship with activists boarded the islands and proclaimed they belonged to China
       </a>
       . Other than people (
       <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120706000016&amp;amp;cid=1101">
        including some city counselor
       </a>
       ) being patriotic and stupid enough to do something like that, it's a tad weird that Taiwanese activists raised Chinese (PRC) flag rather than flag of Taiwan (ROC). This they later admitted was a simple mistake due to their alleged incapability of acquiring the right flag.

       The TV was on this morning tuned to "Good Morning America", the topics they covered while I sat there were some girl that sang a song at some store and got signed by a record company and Miley Cyrus' love tweets.

       that's just advertising. and since nobody likes to watch bad news, no advertiser puts money in a "bad news show". so, you don't get to see those news.

       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably due to the fact that the MSM is absolutely being saturated with Zionist war propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire morning, Fox news has had nothing but stock footage of Iranian missile tests, clips of Nut and Yahoo's war mongering interview, and veiled xenophobia.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are going to war folks, whether we like it or not.  Once Israel strikes IRan, Iran will retaliate by striking Israel and US bases, thus begins World War Z(ion).  Start stocking up on canned goods and potable water if you haven't already.

       Why stock up on water and canned goods though? Do you think this will affect the US immediately?

       A large number of Americans see Muslims as one big happy (or unhappy) group and many believe that organized Muslims attacked us on 9/11.  Most people don't know about the contention between the different Arab tribes.  So by focusing on burning flags and embassy attacks they can whip up the sentiment to go to war against Syria and Iran.

       The US is letting them tear at each other. It promoted this conflict, in an attempt to cause tension between the Japanese and Chinese. They cannot hope to pay back the trillions of debt to the Chinese, so they are trying to start a war in order to clear their debts. Everytime the Chinese and Japanese try to form an alliance, the US tries to cause tension.

       This all kinda reminds me of the end of a Jerry Springer show, where the guests are all onstage. It's really quiet for the most part and audience members are asking questions/making fun of just a few of the more outrageous guests, when all of the sudden, because no one is paying attention to them, someone off camera throws a chair.
      </p>
      <p>
       China threw a chair at Japan and upset the whole stage somewhat.

       Let me start this off by saying that this isn't going to turn into a war. (not to break up with conspiracy circle jerk)
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some research on Dokdo Island (South Korea) and Japanese, and the tension that place has.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only logical thing I can think of is China trying to stop Japan from expanding its trade routes on the sea. When you own a portion of sea that trade-ships have to travel through, you are subject to their rules, their taxes. The fact that it was privately owned before disallowed Japan from enforcing regulations (because the land wasn't technically theirs).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Japan says Dokdo is theirs? -Trade Routes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason China says Senkaku is theirs? -Trades Routes.
      </p>

       for me it's obvious you don't get your news from TV anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       that's just advertising. and since nobody likes to watch bad news, no advertiser puts money in a "bad news show". so, you don't get to see those news.

       Thanks. I looked quite a bit into it. What I found is just greed and a mountain of human stupidity.

       It seems that islands were first time officially explored and claimed in 1900's by Koga Tatsushirō, from who the islands were seized by U.S. during the WW2 and returned back afterwards. This also marked the end of WW2 (it would be very ironic if it would also mark the beginning of WW3). In the 70's Tatsuhirō's descendents sold some of the islands to Kurihara family, who
       <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/303520/japan-owner-of-disputed-islands-wants-to-sell">
        have been leasing the islands to Japanese government
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The dispute here is all about money and resources.
       <a href="http://jcp.or.jp/english/jps_2010/20101004_senkaku.html">
        No one made any objections for 75 years against Japan claiming the ownership
       </a>
       until in the 1969 potential oil and gas reserves were discovered. China then began claiming that Senkaku islands belonged to the Island of Formosa (Taiwan) which Japan unjustly seized during

       </a>
       ) being patriotic and stupid enough to do something like that, it's a tad weird that Taiwanese activists raised Chinese (PRC) flag rather than flag of Taiwan (ROC). This they later admitted was a simple mistake due to their alleged incapability of acquiring the right flag.
