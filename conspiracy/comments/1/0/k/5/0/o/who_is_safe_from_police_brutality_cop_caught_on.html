    <div class="md"><p>Heeey 9000Sins, it&#39;s not police&#39;s problem. The root is the justice system. If cops were accountable for their actions, they would abide the law.</p>

<p>But as the situation is right now, they can do whatever they want. Worst thing that can happen to them, is a paid vacation. I don&#39;t blame them. It&#39;s the judges and state attorneys responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s everyone&#39;s problem and everyone&#39;s responsibility to reign in people and groups who are pushing themselves or flaunting their power.  </p>

<p>The system allows for it because WE allow it.  It&#39;s like a dog we&#39;ve let off leash and now no one wants to get get the dog because it nips at people.</p>

<p>9000 is showing how the system is broken for getting this bad.  Not that &quot;cops are bad&quot; or &quot;fuck the pigs&quot; because that as you&#39;ve said is not entirely their fault or the whole issue.  It&#39;s all about waking up and taking back our power/control.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only problem here, is that the way of the citizen is the non-violent way, which happens to be non-effective. </p>

<p>And if any random guy in the videos above interacted to stop this cruelty from happening, he would have gotten a jail time of several years for assaulting a police officer.</p>

<p>So there is really no way to stop this except of being armed and to have made peace with the world, because every day you go outside, could be the day you are being illegally confronted by a police officer and thus have to deal with him the oldschool way. </p>

<p>But if police officers bug others around, will you be the first to intervene to spent time in jail?</p>

<p>Another solution is a line I remember from Jesse Ventura. He once said, that Navy Seals never get mad. They get even.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one watches the watchmen. </p>

<p>I look at it this way.  there are roughly 311 million Americans, of  which 225 million are over the age of 18.  Of those 225 million Americans, 122 Million voted in the last presidential election, roughly 54%. this is the highest number in many years (up 5% +/-) from the previous year. </p>

<p>That being said, the average turnout for non presidential (federal) elections is around 37%.  </p>

<p>We fill those smaller ticket seats with Tea-baggers and corporate shills and then we wonder why we aren&#39;t represented in our representative government.     you want to change the laws at your city level?  get involved and work to change them.  put a police chief in that will be a better servant.  hire a decent mayor, alderman, comptroller, etc.  elect decent judges. </p>

<p>Face it, you get what you pay for, and if you don&#39;t get involved, they you get what someone else paid for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not disagree a bit, unfortunately.  I think the only thing that would convince these types at this point (and there are many) is someone they know or someone close to them getting killed by the American Gestapo right in front of their very faces or something.  Unfortunately, I have a feeling that even <em>then</em>, they would either somehow literally find a way to still (fucking <em>somehow</em>) rationalize their way out of the real truth (they&#39;d somehow tell themselves that their loved one getting killed right in front of their face by TPTB was a one time anomaly only and not indicative of how things &quot;really&quot; are or something) or they would finally, once and for all, wake up and see just how deep and real the bullshit evil runs in this country...and they would simply freak the fuck out.  They&#39;d go into &quot;Death Shellshock&quot; mode and just do nothing.  They&#39;d go wide-eyed, huddle up in a corner, and just shiver away because their mind can&#39;t handle just how different reality is from the lilly-livered, frosty-colored lie they grew up allowing themselves to be convinced things were like and that they ridiculed so many others for trying to help break them from.</p>
