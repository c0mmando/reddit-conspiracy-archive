       America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, “It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.” It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: “if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?” There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Kurt Vonnegut, 1969

       Vonnegut, while an entertaining author, is wrong here.  While it can be hard to get rich, it's not hard to make money.  Him going on to project his own unhappiness on others, and his misunderstanding of the humility that the sign in the bar targets defies reason and is a sign of his self anointed elitist thinking.
      </p>

       This was written when LBJ's great society was barely underway.  He hadn't seen nuthin' yet.

       Vonnegut's argument dies there.  So it goes.

       So people in America are poor because they're lazy? Or is there some other flaw in their character to blame?

       I'm suggesting that people not being rich does not make them poor.  Plus  there is a difference between being poor and being broke.  Furthermore, yes, some people are poor because they are lazy, and they may indeed have other flaws in their character, to boot.

       I also finished by pointing out that Vonnegut wrote what he did when many obstacles to building wealth weren't as complicated as they are now due to the development of the welfare state.

       I'm using the term "poor" in relation to other developed countries (not in relation to some place like rural China). So, yeah, not broke but without means to live a comfortable life and save for retirement.

       The number of people in the US living below the poverty level has been growing. They're probably not getting more lazy. Seems like other factors are at work: globalization and the financial crisis being the two that first come to mind.

      <p>
       What are the current obstacles, as you see them, to wealth building? Red tape? Employee deductions? Taxes re pretty low in the US compared to other developed countries. There's been a lot of financial deregulation that's enabled a lot of folks to get rich if they don't mind a bit of skullduggery. The Fed dished out $16 trillion to connected folks which means there's a lot of money floating around.
