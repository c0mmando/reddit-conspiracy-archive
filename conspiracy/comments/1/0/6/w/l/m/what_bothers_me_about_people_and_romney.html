        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-09-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/railroadwino.html">railroadwino</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You see all this vehement white guilt about what a shithead Romney is and how his opinions and policies are out of touch, to put it mildly. For example: &quot;John Stewart tears Romney a new asshole&quot;, &quot;Romney&#39;s economic plan would destroy the first world&quot;, &quot;Romney wants your tweens virginity&quot; etc etc. Just a bunch of people playing partisan and trashing Romney for Obama&#39;s sake. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing I want to tell all those earnest fuckers: <strong>It&#39;s by design.</strong> Romney is this election years McCain. He is <em>supposed</em> to be a caricature of rich whiteness. It makes Obama look that much more proletariat and relatable even though he fronts for the banks/whathaveyou. I suspect - but don&#39;t want to say definitively - that Obama in office 8 years has been the game plan all along because honestly I see no way Romney can win this thing. If I knew a bookie who took political bets, <em>all</em> my money would be on Obama even though the payoff would be lousy since it&#39;s pretty patent to anyone paying attention. </p>

<p>The GOP isn&#39;t stupid. Romney as he is currently portrayed is an absolute noncontender to Obama. No crying-in-their-granola liberal is going to forgo voting for a charismatic black man even if Romney had better policies. And no minority is going to put another old tradition white guy into office over Obama. </p>

<p>It all reeks of being contrived, is what I&#39;m saying. I wish people could see past Obama&#39;s abilities as an entertainer and realize he&#39;s going to fuck us just as much as Romney. It&#39;ll just go down easier as you&#39;re being waterboarded.</p>

<p>Note: I know this is pretty conversational but fuck it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Too bad your average sheeple...&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking hard man. I&#39;ve been one of the lucky ones who had a father who taught me to question authority and to try to look the past smoke and mirrors, and it has taken me a long time to see these things. These scumbags play with powerful emotions and they know it. We all love our country and want to see it thrive and see the people thrive and not be taken advantage of. Even knowing all of this I still have a voice/feeling in my head that feels that worse things will happen under Romney than under Obama. Since about 2009 I too have gotten the feeling that just about everything about top tier politics is contrived and scripted.</p>

<p>What we need is a true radical. Not radical in the sense of being dangerous physically. Radical in the sense of breaking with the political norm. Which today means ass fucking the people who voted you into office.</p>

<p>As of this year I&#39;ve been seriously considering voting for 3rd party candidates. Obama isn&#39;t going to miss my vote...</p>

<p>I do not think Obama will fuck as much as Romney, but I do not think Obama is a saint either.</p>

<p>The thing is, the Obama &#39;choice&#39; is basically pigeon-holed because of the two party nonsensical system we have in place, where the only way we can prevent terrible, is to have <em>slightly</em> less terrible.  Our party system is a fucking joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally, someone elucidating what I have thought since the GOPs utter joke of a candidate came on the scene. </p>

<p>Bookies would agree with you too...in LV the other day a bet on Romney would pay, iirc, 3 to 1.</p>

<p>When the puppet on the right sends himself careening off the rails, who can you go to? The puppet on the left.</p>

<p>Third-party candidates are irrelevant in this process. I know that it sucks...but its simply reality. None of it is what it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been thinking the same thing, but I think there is more going on.
I believe that the far right globalist want a big war so NATO and the U.S. can whoop ass while they still can putting them in a dominant position for the remainder of the century. Obama and even W have not delivered on this they would like Romney to at least be perceived as electable so they can steal an election. If Romney can&#39;t pull this off I would expect to see some extreme effort made to force Obamas hand or an assassination.</p>

<p>Eastern countries are set to rival western countries in technological and industrial capability in the coming decades so the right wing hawks feel there is only a narrow window in which to act if the west is going to retain economic and political dominance.</p>

<p>I think we are still looking at the PNAC scenario just expanded to include euro powers.</p>

They are the same basic party, and they have to be in order for both of them to survive.
