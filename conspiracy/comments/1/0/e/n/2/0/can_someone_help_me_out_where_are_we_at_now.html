    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the future. They will phase out cash because..., well, because it&#39;s hard to track someone who pays for things with cash. I&#39;ve heard of employers requiring people to give them their FB password. I wonder what their reaction will be to the people who don&#39;t have a Facebook page. I wonder if in the future people will be required to have one and to log what they&#39;ve been doing and who they&#39;ve been talking to. I know this seems hysterical to some people, but I&#39;m really angry and depressed about the culture of just giving up on privacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that &#39;privacy&#39; is now a <em>bad word</em> and anyone stating doubts about it immediately tagged as an old fart at best and as a potentially suspicious at worst is quite disheartening.</p>

<p>Right now the new generations are coming of age in an era when total transparency of their activities is the cool thing. Too late to reconsider it when a naughty pic or text comes out and wrecks their social/family life and in some cases lands them in legal hell for the rest of their lives. To say nothing of how it will be in the future when a topless or dick shot might notl be the problem, but credit, employment, activism and medical history will be easily collated and used by everyone from employers to crooks to make everything from getting a job to getting credit or a passport quite difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand those reactions. People seem to only wake up to these things after they&#39;ve been <em>burned</em> somehow.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you can now &quot;hear&quot; it first-hand from somebody.</p>

<p>The largest IT recruiting firm in the USA, Robert Half Technologies, asked me for my Facebook login info during an interview.</p>

<p>Until that time, the interview was going great. Lots of questions, telling me specifics about the job that I was &quot;starting on Monday,&quot; etc etc. </p>

<p>Near the close of the interview I was asked for my login info. I told them &quot;Well, you are certainly welcome to look over my Facebook info and I&#39;ll even &quot;friend&quot; you if you&#39;d like. However, I give my login info to NOBODY, so I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t accommodate that request.&quot;</p>

<p>After 7 unreturned emails and 5 unreturned voicemails, I finally contacted the recruiter&#39;s boss and asked why I wasn&#39;t being called back for a job that I was told that I already had and filled out tax information for?</p>

<p>I was told that the end-user &quot;changed their minds&quot; but I&#39;d be called back that week for another assignment--promise!</p>

<p>3 months later...never heard from them again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A previous boss of mine at a top law firm said that the reason they wanted employees to know someone&#39;s Facebook (not login info) was because while you worked for them, you represented them. They wanted to make sure you weren&#39;t bad mouthing previous or current employers, other coworkers, or just doing anything that would embarrass the firm.</p>

<p>I think at a company that would rely a lot on advertising, they&#39;d want people to have Facebook simply because having thousands of friends is a great advertising tool or immediate proof that you&#39;re <em>somewhat</em> social. A lot of people who have Facebook also treat it like Twitter, where you constantly know what&#39;s going on with them, where they are, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so incredibly easy to track people in today&#39;s world, cutting out Facebook or using cash won&#39;t be enough alone.</p>

<p>There really are companies out there who are very into advertising and social media advertising, who won&#39;t even look at your application if you don&#39;t have a Facebook/Twitter - because they feel like you can&#39;t connect in all the ways that others could who are familiar with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, couldn&#39;t be more correct.</p>

<p>I can understand if you <em>have</em> Facebook, employers not wanting defamation or anything like that, but to require it or their login information is really just disgusting. I don&#39;t know how anyone becomes okay with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean?  I definately agree with your points.  Facebook has almost become intertwined with society, i feel like i get the same judgement for not using social media as if i didnt wear shoes.  I think electronic over cash is really just for convenience for both parties.   On a side note it is illegal to have a minimum $ for credit, or atleast that is what i my local cashier said.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>People are now vilified</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Who is vilified? &quot;People&quot; means nothing.</li>
</ul>

<p>If <em>you</em> are vilified, look for a healthier environment.</p>

<p>If somebody else, it&#39;s none of your business - let them live their own life and make their own decisions unless they explicitly ask you for help.</p>

<p>Now, everything from here to the end of the comment may sound cold and harsh, but I have no negative feelings towards you or anyone else. It&#39;s intended as a relief:</p>

<p>Nobody can help you, because nobody cares about you, and if somebody does, it&#39;s because you are a step on the way to their profits, material or spiritual.</p>

<p>Life is a war and you are alone. Nobody but you is responsible for you. Your best &quot;friends&quot; can&#39;t put your interests above theirs simply because their design does not afford for this.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t trust anything, no matter how well it is presented. It&#39;s a war, when disinformation abounds. You <em>must</em> doubt everything that comes from the outside, including responses to your question. Including this one. The only thing you must never doubt is your own judgment.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody has more authority than you</strong>. It&#39;s right if you feel it&#39;s right. If you want to have no Facebook account, go ahead. If you want to use cash, go ahead. This is your only life, not a rehearsal - do something you want before it&#39;s over, no matter what you are taught and told.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually Im glad RFID and smart-card stuff is getting more prevalent</p>

<p>it makes rebelling against the government so much easier!</p>

<p>Thieves and professional fraudsters in the UK are already making bank stealing peoples information via RFID readers.  You can now get a persons CC number and other info just by standing next to them in is a subway or on a sidewalk waiting for a light</p>

<p>this means more cash and when cash is phased out anonymous bulk purchases of goods that always lead back to the person whose ID you stole and not you and if they get shafted for it? Then they will turn into an insurgent overnight!</p>

<p>people are already developing ways to beat facial recognition software so as long as you have the right tools at your disposal then being a revolutionary or even just a plain old criminal will be easier in this world because there will no longer be any intelligent gumshoe detectives to track you down all the security forces will be fat retards who rely completely on the technology to do their job for them</p>
