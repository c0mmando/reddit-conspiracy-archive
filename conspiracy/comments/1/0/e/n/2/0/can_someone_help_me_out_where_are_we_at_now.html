       It's the future. They will phase out cash because..., well, because it's hard to track someone who pays for things with cash. I've heard of employers requiring people to give them their FB password. I wonder what their reaction will be to the people who don't have a Facebook page. I wonder if in the future people will be required to have one and to log what they've been doing and who they've been talking to. I know this seems hysterical to some people, but I'm really angry and depressed about the culture of just giving up on privacy.

       Yes, that 'privacy' is now a
       <em>
        bad word
       </em>
       and anyone stating doubts about it immediately tagged as an old fart at best and as a potentially suspicious at worst is quite disheartening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the new generations are coming of age in an era when total transparency of their activities is the cool thing. Too late to reconsider it when a naughty pic or text comes out and wrecks their social/family life and in some cases lands them in legal hell for the rest of their lives. To say nothing of how it will be in the future when a topless or dick shot might notl be the problem, but credit, employment, activism and medical history will be easily collated and used by everyone from employers to crooks to make everything from getting a job to getting credit or a passport quite difficult.

       I don't understand those reactions. People seem to only wake up to these things after they've been
       <em>
        burned

       somehow. I have actually encountered people who use the
       <em>
        If you've done nothing wrong then you should have nothing to hide.

       argument for being apathetic to what's going on now.

       That argument is completely insane, and what is scary is that people buy into it and parrot it like it's the truth. It does not matter if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't have to prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We used to subscribe to innocent until proven guilty. Now it's everyone is guilty until you can prove you aren't. That is ludicrous.

       People think it won't affect them because they have nothing to hide.   Wait until they are water boarded because someone with non conforming religious or political views is linked to their Facebook page.

       It's not just that. Imagine you only have a card for your bank account. You buy food, water and everything else with it. If you're found to be dissenting the card simply stops working and you don't eat or drink or do anything else. It's the ultimate blackmail.

       Well, you can now "hear" it first-hand from somebody.
      </p>
      <p>
       The largest IT recruiting firm in the USA, Robert Half Technologies, asked me for my Facebook login info during an interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until that time, the interview was going great. Lots of questions, telling me specifics about the job that I was "starting on Monday," etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Near the close of the interview I was asked for my login info. I told them "Well, you are certainly welcome to look over my Facebook info and I'll even "friend" you if you'd like. However, I give my login info to NOBODY, so I'm sorry but I can't accommodate that request."
      </p>
      <p>
       After 7 unreturned emails and 5 unreturned voicemails, I finally contacted the recruiter's boss and asked why I wasn't being called back for a job that I was told that I already had and filled out tax information for?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was told that the end-user "changed their minds" but I'd be called back that week for another assignment--promise!
      </p>
      <p>
       3 months later...never heard from them again.

       Facebook is already in decline.  They don't offer anything new and do not innovate.  Just look at the joke that has become their stock.  Whatever is next, as Facebook was next after MySpace, will be even more connected to everything you do, or should do.  That is when people will truly be ostricized for not being on their grid.

       Whenever they say something like this, that means we should all start doing it.  We should all drop out of facebook, and we should all start using cash for everything.  We should also use all those words online that they tell us put us on certain lists.

       Not just one world currency. It's all digital. If there is no physical cash. The numbers can be made up even easier than the paper money is printed. Plus, it cost money to print money. It's a recession. Even the elite are looking for ways to save loot.

       True, I hadn't thought of that.  Fractional banking could be pushed way beyond what it is now.  Right now they have to at least pretend that they have something to back up federal notes.

       It is not media hype. Your privacy and freedom is being stripped away at an incredible rate and all in the name of keeping you safe (so they would like us to believe) from a threat which is statistically as likely as getting killed by lightning.

       A previous boss of mine at a top law firm said that the reason they wanted employees to know someone's Facebook (not login info) was because while you worked for them, you represented them. They wanted to make sure you weren't bad mouthing previous or current employers, other coworkers, or just doing anything that would embarrass the firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think at a company that would rely a lot on advertising, they'd want people to have Facebook simply because having thousands of friends is a great advertising tool or immediate proof that you're
       <em>
        somewhat
       </em>
       social. A lot of people who have Facebook also treat it like Twitter, where you constantly know what's going on with them, where they are, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so incredibly easy to track people in today's world, cutting out Facebook or using cash won't be enough alone.

       I can't speak on behalf of all companies by any means lol, I can only speak from personal experience. I've just heard stories either on Reddit or from personal friends, and it's pretty much how it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got more than a few handfuls of friends on my Facebook who post
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       location they go to. Restaurant/gas station/school/work/back home..
      </p>
      <p>
       There really are companies out there who are very into advertising and social media advertising, who won't even look at your application if you don't have a Facebook/Twitter - because they feel like you can't connect in all the ways that others could who are familiar with it.

       What do you mean?  I definately agree with your points.  Facebook has almost become intertwined with society, i feel like i get the same judgement for not using social media as if i didnt wear shoes.  I think electronic over cash is really just for convenience for both parties.   On a side note it is illegal to have a minimum $ for credit, or atleast that is what i my local cashier said.

       Now, everything from here to the end of the comment may sound cold and harsh, but I have no negative feelings towards you or anyone else. It's intended as a relief:
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody can help you, because nobody cares about you, and if somebody does, it's because you are a step on the way to their profits, material or spiritual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is a war and you are alone. Nobody but you is responsible for you. Your best "friends" can't put your interests above theirs simply because their design does not afford for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't trust anything, no matter how well it is presented. It's a war, when disinformation abounds. You
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       doubt everything that comes from the outside, including responses to your question. Including this one. The only thing you must never doubt is your own judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Nobody has more authority than you
       </strong>
       . It's right if you feel it's right. If you want to have no Facebook account, go ahead. If you want to use cash, go ahead. This is your only life, not a rehearsal - do something you want before it's over, no matter what you are taught and told.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       Actually Im glad RFID and smart-card stuff is getting more prevalent
      </p>
      <p>
       it makes rebelling against the government so much easier!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thieves and professional fraudsters in the UK are already making bank stealing peoples information via RFID readers.  You can now get a persons CC number and other info just by standing next to them in is a subway or on a sidewalk waiting for a light
      </p>
      <p>
       this means more cash and when cash is phased out anonymous bulk purchases of goods that always lead back to the person whose ID you stole and not you and if they get shafted for it? Then they will turn into an insurgent overnight!
      </p>
      <p>
       people are already developing ways to beat facial recognition software so as long as you have the right tools at your disposal then being a revolutionary or even just a plain old criminal will be easier in this world because there will no longer be any intelligent gumshoe detectives to track you down all the security forces will be fat retards who rely completely on the technology to do their job for them
