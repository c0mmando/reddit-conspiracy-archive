       Title says it all. I highly doubt most of the conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11 and I would like to hear legitimate arguments in their favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: posting a 2 hour documentary or long article is ridiculous. Point out specific things from those articles/videos and back up the claims you make.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit2: this was clearly a mistake to ask for rational arguments here (I've already been called a "corporate slave", "sheep", "fucking slave", etc. just for asking for a debate), I guess I'll be seeing myself out.

       nobody gives a shit about your opinion. we're not gonna go out of our way to show you obvious problems with the official story of 9/11. it may sound weird but you actually have to do your own research to get the answers you want. who woulda known?

       I'd love to know how you figured out what the bias is before even watching the film.  These are experts in the field of architecture and engineering.  I think their opinions might serve you better than some stranger's on Reddit.

       This video just talks about the physics of it all.  Not engineering I guess but physics.  It also doesn't pretend to know who did it or why or any of that, it just simply stakes a claim that is supported by the laws of physics.

       Unfortunately not all three buildings had kinks. How many buildings fell on 9-11 do you know? How many steel buildings have fell straight down into their own footprint due to fire? Offer proof and evidence of your answers thanks. I don't want to have to read or watch a video though.

       No, it only happened for first time once that day. After the first building fell the other buildings would not have been the first buildings to collapse from massive fire damage. They would have been the second and third respectively.

        Are you literally saying there was explosives in the building?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, lots of things explode besides "explosives." An explosion simply requires the presence of some flammable material, an ignition, and a, confined space capable of sustaining sufficient pressure. For example battery backup systems are a common explosive risk in office environments because the batteries can produce hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas + enclosed area + fire = explosion.

       LOL @ your "hard facts." It's full of some guy CLAIMING he's stating hard facts but giving the viewer no way of verifying a single thing he says. Furthermore his "fireworks" example relies on shitty logic - just because one thing can cause an observed effect does not mean it is the only thing that can cause that effect. There is no reason to think that only explosives planted by government conspirators could cause debris to be launched upward, and in fact there is a much simpler, more straightforward explanation for that phenomenon that the video completely ignores.

       Why would they have to pretend that? According to you they DID level the entire complex with bombs. So why not just plant bombs and say "welp, I guess the terrorist muslims planted the bombs?" Why invent this convoluted plot with airplanes if the airplanes aren't even going to bring down the buildings?

      <p>
       No, that's an accurate characterization of how the video establishes one of its crucial "hard facts": it tells you to imagine what fireworks look like, then tells you that only an "explosion" could make debris fall like that. Not only does that insult my intelligence (since it confuses necessary and sufficient conditions), it is directly contradicted by the engineering studies that have stated that a collapsing building would have created tremendous downward pressure that would have pushed columns of air upward and outward, causing the debris to fall in the pattern seen in the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, your video is extremely stupid. It
assumes the viewer is an imbecile who can't distinguish necessary and sufficient conditions, and it assumes the viewer is ignorant of alternative explanations that are simpler, involve fewer assumptions and require fewer leaps of logic.

       So why the hell didn't they put some Iraqis on those planes? I mean using airplanes was retarded enough (and you STILL haven't explained why they would have done that), but using Saudis to frame Saddam? The conspirators were able to orchestrate a complex plan involving presumably hundreds if not thousands of people (not one of whom has spoken up in the decade since the event occurred) to plant bombs, train hijackers, install remote control devices in places, shoot missles at the pentagon,  and bury all the evidence, but they couldn't find even ONE IRAQI to help them out?

       Of course not. Of all the arguments you could possibly make about 9/11, "it never happened before" seems like one of the dumbest.

       But by all means, do post more animated gifs in support of your campaign for 9/11 truth.

       Circular reasoning. That might have been part of the collapse. It's only "before the collapse" if you define "the collapse" to exclude other ancillary events related to the destruction of the buildings.

       Yea but debris and fire isn't enough to make it fall that way.  In 1975 there where fires in a wtc that burned out of control for several hours, no weakened steel, no structural damage.  Only superficial stuff. The original explosion of jet fuel on 9/11 would be hot but just for a bit, and as you can see from the video, most of the fuel was on fire outside of the building. so the remaining fire is just your standard office fire, and in number sevens case it didn't even get the assistance of a plane hitting it.  I feel the need to say this in every post here: I am not crazy and I like good debate, I'm not going to call you a sheep or get mad.  I just feel that the official story has holes in it.  There are things that don't make sense, however, I do not pretend to know who did it or why, as there isn't enough evidence of anything to prove that.  I hope that we can have an intelligent conversation.

       Every building is different. If the other buildings weren't built like WTC 7, or the fires weren't as intense, or the fires weren't allowed to burn out of control for so long, then there's no basis for comparison.

       Not at all. You (usually) can't prove a negative, so I would never expect you prove that no other building
having the same design WTC 7 has experienced comparable levels of damage. I would simply point out that no one has ever identified such a building.

       Yes, and due to the lack of exact replica, I am giving you one here.  Instead of being super stringent, I am saying find me anything even close.  It could be from older times, when codes weren't as strict, as long as it has a steel frame and support system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seperate side note.  The fire I did reference (albeit in the wrong building) that DID happen in the larger building, happened with no structural issues, on a much lower floor (the 11th) with a loooooot more weight to bear than where the plane fire happened (the 99th ish).  Yet 9/11 is the one that caused collapse?

       Here is a video, from a physicist explaining the things that dont add up.  Just about the way it falls.  He, Like me, doesn't pretend to know who did it or why, just that shit doesn't add up.

       I'm the one being "stringent." If the other building was constructed differently, or the fire was not as intense, it's useless for comparison. There is absolutely no scientific value in comparing two buildings with fundamentally different characteristics, especially when it is officially r those characteristics (building design, intensity of fires) that are alleged to account for the different outcomes.

       Ok so this is a waste of time.  Because the fact that even lesser buildings built to lower standards not falling from fire is thrown out to to the lack of comparability.  I understand your want to find something exact, but I know that that is not realistic.  There isn't enough buildings of exact same make that have been on fire the exact same way.  Simply put: my point is that even buildings with a weaker design that have been in worse fires don't structurally collapse in all the way down on their own footprint.  That's all i'm saying.

       It doesn't have to be exact. Just reasonably comparable on the three variables that matter: building design/construction, intensity of fire, length of uncontrolled fire.

       Yes however, there are instances of weaker buildings burning for longer, and only partial collapse. For example, the Windsor Tower in Madrid.

       Building on fire for 24 hours and you get your collapse.  But only partially, and not just falling all at once.  Not quite apples to apples but I am giving you the benefit of the doubt, as American Buildings generally are built to a stricter code and the wtc fires didn't last nearly as long.

       It's not an issue of "weak" vs "strong." The issue is HOW the building was designed, and whether a building with the same basic design would respond to a similar fire of similar intensity for a similar duration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore you have no way of judging whether a particular building was "weaker" if you did not subject it to the same conditions. And if you did subject it to those conditions, and it did not collapse, that might mean that it was not in fact "weaker." That's why it's pointless to compare buildings with different designs: because you can't draw any conclusions based on that comparison. For all you know that other building was not actually "weaker," because it did not actually collapse.

       If your definition of weaker is merely based on the outcome and not the way it is built than that is to say that no two buildings are anything alike at all and we are to learn nothing from even the closest comparisons we have.  If you are ok with that than good for you.

       I agree that it's pretty stupid to try and draw conclusions from comparisons, since you will probably never find any truly compatable events. It makes much more sense to look at what actually happened and explain why it's impossible for fire to bring down a building like that.

       to some extent yes, but the heat in the steel would have to radiate through it, therefore it would carry the heat therefore making it glow.  its being heated from the inside and has to radiate out. And I think this is all besides the point,

       <p>
        The fire is the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse.  Even today, the media report (and 
many scientists believe) that the steel melted.  It is argued that the jet fuel burns very hot, especially 
with so much fuel present.  This is not true....  The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not 
unusual, and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel.
        <br/>
        In combustion science, there are three basic types of flames, namely, a jet burner, a pre-mixed flame, 
and a diffuse flame....  In a diffuse flame, the fuel and the oxidant are not mixed before ignition, but 
flow together in an uncontrolled manner and combust when the fuel/oxidant ratios reach values within 
the flammable range.  A fireplace is a diffuse flame burning in air, as was the WTC fire.  Diffuse flames 
generate the lowest heat intensities of the three flame types...  The maximum flame temperature 
increase for burning hydrocarbons (jet fuel) in air is, thus, about 1000 °C -- hardly sufficient to 
melt steel at 1500 °C.

        to some extent yes, but the heat in the steel would have to radiate through it, therefore it would carry the heat therefore making it glow.

       Ok so take jet fuel out of it, it doesn't change the properties of steel and the max temperatures present with the given ingredients.  Furthermore, it doesn't change the fact that there where materials present made by temperatures far to hot given the circumstances.

       Circular reasoning. You're assuming (without evidence) that circumstances preclude high enough temperatures to severely weaken steel.

       A fire is a reaction of things.  A fire can only burn as hot as the fuel its given will make it burn.  Based on the ingredients of a fire you can know its temperature.  We are left with one conclusion: If the fire burned hot enough to melt steel, there are more things being burned than we are being told about, as the given ingredients do not burn at a temperature high enough to melt steel. also, just because you didn't claim it doesn't mean no one ever did.

       It didn't have to "melt" steel to make the buildings collapse. It only had to weaken it enough that it couldn't do its job.

       Wait are you going to say that I am doing that?? I have brought up several point that you have yet to respond to.  If you would have looked at my sources you would see that with the way physics work, even if the top section did collapse, it wouldn't be enough to bring the whole thing down.  It would stop pretty soon after it started, and the top section would fall off the side.  Frankly, you don't source one single thing, you claim that I cherry pick when actually you have been doing it this whole time, so I am over it.  I was hoping to have an intelligent conversation but you do not want to have one.  have a good day.

       I'm not the one discarding conventional theories. In order to prove it was an inside job you have to first show that the conventional explanation is clearly untenable, which you fail to do every time you post some amateurish spiel that mischaracterizes the conventional explanation.

       Not with the likes of you.  It take two intelligent people.   Unfortunately, when people want to just insult it is no longer intelligent.  You sir, are just like the crazy people on this thread who immediately scream ZIONIST BANKS AHHHH YOUR A SHEEP, only you are the other end. When one has to resort to insulting, they are fully aware they are losing an argument, they are just upset.  I see you have been studying the ways of Bill O'reilly.   Have fun with that.

       collision physics.  plane wings do not slice through steel beams.   the aluminum plane can not penetrate steel without deforming or slowing down, but we observe this on the videos.    It could not be a commercial airplane - again the laws of physics don't apply on sept. 11 2001.

       the demolition of WTC7 is quite obvious to me.  there is no mechanism for uneven fires and damage to result in free fall acceleration during collapse.   explosives were never tested for.  don't bother asking me for evidence unless you can grant me special prosecutor and subpoena powers (might need guantanamo and some waterboarding to boot.)

       Don't come here expecting intelligent debate.  You get more than 2 layers deep and these guys are lost.  They are into conspiracies because real life events and the context surrounding them are too hard.  It is far easier to blame the Jews and then call anyone still asking questions a Mossad or government agent.  Ask to boys here, they have already "confirmed" (they have no idea what that word means) that I am a paid shill for Israel.

       Since you are butthurt about it, let me explain. We are not here to dance for your entertainment. You can't come in, clap your hands and ask us to start an argument. You might want to come up with an argument of your own. I don't think you're a slave but you certainly present yourself as lazy.

       dude I'm sorry I posted a video about the physics aspect of this in a respectfull manner without name calling and no one responded.  There are fanatics who flip out but that is not all of us.  To blanket statement is to show a laziness of the mind.

       I am trying to have good convo.  I'm being sane and rational and not just yelling sheep.  No one is responding to me.  Not everyone in r/conspiracy is a crazy tin foil wearing nut job.  I like the truth, and I don't pretent to have it, but I feel like the truth should hold up to questions and from what I see the official story doesnt . I am not pretending to know what happened or why, all I an see is that there are errors in the official story which leads my to having questions.  That is all.  I hope I am wrong to not trust I really do.  But I do not see evidence enough to convince me I am.

       Circular reasoning. That might have been part of the collapse. It's only "before the collapse" if you define "the collapse" to exclude other ancillary events related to the destruction of the buildings.

       any building any time.  From a fire.  Yes sorry getting two points mixed up.  So yes: any skyscraper that was caused a colapse by fire.  Office fires are all burning from pretty similar sources.  Come on there's got to be one!

        Yes however, there are instances of weaker buildings burning for longer,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not an issue of "weak" vs "strong." The issue is HOW the building was designed, and whether a building with the same basic design would respond to a similar fire of similar intensity for a similar duration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore you have no way of judging whether a particular building was "weaker" if you did not subject it to the same conditions. And if you did subject it to those conditions, and it did not collapse, that might mean that it was not in fact "weaker." That's why it's pointless to compare buildings with different designs: because you can't draw any conclusions based on that comparison. For all you know that other building was not actually "weaker," because it did not actually collapse.
