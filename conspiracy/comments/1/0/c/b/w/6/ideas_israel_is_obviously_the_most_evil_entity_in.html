       I will say this first: We don't support any form of violence or bigotry but enough is enough! The Zionist have to go and whining to the choir doesn't change anything. I am willing to be the change where others are not. What are some things that we can do that aren't violent or illegal. I would also like to mention I have over 2 million US dollars in savings but a large portion of my savings is not liquid and would take 6+ months to exchange to cash. What would you do if you were me?

       Zionism is an evil ideology, no doubt.  But to call it "the most evil entity in human history" is hyperbole.  (Assuming you're not a troll) If I were you I would create a non-profit organization that would offer awards to artists/playwrights/writers/poets to create art against the occupation, and in that way attempt to change public opinion.

       The pharmaceuticals are the big one though. I believe that Teva owns something like 33% of the generic market.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may sound stupid, but I call the pharmacy before I get a script filled. If they choose to fill with Teva generics I simply do business with one of the other 6 pharmacies in my area.

       We can tone down our language and avoid usernames such as "whitepride" because it really turns off the rational people out there who would otherwise be persuaded to not support Israel when presented with facts.

       White pride has nothing to do with racism. noone ever gets uptight when someone yells brown pride or black power or anything like that, and now white people have become a minority and we are now not allowed to be proud to be white or we are racist? that is just absurd.

       GTFO, scum. You don't support bigotry? What did you just say in response to a rap video? "More bullshit by a nigger jew who wants to keep us by the truth by raising fake conspiracies." Look we all know Israel is bad, but to say "Israel is obviously the most evil entity in human history." Is retarded hatemongering. Like the USA isn't responsible for any of this? Stop blurring the line between anti-zionist and Jew hater. We don't need you or your non-existent 2 million dollars.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First: I think you're likely a troll, because I don't think a multi-millionaire would post to this subreddit. But, giving the benefit of the doubt, here are some ideas I would suggest you consider....
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: Invest a lot of small amounts in a variety of alternative Internet startups. darknetplan and others could certainly benefit from only a small (relative to your claimed assets) donation - a few thousand dollars would go a long way for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third: Invest in grid-independent ideas and solutions, in general. A free bi-directional electric meter and a complimentary solar panel for anyone willing to commit to a relatively equal dollar amount of additional home electricity production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth: Like the alternative Internet solutions, I've seen many inquiries, suggestions, and ideas about alternative media outlets. These seem to face the biggest barriers to entry. The "little guy" can't get his toe in the door. A few hundred dollars - maybe a thousand or two - worth of sponsorship to get such ideas off the ground might bring about a resurgence of the freedom that reddit once represented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary: Anything - especially small things - that will liberate individuals from the serfdom of ZOG. Expect a lot of it to fail - i.e., be wasted money. But, if you truly have an interest in this, you should be willing to accept those losses in pursuit of success.
