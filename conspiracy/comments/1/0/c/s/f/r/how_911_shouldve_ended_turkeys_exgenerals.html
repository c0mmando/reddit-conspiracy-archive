    <div class="md"><p>Some says the Islamist party wanted to get ride of the secular opposition .  I&#39;m not quite sure what to believe, not much informed about Turkey in general , but that AKP is quite popular in Turkey . It might be both because there is too many people that were brought to trial kinda went overboard .</p>

<p>But it was funny seeing Israelis getting mad at some Turkish action series that made them the bad guy conspiring against the government, it even escalated to a diplomatic incident  . Or Erdogan not shaking hands or even willing to sit on the same room with Shimon  Peres in the world economic forum .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, as a Turkish guy, let me clear out things for you. Turkish generals are no angel but what government doing is not an example of democracy nor justice. </p>

<p>The current islamist government have been using Ergenekon as a threat to imprison journalists, business man or whoever who holds some power but have opposing views with this islamist government. People are being held in prison for years without conviction just as suspects. And being a suspect is as easy as having talked few times with another &quot;suspect&quot; or having a copy of a controversial book.</p>

<p>Those Ergenekon and Balyoz(sledge hammer) trials reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sl%C3%A1nsk%C3%BD_trial">Slansky Trials</a> and clears away any confidence I have in justice system. </p>

<p>Actually what is happening currently in Turkey is the change of ruling elite who are holding power. The previous ones were the secular nationalists and those becoming more powerful are the conservative islamists. This is simply the failure of secular republic as it was formed 1923. </p>

<p>If anyone is interested I can give some examples or more explanation</p>

<p>Lynch adds that one U.N. employee was sent to the hospital with broken ribs. Inner City Press is reporting that, in response to the incident, several U.N. security officials have been banned from speaking to the press and assigned to paid &quot;modified duty.&quot;</p>

<p>A U.N. security officer complains that he and his fellow guards are &quot;just pawns to Ban Ki-moon,&quot; adding that &quot;Ban will do anything to avoid a confrontation with the Turks.&quot;</p>

<p>But congrats to them on the purge. Imagine when or even if that happens to the US....</p>

<p>That&#39;s very difficult to do. I think the Americans don&#39;t have it in them any longer. I can say this as an American: the Americans are a broken people, unable to stand with dignity any longer. They fall in line and do as their told, just like their old-time enemies, the Nazis and Stalinists. A purge of the terrorist elements of the USA Republican Party is quite unthinkable. You have to consider, the big money is connected to that element, and that&#39;s &quot;the bottom line&quot; in today&#39;s America.</p>
