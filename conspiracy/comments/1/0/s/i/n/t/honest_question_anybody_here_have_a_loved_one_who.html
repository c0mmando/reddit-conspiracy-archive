        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve scheduled an appointment to appease my wife, but I&#39;m not sure what to say to the therapist.  &quot;We&#39;re all fucked and here&#39;s why...&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT: Since this post has apparently blown up and just about everyone thinks I&#39;m an asshole for 1) agreeing to see the therapist or 2) not loving my wife or something, I may be forced to say its the kneejerk reactionary nature of this place and conspiracy theory in general that gives it such a bad name.  Look, either I&#39;m an asshole for giving into my beloved wife&#39;s concerns and agreeing to follow through on her suggestions or I&#39;m an asshole for not thinking her concerns are valid, not both.  For months, I have kept my views to myself.  However, I see WWIII approaching and I felt the need to discuss with her a plan for us and our 4-year-old daughter should it come to that.  Her reaction was not borne out of being dumb or evil or anything.  She honestly can&#39;t follow my line of thinking.  She will not see the possibility, or at least won&#39;t see any reason to worry about the possibility.  Out of love and concern for my well-being, she wants me to go see someone who in her opinion can help.  I do not doubt therapy can help alleviate some of the symptoms of depression and anxiety, so there is some merit in following through.  But no therapist can change that 9/11 was an inside job, that the Federal Reserve and international game of finance is a rigged system, that there are powers who operate in the shadows who build creepy underground doomsday bunkers under Denver International Airport, that scientists with no morals have devised mind-control techniques so effective that James Holmes doesn&#39;t even know who the fuck he is, that child-abuse and ritual programming are an everyday occurrence within the moneyed elite, that constant streams of aircraft are dumping loads of heavy metals into our atmosphere, that we are lied to and spied on and used and abused at every turn.  It&#39;s a sham.  It&#39;s all a sham.  Does saying that make me crazy?  Depends on your definition.  I know it makes me depressed and anxious, but I think I&#39;d have to be insane to not be depressed and anxious under these circumstances.  But I love my wife and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make her life as good as it can be.  If that requires her to remain in the matrix, so be it.  And just because I&#39;ve &quot;woke up&quot; as is so often said here, it doesn&#39;t mean I need to be miserable every second of every day.  So, I&#39;m following through on what she would like.  I was just trying to get a sense for how others here would react to the situation.  I see many of you would be willing to piss away your marriage, and many of you seem to think it would be okay to keep all of your thoughts to yourself and not include her in them.  I don&#39;t think either way is right.  I wasn&#39;t really looking for advice on what to do.  Really, I was looking at what to say to the therapist.  But thanks for all the vitriol.  That was real helpful.</p>

<p>EDIT #2: Seems like the votes and the general tone in here changed drastically over the last few hours.  At first, I was ridiculed mostly for agreeing to see the therapist.  Now I&#39;m mostly being denigrated for my views.  I&#39;m going to the therapist.  I love my wife.  I&#39;m not mad at her for feeling the way she does.  I&#39;m not stockpiling ammunition.  I&#39;m not running for the hills.  I wanted to come up with a plan for the worst-case scenario, because whether you believe it or not, an economic collapse/WWIII will take out the power grid, the cell towers - it will be chaos.  Where do we go with that last tank of gas?  I don&#39;t see anything insane with thinking that through.  </p>

<p>And if anybody has anything to say about my ability to be a good parent to my daughter, fuck off.  You don&#39;t know anything about me, how much I love her and how much I do for her or my family.  This got real personal in here by a bunch of anonymous trolls.  Way to be a &quot;community&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your everyday life and activities are suffering from compulsive behavior, if you&#39;ve become unstable and paranoid to the point of fearing everything and everyone, well, you owe it to the person that cares for you to analyze your situation. </p>

<p>Might sound hypocritical posting this here, but try to keep your wits and a sane, open minded approach to everything. Yes, there are many dark, dirty deals done daily in our society, our world, but not all is due to aliens or cultists or secret organizations. Going from an inquisitive mind that questions the official version to a tinfoiler wacko that sees faces in the clouds everywhere is, sadly, quite easy.</p>

<p>Gain some balance. Good luck.</p>

<p>She wants to have a happy life and wants you to be happy so she can be happy.  </p>

<p>If you are constantly spouting off about horrifying conspiracies, neither of you are happy.  You might be right, you might have the truth, but, I also took a stinky diarrhea shit in the toilet yesterday.  That&#39;s the truth.  I&#39;m going to go tell my wife all about it, and show it to her, because it&#39;s true.  I&#39;m gonna go on and on about it until she really gets a good smell, maybe I can get her to dip her finger in and touch it so she really knows the full extent about it.  See where I&#39;m going with this?</p>

<p>It&#39;s partly about decorum.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you believe and why, this kind of boldfaced stubbornness is going to get you in all sorts of trouble.</p>

<p>An essential feature of critical thinking is being able to listen to and accept others arguments. If you let your opinion outweigh anything anyone else might say, then you are simply just living in a fantasy of your own design. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have some extremely silly beliefs, and an inability to reconcile them with actual facts. Psychologists see conspiracy theorists everyday. Government paranoia is a common side effect of a wide range of mental illnesses. </p>

<p>Unless you are just really emotionally invested in conspiracies for some reason, you are most likely mentally ill and would benefit from treatment.</p>

<p>You say you believe a global conflict is coming, and that you are making plans to get you family to safety if one occurs. What does that mean? Does that mean that if Iran and Israel engage in armed conflict you plan on running to the hills? I wouldn&#39;t want my 4 year old around someone like that. If you don&#39;t go, or mislead the shrink, what of your wife leaves you? You&#39;d have absaloutely no chance or getting custody of your kid.</p>

<p>For the sake of your child, go to it with an open mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, everyone holds a certain amount of bias, but what is &quot;belief in conspiracies&quot;? Conspiracy, by the dictionary definition, has certainly occurred numerous times. I can think MK-ULTRA, Bay of Pigs, bought out protests against FDR, etc off the top of my head. But all the sources linked to in that wikipedia section are from psychologists which, by categorizing &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; into this vague group rather than placing a professional diagnostic like &quot;schizophrenics&quot;, commit the exact same sort of bias they seem to write against.</p>

<p>And this sort of bias is what people like the OP have to contend against simply for having certain viewpoints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP,</p>

<p>Whether your wife understands or she doesn&#39;t, you should honor your marriage. Do everything in your power to reconcile with your wife - even if it is her who makes the unreasonable demands, not you. Love knows better than you do. Love is worth <em>all.</em> Many people will tell you differently - they do not understand. The truth is this: if you are not willing to make the necessary compromise for your wife, you do not have love at all - you have an arrangement that suits your current preferences. Your love is only for your own preferences - no more, no less.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to chastise you and/or be harsh toward you - my only point is as follows: honor your marriage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to call you an idiot for looking at things, but thinking that wwIII is iminent means you haven&#39;t looked at enough things with enough perspective.  Wars are dangerous, messy, shitty things, and (since this <em>is</em> <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that there is a <em>much greater chance</em> of a conspiracy to appease the masses and end the suffering and poverty than there is of a conspiracy where one side tries to take the other&#39;s shit in a way that makes the entire fucking world want to kill them.  Want an example of this in action? look at Burma: five years ago I could show end game after end game coming out of there, because they&#39;ve literally got the dick of every nuclear world power somewhere in their ass; right now they are going through genuine democratic reforms with far reaching consequences, many of which are positive.</p>

<p>So, go to your therapist.  Keep thinking about this shit.  But take your paranoia with a grain of salt, try to get some perspective on it (I&#39;d suggest learning a second or third language as a good way to do this), and listen to the woman who loves you enough to let you stockpile ammunition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a SO who won&#39;t even listen to your views about what you think is going on: then they&#39;re the problem.</p>

<p>If you have a SO who cares about you and knows when you&#39;ve gone into the deep end: then they&#39;re likely the solution.</p>

<p>If someone thinks you&#39;re crazy just because you question the status quo, then you shouldn&#39;t be around that person.</p>

<p>All of us in the conspiracy community know that person who has let their beliefs truly take over their lives and changed the way they act and feel around everyone. You can be caught up with world news, the truth about what&#39;s going on around the world, and potential conspiracy theories, and not let it consume your every being. You can believe and make a difference without letting it take over you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should never come to this. Here&#39;s why...</p>

<p>-You are individually powerless against the alternative news you discover.</p>

<p>-Society is conditioned to cater to the lowest common denominator (that&#39;s what creates a society, everyone participates at some basic level)</p>

<p>-By nature, people like you are naturally curious about the true nature and workings of society at the higher levels</p>

<p>-Generally, there is no instant reward to the population at large for learning of these truths, therefore, it is very hard to show any benefit for discovering them. You can&#39;t come home and say, &quot;Kennedy is an inside job, so I made these trades in the market, and now we are millionaires!&quot;. This makes it hard for others to see the value of your discoveries.</p>

<p>-The knowledge you gain is cumulative, and should discretely help you make important decisions in life. When the TV is crowing that everyone should dump their cash into real estate and Hummers, like it was in 2007, you can count on your accrued discernment to guide you.</p>

<p>-If they want to act on the hype, you put a reasoned case to you wife/family/partner as to why you are acting the way you are when the need arises. It is your responsibility, make a factual case based on easily understood truths.</p>

<p>-You need not proselytize or &quot;convert&quot; people. Even your own family. Understand that the knowledge you gain is occult in nature for a reason, that being it goes against the &quot;truths&quot; of society at large, and as such, most people won&#39;t want to hear about it.</p>

<p>-In short, don&#39;t let what you learn take over your life. Let it guide you. Your actions need not be abrupt. Most agendas you learn about have a long shelf life, act accordingly. The best thing you can do is &quot;sit in the reeds&quot; with this stuff, and act when it it to your advantage. Be a poker player, not a guy with a bullhorn and banner.</p>

<p>...all that being said, I would tell the shrink that you looked at some stuff, it kinda made sense, but now reflecting on it, it does not. Feign ignorance, and just claim you were caught up in the novelty of it, like a new season of reality TV, and just wanted to share it with your wife, wanted to share the excitement. He does not need to know what you think, dude, and you won&#39;t change anyone&#39;s mind, especially not his. Do you want a diagnosis that involves paranoia? Didn&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>Downplay it, act dumb, don&#39;t proselytize, live to learn another day. Keep your ears, mind and eyes wide open. Lay low in the reeds. Act when the opportunity arises. Stupid like a fox, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what and what not to do.</p>

<p>don&#39;t walk into the shrink and say OMG 9/11 and when he disagrees lose your temper. Discuss past public knowledge operations undertaken by foreign and domestic intelligence and explain your concerned about the implications of future government policies at home and abroad and your family.</p>

<p>This is completely rational to question authority and it shows more intelligence than the average person. Discuss what direction he thinks the country is going in and what political leaning he has. These discussion are completely normal and not to sound rude, but your wife needs to be more open to discussions about your genuine concerns before admitting you to a shrink. This is a communication problem between you and her and her unpreparedness to listen to what you have to say.</p>

<p>A piece of advice would be not to force information on people because they do not like being told they are wrong and they&#39;ve been wrong for a while. Plant a seed, and leave it to grow for a while and she will come asking more questions. This is exactly what I did with my family.</p>

<p>In short: The world will always be fucked up. It was fucked up hundreds of years ago, it will continue to be fucked up in hundreds of years time.

    <div class="md"><p>The simple fact is this shit can be depressing and cause obsession.  In other words, even though what you believe is the truth you might still be suffering a decrease in the quality of life because of it.  Imagine if someone became obsessed with death - yes, they are looking at something that most people don&#39;t want to, and avoid thinking about, but it might also be a mental health problem.  In other words, even though you are delusional you may benefit from thinking at things in a different way - i.e., get a therapist that will teach you Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - this could help you deal with all this negative shit even.  Basically, there is nothing you can do about the state of the world and you know it (&quot;we&#39;re all fucked&quot;), it will also help with your wife who is obviously thinks you and your relationship needs some attention.  In other words you can let this shit totally take over your life, or you can live what little life you have left.  I am saying this to you as much to me, because I&#39;ve been getting depressed from this shit lately too.</p>

Don&#39;t be fearful, stressed, or paranoid of these events. You should show a feeling of being empowered, be happy that you have this knowledge, and educate other people about it; however, becaseful not to show them the &quot;conspiracy&quot; videos like Alex Jones, try to show factual mainstream media documents and then show them how they link together instead of a video titled &quot;NWO 9/11, WMD cover up, Guns for Hire in Syria, Expunge the FDR&quot; all in one video to confuse and scare them.

<p>as I become more and more convinced that the reason I&#39;m depressed is that we live in a shithole of evil and corruption</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how depression works though, it&#39;s more to do with a habit of thinking. </p>

<p>I would start reading/watching self improvement materials if I were you, try subs like <a href="/r/selfimprovement">/r/selfimprovement</a> and <a href="/r/GetMotivated">/r/GetMotivated</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being depressed is one thing, but if you are in a self destruct mode due to this depression - then it is serious and you need some help - which some good counselling can take care of (not necessarily from a shrink - a good friend with whom you can talk freely and who can advice you honestly), which your wife also needs to be part of (I am guessing she is the person you spend most of your time with - so she is actually in a better position to help you and guide you to come out of the self destruct mode).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t waste your money and time. You have only been rewarded for your open mindedness and mental capacity to see through the bullshit - by the mere act of &quot;appeasing&quot; her would be stooping below your mental capacity and open mindedness. Tell her to open her god damn eyes.</p>

If he&#39;s suffered from depression it wouldn&#39;t hurt to seek help.

They want your relationships to succeed. </p>

<p>If one believes in an all powerful god entity, how can they not see that the &#39;living word of god&#39; is the living &#39;word&#39; of all sound, song, and silence that actually IS alive in the present moment?</p>

<p>I read about things coming down the line, then think about how to prevent it from happening to us. </p>

<p>Examples of what I constantly think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>FEMA camps</li>
<li>global economic collapse</li>
<li>False flag in downtown SF, where I work</li>
<li>chemicals being deployed silently</li>
<li>Fukishima fallout</li>
<li>police taking me away for posting in r/conspiracy</li>

<p>I&#39;ve always been the one who has to have a plan of attack for everything. I have to keep these scenarios in my mind and not let my wife know my plans to thwart these scenarios. </p>
