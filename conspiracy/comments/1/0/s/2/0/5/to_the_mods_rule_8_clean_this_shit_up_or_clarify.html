       For the past couple of days we've seen the top posts being imgur links or some other bs link with just a pic and a wall of text with no sources to back up their claims.

       I'm asking you to either enforce the rules or clarify them because this is the type of shit that makes this subreddit look like a bunch of nut jobs.

       Edit: How does one become a mod? I'd be interested in becoming a mod for this sub... I encourage you to look at my post history as I try to stay as unbiased as possible on all issues.

      <p>
       Edit to the Edit: 3+ hours and not one Mod response, way to stay on top of shit boys! Can't say I'm surprised.

       has been nearly the same in the two years I've been lurking here and the last six months that I've been posting here. Just, the amount of people is growing so much that you notice the garbage a whole lot more. There's just not that many active posters here and people are just becoming so discouraged by any trolling at this point that they just leave. People may disagree with it, but a conspiracy sub still needs moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd really like to see
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or whatever sub ends up being a discussion on conspiracies actually be a place for discussion. "Question everything" is the motto I learned about conspiracies in my mid teens, and it's something that should be applied even here. If someone brings up a counter-point or tries to argue the discussion, then encourage discussion, try to prove that person wrong and try to have a healthy debate about it.

       the main reason I dont spend much time here is the mods act like 14 year old girls and drag their lunatic drama into threads.  mods are chosen behind closed doors here and the fucked reddit dipshit college hippie meme shit culture has come here because /politics is such a cesspool of billioinaire cocksmoking.  I hate this place now.

       I've said it before and I will say it again. Make the sub self posts only. Almost every post merits a discussion. Embed the link you want to post into your post and start from there.

       I like the idea of having something like a self-post only period instead of only self posts. Like a Self-Post only weekend from Friday morning til Monday morning. I'd also be in favor of banning image only posts, let people post them in a self post and add their own opinion, sources or links to the artist that made the picture. Instead of encouraging people to post anything conspiracy related with a catchy title just for the karma.

       Welp, we both have the same idea, sadly it doesn't look like its ever going to happen. Honestly, I haven't seen a better (or to be quite frank, ANY) approach towards this subject. Its been quite obvious that we (r/conspiracy) are being gamed. Its probably just a group trying to bury our integrity, but to ignore it is just as good as endorsing it. The subreddit has turned to shit. Questioning motives gets ridicule, questioning the obvious (obvious to most of us) gets ridiculed, questioning the questionable gets ridicule, questioning the unquestionable gets ridicule. When will people realize that many people have many different points of view. Ridicule is NEVER the answer. Educate Proliferate Consecrate

       The only way I can see it like that is if the OP is really misleading in the title or something. I always downvote shit like that. Also, would it hurt to mention the length of the video in the title or something? It would make it easier, IMO.

       But that seems like more logical of a response. I guess it would be, by definition, something other than a shill, but I'd put money on the fact of there being lots and lots of unwitting "shills".

       To be honest, im this close to unsubcribing from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and I have seen many of the regulars complain about the situation. We were never like this a few months ago and now almost on a daily basis we get meaningless junk or memes on the frontpage. Now we have to look for the good posts in the "new" section before they get downvoted - either this is intentional "forum sliding" or we attracted the wrong type of subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I like the mods here, they seem like nice people from their posts, but I think they have to do more about the situation - this "no rules" mentality isnt working out and its a shame to lose this subreddit because of this.

       Agreed. I have a hard time coming to this sub anymore because of shit like this. I've been a member of r/conspiracy for a little over a year and wow is it ever different. I only spend time her to pick what I feel are worthwhile posts to x-post them to my own sub that so far is so tiny it has none of the issues that come with size. It's a shame really.

       Not sure what the truth is :), but what I'm going for is a place to have discussions about topics and beliefs that will tend to be controversial without name calling and derogatory responses. It might be a tall order, but that's my hope. And yes, no memes, heh.

       I feel the truth is there is no truth. But I agree that controversial shouldn't be of primary concern over non-controversial topics just because. I just want to be able to have a place where you can have an argument about a topic and not be attacked. A place where we can try and find the Truth, or some close approximation thereof and even, god forbid, agree to disagree.

       Honestly, we as a community decided it was up to us to regulate and downvote stupid or immature content. You need to take some personal responsibility and stop blaming the mod who is acting in accordance to the wishes of this SR constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you see something stupid, downvote. If a thread has no substance then

       reddit is a poor vehicle for discussions of conspiracies and controversial topics. Anyone can create an account. Sockpuppets are not only tolerated by the administrators, they are celebrated. Even after much controversy and many justified "witch hunts", karmanaut is
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       a moderator at the default subreddit
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . So is the power spammer davidreiss666.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moderators of this subreddit could ban blatantly abusive accounts, but that only stops them from submitting articles and posting comments. As I understand it, those accounts still could upvote bad content and downvote good content, even after being banned. Also, they could just create new accounts. It's pretty clear that some of the most obnoxious reddit users have already created lots of sockpuppets over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, asking moderators to take drastic actions only worsens the problem. I have seen enough of some of the more highly regarded moderators here to know I definitely do not trust their judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should be a place where unpleasant ideas are tolerated. Trying to "clean up" the subreddit to avoid scaring the unenlightened is a huge concession to the status quo. And it probably would not have the desired effect anyway.

       While I agree 100%, so far no dice. These memes, they add
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to the conversation, and even though a sidebar sets out rules for the sub, not everyone reads them, and worse, by seeing them in the sub when clearly they are forbidden, they still show up. It's here, r/funny, everywhere. But at the same time, we have tools at our disposal. Click 'hide' and move on.

       This is great in theory except for 2 things: #8 on the sidebar expressly forbids memes, and when so many people post memes in so many places on Reddit, it cheapens the joke. They're an eyesore.

       Oh I understand this, trust me. In this day and age, you have to get to the point or you lose the reader. But honestly, the charm or expedience of memes was gone when everyone and their sister jumped on the bandwagon. In America we call this 'saturating the market'. Too much of something drops the value.

       Memes are the most powerful tool in our arsenal. That is why stuff like this keeps coming up. This is CIA at work, they dont want us using the most effective propaganda methods, hence the ban, and relentless propaganda from fake accounts trying to discredit the tactic and make it seem unpopular.
