    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been nearly the same in the two years I&#39;ve been lurking here and the last six months that I&#39;ve been posting here. Just, the amount of people is growing so much that you notice the garbage a whole lot more. There&#39;s just not that many active posters here and people are just becoming so discouraged by any trolling at this point that they just leave. People may disagree with it, but a conspiracy sub still needs moderation. </p>

<p>I&#39;d really like to see <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or whatever sub ends up being a discussion on conspiracies actually be a place for discussion. &quot;Question everything&quot; is the motto I learned about conspiracies in my mid teens, and it&#39;s something that should be applied even here. If someone brings up a counter-point or tries to argue the discussion, then encourage discussion, try to prove that person wrong and try to have a healthy debate about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the idea of having something like a self-post only period instead of only self posts. Like a Self-Post only weekend from Friday morning til Monday morning. I&#39;d also be in favor of banning image only posts, let people post them in a self post and add their own opinion, sources or links to the artist that made the picture. Instead of encouraging people to post anything conspiracy related with a catchy title just for the karma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welp, we both have the same idea, sadly it doesn&#39;t look like its ever going to happen. Honestly, I haven&#39;t seen a better (or to be quite frank, ANY) approach towards this subject. Its been quite obvious that we (r/conspiracy) are being gamed. Its probably just a group trying to bury our integrity, but to ignore it is just as good as endorsing it. The subreddit has turned to shit. Questioning motives gets ridicule, questioning the obvious (obvious to most of us) gets ridiculed, questioning the questionable gets ridicule, questioning the unquestionable gets ridicule. When will people realize that many people have many different points of view. Ridicule is NEVER the answer. Educate Proliferate Consecrate </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, im this close to unsubcribing from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I have seen many of the regulars complain about the situation. We were never like this a few months ago and now almost on a daily basis we get meaningless junk or memes on the frontpage. Now we have to look for the good posts in the &quot;new&quot; section before they get downvoted - either this is intentional &quot;forum sliding&quot; or we attracted the wrong type of subscribers. </p>

<p>Personally I like the mods here, they seem like nice people from their posts, but I think they have to do more about the situation - this &quot;no rules&quot; mentality isnt working out and its a shame to lose this subreddit because of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is an example of a recent post that might be breaking rule # 8 (it was around +100 points) :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/10kxnj/assange_versus_hillary_clinton/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/10kxnj/assange_versus_hillary_clinton/</a></p>

<p>I tried to mention rule number 8 in the comments but nothing was done and it stayed on the frontpage for a bit.</p>

<p>Personally I think if that&#39;s not a meme then I dont know what is.</p>

<p>Also, this is one example of many we see on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>reddit is a poor vehicle for discussions of conspiracies and controversial topics. Anyone can create an account. Sockpuppets are not only tolerated by the administrators, they are celebrated. Even after much controversy and many justified &quot;witch hunts&quot;, karmanaut is <em>still</em> a moderator at the default subreddit <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. So is the power spammer davidreiss666. </p>

<p>The moderators of this subreddit could ban blatantly abusive accounts, but that only stops them from submitting articles and posting comments. As I understand it, those accounts still could upvote bad content and downvote good content, even after being banned. Also, they could just create new accounts. It&#39;s pretty clear that some of the most obnoxious reddit users have already created lots of sockpuppets over the years. </p>

<p>In my opinion, asking moderators to take drastic actions only worsens the problem. I have seen enough of some of the more highly regarded moderators here to know I definitely do not trust their judgement. </p>

<p>This should be a place where unpleasant ideas are tolerated. Trying to &quot;clean up&quot; the subreddit to avoid scaring the unenlightened is a huge concession to the status quo. And it probably would not have the desired effect anyway. </p>
