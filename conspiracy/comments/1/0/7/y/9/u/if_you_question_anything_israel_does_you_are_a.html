       The nazis were not smarter or more talented than the people they wiped out. They were marginally smarter than the Russians, but they didn't have the manpower or resources to do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact if they were really smart they would have saved the Jews and encouraged them to reproduce, since Jews tend to be well educated and productive and tend to grow the economies of places where they live. Killing off all your local jews is just plain stupid. If nazis hasn't wasted so much effort trying to kill their Jews they might have had a lot more success, and Jews themselves would have less need to for a country of their own.

       Their descendants are pound for pound more successful than any other group on the planet. There are only 14 million Jews worldwide but they dominate every scientific field. Physics, chemistry, medicine, you name it. Germans barely register on the scale and perform no better than Italians, Swiss, etc. They just lack that ashkenazi gene.

       Of course not. They're a tiny minority. Thank god the USA and UK were smart enough to help them out. God knows how far behind we'd be technogically without Jews making discoveries like the krebs cycle.

       Naw, I make my own arguments. I even try to give arabs the benefit of the doubt. For example I looked at the wikipedia page on the "Islamic golden age" and the only real "invention" they list is "a rudimentary sextant (known as a kamal)." They didn't even invent a real sextant, just a RUDIMENTARY one.
      </p>

       Then I tried to look up a "kamal" and I found out it's just a piece of wood hanging from a string you hold in your mouth. It's a piece of fucking string, not a sextant.

      <p>
       I also remember looking up some geometrical problem that was supposedly "solved" by medieval islamic "scientists". It was incomprehensible gibberish and even the post-colonial liberal academic who wrote it admitted there didn't seem to be an equation there but the diagram "strongly suggested" a solution somewhere else

       So what? They're still idiots who don't invent or produce anything useful. They just use western technology to harvest oil for sale and buy weapons from western countries.

       Nope, I used wikipedia to look up all these supposed arab "accomplishments." They're shit. They had some cool architecture apparently, but of course they didn't actually build the Hagia Sophia, they just tried to paint over it with silly claptrap about mohammed.

       But ultimately my views on this topic are guided by a simple straightforward principle: resources ought to be accorded to the highest value user. That's straight up Scottish enlightenment. The only person who's really informed any of my thinking on any of this is David Hume.

       Why didn't Jordan create a Palestinian state when they occupied the West Bank for 20 years? Why did they just toss them into refugee camps and deny them sovereignty?  Didn't they care passionately about the plight of the poor Palestinians before 1967?

       Not sure what that has to do with anything except for prove my point. I'm not talking about Muslims. I am talking about Jews.

       So which dead kid picture is your favorite? I'm gonna keep asking until you tell me, you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Know why I'm going to keep doing that? Because it hammers home the win in this argument for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with that, I wish you a good night. You have unwittingly proven my point through the things you have said and asserted tonight, and I do wish to thank you.

      <p>
       Have a great evening!

      <p>
       Edit: Just a quick thought here. Are you, like, some sort of performance artist? Like, did you pick the Zionist hyperbole to impersonate in order to draw attention to the atrocities Israel has committed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well if not, thanks again for helping me point out how horrible Zionism really is and the sad state of the Palestinians day to day life.

       i'm sure they do agree with me (as most of the world's population does).

       it doesn't surprise me that after 50 years of war and suffering, they just want it to be over. that doesn't mean that they recognize the illegitimate apartheid regime, just that they want to end the bloodshed. and remember the demographic competition. if they can get a lasting peace, they can win at the ballot box instead of fighting the world's biggest army by proxy.

       has anyone ever mentioned something called a persecution complex to you? it's where people imagine that others are focused on hurting them for no reason. whereas in the case of israel, basically everyone in the world is upset that israel blatantly colonizes shit against the UN, has nukes, bombs its neighbors, and keeps the palestinians in a hell on earth. israel isn't a victim, it's the aggressor. trust me, i don't have a dog in this fight. i'm an unbiased outsider and i see that israel is being a bitch.

       He is trying to draw attention to the fact that Arab countries are unjust and since we support Palestine we must support other Arab countries. It's a typical strawman.

       Do you have any pictures of dead marsh arabs? The Iraqis obliterated their entire homeland. They drained the marshes and turned them into a desert. About 80% of them have been wiped out through various measures over last 50 years. Some historians believe their homeland was the inspiration for the Garden of Eden described in the Old Testament.

       No. If anything the crusades helped pull Europe out of the dark ages. The arab golden ages accomplished pathetically little. Once Europe hit the enlightenment they easily blew past the muslims, which is part of the reason why muslims are so angry today. I mean they're really just embarrassed.

       What would have really advanced us technologically is if the western Roman empire had held up. They were on the verge of an industrial revolution in the 3rd century. Enlightenment Europe was essentially an attempt to reconstruct the old Roman civilization.

       "They" in this case refers to Persians, not arabs. In fact most of the achievements attributed to arabs were actually accomplished by Persians, Turks, Berbers and Jews. Arabs themselves accomplished  very little outside their initial conquests, and even those were due primarily to the fact that byzantines did not build real fortifications against the deserts, since they never expected to be attacked from there. When arabs tried to leave the desert and fight the Franks they got their shit pushed in by Charles Martel, who wasn't even proper royalty at that point. And this was still in the 8th century, when the Franks still could not mount any effective defense against the Vikings!

       "The first century of the Islamic Arab Empire saw almost no scientific or mathematical achievements since the Arabs, with their newly conquered empire, had not yet gained any intellectual drive and research in other parts of the world had faded. In the second half of the 8th century, Islam had a cultural awakening, and research in mathematics and the sciences increased.[47] The Muslim Abbasid caliph al-Mamun (809–833) is said to have had a dream where Aristotle appeared to him, and as a consequence al-Mamun ordered that Arabic translation be made of as many Greek works as possible, including Ptolemy's Almagest and Euclid's Elements. Greek works would be given to the Muslims by the Byzantine Empire in exchange for treaties, as the two empires held an uneasy peace.[47] Many of these Greek works were translated by Thabit ibn Qurra (826–901), who translated books written by Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Eutocius.[48]"

       A Persian may have hit on it, but it was an Islamic Caliph that took the initiative to revive it during the Islamic Golden age. It really started with the Greeks though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Greeks hit around on it, followed by a Persian that added a little more to it, then an Arab Caliph pushed it's development even further.

       No, I made my point very clearly and you're  trying to make a silly semantic argument because you have no substantive rebuttal. Germans were fools to persecute the Jews, which is why they're now trying to get them to move back to Germany. Germany is much more successful today than it was under the nazis because the USA made it its vassal.

       Israel builds world class R&amp;D facilities while Dubai builds obnoxious hotels in the sea. I think I know which side the USA should support.

       You lose again! Israel builds world class R&amp;D facilities
       <strong>
        because
       </strong>
       we protect them and give them money. The simple truth of the matter is if it weren't for the US and the UK Israel would have never survived the desert climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can defend Israel until you are blue in the face, but the fact is that many people in the US and Europe are getting real tired of supporting them financially and militarily. Eventually, we will turn our back on her and she
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       die. And what
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       sad about it is their citizens that are largely innocent in all of this will bear the brunt of any military action against Israel because of her administrators horrific deeds. Sorry if you don't like to hear that, but them's the brakes, brotha.

       Great!  At least Israel gives us something useful in exchange for that money and protection. That's what economists call a Pareto efficient transaction.

      <p>
       Compare to Saudi Arabia. We give Saudi Arabia money and protection but they don't do jack shit for us. They just buy fast cars and Russian hookers.

       I love the fact you are using circular reasoning on this, but, the fact remains; Israel would never be able to do that without our help and money from our taxpayers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This really is going to be my last reply to you on this issue. You have it set in your mind one way, me, another way. I believe your argument is invalid. You have things to corroborate your story, but the bottom line is this: Israel wouldn't do shit if it weren't for us and you would have nothing to back up anything you can say about "Israeli inventions".
      </p>
      <p>
       Israeli inventions made in Palestine after 1948 are the West's inventions by proxy.

       Then that's a great reason to keep supporting them while we tell obnoxious muslims to STFU. Any Muslim who wants to fight the advance of human civilization can eat a hellfire missile.

       If you equate the actions of the Israeli government with all Jews, you are a scumbag-nazi-antisemite piece of trash. Bumblingmumbling, tttt0tttt, Ijob911, and Occidentalist (r/whiterights mod IIRC) are examples of people like this.
