       Every couple months on one of my days off, I some how end up spending a few hours online watching conspiracy videos.  Videos like the Zeitgeist films, 911 stuff, Federal Reserve shit and the like.  I watch them and I get pissed.  As I am watching them I start to think about ways that I can get involved.  And before you know it, the day is almost over and I have to go back to work the next day.  Back to paying bills, buying groceries, and just trying to survive.  I know the world is fucked up, I know the government is corrupt, I know that America is a police state, I know the Federal Reserve runs the world, I know that the human race is destroying the planet and spreading like a cancer.  But what I don't know is what I am supposed to do about it.  No one has any real answer on what to do.  They only want to tell you the problem, not how to fix it.  Am I the only one that feels like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR
How can I save the world from itself?

       Violence is the only answer but people in conspiracy are too crazy and socially awkward to team up and fight. People here also have their own agendas, especially towards Jews. Blaming Jews for most of the worlds problems is popular for people here but it isn't actually going to change anything.

       Unfortunately the Jewish faith, like many others has been hijacked. It is true that many powerful famil8es are of Jewish decent, but those who impugned the entire faith are off base. At this point, it is no longer about faith, but power.

       Nott anti-Semitic.  Anti-Zionist.  Zionism has, unfortunately, done a lot to make sure and very much confuse the two so that it's difficult for many to tell the difference between one and the other and many who are really rightfully hating against Zionism lump Judaism along with it since Judaism is, again, so heavily tied with it (almost identical with it on the surface), and many Zionists ARE indeed Jews.  That's obviously part of the plan:  Confuse Zionism and Judaism so that Zionism can hide behind the other.  They are indeed different, however, and many Jews (some in Israel itself) directly oppose Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Down with Zionism and anyone who supports it - whether Jew or non-Jew.  Doesn't matter.  It's Zionism that's the cancer which must be eradicated.

       It's good to stalk up on luxury items like booze or cigs. If worst comes to worst, having something that is non essential to you (but others are addicted to) is good for bartering. Sounds terrible, I know.

       That's actually very good because gold will not be helpful right after a collapse unless you have access to someone willing to buy it.

       Non perishable food and water is a necessity and also a good stock of ammo. You should also learn how to secure a building and from people gaining entrance and/or booby traps.

       booze especially higher proof vodka also makes a decent antiseptic if you're in a pinch. you can also get high enough proof to help with a quick campfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       That along with superglue, gauze/something absorbent, duct tape, and maybe neosporin would work as a backup first aid kit if there was an actual emergency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vodka is useful stuff. Just don't drink it in an emergency due to inebriation and dehydration.

       You have to be the change.  You are at a stage in your spiritual awakening where the conspiracy is overwhelming.  As you go down this rabbit hole you will discover that it all stems from a desire to oppress the human spirit - and I mean that literally.  YOU are a spirit and you chose to take up in a physical human body to be here at this particularly incredible time in human history.  Do you think it is happenchance that you were born here at this particular time or do you believe you have a purpose?  The fact is - everyone has a purpose and the controllers would have you believe that purpose is chasing their money because their money leads to emptiness and soullessness.  Discover your sovereignty and begin to FIGHT back in whatever way you are capable!  It might be all you can do is help your neighbor roll the garbage bin back to its place...if that's all you can do, do it!  If you have talents or other capabilities, start finding ways to hone them and put them to good use.  Research is great, but you need to turn that knowledge into action.  Find corruption in your local area and try to extinguish it.  Pick a subject you're passionate about or annoys you greatly and go for it.  Once you discover the hidden power within you and you trust that you have a divine purpose - you will find great joy in going about your days influencing all you come in contact with.  After I discovered that fear was an illusion and I was here as a lightworker to usher in the golden age of peace and prosperity, I have witnessed before my eyes an unfoldment of understanding that has aided me in my quest to make this world a better place.  Now is just the beginning!  You gotta understand - all those goverment officials, people with "power" like the pope and the president...yeah they wield power but at the end of the day they are NO DIFFERENT and no more special than you.  They are a physical body with a spirit as well and have no right to oppress you whatsoever.  The sooner you can KNOW this the sooner you can begin holding your thoughts with determination which will cause your opponents to FAIL if you are pursuing a path of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example I can give is fluoridation....I woke up in the last 4 years and said "Hey, wait a minute, my city adds fluoride to the water and I don't like it."  So I simply went to city council and told them so.  They brushed me off which presented my ego with a choice - go back to sleep or continue fighting?  Since that time I have created
       <a href="http://www.durhamagainstfluoride.com">
        http://www.durhamagainstfluoride.com
       </a>
       and will be featured in a November investigative report on Fluoride at the local ABC news affiliate.  What's stopping you from doing the same?

       Yeah you have to just set your mind to it.  In my experience trying to fight the man the government is just like a big onion.  You have to peel back the layers to find out who is exactly responsible for what - once you do that all you have to do is shine the light on 'em and they go running like cockroaches!

       Getting taking back control of our wealth is the first step. Gold/diamonds/etc are good, but too impractical for most people to use on the day to day. Once the bitcoin infrastructure is more firmly in place, a snowball effect will occur once people see all the benefits their bitcoin using friends have. No paypal fees, no bank fees, no federal reserve hyperinflation. Hell, if you're just looking to make a few bucks, now's the time to invest. My bitcoins have literally increased in "value" by 2000 federal reserve notes since March 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       Converting your federal reserve notes to bitcoin is really the only way I can think of (outside of "scary" violent rebellion) to fight back. If you have a better idea, post it instead of leaving a dismissive comment. If you don't have a better idea, shut the fuck up.

       Math indeed is the owner of bitcoin, it is a decentralized currency. If you want to get nitpicky, every bitcoin user technically "owns" it, because the computational power needed to "mint" bitcoins as well as log transactions is distributed across the all the bitcoin users' computers.

       A better idea is trading a bartering things you actually need if you dont want to use the US Dollar. Bitcoins are a artificial unsubstantiable currency with more in common with a ponzi scheme than coin.

       Currency is too practical of an invention to get rid of. Most people like being able to buy stuff off the internet and would rather live in a police state than lose this convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the manipulation of currency by centralized banks. If you still think bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, you might want to do some more research if you're serious about saving the world.

       Bitcoin's a hell of a lot less ridiculous than fiat currency. Fiat currency is what gives the US its power. If you want a substitute for fiat currency you need something that you can't fake and isn't centrally controlled. Bitcoin fits that bill.

       The problem with fiat currency isn't that the paper it's printed on doesn't have intrinsic value, it's that the effort required to create fiat currency doesn't reflect the currency's value. Bitcoin, like gold, can't be created at the same rate as fiat currency and so threats like hyperinflation go away.

       People trying to overcome the system are idiots , even if it was idiots that sometimes succeed and did revolutions . the system is too big to be overcome by a handful of people or unless you have the talent of a prophet to make people do the right thing , but as an individual i'd suggest this .

       Get out of the cycle of slavery , consume what you need and specially  what you own , why do you need to buy that super sized TV ? or even why do you need TV on the first place?  The best thing is to a have a group of people with the same mind set and form a small village , and as a goal is to be self efficient overall without having to import from the outside only if needed , like some of the Mormon villages or the Hamish ones .

       This actually makes a lot of sense.  Self-sufficient (or semi self-sufficient) agrarian villages are actually the answer!  I'm not kidding.  Especially think if the economy collapses...what will be the most valuable thing?  Food.  You will be able to trade food for whatever you want.

       All you can do is educate yourself. By not being part of the problem you are automatically part of the solution. You can do simple things like never agree with someone if they are spreading propaganda, and if someone is interested in the other side give it to them. You don't have to hit the streets so so speak, these days with the internet, if someone want's to know something the information is out there. It's just a matter of them wanting to know. P.S. Zeitgeist is propaganda. Make sure you are properly educated yourself before you start trying to educate others.

       You cannot. This is going down because it's deliberate. 
What you can do: relocate if possible. Get out of major population centers. Set by some food. Heck - go buy an above ground pool and fill it with water. Lots of little things you can do to make yourself a LITTLE less vulnerable. Have a gun? Go practice. Only have a bow and arrow? Go practice. Get REALLY good. Find decent people in your area that are like-minded if you can.
Need to stay healthy in times of collapse (for whatever reason)? Stock up on vitamins now. Learn how to use chlorine dioxide and hypochlorous acid. Go to the feed store and buy a bunch of FishMox - it's the same penicillin prescribed by doctors. While you're there grab some DMSO - great for healing wounds (even sprains and breaks) quickly. Go read "Doom and Bloom" and watch the videos. Learn how to stitch up a wound.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words - prepare yourself. Dunno if anyone here is aware of this, but you will actually find a lot of people paying attention to what is happening in churches all over the country, especially non-denominational (not Catholic, Lutheran, Episcopalian...just less likely there is all). This is on account of these events all existing in bible prophecy. You can always look there for others like you who are paying attention.

       We need to build resilient alternatives now.   Look at the Soviet rise to power  (dual power) and crisis capitalism.... be there with a solution when TSHTF and you get first mover advantage.   The goal is not to sieze power but prevent breakdowns that lead people to beg to be saved by tyranny.

       All you can do is educate your fellow man to counter the mass corporate messages being put on air everyday by the mainstream press.  Then hopefully we collectively reach a critical mass or tipping point of awakening to the need to actually face these problems.  There's a bunch of little things you can do personally, but you already know them all.  Buy local, etc.

       Start with yourself, then pay it forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to educate (not violently cram information down people's throats) people about what's going on in the world around them, and try to make them interested enough that they'll do the same. If you can educate a few people and make them interested enough, and those 3 people do the same, etc, then that's a great start. Start with yourself, then start locally and within your community. Educate people on what to do in case of emergency/catastrophe, the benefits of buying locally, of learning trade skills, and try the best you can to spread the word. In a humbling sense, you're only one man, don't think you can do the work of 10,000 men.

       I think about this question on a daily! The fact is there's not enough people getting angry! informed..yes.Believe even? sure! But what can you do with only a hand full of REGULAR people? if we stand up against our government with words and papers...what will that achieve..besides MORE LAWS! Our freedoms are being taken away systematically and its like a guy running with an arm full water eventually the only freedom we will have will be in our minds..and that is slowly being invaded as well with preemptive crime software and data agencies. WAKE THE FUCK UP PEOPLE!! p.s.there is going to be a pole shift soon causing global catastrophe.. DON'T go to the FEMA camps..

       I think about the EXACT same thing. Ive thought of leading protests, but thats already been done and nothing was changed. The only other thing I can really think of is to just spread the word. I talk to all my friends and family about all my conspiracies and some believe and some dont. But just get it out there, let people know. If enough people wake up, I believe that we could overthrow the government. Theres alot more of us then there are them. But what I have found out is that not many people believe or care enough. This fact breaks my heart. We live in a dying world and nobody (not enough to make a difference) cares. WTF?! I just end up feeling alone. But I hoenstly dont know what else to do besides tell everyone I come in contact with.

       The most you can do is tell everyone like you are doing. Try telling them about chemtrails BC that is something they can witness and observe with their own eyes and know for themselves if it is true or not. Though I do admit most people will just not care or still think it's a joke even when you point them out to them. I was with a friend one day and the trails were so bad you could see the grid/pattern they were making over the are. I pointed it out to my friend and he just gave me a sarcastic, "OH NO DUDE THE GOV IS AFTER US!'' type response. Not surprisingly that was one of my friends who only watches TV and browses reddit in his spare time. TV is our biggest problem. I mean you can kinda tell when all someone does is watch TV just by speaking to them for a few moments.

       Anyways, I have always wanted to make a huge banner with a list of stuff like chemtrails, the fed reserve, GMOs,etc. Just make a small statement about each that shows it's damages/dangers/how it will be used for control and hang it across an intersection. I also have always wanted to create a small flyer with the same deal and just start hanging them up or giving them to police departments/fire/etc.

       Well chemtrails is the main topic i talk about, because of the same reason you just said, because they can actually see it for themselves. One day the chemtrails were so bad and i pointed them out to my dad and he told me they were WATER VAPOR. I wanted to shoot myself. I was like are you freakin kidding me? I also have tons of pictures of them on my phone. I have this PERFECT shot of a contrail in the back and a chemtrail right beside it but a little closer, and i tried to explain the differece to my dad, my boyfriend, and everyone else, but everyone thinks im losing my mind. And it really upsets me. I mean they are CLEARLY 2 different things. How can they not see the difference? I cant believe how much people just dont care about these things.

      <p>
       And yeah, your flyer idea sounds great. I might actually do that.

       Banners and flyers would be the easiest thing. It would also be relativity cheap and could be extremely effective. I should really do that...You too..And everyone. I'm not sure what would be the best thing to put on it through. 
Also my dad is the one who told me about chemtrails.lol

       Just be aware of what is going on, and you will do the right decisions when it's time to make them. Don't participate in any "programs" put in place for you by them. Meditate, work on yourself and "be the change you want to see in this world" on a daily basis.

       It will come to a critical mass tipping point and the people will rise, that is what our governments are afraid of, they are afraid of the people uniting together to break the system in half. Soldiers are waking up, police officers are waking up, it is only a matter of time now.

       These measures they are putting in front of us in the form of laws and regulations means we are doing something right and they are very worried.

       I feel ya, OP, but you can't change it IMO. There are too many people to coordinate things with. It's like tying 20-30 people together and telling them "Walk forward..." but what is forward? My forward could be your stumble to the left. Sure, you can make a reference point on a wall and tell people to walk toward it, but that's only a handful of people. How do you get the majority of the world to work together? I don't think you can.

       First of all, why would you take this responsability upon yourself? You're not in a position to do what you propose so don't consider it, and don't think it's up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you can do is this. Educate yourself, fact check things on here, develop a way to spread this among people that you know to educate them as well. Right now this is the only thing we can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly: Don't let these events lead you toward a victimhood mentialty. Feel empowered and lucky that you had the opportunity to see things for how they actually are instead of being brainwashed. Feel good about it. I felt the same way for a while but realized that I am honestly caring too much when I can't do TOO much about it, but I can make a significant difference. You have to care... but not that much. have THAT attitude, take it lightly even though it's serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: Fix it by educating yourself further and educating others. Don't sweat it too much, feel empowered that you can make a difference and can see what is happening.

       Honestly... just get a good viewpoint on death. Prepare all you want but push come to shove you're probably fucked. Besides... after the collapse, what are you hoping for? Riots happen, shit goes to hell and you're just trying to make it through to the other side? What do you think is on the other side? A better society where you can go back to not having to live like a caveman? Get in touch with mortality, find something to convince you you've died and then figure out how you feel about it. I'm not saying just roll over and give up but just... face reality. You're gonna die anyway. Life is just preparation for it.

       This is something I have a lot if trouble with. I'm 31, married with a 6 year old and baby due in May. I'm a little on edge to say the least. My occupation is that I own am insurance agency which is of course tied to our financial system that will collapse sooner than later. When it does I have no income. I have no degree and no other skills. I'm as well prepared as it gets with survival items but my big issue is finding a place to ride it out. Im in a city that will get real rough when it hits the fan. Moreover I would like to be proactive and fight this thing to keep it from coming but all I do is work to keep a roof over my families head. I have a hard time not being depressed off and on all day if I let myself think about it too much. For those of us with kids, trying to fight this for the time being is one we can't afford. One way or another we will be forced to eventually but I just can't fathom giving up my house, my job, and more and starting all over in a time like now. I would like to know what someone in my position could even do.

       Alone, people are fairly weak. But, in a group and organized, people become stronger. So, I guess we need to talk to each other about this situation. It would be better to do it in person, but through the computer will work too.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of things that people do are out of our control. We can only control our own lives. And even this is fairly limited. We are born and live in a society and a culture. These things change only slowly over time. Slavery has been outlawed, but Jim Crow is alive and well. It will take hundreds of years for it to stop to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the best way out is too become as self-sufficient as you can and then drop out of society as much as possible. You still have to pay taxes, but the big boys use off-shore tax shelters for a reason. You should too. I do not recommend doing anything to show up on their radar. You, alone, are probably too weak to fight the power of the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we should try to continue to educate ourselves and those around us. It may help us prepare for the future.

       This is debatable. While I'm not advocating willfully trashing the planet by being a slob, I'm not getting on the Al Gore Express either. Besides, his home is said to leave a less than acceptable "carbon footprint". The Earth goes through changes. It isn't like someone felt its forehead and gave it a thermometer. Like most other issues these days, it too is highly politicized.

       start by promoting drug use. . . marijuana and lsd are proven to open the mind and allow people to think in new and creative ways. If everyone tried it, the world would be better overnight. . . other than secluding from modern society and living off the land, you and I are kind of stuck as cogs in a wheel. . . the world is the way it is because people are the way we are. It's still kill or be killed, always has, always will, and greed will always be a trait that ensures survival

       Your intentions are noble; however, it is highly unlikely you will open the eyes of the lemmings. Many of us are becoming aware of

        statism

       and the dangers that society's

       I have evolved into believing in many of the principles of being libertarian. It sounds like this may be an intellectual and political direction that will not drive you nuts.

       what other indisputable, uninterpretable vessel is there, besides science, to bring the planet together and achieving so much more than if we were separate? if you call it 'government' or 'politics' then you don't understand, and im guessing you've barely looked into it
