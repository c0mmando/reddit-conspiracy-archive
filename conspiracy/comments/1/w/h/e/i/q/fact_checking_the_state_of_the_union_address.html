        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/analysis-of-obamas-sotu-speech.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/analysis-of-obamas-sotu-speech.html</a> </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly the people on the politics board do not like hearing any of the truth. 
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1wfszq/fact_checking_the_2014_state_of_the_union_address/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1wfszq/fact_checking_the_2014_state_of_the_union_address/</a></p>

<p>The following are not conspiracy theories they are just basic facts of how the Corporations have completely taken over America today.</p>

<p>Lie number 1</p>

<p>The Afghan war is not set to end any time soon. Obama is negotiating with Karzai to keep 10,000 troops in Afghanistan for at least another 10 years at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Lie number 2</p>

<p>8 million jobs have not been created since the start of 2009. Only just over 4 million jobs have been created since mid 2009.</p>

<p>Lie number 3</p>

<p>How is Obama rebuilding any trust with the American people?</p>

<p>He is spying on every American through the NSA.</p>

<p>He has retained the over $1.3tn a year of Corporate Welfare while hiking the taxes on the middle class and working poor by a massive $200bn a year.</p>

<p>Lie Number 4</p>

<p>America is now plum bottom for social mobility (out of the 30 or so developed countries). The American dream of almost everyone being able to make it to the middle class is dead.</p>

<p>Lie Number 5</p>

<p>Obama is not rebuilding the middle class - he is wiping the middle class out.
Median Household Incomes have now fallen below the levels of 1995 at just above $50,000. 
Median Male wages have now fallen back to the level of 1970 at just over $30,000. 
Both numbers are inflation adjusted. 
Both numbers are still falling. </p>

<p>The economic charts for this are in here:-
<a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/10/all-of-policies-of-federal-government.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/10/all-of-policies-of-federal-government.html</a> </p>

<p>Lie number 6</p>

<p>Obama is not helping Veterans. He has just reduced Veterans pensions by reducing the COLA adjustment by 1%, which will effectively render Veterans pensions worthless in 10 or 20 years time.</p>

<p>Lie Number 6</p>

<p>Obama did not save the auto industry or General Motors. General Motors is going to need another bailout in the fairly near future.</p>

<p>Lie Number 7</p>

<p>The economy is not picking up speed - the reverse is true, it is slowing down.
Well paid jobs are NOT being created.
Of the 4 million jobs created since 2009, 1 million have gone to over 65&#39;s and 1 million are minimum wage bar staff and waiters.
Most of the rest of the 2 million jobs are low paid or minimum wage.</p>

<p>If GDP was calculated using real inflation America would never of been out of recession since 2008. Real inflation is 4%+ more than the official inflation statistics due to hedonic adjustments and under including things that have risen a lot in price - like college education.</p>

<p>Lie Number 8</p>

<p>Obama is not encouraging small businesses - he is strangling them.
Both the number of new business start ups and the number of people employed in those start ups have declined significantly.</p>

<p>Business start ups - the BLS Birth/Death model is wrong
<a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/05/business-start-ups-bls-birthdeath-model.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/05/business-start-ups-bls-birthdeath-model.html</a></p>

<p>Lie Number 9</p>

<p>Obama is not encouraging bringing jobs back to America.</p>

<p>He is currently negotiating the TPP treaty which will lose many thousands of American jobs and kill millions in the third world by denying access to affordable medicines.</p>

<p>Lie Number 10</p>

<p>America&#39;s energy production has increased very dramatically because of Fracking and Shale gas deposits.</p>

<p>Lie Number 11</p>

<p>Obama is not building a cleaner planet. He is over-riding existing environmental protections in America and elsewhere by negotiating the TPP treaty which over-rides National Laws.</p>

<p>Lie Number 12</p>

<p>Immigration amnesty will mean more competition for existing American workers.
It will increase unemployment and lower average wages.</p>

<p>Lie Number 13</p>

<p>Unemployment is NOT coming down.</p>

<p>It INCREASED by 600,000 in 2013.</p>

<p>The only reason that the headline rate of unemployment has come down is because of the hundreds of thousands of people of working age have left the labor force. They have given up looking for work because there are no decent paying jobs being created.</p>

<p>The labor participation rate is now the lowest it&#39;s been since the early 1980&#39;s (at under 63%) before the advent of large numbers of double income households.</p>

<p>Jobs data highlights - massive miss +74,000 vs +200,000 Expectations, 1 million FEWER jobs than in 2012 <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/jobs-data-highlights-massive-miss-74000">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/jobs-data-highlights-massive-miss-74000</a></p>

<p>Lie Number 14</p>

<p>Obama is NOT giving a chance for Americans to find a job.</p>

<p>Cutting Corporate Welfare by $1.3tn a year and using the money for massive tax cuts on the lower paid and some tax cuts on small and medium sized business WOULD create jobs.</p>

<p>But instead Obama increased taxes on the lower paid by $200bn a year, which means that Americans have less money to spend in American businesses.</p>

<p>Lie Number 15</p>

<p>America no longer has a world class education system.
Education standards are falling. 
America is sliding down the education league tables.</p>

<p>This is showing up in the appalling Social Mobility statistics where America is now plum last out of the 30 or so developed countries.</p>

<p>Young people are being loaded down with massive Student Loan debt, which has now surpassed $1tn. More than the sub-prime mortgage fiasco.
Getting more young people loaded down with massive student loan debts is NOT helping the economy, it is wrecking it.</p>

<p>Making money out of Education and breaking the economy  - the interest on Student Loan Debt
<a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/06/making-money-out-of-education-interest.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/06/making-money-out-of-education-interest.html</a></p>

<p>Lie Number 16</p>

<p>Obama is INCREASING income inequality, not addressing the problem.
Increasing income inequality is the inevitable result of current government  (both parties) and Federal Reserve policies. </p>

<p><a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/12/growing-inequality-only-very-few-people.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/12/growing-inequality-only-very-few-people.html</a></p>

<p>Lie Number 17</p>

<p>Obamacare does NOT fix the American Healthcare problem.</p>

<p>6 million policies have been cancelled and only 3 million people have so far signed up for Obamacare. 3 million FEWER people now have Healthcare Insurance as a result of Obamacare.</p>

<p>Obamacare is also not helping because it INCREASES the average cost of Healthcare (pre subsidy) by reducing the level of competition in an already highly uncompetitive market.</p>

<p>Obamacare is the worst scheme that anyone has come up with so far for providing Healthcare, anywhere in the world
<a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/11/obamacare-is-worst-scheme-that-anyone.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/11/obamacare-is-worst-scheme-that-anyone.html</a></p>

<p>Lie Number 18</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s Voting Reform Commission will NOT help improve American democracy.</p>

<p>He appointed Ben Ginsberg as co-chair</p>

<p>Stalinist sleazeball Ben Ginsberg co-chairs Obama&#39;s voting commission - he&#39;s just been on Maddow
<a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/stalinist-sleazeball-ben-ginsberg-co.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/stalinist-sleazeball-ben-ginsberg-co.html</a></p>

<p>Lie Number 19</p>

<p>America is NOT out of Iraq. There are still 7,000 private blackwater type mercenaries in Iraq.</p>

<p>Lie Number 20</p>

<p>Obama is not planning to leave Afghanistan or end the Afghan war.
He is negotiating with Karzai to keep 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan for at least another 10 years.</p>

<p>Lie Number 21</p>

<p>America is NOT safer.
Islamic Extremist groups now control far more territory than they did before Obama came to power.</p>

<p>Obama is supporting Al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria.</p>

<p>The Islamists have just taken over in Fallujah Iraq.</p>

<p>The Islamists control Libya and have grown in power in large parts of Africa. </p>

<p>92% of Pakistani&#39;s now consider the American government their enemy with a commensurate increase in support for Islamic Extremists due to Obama&#39;s drone warfare program and the large number of civilians it is killing.</p>

<p>There is a raging civil war in Yemen, where Obama is propping up a corrupt dictator.</p>

<p>etc. etc.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s drone warfare program is meeting it&#39;s objectives.</p>

<p>The purpose of the drone warfare program is to .... create more Islamic Extremists</p>

<p><a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-purpose-of-drone-warfare-program-is.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-purpose-of-drone-warfare-program-is.html</a></p>

<p>Where would the MIC be without enemies?</p>

<p>Lie Number 22</p>

<p>Iran is NOT trying to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>

<p>It is using it&#39;s stockpiles of partially enriched uranium for it&#39;s civilian nuclear energy program.</p>

<p>Ehud Barak, ex heads of Mossad and the CIA agree with this assessment.</p>

<p>Bibi Netanyahu &amp; Ehud Barak tried to hijack a war with Iran in 2010. IDF &amp; Mossad chiefs disagreed with them</p>

<p><a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2012/11/bibi-netanyahu-ehud-barack-tried-to.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2012/11/bibi-netanyahu-ehud-barack-tried-to.html</a></p>

<p>Truth Number 1</p>

<p>Obama is negotiating with Iran for peace, despite Senate warmongering in trying to impose a sanctions resolution. The Senate has been bought by AIPAC and Israel.</p>

<p>The scale of the Israeli bribery of US Politicans &amp; government - list of donations to the Neocon crowd <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-scale-of-israeli-bribery-of-us.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-scale-of-israeli-bribery-of-us.html</a></p>

<p>Emotional Blackmail Number 1</p>

<p>Uses a member of the armed services to pull at people&#39;s emotional heartstrings.</p>

<p>The troops are being used as cannon fodder in support of wars fought for Corporate profits.</p>

<p>What if ...... the wars were never about terrorism they were always about money and corporate greed</p>

<p><a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/01/what-if-wars-were-never-about-terrorism.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/01/what-if-wars-were-never-about-terrorism.html</a></p>

<p>Omissions </p>

<p>Obama did not mention the TPP or Tafta &quot;trade&quot; treaties</p>

<p>TPP treaty set to destroy jobs and kill millions, both Chomsky &amp; Buchanan oppose it</p>

<p><a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/tpp-treaty-set-to-destroy-jobs-and-kill.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/tpp-treaty-set-to-destroy-jobs-and-kill.html</a></p>

<p>Obama did not mention that the NSA is spying on every American and hundreds of millions more around the world.</p>

<p>The NSA&#39;s Mass Surveillance programs are only useful to the government - they make everyone else LESS SAFE</p>

<p><a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-nsas-mass-surveillance-programs-are.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-nsas-mass-surveillance-programs-are.html</a></p>

<p>It is time to put the spurious arguments of the supporters of the NSA&#39;s Mass Surveillance to bed</p>

<p>Neither did Obama mention this</p>

<p>There is a giant sucking sound in America today. The sound of trillions of dollars of wealth and millions of jobs leaving the country</p>

<p>Obama didn&#39;t mention the various moves to restrict civil liberties and prepare for the expected mass social unrest as a result of current economic policies by the government and the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s Catalog of Civil Rights Abuses and preparations for massive civil unrest Updated 12/11 <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2012/11/obamas-civil-rights-violations.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2012/11/obamas-civil-rights-violations.html</a></p>

<p>Updates</p>

<p>Lie number 23</p>

<p>The deficit has NOT been cut by half.</p>

<p>The deficit is currently running at the average deficit level of the Bush administration.</p>

<p>There was a huge increase in spending during Bush.</p>

<p>Bush increased the National Debt by $5.5tn over 8 years. The National Debt doubled during that time to ~$11tn.</p>

<p>This is an average of $700bn a year.</p>

<p>The deficit for 2013 was $650bn, the deficit for 2014 is expected to be $750bn according to the CBO.</p>

<p>The deficit is expected to increase to over $3tn and spending is expected to increase to $6tn in 2023 from the current $3.5tn with current policies.</p>

<p>Why the sequester is a giant con trick. Why the government and the Federal Reserve are on the wrong path.</p>

<p><a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/02/why-sequester-is-giant-con-trick.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/02/why-sequester-is-giant-con-trick.html</a></p>

<p>Lie Number 24</p>

<p>America is NOT the best place to do business, for the first time since these tables started being compiled, America has recently dropped out of the top 10 countries.</p>

<p>America has now fallen behind even Hong Kong.</p>

<p>America is NOT better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth. It is a very long way indeed from that.</p>

<p>It is sickening what is happening in America Today</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AMAZING! I had a lot of this going through my head as I was watching the speech last night but you did a great job of compiling all the evidence and links. More people need to see this, I have been spreading it around as much as I can.</p>

<p>My political science professor did something like this a few years back, he has us listen to it and take a survey on how we felt after each issue he talked about during the speech, then after we read the transcript and saw how bullshit everything was. All the numbers he would throw around had no support behind them. For instance &quot;This past month we increased jobs by 90,000.&quot; Everyone would say they were happy about it, then with the facts in front of them and reading it and seeing that there were 90k created, 175,000 were fired. So in really we lost jobs not created them. </p>

<p>Keep up the good work and it amazes me the bullshit that all these speeches are, and how gullible the public is. </p>

<p>Keep the word going around and keep it up! You can&#39;t fight the spread of information!</p>

<p>Depends on how you define &quot;war.&quot; Active combat operations are going to end at the end of 2014. The 10,000 would be primarily training of Afghan forces, with some spec ops teams to hit al Qaeda. But we&#39;d be giving up the fight against the Taliban.</p>

<p>Can you cite this? My understanding was that the TPP was to be an executive agreement, which means it cannot change federal law in any way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only reason that the headline rate of unemployment has come down is because of the hundreds of thousands of people of working age have left the labor force. They have given up looking for work because there are no decent paying jobs being created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Unemployment&quot; and &quot;people who aren&#39;t working&quot; are two different things. Labor force participation rates are what you&#39;re looking for. The unemployment rate is the proportion of people who are willing and able to work, actively looking for it, and unable to find a job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama and the Republicans (Boehner leading the Republican push) are trying to Fast Track the TPP treaty through Congress. </p>

<p>Congress will not be able to propose any amendments to it and there will not be much of a debate if Fast Track is passed.</p>

<p>The stumbling block so far is that there is a not a single Democrat co-sponsor of the Fast Track bill.</p>

<p>A few Democrat members of Congress, e.g. Alan Grayson have spoken out against TPP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The headline rate of unemployment only includes people that have actively looked for work in the last 4 weeks. </p>

<p>U6 unemployment is at 13%. This includes people who have only been able to find part time work but want full time work and some discouraged workers.</p>

<p>If the US used similar criteria as European countries in their official unemployment numbers, the headline unemployment rate in America would now be 11.5%.</p>

<p>Real unemployment including all those who would work if there were decent jobs available is now over 23% and rising. </p>

<p>If the only jobs available do not cover the costs of childcare, transport to work, loss of benefits etc. what is the point of working?</p>

<p>Until the real unemployment rate gets back into the range of historical norms (10 to 15%) labor market conditions will not see any noticeable improvement. When and if more jobs are created, more of the currently discouraged workers (currently over 8% of the work force) will start looking for work again. </p>

<p>At the moment the rate of job creation is not even keeping up with population growth and labor market conditions are deteriorating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPP over rides National Laws and National Sovereignty. </p>

<p>It sets up international tribunals where Corporations can sue local taxpayers for &quot;loss of profits&quot; if the government tries to protect the people over Corporate profits. </p>

<p>Individual settlements are expected to run into $bn&#39;s.</p>

<p>The main areas of TPP (that we know of so far) :- </p>

<p>Deregulation of multinational banks </p>

<p>Protects drugs company profits. Allows them to charge high prices in developing countries.</p>

<p>Copyright and patent protection. The longest patent and copyright protection will apply to all the countries in TPP. (So a drug company can bribe a member(s) of Congress to extend the patent protection on a particular drug and then that will effectively apply to all the countries in TPP. At least that is what the drugs companies are aiming for.)</p>

<p>Copyright protection for Hollywood - see the case of KimDotcom.</p>

<p>Allows Monsanto to sell their GMO seeds even if countries want to ban them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The President could reinstate the Rule of Law by prosecuting the major criminals in the crony Corporations and could Reinstate the Bill of Rights by not pursuing policies that abuse it. </p>

<p>The President cannot write laws himself or write a budget. (Although Obama is fond of EO&#39;s.)</p>

<p>Even if Congress approves a budget that allows $1.2tn a year to be spent on the military, Obama does not have to spend it. He could order the DoD and DHS to reduce spending by a very large amount.</p>

<p>He could publicize the fact that military spending is now $1.2tn (not the $650bn or so in the official DoD budget, plus ~$80bn for the continuing Afghan war).</p>

<p>Obama could stop the drone warfare program which just recruits more enemies of America. 
He could withdraw troops from hundreds of military bases around the world (but Obama is building even more bases and moved troops into 30 more African countries in 2013).</p>

<p>He can state what he would like to see Congress pass laws to do and has the money and resources to publicize his views to get public opinion on board. </p>

<p>Removing the government subsidies on the big banks, big oil and kicking ex Monsanto employees out of the FDA would all be extremely popular measures in the court of public opinion. Maybe he should start there. </p>

<p>He could also kick other Corporate lobbyists out of the government, people like Jack Lew.</p>

<p>There is actually quite a lot that Obama COULD DO to start moving things in the right direction without Congress doing anything. Obama doesn&#39;t want to and is making things even worse.</p>

<p>Even I would leave out the bit about ending the Federal Reserve for now. 
Even though the Federal Reserve is THE ROOT CAUSE of America&#39;s problems. It is the main enabler for everything else that is wrong with the government today.
He could refuse to appoint people that have the interests of the big banks and not the interests of Americans at heart as Chairman of the Fed. People like Janet Yellen. 
He could push for someone who does have the interests of Americans at heart in the court of public opinion. There are some candidates I could name.</p>

<p>Talk of ending the Federal Reserve private bank or otherwise taking away the power of the banksters has a habit of getting Presidents shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For over a hundred years before the Federal Reserve was set up the value of the dollar was remarkably stable (~1784 to 1913). </p>

<p>There were periods of price inflation,e .g. during the civil war and there were periods of price deflation during the various recessions. </p>

<p>The value of the dollar in 1913 was almost unchanged from 1800 / late 1700&#39;s. </p>

<p>America does not have free market capitalism. </p>

<p>The wealthy elites and the CEO&#39;s of crony Corporations have bought the government lock, stock and barrel and the government works for them, not for you. </p>

<p>Crony capitalism is also known as Corporatism.</p>

<p>&quot;Fascism should more properly be called Corporatism as it is the merger of Corporate and State power.&quot; Benito Mussolini</p>

<p>This perfectly describes the system in place in America today. See the TPP treaty currently being negotiated by Obama, if you have any doubts about this.</p>

<p>Prior to 1913 America did have a pretty good approximation to Free Market Capitalism. With this system in place America went from almost nothing to the greatest power on Earth in a little over 130 years. It took Rome 500 years to do that. It took the Brits about 700 years. </p>

<p>The Case Against Barack Obama. The genius of the United States is DYING <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-case-against-barack-obama.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-case-against-barack-obama.html</a></p>

<p>Things have been getting steadily worse since 1913. Since Bush was inaugurated there has been a dramatic worsening of America&#39;s strategic position and a dramatic weakening in the Rule of Law.</p>

<p>Prior to 1913, America still had the Rule of Law. When Rockefeller got too powerful and Standard Oil obtained a monopoly position it was broken up (in 1911) by the government.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil</a> </p>

<p>Nobody is doing anything to break up the monopoly position of the too big to jail banks today. The big banks actually consolidated their monopolistic positions in the crash of 2008 and the TARP bailouts. The big banks took over some of their less cogent rivals - like Lehman&#39;s Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch. The top 5 big banks are even bigger and even more powerful today, than they were in 2007. </p>

<p>Obama COULD do a heck of a lot of things (while still staying within the bounds of the Constitution) to start moving things in the right direction. He doesn&#39;t want to and is making things even worse. See my comment below.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you did watch the speech as you claim, you didn&#39;t actually listen to it or analyze it for yourself. </p>

<p>If you did watch it and actually listened to iObama&#39;s speech, you would know which part of the text I am referring to for each of Obama&#39;s 25 lies.</p>

<p>Just to help you out, the text of the speech is included at the bottom of the article. I am certainly not going to post up a propaganda video for people that can&#39;t read. The text is bad enough without having to listen to his sickening lying voice. The ONLY thing Obama is good at is public speaking. There have been some other inveterate liars in history that have been good at public speaking too, but actions speak far louder than mere words.</p>

<p>If you were in any way informed you would of spotted a lot of Obama&#39;s lies for yourself. That seems to be pretty much the consensus on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The part of the text of Obama&#39;s speech to which I am referring to for each lie is obvious. For the first one Obama said he was ending the war in Afghanistan. Maybe you didn&#39;t even bother to read or listen to his speech. The text was written while Obama was speaking, the links were put in straight after. I spotted another couple of lies after reading the text of the speech, there were so many to keep up with.</p>

<p>Obviously you are the spammer. If you had bothered to go to even one of the articles on my blog to check out the evidence that Obama was lying, you would of found that there are no ads on my blog and I make no money for it. </p>

<p>The mullahs in Tehran might be mad but they are not suicidal. They only encourage OTHER people to commit suicide attacks.</p>

<p>Iran cannot refine enough oil to meet their domestic energy needs. Hence their civilian nuclear energy program. </p>

<p>If Iran is developing a nuclear weapon (the intelligence agencies of Mossad and the CIA say they are not), it will be for self defense. </p>

<p>Iran has just signed a deal to export Natural Gas from Syria/Lebanon by building a pipeline from it&#39;s South Pars gas field via Iraq. </p>

<p>This deal was signed in July 2013 and was the real reason that the Neocons and Obama tried to escalate the Syrian war - not chemical weapons. </p>

<p>It is still the main reason why the Neocons in Congress want to scupper the Iranian peace talks by passing a resolution for sanctions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>19 - OK if the US DoD is paying for that, I agree, we&#39;re not out of Iraq yet.</p>

<p>22 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Iran cannot refine enough oil to meet their domestic energy needs. Hence their civilian nuclear energy program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is completely irrational.</p>

<p>How much money is Iran spending on its nuclear program? This is a high-tech program that requires a lot of high-tech equipment. Not only is the equipment expensive, so are the bribes to get countries to sell it to them. So is putting it in hardened bunkers so the USA or Israel will have a tougher time destroying it. So is training or acquiring (and protecting!) the scientists and technicians necessary to make it work.</p>

<p>How much money, time, and effort is that?</p>

<p>Stack up on top of that the diplomatic nightmare that they&#39;ve gone through since they launched the program.</p>

<p>How much money, time, and effort would it take to build enough comparatively ultra low tech refineries to turn Iran&#39;s seemingly limitless supply of oil into enough energy for the nation?</p>

<p>A tiny fraction of what they&#39;re spending on nuclear, right?</p>

<p>Do you know what diplomats would say if Iran built 17 new oil refineries? Something like, &quot;Good for you! Have fun with that.&quot; And that would be that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not at all about energy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would Iran do with nukes if it had them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does Pakistan do with them? India? North Korea? Israel?</p>

<p>Hopefully they&#39;d sit on them as a deterrent for the USA ever invading them. That seems to be the most logical, rational reason for them to pursue the weapon technology.</p>

<p>Think about it. Iran and Iraq fought like brothers for decades, maybe centuries and it was always a close battle.  Along comes the USA who kicks the everlovin&#39; shit out of Iraq inside of a week.</p>

<p>Iran knows the USA doesn&#39;t like it. Iran knows the USA has fucked with it before. Iran sees the USA becoming more aggressive with its military. Iran does not want to end up like Iraq. </p>

<p>Iran is incapable of repelling a US attack with conventional forces so it has only one option: Nukes.</p>

<p>So I agree with this statement of yours:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Iran is developing a nuclear weapon (the intelligence agencies of Mossad and the CIA say they are not), it will be for self defense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for the &quot;if&quot;.</p>

<p>Thus my statement that anyone who believes that Iran is developing nuclear capability for only power is... putting it more nicely this time... foolish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some very good points. I mostly agree with what you have written.</p>

<p>I have some provisos :- </p>

<p>If it was easy for Iran to build more oil refineries they would do so. Sanctions no doubt makes it more difficult. </p>

<p>North Korea bought their nuclear technology from Pakistan. It wasn&#39;t that difficult for N Korea to do it. </p>

<p>Iran knows that it is in a battle for Regional Power with Saudi Arabia and Israel, who are allies.</p>

<p>The tensions with Iran are about :-</p>

<p>Oil &amp; gas (obviously). There is a glut of carbon based energy at current prices. There is only a shortage of distribution and infrastructure - both pipelines and refineries. Iran &amp; Saudi Arabia are battling over their relative share of energy supplies.</p>

<p>Sunni&#39;s vs Shia&#39;s. The Europeans fought many wars over sectarian divides in the 1500&#39;s and 1600&#39;s. The division within Islam is very similar. </p>

<p>The USD as Reserve Currency. The US is in danger of losing Reserve Currency status because of it&#39;s massive debts. </p>

<p>If the USD loses Reserve Currency status this would very severely limit the power of the Federal Reserve as well as causing economic carnage in America itself. </p>

<p>There  was more news out on this one today :- <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-29/nothing-lasts-forever-world-bank-chief-economist-calls-end-dollar-reserve-currency">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-29/nothing-lasts-forever-world-bank-chief-economist-calls-end-dollar-reserve-currency</a> </p>

<p>China is in an economic coalition with Russia and the Brics to replace the USD as the Global Reserve Currency. Iran is selling oil to both China and India for something other than dollars. </p>

<p>The following link contains the series of actions that China has so far taken to marginalize the USD since 2011. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, anyone who doesnt believe what you admit isnt supported by any evidence is a fucking retard?</p>

<p>Furthermore, who cares if Iran is making a nuclear weapon? The USA has nuclear weapons. Israel has nuclear weapons. Pakistan has nuclear weapons. For some reason nuclear proliferation is good, when its done by certain people and bad when done by other people.</p>

<p>Any of the rationalizations that can be presented to justify Americans having nuclear weapons should also apply to anyone else. Getting sick of the &quot;we are more responsible&quot; myth that been perpetuated by those who have already used nuclear weapons irresponsibly. </p>

<p>&quot;We had to end the war&quot; sounds like a reasonable rationalization for dropping nuclear bombs on large cities, until Iran decides that they &quot;need to end a war&quot;, then everyone gets their panties in a wad. </p>

<p>That nuclear technology is considerably more expensive than oil refinery technology?</p>

<p>That Iran had to build its nuclear technology inside expensive fortified bunkers to help protect it in the case that another power like Israel or the USA might choose to destroy it, but certainly wouldn&#39;t have to do that with oil refineries?</p>

<p>That Iran has to protect its nuclear scientists and engineers from assassination but nobody would care to assassinate engineers and technicians working in oil refineries?</p>

<p>That Iran has to face almost an entire world full of governments who don&#39;t want it to build nuclear power but wouldn&#39;t give two shits about it building oil refineries?</p>

<p>That it&#39;s a shitton easier for Iran to get the raw materials for refineries than for nuclear power?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not telling you to believe any government. You don&#39;t need to believe any government. You just need the ability to think.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s examine facts. The cool thing about facts is they are true regardless of who says them. Here are some facts about Iran, nuclear technology, and oil refineries:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Iran says it&#39;s pursuing nuclear energy purely for public energy usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Iran has a nearly limitless supply of oil.</p></li>
<li><p>The technology required to get nuclear power up and running is very complicated and expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>The technology required to build and run an oil refinery is in use across the globe and in comparison to nuclear power is very cheap and simple.</p></li>
<li><p>The process to get nuclear power up and running is incredibly lengthy (how long have they been at this already) and effort-intensive.</p></li>
<li><p>The process to get an oil refinery up and running is non-trivial but in comparison to nuclear energy is trivial. They could have been there by now.</p></li>
<li><p>Iran had to build its nuclear facilities inside hardened bunkers in order to help protect it from military strikes by, one would assume, Israel and/or the USA.</p></li>
<li><p>Iran would not have needed to build oil refineries inside hardened bunkers because nobody would care to attack them.</p></li>
<li><p>Iran has seen its share of assassinated nuclear physicists and technicians and needs to spend an inordinate amount of effort and money protecting them.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody would care to assassinate Iranian oil refinery engineers or technicians.</p></li>
<li><p>Iran has to face the diplomats of numerous nations (not just the USA and Israel) who do not want it to develop nuclear anything.</p></li>
<li><p>The world could give two shits if Iran built 100 oil refineries.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Think about it. Why is Iran going through so much pain, anguish, effort, and expense?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not for nuclear energy. They could have had all the oil-based energy they wanted by now given the same investment of time, money, and lives.</p>

<p>Given their proximity to the equator and the lack of cloud cover over the nation, one imagines they could have done the same with solar. Hell, they could be the kings of solar energy worldwide had they invested every dollar and hour they spent on nuclear on solar instead.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not about energy. It&#39;s about nuclear weapons. If you examine the facts and apply a bit of critical thought, that is the only rational conclusion.</p>

<p>=== EDIT ===</p>

<p>Let me be clear on this, too. I don&#39;t begrudge Iran the ability to build nuclear weapons. I believe it really is one of only two ways they could ever deter an Iraq-like ass-whooping like the USA put on Iraq. (The other being a mutual defense agreement with China that would force China to attack the USA if the USA ever attacked Iran.) It&#39;s in their national best interest, long term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. </p>

<p>Having nuclear weapons is a deterrence against any invasion by America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some very good points. I mostly agree with what you have written.</p>

<p>I have some provisos :- </p>

<p>If it was easy for Iran to build more oil refineries they would do so. Sanctions no doubt makes it more difficult. </p>

<p>North Korea bought their nuclear technology from Pakistan. It wasn&#39;t that difficult for N Korea to do it. </p>

<p>Iran knows that it is in a battle for Regional Power with Saudi Arabia and Israel, who are allies.</p>

<p>The tensions with Iran are about :-</p>

<p>Oil &amp; gas (obviously). There is a glut of carbon based energy at current prices. There is only a shortage of distribution and infrastructure - both pipelines and refineries. Iran &amp; Saudi Arabia are battling over their relative share of energy supplies.</p>

<p>Sunni&#39;s vs Shia&#39;s. The Europeans fought many wars over sectarian divides in the 1500&#39;s and 1600&#39;s. The division within Islam is very similar. </p>

<p>The USD as Reserve Currency. The US is in danger of losing Reserve Currency status because of it&#39;s massive debts. </p>

<p>If the USD loses Reserve Currency status this would very severely limit the power of the Federal Reserve as well as causing economic carnage in America itself. </p>

<p>There  was more news out on this one today :- <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-29/nothing-lasts-forever-world-bank-chief-economist-calls-end-dollar-reserve-currency">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-29/nothing-lasts-forever-world-bank-chief-economist-calls-end-dollar-reserve-currency</a> </p>

<p>China is in an economic coalition with Russia and the Brics to replace the USD as the Global Reserve Currency. Iran is selling oil to both China and India for something other than dollars. </p>

<p>The following link contains the series of actions that China has so far taken to marginalize the USD since 2011. </p>
