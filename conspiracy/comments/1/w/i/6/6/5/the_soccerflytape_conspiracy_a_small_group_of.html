        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">134</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-01-29 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/pimpst1ck.html">pimpst1ck</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi there <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  I don&#39;t expect this to be up long until it&#39;s deleted by the mods but I hope it&#39;s read by as many of you as possible.  I honestly I would never find myself posting here, but the situation calls for extreme measures.  Before some readers trawl through my comment and out me, yes I am a regular poster to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>.  Although I&#39;ll say now that I&#39;ve never been part of any alt-account posting or brigading, and that this is the first time I believe I&#39;ve ever posted or voted her.  The my main problems with this sub are with a small number of posters who allow and permeate racist discourse.  That&#39;s the reason why I&#39;m here.</p>

<p>A few days ago I noticed that r/holocaust was modded and run as a Holocaust denial front.  I had a serious problem with this, but I knew that reddit didn&#39;t grants subreddit mod requests based on racism.  However I believed I had a case that the subreddit modship could be revoked on legitimate grounds of inactivity.  3/5 mods were shadowbanned (including <a href="/u/bumblingmumbling">/u/bumblingmumbling</a> and <a href="/u/Occidentalist">/u/Occidentalist</a>), one was inactive for over 60 days (<a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a>) as per the rules on <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> and one had been active elsewhere on reddit recently but had not made any contribution whatsoever to <a href="/r/holocaust">/r/holocaust</a> (/EdSmith1384).  Since <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> is dedicated to handing over &quot;abandoned&quot; subreddits to new mod teams, I thought there was a more than sufficient case that the <a href="/r/holocaust">/r/holocaust</a> team had abandoned the subreddit.  On top of their inactivity, the activity on the subreddit had slower to a trickle, limited to posts by passerby users unaware of the Holocaust Denial material on the sidebar, and months old posts about Holocaust denial still lingering on the front page.  Several users of <a href="/r/badhistory">/r/badhistory</a> including me and the mod <a href="/u/Turnshroud">/u/Turnshroud</a> posted a few links refuting the claims of Holocaust Denial which turned out to be the most concentrated activity on the subreddit in the last year.</p>

<p>However, despite these grounds, and despite making another appeal to the admins via PM, my request failed.  This was becaus e <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> allows a three day grace period for the mods to respond to the request (upon which an automatic message is sent to the mod team of said requested subreddit).  The first mod to respond, funnily enough, was <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a>, who had no indication of any activity on reddit in the previous 80 days (25% more than the 60 day minimum for mod abandonment).  Literally his only post activity on reddit in the last 3 months has been objecting to my request and posting one random link to r/terrorism.  Since then he has not posted anything in the last five days.  Now I found that this was especially odd considering <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> is moderator for OVER SEVENTY SUBREDDITS. Shouldn&#39;t someone with that much power over reddit communties be a bit more active on the website.</p>

<p>I discovered that this had created some problems for other subreddits.  Firstly there was <a href="/r/iran">/r/iran</a> who was trying to remove <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> as head mod to try and fix some of the problems with the subreddit. They appealed to him with a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/iran/comments/1vmz6v/sticky_for_visibility_feedback_result/">survery of the userbase</a> of which over half called for <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> to step down.  He ignored it.  The userbase then <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/iran/comments/1vpk5v/ever%20yone_please_message_the_reddit_admins_the/">appealed on mass to the admins</a>.  They also did nothing.  So despite reddit proclaiming an environment for free speech and democracy, the majority of a subreddit&#39;s subscribers are unable to remove a mod who is holding the subreddit hostage.  In the last year, he has only made one contribution to <a href="/r/iran">/r/iran</a>, which was heavily downvoted by the userbase.</p>

<p>This issue has also extended into <a href="/r/xkcd">/r/xkcd</a>, which has gained a bit more publicity.  <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> is the head mod there, yet recently the active mod was <a href="/u/Wyboth">/u/Wyboth</a>.  He was popular and did many good things with the subreddit including creating the new CSS.  Then he starting removing links on the sidebar to <a href="/r/TheRedPill">/r/TheRedPill</a>, <a href="/r/mensrights">/r/mensrights</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (which admittedly aren&#39;t seriously related to <a href="/r/xkcd">/r/xkcd</a>).  This resulted in him being removed from modship, which upset a large number of users.  This is where <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> starts to get involved.  When soccer removes wyboth, he replaces him with flytape.  Flytape attempted to say wyboth&#39;s removal of mod privilages was his own fault, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/1wat2l/wyboth_has_brought_this_upon_himself/">a post which he later deleted.</a>.  He then tried to convince the subreddit community that everythin g was running as normal, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/1wb8ak/everything_is_back_to_normal/">in a thread that was chockablock full of deleted/censored comments and then later removed from being visible on the front page.</a>.  It&#39;s also worth pointing that the creator of xkcd <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/anonymous123421/comments/1w8aie/petition_to_reinstate_uwyboth_as_a_mod_of_rxkcd/">has expressed his disgust at how his intellectual property is being abused</a>.  In the same link you&#39;ll se that flytape has attempting to attribute the blame for wyboth&#39;s removal for talking to SRS about how <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> is squatting on his own subreddit in a post about my attempt to get modship of r/holocaust.  Despite wyboth only reiterated the point that soccer is squatting on subreddit&#39;s and holding them hostage, flytape says that he was committing some level of espionage - literally calls it &quot;serious personal army stuff&quot;.</p>

<p>So that brings it back to the situation with <a href="/r/holocaust">/r/holocaust</a> and <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a>&#39;s intentional squatting on the subreddit to keep it as a front for Holocaust denial.  Although several changes happened after I made my request for modship.  You might remember that myself and <a href="/u/Turnshroud">/u/Turnshroud</a> posted some anti-denial links. Suddenly, our links disappeared.  I posted links to the Holocaust History Project and the Holocaust Controversies Blogspot page, which were on topic and did not violate any apparant rules of the subreddit.  My hidden links can still be <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/1vsvgj/the_holocaust_history_project_a_useful_collection/">viewed directly</a> by url <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/1vzher/the_holocaust_controveries_blog_one_of_the_most/">here though</a>.  You won&#39;t find them anywhere on the page though.  I find it incredibly ironic that an almost completely inactive user objected to a user taking over his subreddit on grounds of inactivity, when said user had created the most on topic subreddit activity in the last year.  <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> also started expanding the mod list, presumably as a way to ensure the subreddit&#39;s safety from further requests despite his own inactivity.  One of these new mods was <a href="/u/0ccidentalist">/u/0ccidentalist</a>, an alt account for the shadowbanned mod <a href="/u/Occidentalist">/u/Occidentalist</a>, who responded to my <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> request with the convincing words of &quot;Fuck You&quot;.  However the most interesting new mod added to the <a href="/r/holocaust">/r/holocaust</a> team was none other than our friend <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a>.  Flytape had already proven to be more than suitable for this modteam by already proving he was the least capable and desirable person to run an online community dedicated to the Holocaust.  Most recently he had said <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1vozfg/the_moderators_are_shills_working_to_advance/ceuibf2">this statement in a comment on this very subrddit</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody gave a fuck about the civil war ending in 1942 and we shouldn&#39;t give a fuck about the Holocaust in 2014.  Yes it was bad and should be remembered as a historical anomaly, Jews should remember it and not let themselves end up in that situation again. But 72 years is almost 3/4ths of a century and people need to move the fuck on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let that sink in.  Not is he only partly blaming the Jews for the Holocaust, but he is explicitly encouraging people to STOP TALKING ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you, why would a person accept an offer to moderate an online community about the Holocaust when he has explicitly said he wants people to so stop talking about it?  It only makes sense that he accepting it as part of an agenda to keep squatting on the subreddit and to explicitly limit the discourse on the Holocaust which happens there.  And it&#39;s worked.  The greatest contributions to the subreddit in the last year have been deleted and now only material promoting Holocaust denial is allowed.</p>

<p><a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> is directly complicit in a conspiracy headed by <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> to control as many non-default subreddits, which would have potential communities, as possible.  Following with the example or <a href="/r/iran">/r/iran</a>, <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> also holds many other national subreddit domains including <a href="/r/ivorycoast">/r/ivorycoast</a>, <a href="/r/oman">/r/oman</a>, <a href="/r/libya">/r/libya</a> and <a href="/r/bangladesh">/r/bangladesh</a>.  Following in the example of <a href="/r/xkcd">/r/xkcd</a>, he holds many significant issue based domains hostage such as <a href="/r/gender">/r/gender</a> which are moderated by legitimate users, but like in the case of <a href="/u/Wyboth">/u/Wyboth</a> could be removed at any whim he wishes.  He holds a monopoly on most Israeli-Palestinian subs including <a href="/r/IDF">/r/IDF</a>, <a href="/r/mossad">/r/mossad</a>, <a href="/r/Palestine">/r/Palestine</a>, <a href="/r/middleeastnews">/r/middleeastnews</a>, <a href="/r/jewishstudies">/r/jewishstudies</a> and <a href="/r/hamas">/r/hamas</a>.  Ironically, it&#39;s not the Jewish conspiracy which is controlling the dissemination of information for pro-zionist causes on reddit, it&#39;s actually Holocaust denierswho are controlling and squatting on online communities to prevent pro-Israel material being spread.  He has no intention of doing anything with these subs except to hold them and to prevent any user group or lower mods doing things with them he doesn&#39;t like.</p>

<p>If <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you truly dislike censorship, the control of information and supression of free speech, then look no further than your borders.  <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> is directly complicit in one of the biggest conspiracies on reddit which are guilty of all these things, headed by possibly the most powerful non-admin redditor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of aware I&#39;m going into &#39;enemy territory&#39; with <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a>, but I hope as many of you receive this information as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see alot of people bitching about Jews, holocaust, conspiratards and brigades, and yet, no one dares adress another issue. I don&#39;t participate or post in r/conspiracy or r/conspiratard because frankly, I don&#39;t care. I am however an avid follower of XKCD for years now, and what your boy u/flytape and his buddy u/KamensGhost are doing in r/xkcd is inexcusable. Freedom of speech my ass. They have taken over a sub they had no participation in before being made mods by u/soccer, started with deleting comments of those questioning them or disagreeing with them, deleted all posts about the mod situation, started banning contributors in the r/xkcd sub AND blacklisting and deleting comic strips making fun of conspiracy theories, WHICH WERE ALWAYS A STAPLE OF XKCD and other strips they personally disagree with, like Pickup Artist. If that is NOT a hostile takeover and attempt to censor and screw a subreddit, I don&#39;t know what is. How do you excuse that? What &quot;freedom of speech&quot; are you exactly defending? Your own, over everyone else&#39;s INCLUDING the freakin&#39; comic creator? I see alot of talk about shills. Here&#39;s a thought, conspiracy fans: If shills do exist, I&#39;m pretty sure they are professional and smart enough to integrate themselves in a community and assume positions of responsibillity, and later use them to discredit said community with their actions. It&#39;s called being an &quot;agent provocateur&quot;. Right now your subreddit is the focus of a lot of shit-talking and criticism because some people that are mods and frequent contributors in your subreddit are pissing all over other subreddits they had no business with in the first place and generally being total assholes to other communities. Just food for thought. There, I vented, go ahead and ban me now, defenders of &quot;freedom&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Randall could try filing a lawsuit over it. I&#39;m sure having a racist Holocaust denier claiming to represent his comics and using that representation to shill a political agenda is negatively affecting his brand, seeing as they are using his trademark in the subreddit name (someone who owned the trademark &quot;gaymers&quot; once sued reddit to get <a href="/r/gaymers">/r/gaymers</a> to change their subreddit name and it would have worked had he not dropped the lawsuit.

<p>At least changing the subreddit name will prevent fans of the comic from subscribing, thus cutting off any new subscribers. </p>

(Not sure if serious, or trying to anger people) if actually serious-  propaganda doesn&#39;t make up the millions of deaths. Propaganda doesn&#39;t exaggerate the atrocities the Nazis committed. If you are in such denial, go visit a concentration camp in Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get where you&#39;re coming from.</p>

<p>However</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say Goeth (The Butcher of Plaszow) didn&#39;t really stand on his balcony and snipe Jewish prisoners for fun.  His mistress literally denied these allegations until the day she died.  So maybe there is a chance that people were caught up in the emotions of being starved to death in a labor camp and embellished the story a little bit to get back at the Nazis.  </p>

<p>If that possibility is true then yes, the atrocities of the Nazis have been exaggerated.  I don&#39;t know that it is true but it is certainly plausible.  Hence the reason that I find it absurd to label everyone who brings up an inconsistency as a racist and threaten them with jail time.</p>

<p>And there are concentration camps where the soviets were the only ones with access for many years.  There have been some inconsistencies surrounding some of the claims there as well.  </p>

<p>Does it make me a criminal for talking specifically about the inconsistencies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Erm, can I just point out that you&#39;re all talking about a scene in a movie - which captured the essence of events without strict attention to historical accuracy - based on a fictional book?  Albeit the latter did reference dozens of interviews between Thomas Kenneally and those saved by Oskar Schindler.</p>

<p>Goeth did randomly shoot prisoners with a sniper rifle, but not precisely in the way demonstrated in the movie, which isn&#39;t even the way described in the novel, which in turn embellished the historical testimony.</p>

<p>Just saying. It is kind of better to go to the source than base your knowledge base on Hollywood movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. If I recall correctly it was given a full blown orthodox funeral in Israel anyway. Nobody denies the big points of the holocaust:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jews were rounded up and put in ghettos</li>
<li>All their property was illegally taken from them</li>
<li>They were sometimes massacred in these ghettos</li>
<li>From the ghettos they were sent to concentration camps</li>
<li>Due to either work, fatigue, disease, or starvation, many <em>many</em> people died</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone agrees on these things. However, when you even bring up <em>known</em> hoaxes, like the lampshades, Jewish soap, and even the fucking shrunken heads, conversation/debate immediately stops, and that&#39;s bullshit. People let their emotions take over, and I get it, it&#39;s a pretty emotional thing, but that&#39;s the beauty of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, people are - theoretically - allowed to discuss things like this without fear of repercussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/pimpst1ck">/u/pimpst1ck</a> is pretty much correct in everything he has already said.  </p>

<p>While <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> will cry about the first amendment and censorship that isn&#39;t actually what this is about. This is him stomping out at least two communities who don&#39;t want him there.  </p>

<p>He was added as a mod by <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> to <a href="/u/holocaust">/u/holocaust</a> to stop an attempt by another user to make it a more active place. Now he&#39;s one of many mods which includes <a href="/u/bumblingmumbling">/u/bumblingmumbling</a> who made this sick holocaust joke:<br/>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/2WweXzS.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/2WweXzS.jpg</a>  </p>

<p><a href="/r/holocaust">/r/holocaust</a> isn&#39;t actually about discussion. Posts about the holocaust that suggest it may have happened are being regularly removed by said moderators. For example, try to find this post on the sub:<br/>
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/1w75hr/report_on_documenting_killing_sites_throughout/">http://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/1w75hr/report_on_documenting_killing_sites_throughout/</a>  </p>

<p><a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> was then asked to mod <a href="/u/xkcd">/u/xkcd</a> by the same <a href="/u/soccer">/u/soccer</a> who has been holding on to the top mod spot there despite the community saying they don&#39;t want that. They created a protest sub called <a href="/u/xkcdcomic">/u/xkcdcomic</a>. The creator of the xkcd comic has stated publicly he does not want <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> moderating a community about his comics:<br/>
<a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/anonymous123421/comments/1w8aie/petition_to_reinstate_uwyboth_as_a_mod_of_rxkcd/cezp63m">http://np.reddit.com/r/anonymous123421/comments/1w8aie/petition_to_reinstate_uwyboth_as_a_mod_of_rxkcd/cezp63m</a>  </p>

<p>While <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> has continued to deny he is a holocaust denier he is actually a self-admitted holocaust denier. He correctly pointed out in the past that &quot;holocaust denial&quot; has different varieties to it:<br/>
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratocracy/comments/1tx3k5/holocaust_denial/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratocracy/comments/1tx3k5/holocaust_denial/</a>  </p>

<p>He has openly stated that he is in the middle category that he described in that post:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that the numbers were exaggerated.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now he&#39;s being an enabler to the category he claims is very rare:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people, an extreme few of them, claim it didn&#39;t happen at all.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This obviously isn&#39;t a free speech issue. Those communities don&#39;t want him and his buddies there. He&#39;s simply a trolling, community stomping, attention whore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, here is the thing, there are actually 2 problems, first being, that you cannot snatch the crayons back. To become a mod in a sub, you have to be modded by another mod or if the sub is modless or the mod is inactive, you have to request it from the admins, in which case, the AWOL mod is notified, and if he doesn&#39;t reply or veto the request, the admins grant it. Apparently, when u/soccer is notified that someone wants to mod one of his subs, obviously because he doesn&#39;t, he becomes active long enough to either decline the request or kick out the new mod, and appoint instead somene else , in the case of r/xkcd, u/flytape, as mod (someone with no participation or interest in XKCD). So, no snatching the crayon back. </p>

<p>The second problem is, why the hell does he do that? Exploit reddit&#39;s loose rules (recently changed and tightened because of this shitstorm) on mod requests to hoard a bunch of random modless subs (keep in mind that not all modless subs are dead or inactive, several thriving communities remained modless by accident or on purpose, and thus vulnerable for exploitation). Then ,go AWOL and appear only when someone else requests modship only to deny them and appoint someone else with no relation to the sub. The only reasonable explanation I can think of is that u/soccer is just a sockpuppet created by a group of users to hold subs hostage for future use or to fuck them up for their own reasons, be it pettiness, trolling, an agenda or provocation. I cannot speak to their motives, but the method and it&#39;s result are pretty obvious. </p>

<p>That said, it seems like the only motive for you to try to rally people for your &quot;cause&quot; is to suppress content like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/1wgjpu/six_million_jews_19151938/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/1wecst/richard_e_harwood_did_six_million_really_die_pdf/">this</a>.

<p>Im not getting any information from this statement that he is blaming the Jewish Community nor encouraging people to stop talking about the holocaust.
This sounds like an interpretation on your part that he implied that.</p>

<p>What I read is that he thinks  that it was a bad but that why should we dwell on it? which to me he is making a statement that sometimes dwelling on the past doesn&#39;t make it better. Which I do understand from one perspective.</p>

<p>Also that the there are people in the Jewish community at that time that are partly responsible for what happened to them. The reasons why is that when the Germans came in, most of them just rolled over. If your country gets occupied and you do nothing you are partly responsible are you not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is analogous to saying a rape victim, while not asking for it, should have just, you know, not gotten raped. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t really quite right, but it is hard to find something to compare to placing blame on the victims of systemic, organized, and mindful slaughter. Look at the examples of those who fought back in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a>, who were all slaughtered. Yes, it is not black and white, however that does not imply that the Nazi party, or <em>anyone</em> complicit in these actions, should take anything less that all the blame. What can you, yes <em>you</em>, Trinsic-paridiom, do as a person when an entire nation state is committing irrationally large amounts of resources to killing you, your family, your freinds, and anyone like you. More to the point, imagine, if you will, that you are living in a small town in Hungary. From there to the Soviet lines was on average 500 miles. </p>

<p>If enough people make a concerted effort to do something anything is possible. This is the story of humanity. We have walked on the moon (if not, why haven&#39;t NASA had any accomplishments since?), been to the deepest reaches of the ocean, flown jetliners past the speed of sound. When we can accomplish such beneficial feats what makes it so impossible that an entire nation state of 90 million people could all work together and accomplish a feat of such horrifying magnitude as the holocaust. It&#39;s not like the Jews all let the Nazi&#39;s kill them meekly, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielski_partisans">Bielski partizans</a> certainly prove that, but it is hard to succeed when a well equipped, highly efficient, and world beating army is doing their darnedest to kill you.</p>

<p>In summaiton, I think that you gravely underestimate the human capacity for violence. Remember that this sort of tragedy, no matter who you think to blame, must never happen again. The wholesale slaughter of men, women, and children, for any reason, is not to be ignored or belittled. I know none of this will matter to you, but just try to understand how the victims of the holocaust felt, whether they be Jewish, catholic, protestant, Muslim, Russian, German, Polish, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Moldovan, Czech, Slovak, Serb, Croat, Slovene, Italian, French, Belgian, Danish, dutch, Austrian, gay, straight, male, female, young or old. I don&#39;t even care if you are hate jews, or dislike them, or whatever your reasoning is. But what I do care about is that you understand that such an event must never happen again. To say it couldn&#39;t is naive. There is nothing more important to take away. Please, I beg of you, of all the denizens of this subreddit, please, no matter how imaginary you believe the holocaust, no matter how much you think it justified, exaggerated, contrived, whatever you think, please understand that murdering millions, or even hundreds of thousands of people is not acceptable. Yes, the allies bombed cities to rubble, and to us this is an act of barbarous cruelty, but two wrongs do *<strong><em>NOT</em></strong>* make a right. Please, if nothing else, remember that. </p>

<p>I know this is about as successful as commanding the tide to stay out, but I have an irrational optimism that even if only one person remembers this I have made the world just a little better. And we need all the light we can get.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flytape [+15] -114 points 9 days ago (100|212)
This is the problem with people today.
Everyone thinks they &quot;know everything&quot; and anyone who doesn&#39;t agree 100% is a sheeple or a conspiratard or a denier.
I could tell you my views on the Holocaust but honestly, nobody gives a fuck.</p>

<p>The Holocaust happened so long ago that it shouldn&#39;t even matter any more. The Holocaust happened 72 years ago. If we go back in time to 1942 when the holocaust started 72 years ago, then we go back in time another 72 years (a total of 144 years) the civil war just ended. Nobody gave a fuck about the civil war ending in 1942 and we shouldn&#39;t give a fuck about the Holocaust in 2014.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no adequate reason whatsoever for denying anything less than 5-6 milion Jews being killed during the Holocaust.  All evidence points towards that death toll including all available census date (e.g. check the World Almanac figures from 1938-1948) and a complete historian academic consensus for this figure (with much debate about the specific number within this figure)</p>

<p>Denying that figure would not be shitty if you had good evidence and reason for it.  For example Gerald Reitlinger, who wrote one of the first comprehensive Holocaust histories in 1953, stated that roughly 4.8 million Jews were killed.  This figure was based on incomplete evidence at the time and so the dimished figue was legitimate for the period.  Now it&#39;s no longer relevant.</p>

<p>Since you have no legitimate reason to disagree with the 5-6 million death toll, then you presumably have an additional agenda to deny the academic consesus on the Holocaut.</p>

<p>I can convey historical facts without risking jail time. I&#39;m British. I don&#39;t necessarily agree with Holocaust deniers being imprisoned for their opinions, though I can see why the countries involved did add that to their statute books.</p>

<p>To my mind, it&#39;s much more useful to let them air their views, so that historians can point out the many flaws in their logic and/or shred their &#39;facts&#39; under scrutiny of the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the problem with that, outside groups were brought into the &quot;debate&quot;.  Outside groups contacted Randall and the admins and even came to conspiracy to try and appeal to me stepping down here.</p>

<p>Its highschool groupthink popularity contest bullshit.</p>

<p>Now here is reality.  Soccer owns xkcd.  Soccer isn&#39;t going to let you use xkcd as a platform to get people to leave xkcd nor will he give it to you because you don&#39;t like him.  You can feign outrage all day long but reality is that a majority of people don&#39;t give a shit.  This SJW campaign to have mods step down is just the vocal minority trying to impose their will upon people by using bullying tactics like this whole racism charge being leveled at me.</p>

<p>So.... keep crying.  I don&#39;t care.  Life goes on.</p>

<p>Seriously don&#39;t you realise you are accusing Jews of doing things to Palestinians which you denied happened to the Jews in the first place?  You&#39;re contradicting yourself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m especially interested in citations for Israeli gas chambers and mobile killing squads.  I&#39;m also interested in how the Palestinian population has increased 10-fold in the last 60 years. For a group of people which managed to stage the greatest hoax in world history, they seem surprisingly bad at committing genocide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>pimpst1ck</strong>, you seem terribly obsessed with the Holocaust - with a fervor bordering on religious fanaticism. You seem to think of it as a sacrosanct event that should be held in reverence, and NEVER discussed except with a bowed head and contrite spirit.</p>

<p>No one wants to be called before the Holocaust Inquisition, and given the pseudo-religious aura of mystique that the Holocaust has acquired, the accusation of HOLOCAUST DENIER has become a spectre that strikes fear into the hearts of the masses, any of whom may inadvertently run afoul of the Holocaust Dogma because precise definitions have never been set in stone.</p>

<p>Would you be so kind as to define the Dogma and Tenets of the Holocaust? You know, the Articles of Faith that each and every person is expected to accept - <strong>without question</strong> - in order to avoid being labeled and ATTACKED as a &quot;Holocaust Heretic&quot;?</p>

<p>Given the potentially HARSH ramifications for &quot;Denial&quot; (prison time in many countries), I think it is only fair that the peasants be informed on what they MUST believe in order to avoid such charges.</p>

<p>Friend, look up. You just launched a rambling <strong>1,500 word screed</strong> of whining and hand-wringing, bemoaning the fact that you and your pals are unable to gain control of various subs - and the crux of your &quot;argument&quot; revolves around so-called &quot;Holocaust deniers&quot; - as though these elusive, mysterious (and largely irrelevant) creatures are the greatest threat to life on Earth today.</p>

<p>Above you mention &quot;academic discussion in the classroom&quot;. What exactly do you teach and to whom? In any case, it&#39;s clear that you are BALLS DEEP in your devotion to a topic that, from my experience, is of little relevance to the public at large: Most people simply accept that the Holocaust was a blight on human history, largely accept the &quot;facts&quot; as presented (by folks such as yourself), and move on - busying themselves with the here-and-now challenges of daily existence. </p>

<p>Are there people that &quot;<strong>deny</strong> the Holocaust&quot;? Possibly, but we don&#39;t know with certainty, as you and your fellows have been asked to articulate exactly WHAT MUST BE BELIEVED in order to avoid such a charge, and you have dodged. </p>

<p>People deny / question many things, from the theory of evolution to the moon landings, but thanks to the valiant efforts of SOME, so-called &quot;Holocaust Denial&quot; (and I say &quot;so-called&quot; because you have yet to define WHAT deniers supposedly deny) is attacked as the epitome of EVIL, the mark of morally reprehensible reprobates, right up there with baby rapists. This is tantamount to the charges of HERESY that were leveled  against those who defied the dogma and tenets of Christianity as dictated by the church during the inquisition - but with ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE: <strong>At least the church DEFINED what one MUST BELIEVE in order to avoid such charges</strong>. </p>

<p>But you refuse to do that. <strong>Why?</strong> How can you indulge in <em>J&#39;ACCUSE</em>ing people of &quot;disbelief&quot; when YOU and yours <strong>refuse</strong> to define exactly what <strong>MUST</strong> be believed in order to avoid the accusation? </p>

<p>Is my asking for clarification ITSELF an act of Holocaust Heresy?</p>

<p>So tell us, Mr. &quot;<em>academic discussion in the classroom</em>&quot;, how would you respond if one of your STUDENTS posed this same question in the classroom? Would you have the other students stone him to death? Burn him at the stake for having the temerity to ASK?</p>

<p>WTF do you pretend to be &quot;defending&quot;, <strong>pimpst1ck</strong>?</p>

<p>It was a predictable consequence of the Industrial Revolution. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is true. Much genocide in the Old Testament as well. God ordered it, and at least one order still stands, in fact.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Indeed raged day and night like Dresden or Tokyo after a firebombing air raid - <strong>also</strong> new in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Many things happened for the first time during that century, come to think of it. Large scale chemical warfare - atomic bombs being tested on civilian populations... one could go on and on.</p>

<p>The &quot;academic&quot; I&#39;ve been chatting with in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1wmc2s/guess_what_the_guy_who_accused_rconspiracy_mod/"><strong>THIS</strong></a> thread doesn&#39;t seem to know what he&#39;s talking about. I think he has ignored pre-1939 history in favor of studying the means and methods of gore - which is pretty much par for the course, from what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But remember this, and remember it hard - there were gas chambers and cremetoria constructed with genocide in mind. Industrial scale murder with the aim of obliterating whole sectors of society. An estimated 17 million individuals died. </p>

<p>Gas chambers? <em>Check</em></p>

<p>Crematoria? <em>Check</em></p>

<p>Genocidal intentions? <em>Check</em></p>

<p>Curious that you would think I &quot;DENY&quot; these things (I don&#39;t).</p>

<p>My criticism of your position is that you focus on what happened to who and where while ignoring the ONLY pertinent question: <strong>WHY</strong>.</p>

<p>Do you REALLY think that someone is going to build more gas chambers, crematoria and open-pit fires to dispose of undesirables?</p>

<p>DUDE! Technology has changed! Keep up with the times!</p>

<p>What you SHOULD be concerned with is the cause of the cultural rifts, divide, and enmity that spawned the technical details that horrify. That is the ONLY worthy study if you truly seek to avoid &quot;that future&quot;. </p>

<p>That is true. Much genocide in the Old Testament as well. God ordered it, and at least one order still stands, in fact.</p>

<p>My apologies. I&#39;m not a Christian (nor a member of any other Abrahamic religion), therefore I&#39;m not proficient in using the Old Testament as historical evidence. I do respect the fact that it is part of your religious beliefs though.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, you are using the Old Testament to justify genocide in the modern day. In which case, I will most certainly fight you all the way.</p>

<p>Many things happened for the first time during that century, come to think of it. Large scale chemical warfare - atomic bombs being tested on civilian populations... one could go on and on.</p>

<p>Mind boggling, isn&#39;t it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Air raids weren&#39;t new to the 20th century, but the means and scale of it was, so I&#39;ll let that stand.</p>

<p>It is mind-boggling. Thank you for strengthening my point that the stakes have grown so much higher now. The danger is much more acute.</p>

<p>Precisely.  But aren&#39;t you glad that there are historians around to remind people?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just had a quick skim-read, but I can&#39;t see any historical facts from the OP in the thread that appear horribly incorrect. Please do feel free to highlight the points that you feel to be in error, and I&#39;ll evaluate them for you.</p>

<p>For the record, I have a MA in History. I studied the Holocaust, and wrote a dissertation about it. I organised Holocaust Memorial Day for many years at the university where i worked, which included lectures by Holocaust survivors. These are my credentials.</p>

<p>Incidentally, what are yours?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you accept all of those as historical fact, then you are not a Holocuast denier. Thank you. I&#39;ve run into so many of them recently that it beggars belief.  Please help me convey the fact to those in doubt that this did actually happen. &lt;3</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My criticism of your position is that you focus on what happened to who and where while ignoring the ONLY pertinent question: WHY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow! That&#39;s a massive question. It&#39;s never going to be adequately covered in a Reddit comment. It&#39;s more a subject for extensive history books.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to answer it, but could we narrow this down slightly please?  Are you looking for the socio-economic reasons, the psychology, the element of peer pressure, the ideology, the eugenic arguments, the forward-thinking &#39;making space&#39; rationale, the engineering/problem solving angle, the financial concerns or other?  And which sector of society?  </p>

<p>For example, the severely physically or mentally challenged would have been killed, so that national funds didn&#39;t go into their upkeep, and the Master Race was kept &#39;pure&#39; from the potential &#39;pollutants&#39; of genetic conditions.  </p>

<p>Women&#39;s Rights activists were shot dead because gender equality was seen as a dangerously Communist ideology, which &#39;corrupted&#39; traditional Germanic values.</p>

<p>Please be more specific and I will answer any questions on the &#39;why&#39; that you wish to learn.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>DUDE! Technology has changed! Keep up with the times!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not the means but the notion. The fact that people had meetings, sat on committees and problem-solved the actuality of industrial scale mass murder. The idea of factories of genocide has been established.</p>

<p>And as anyone who&#39;s ever read or watched &#39;V for Vendetta&#39; will tell you - ideas are bulletproof.</p>

<p>In the Holocaust, it was gas chambers.  It was much more besides, but that was the moment when the killing became industrialised. But, as you point out, we&#39;re in danger if we&#39;re looking solely for gas chambers as an indication that this is happening again.</p>

<p>Our vigilance is required to look for that idea turning into actuality again, not necessarily with the same methodology. </p>

<p>Though next time things could speed up considerably using Nazi blueprints. For example, it took several years for the likes of Hoss to perfect the cremation pits that facilitated the gas chambers running to full capacity.</p>

<p>The next regime will have that information in advance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Utterly agreed.  Those who seek to divide and turn us against certain sectors of society sow the seeds for the next Holocaust.  It&#39;s beholden upon us all to learn how to spot those media scares and terror tactics in progress. Then to nip it in the bud, before it threatens our future.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no good waiting for the camps to be built. By then, prejudice and fear could well be endemic.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t rule 10 this fellow or moderate this post even though it violates rules 1, 2, 9, 10, and 11.</p>

<p>He is very passionate about this subject and has every right to post this as a conspiracy, even though he is wrong.</p>

<p>The reason I am a mod of <a href="/r/Holocaust">/r/Holocaust</a> is because I was invited because of my history of protecting free speech here in conspiracy.  The top mods at <a href="/r/Holocaust">/r/Holocaust</a> want to make sure that questions can be asked about the Holocaust without users being banned or accused of racism simply for inquiring about something they perceive as an inconsistency.</p>

<p>The users who are mounting an attack against me, as many of you have seen here repeatedly for the last year, simply want to control the conversation from their own ideological point of view.</p>

<p>We have all seen that anti-israeli comments and posts on most main reddit will get you banned, there is clearly no lack of pro Israel sentiment on reddit.</p>

<p><a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> won&#39;t even allow users to submit a conspiracy thread because they are so afraid of something negative regarding Israel of making it to their front page.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t how this rule works, this is a rule that prohibits users from accusing other users of racism.

<p>Rule 9 is in place to stop these metareddit brigades which is basically all you have done with your life for the last 3 days.  So i&#39;m fairly confident that this post will be brigaded because of all the other brigades you have initiated in the past three days, they all TIE together.</p>

<p>Rule 10 is in place because of constant disruptive behavior that comes from people who &quot;don&#39;t like people to be allowed to talk about this stuff&quot;</p>

<p>Rule 11, it sure is sensationalist.  It may be accurate if you only are willing to look at things thru the perspective of a person who thinks any discussion about the holocaust that isn&#39;t 100% worshiping the official story, is somehow racist or antisemitic.  ITS NOT</p>

<p>There is no such thing as the official story because there is still so much debate. Please inform me, does the official story support structuralism or intentialism? Do they support Goldhagen or place the blame exclusively on the Nazi Party?

<p>If you want to talk to me honestly then we can talk.  If you can&#39;t keep the context clear when I say something like &quot;Here is one example&quot; then we don&#39;t have anything to talk about.</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not denying the Holocaust.  My claim is that certain aspects of the story have been exaggerated for political purposes.   Goeth is ONE EXAMPLE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is that subreddit called <a href="/r/holocaust">/r/holocaust</a>? It&#39;s just not an honest name. Rename it <a href="/r/holocaustrevisionism">/r/holocaustrevisionism</a> or something, because that is not a forum promoting discussion, that is a forum advocating that the holocaust has been massively overstated, and seems very anti-semite. I don&#39;t care what the actual answer is, you cannot call that a forum for free speech and then have links to only one side of the argument on the right bar, you have to show both sides of the argument, and allow people to come to their own conclusion. Otherwise it&#39;s just a holocaust orientated extension of <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a>.</p>

<p>In a two second look there, I&#39;d have to question <a href="/u/bumblingmumbling">/u/bumblingmumbling</a> as a mod. Personally, I believe mods should be there as impartial adjudicators, and to improve the subreddit in general. They shouldn&#39;t argue at all. If they don&#39;t like that, they shouldn&#39;t be mods. Why? Because giving someone the power to delete comments does not bode well for promoting discussion. </p>

<p>And, quite frankly, I&#39;d rather not talk to people like you. You&#39;re always the same. You go through a set of arguments that you got from wherever, and then when I disprove them, you don&#39;t respond and move onto the next one. You gave one example that was comprehensively wrong above to multiple people. You will keep giving that example. You won&#39;t change, but what&#39;s it to me? White supremacists seem to have the most amazing level of double standards I&#39;ve ever seen. My arguments are rigorously criticised, but if I try to apply the same thing to a white supremacist&#39;s arguments, they ignore the comments and cite something else. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to talk to you. It&#39;s nothing personal, just the depressing experience of arguing with people on the internet. We get no further than yours and my time being wasted.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not applying this rule of neutrality of point of view to reddit in general, only to white rights oriented subreddits and mods. I assume it&#39;s because you&#39;re working for the other side, not for neutrality.</p>

<p>&quot;Allowing people to come to their own conclusions&quot; isn&#39;t what the people whose agenda you&#39;re serving do. Neutrality isn&#39;t the issue here, it&#39;s zionism and jewish supremacist propaganda. When I turn on the TV anywhere in western nations, I&#39;m not flooded by white rights propaganda. I&#39;m flooded by jewish-interests-serving propaganda. Same when I go to usual subreddits, because the tribe is working fulltime to make it so. This is what you&#39;re doing here, trying to wipe out an annoying stain on your perfect nazi uniform of propaganda clampdown on reddit.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t like that holocaust doubters or deniers are running r/holocaust? Well too bad, cry me a fucking river.</p>

<p>An example which is flawed, and which has been argued against by about 5 different people, to which you have presented no further argument. So it&#39;s not an example of whatever point you&#39;re trying to make. Don&#39;t give me that shit about his lover. It&#39;s not a reliable source for determining someone&#39;s personality. Your other qualm with the story seems to be that he shoots people from his balcony? I mean what is so hard to conceptualise about <a href="http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/cc/af/b8/z12103628Q.jpg">this photo</a>?</p>

<p>I&#39;m assume your point is something to do with the exaggeration of the Holocaust by those &quot;sensationalist academics&quot;. I&#39;m quite happy with my understanding of the Holocaust. I don&#39;t believe the academic community is just a giant bunch of frauds, and I think that the figures for the Holocaust are as accurate as can be expected. I&#39;m not going to go trawl through <a href="/r/holocaust">/r/holocaust</a>, because its not a forum for discussion, as I have clearly outlined above. If changes were made, and there was vibrant discussion there, then I&#39;d have a reason to read the subreddit. Instead it&#39;s just <a href="/u/bumblingmumbling">/u/bumblingmumbling</a> muttering about how many survivors there are and no other comments.</p>

<p>You complain about how I associate you with <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a> and then act exactly like how I just described people from that subreddit acting. If you need me to explain why that is, you obviously haven&#39;t read anything I&#39;ve said. What do you want? A separate category? Why bother when you fit so well into the first one?</p>

<p>Questioning academic consensus with no good reason or evidence suggests an additional agenda.  When it comes to the Holocaust it&#39;s easy to see it&#39;s racial hatred.  You yourself are guilty of claiming that the Holocaust has been exaggerated for political purposes.  You are thus accusing huge amounts of Jews affected by the Holocaust for being complicit in a conspiracy.  This is racial hatred.  Ever heard of Blood Libel? Accusing Jews of the Black Death? Protocols of Zion?  All examples of claims of Jewish conspiracy theories used to justify violence against Jews, and none without any intellectual basis just like Holocaust Denial.</p>

<p>What happens in other subreddits is immaterial. For the purpose of this topic, all that matters is what you do with the moderator powers you have. You should be measuring your actions against what is right or wrong, not what happens in the rest of the site. </p>

<p>So, you&#39;re saying that if I posted something in <a href="/r/holocaust">/r/holocaust</a> discussing and even refuting common questions regarding the Holocaust, completely seriously, it would remain unmolested by mods on the subreddit? </p>

<p>I used to read xkcd years ago, and while I stopped reading it several years ago, I was also subscribed to the subreddit until this account, due to my loss of interest in Munroe&#39;s work. That should give you a good idea of where I stand in all this, so take the following as the pedantic querying that it is. You say other mods were involved in censoring the subreddit, but I have never seen so many deleted comments on a thread in that subreddit until you arrived. Whether or not you were involved, it coincided with your arrival. It implies that: you were responsible for hitting the button(which you have already denied, so I rule this as unlikely, unless you&#39;re a lying sonuvabitch) or that your presence incites and alienates the community to the point that posts (apparently) are necessary to delete. Considering this is the selfsame community you were brought in to <em>help</em>, following this reaction by users, it seems that the best course of action to help the community would be to leave, no? </p>

<p>I am apart of no brigade. I have been a subscriber to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for a number of years, on this account and others. Please do not lump all who question your actions in with brigading. While it may be easy to do, it is not true. </p>

<p>That&#39;s odd because every time someone does post in one of those subs (questioning the Holocaust) it gets brigaded by you <a href="/r/stalkerwatch">/r/stalkerwatch</a> and <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/badhistory">/r/badhistory</a>...</p>

<p>So sorry! <a href="/r/Holocaust">/r/Holocaust</a> will forever be what we make it.  You can&#39;t do anything about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely staggering to imagine how your brain functions, Flytape. The sheer amount of doublethink that&#39;s expressed in every single one of your posts is so mind-bendingly huge that the idea that a human mind can remain cognizant under that much stress is a testament to the resiliency of human physiology. </p>

<p>The reason you&#39;re a mod at <a href="/r/holocaust">/r/holocaust</a> is because you were invited in order to bring the illusion of &quot;activity&quot; to the sub. Your history of &quot;protecting free speech&quot; is a lie so blatant as to be laughable - you, the mod who&#39;s deleted dozens of posts critical of your policies or contrary to your views; you, the mod who, if you can&#39;t ban your opponent from conversation, brush them off as a shill of some larger conspiracy against you.</p>

<p>Give me a break, and give whatever part of your brain that manages cognitive dissonance a break, too.</p>

<p>Please actually explain where I said that.  Saying that censoring Holocaust deniers is not as bad as censoring mainsteam Holocaust discussion doesn&#39;t make me OK with censorship.  In fact it clearly indicates I have problems with censorship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The future. That&#39;s what we&#39;re defending. </p>

<p>Something changed towards the middle of the 20th century. Wholesale slaughter on an industrial scale. There was nothing new about concentration camps - the Romans had them in Britain - nor was there anything particularly innovative about the notion of committing genocide.</p>

<p>But nothing before had ever happened like this. The Holocaust (and all the related genocides of the period) was something entirely new. Buildings built for the sole purpose of the mass murder of thousands in a single day. Experiments in disposing of the bodies resulting in perfecting the means of open air pits, infernos which raged day and night.</p>

<p>This is in the world now. This knowledge is there. It&#39;s not a matter of could it happen again, it will. That is the nature of history, and the optimum time for that is when people have forgotten.</p>

<p>Quibble about the details if you will. No academic is taking you seriously anyway. But remember this, and remember it hard - there were gas chambers and cremetoria constructed with genocide in mind. Industrial scale murder with the aim of obliterating whole sectors of society. An estimated 17 million individuals died.  </p>

<p>That is the memory that we&#39;re defending. That is the future we are seeking to avoid.</p>
