       It's not that it's fake snow, and doesn't melt; it's the speculation that it is a chemically created snow, or a chemically induced snow.

       No, tell me in words HOW they make the 'fake' snow.  What chemicals they spray, and the process that happens to get this snow that we see in the videos.

       The fake snow not melting has already been debunked, however I would like to hear what you have to say.

       Who tries to burn snow with a lighter? As a lifelong Northeasterner this has to be one of the strangest things I've seen trend lately. Snow isn't just water, there's a bunch of crap in it from the atmosphere/pollution before it even gets disgustingly dirty from being sloshed around.

       I guess those who read that when you try to melt it with a lighter it doesn't melt, and don't believe it, so they try it for themselves, as I did.

       It is the weirdest, most unnatural type of snow I've ever seen. It's also a subject that is being trolled extremely hard. Every post on this subject has 0 upvotes?  Never have I seen such a campaign of disinfo,

       Right, I think what people are trying to point out is that this snow has something foreign in its chemical make up. That foreign substance may be just a natural collection of extremely fine pollutant, but it could be a synthetic chemical as a result of chemtrailing. What is needed is a control. Someone from the North that has access to snow needs to go get some, use a clean burning lighter (I'm looking at you cigar aficionados) and then someone from the Atlanta area do the same. If the Atlanta snow burns dirtier, then there could be a case for something additional to be in the snow. Sorry, I'm just tired of the "look at my snow" "no, look at my snow" etc.  If the motive is to prove that something "else" is going on with the snow in the south, then we have to have something to compare it to.

       Ok, well, something is up w this southern snow, because my New England snow just melted w no residue from a Bic lighter. No black smokiness, no residue, just melted. The snow afterwards smelled like butane, but definitely not like plastic. I'm letting it melt at room temperature to see what's left in the water, but again, I repeat, there was no charring.

       That's probably the most 'clean' way to do it. Now we just need someone from the south to do the same thing.

       If that's the case, you should make a post of a video of "normal" snow. Seems like a great chance to show some solid evidence that there is a little something 'off' about the snow in the south.

       Because of Android vs Chrome OS issues, I can't upload to YouTube (without getting on my desktop and that's a whole update issue in itself!). What other sites w an Android app can I upload to? Its too large to even email it to myself and Bluetooth and USB were a no-go. Go fucking figure, Google has bugs that made this a two hour long "all these features and I'mma chuck this shit against the wall" event last night.
