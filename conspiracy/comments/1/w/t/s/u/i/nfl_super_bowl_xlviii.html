       Right now, Fox is airing a segment on 9/11.  The usual stuff is happening:
       <br/>
       * Rallying America around 9/11
       <br/>
       * make mention of terrorism
       <br/>
       * Military 'leaders' are called in to discuss the event
       <br/>
       * Its all very...patriotic.
       <br/>
       * Building the Superb Owl up as not just a sporting event, but a symbol of American Freedoms
      </p>
      <p>
       Followed immediately by "Three Days to Kill" trailer, in which the main character is all about fighting terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slogans of Ads being repeated and played one right after the next:
       <br/>
       "Whatever happens next"
       <br/>
       "The next big thing is here"
       <br/>
       "After the Super Bowl, let's go crazy"
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  I will keep using this post to add what I see.  I'm making no claims nor offering opinions on the content.  I'm simply writing what I see.

      <ul>
       <li>
        Segment on Lombardi and how his success was directly related to his Faith and a sense of nationalism.  Extolling the virtues of New York and its citizens.  After talking about his strength of character, it returns to claim it was because of his faith, and participation in the army.  The whole segment was narrated by a priest in full garb.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        "Fox is live and the center of the universe"

        Obama Interview
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Obama interview starts with Healthcare, focusing on problems with the computers.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Obama dodges questions about problems with computers and extolls virtues of healthcare.  Bill cutting off Obama's responses, trying to back him into a corner.  Being pretty disrespectful.
       </li>
       <li>
        Shift to Libya.  Talking about terrorist attacks and how Obama knew of these.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        This is almost impossible to follow along.  Tons of mentions of terrorist attacks and protecting the American people.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Shift to IRS and Schulman(sp?).
       </li>
       <li>
        Obama says no corruption in IRS.
       </li>
       <li>
        Obama predicts score of "24-21"

        "Broncos and Seahawks get ready for battle"

       <li>
        Segment on Pete Carroll
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Segment on John Fox, centric around his hospitalization
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Not much happening at this point.  One could point to each commercial and discuss their conditioning methods, as each commercial is employing mnemonic devices.  Focus is shifting to exploration of the teams, coach and player interviews, and the build up for kick off.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Segments on Russel Wilson, Payton Manning

       <li>
        Reading of Declaration of Independence.  Segment extolling patriotism and military prior to the reading.  "We must all hang together, or assuredly, we will hang separately."  Lots of military and American propaganda.  Varying players, owners, coaches, commentators reading the Declaration of Independence.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Blatant appeal to American nationalism.  Michelle Obama extolling military troops.

        Weird spot with a gear rotating and people screaming in the background.  No text or voice over.  This is the second weird, out of place spot that didn't make sense.  The first being a British Flag with a bullet hole appearing in it.
        <br/>

        Final Edit
       </strong>
       :  Well there you have it folks.  The purpose of my post was to document media proceedings in the case that anything should happen.  While no terrorist attack occurred, this game was fraught with ultra patriotism and propaganda and left me feeling very odd about nationalist sentiment.  Take care everyone!

       the saudis want a US intervention in syria, because the syrian rebels are heavily funded by the saudis. the syrian civil war is a proxy war, and the saudis want the US to intervene because if it doesnt, the assad regime will stay in power.

       I don't exactly know, but what we all know is that the USA seems to be runing a smear campaign against the Olympics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples - Gay rights, stray dogs, Volgograd bombing, unfinished sidewalks, (see the rest of reddit for more) etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows why?  It could be for a number of reasons, but I suspect there is something above and beyond the anti-Putin sentiment - something which is not yet publicly known.  The world could use some NSA staff who are reading this post right right now to actually do something useful and go sift through emails of Saudi, Russian and American officials, and make public any emails between them, pertaining to the Olympics.

       I have tempered expectations. Admittedly, I bought into the whole "2012 London Olympics Occult Ritual" shit and followed the symbolism very closely, down to the "London Burning" commercials they were airing to support it. Just turned out to be much ado about nothing.

       Maybe, but then again it could just be the whole fear narrative that MSM constantly pushes, but on a subconsious/subliminal level... always making you feel like you have something to fear. Maybe they're just putting dots out there that they know subconsciously you will connect.

       I'm more than convinced that's what pop stars do today with the illuminati shit. They reference it just to be able to get both crowds, the people who think it's all occult symbolism will watch and say all they want about it, the fans of the artists will still listen, they double dip on the revenue.

        I have tempered expectations. Admittedly, I bought into the whole "2012 London Olympics Occult Ritual" shit and followed the symbolism very closely, down to the "London Burning" commercials they were airing to support it. Just turned out to be much ado about nothing.

       Yeah, I've only been watching for about 15 minutes (logged in online to stream it during the timeout to check if that Bronco's player's knee was down on the fumble/strip, which it was) and have already noticed the crazy over-emphasis of faux-patriotism; specifically, that Coke ad with everyone singing "America the Beautiful" in different languages was especially gag-inducing and/or cringe-worthy.

       The rich have been preparing for when the lower classes try to take what's theirs. It kinda just reminded me of the Capitol from The Hunger Games. And it doesn't help that Phillip Seymour Hoffman was found dead and that they announced that he was found with a needle in his arm.

       No, Last year it wasn't like this at all. There were some rumblings about Detroit and such, but not all the American flags, soldiers, and "Prepare" warnings. When it was in Indianapolis (close to where I live) there was nothing of the sort. No snipers, no armored cars, just lots of fun and frivolity. People on my facebook are saying they are happy to see the patriotism, but it down right scares me. Really.

       Sexually graphic yogurt commercial, "fuel your pleasure" people! Buy everything that makes you feel good and gets you hot chicks to lick questionable liquids off your pants.

       Hidden Cameras reveal people are having fun and drinking, getting married, winning stuff, unaware they are being filmed.

       Bud Light- "Stay in the game, drink responsibly"- AKA don't focus on the subliminal messages everywhere else.

       ***That Maserati commercial was uncanny. There's so much to interpret- if this is truly a message from the elite, I see it saying, "You, the masses, are capable of destruction. You do have more power than you are aware of, but as you slowly grow in size your intelligence dwindles. As we continue to feed you garbage that makes you sloth-like in mind and body, we will wait and strike." "We have prepared, now we strike." This is a tribute to those who are "exactly the opposite of ordinary"

       "The Strain" is a vampire novel that was published probably 3 years ago, now being made into a TV series. Written by the director, in a CRAZY coincidence.

       "Didn't catch the audio, but I just saw a British Flag on screen, followed by a bullet hole appearing in it"
      </p>
      <p>
       I tuned in to the fox live stream just in time to catch this weird bit of data stream. I've been wondering about it the last couple of hours and this is the only reference to it that I have come across so far. I'm not saying it's anything but if anybody knows what it is I would be very interested in knowing its purpose.

       Only audio I remember was a bullet shot when the hole appeared and then the music started getting a little tense. It cut immediately after that point.

       I just logged into the Fox Online thing they're doing for free today to let everyone stream the game, and I caught it as well. Late in the 2nd quarter, with audio I believe (a gunshot), and it was pretty weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably nothing though, just some company trying to be "cutting-edge" and do something out of the ordinary with the intention of it going viral if I had to guess since it's apparently been on twice now...

       Has anyone here actually watched the Super Bowl before? It is always larger than life. It always is very patriotic, this year perhaps more than normal as it's the first in New York in decades. The commercials are always over the top, and often cryptic to take advantage of the huge audience and social media activity. And the productions and announcers always pull out all the stops...which can lead to awkward moments and comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Super Bowl is bizarre for a variety of reasons (like all entertainment), but some sort of blood ritual or false flag conditioning it is not. Also, no one is uncovering anything surprising here with the patriotism angle -- this has been standard practice in American sports for years.
      </p>

       Enjoy the game, folks.

       My point wasn't that it's not weird or annoying because it is "tradition", but rather it was not out of the ordinary, and doesn't signify anything new or unusual. It's standard practice, particularly at big games. And no one here saying "OMG PATRIOTISM" is pointing out anything new. They would have known that if they regularly watch sports. Every regular fan is aware of the relationship. Folks in this sub who watch one Super Bowl are not suddenly uncovering some grand propaganda conspiracy.

       I seriously disagree, I'm done with any professional sports, either watching on TV or live events. I love sports and I'll still support local semi-pro or below teams, but as far as the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, I am utterly done. I don't like the amount of ads, the idolization of players, the supreme competitiveness. I'm not wearing the clothing or icons anymore. I'm discharging myself from the army of fans.

       But when a simple sports game captivates people more than the complex socio/economic problems of our world that we live in today... and our children will live in... that is where I see wrong.

      <p>
       There were a lot of moments during the super bowl that gave me an impression of pre-WW2 fascist germany/italy.

       Propaganda will become more prominent, and people will be alright with it. It moves so slowly that nobody will notice until it's too late. Only those who actually can see through the bullshit understand why certain inconsistencies occur in our media today.

       I don't watch TV. It's pointless. It's a fucking screen that talks to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can get all the news you need from the internet, minus the horse shit commercials, the right/left-wing biased nonsense, and having 30 minutes force fed into your cranium.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why do we watch TV? To entertain ourselves? What about books? what about chess? What about going outside and talking with other people? What happened to all of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this idiocy regarding the super bowl hits me harder because I didn't watch it. I can't believe some of my friends can sit through that shit.

       Hey man...I finally see you on this sub.  Nice to see someone from another sub I frequent.  If you really are "conspiracy"-minded you'd probably get a kick out of some of my other stories I've written in that series.

       I assume your talking NASCAR: From the far side? I didn't see any other ones but I found it very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I don't see people awakening, I see people are probably more dumb than ever. The thing with the Maserati commercial most people commented on was the fact that it was seemingly out of place for a super bowl ad, more along the lines of how many people watching are going to buy Maserati's? I didn't see too many people think that the commercial's context was weird unfortunately.

       Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  I wrote one about the Ukrainian protests and one about Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm seeing is a "now or never" moment.  As in, we're coming to a crossroads where people will have to make a choice about what's going on around us, regardless of how awake they are.  I guess when I see people talking about that commercial at all, for whatever reason, it's like a very small victory, like "Hey! People are asking questions at least..."  I'm probably overly optimistic, but it's how I stay sane lately.

       I agree, a lot of people agree, but the problem is they are still stuck inside the paradigm of left vs. right. Ethics vs. Government Regulation, Free Market vs Crony Capitalism. But in reality its more than that. Its a flaw of human character that is the root of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do find people that are like a lot of people in this sub out in the wild, but its a rarity, and even then they aren't fully vested in the movement. I too have optimism, but i'm afraid at the same time what a real revolution would bring. Its hard to stay sane sometimes, it really is.

       I didn't see the commercial live, but I had a chance to check it out a few minutes ago and I think that you might be looking into it a bit too much. Maserati released the Ghibli III as a new addition to their line of executive sedans just recently in 2013. I think this is what they mean by "We have prepared..." 
I assume that the lines that the boy voices over ("let them get huge, we'll stay small") could just reference that the car has a smaller engine than a comparable sports car such as Ferrari, who is known for their huge V12 engines, or even Lamborghini, who also favors a huge V10 engine. It's not impending doom, just a pretty turbocharged V6 pushing 410 hp!

       This shouldn't be downvoted. It allows an active discussion of actual events that will be happening today. Documenting and publicizing every single instance of programming and control through the media can help everyone become more aware of it. I won't be watching at all, but I'll keep checking back to see what nonsense I'm glad to be missing.

       My own sentence is giving me a headache. This was a commercial for a t.v. show and apparently they were saying satan is here by using the triquetra symbolically. Lol...very interesting it shows satan as misspelled if not capitalized...&gt;_&gt;

       I don't think anyone has that answer. I just see that they are going by prophecy to keep the religious world in fear that the end times are near. The four blood moons to be completed is just one of many that supposedly need to be completed before the culmination of everything. I just think this may be preparing us for events to start happening sooner rather than later. Who knows really. Only time will tell.

       Yes, that was too much. And as a sidebar, I posted something on Facebook about the overabundance of patriotism, and I got a private message from someone I don't even know telling me that there isn't any such thing as too much patriotism and that I should move to North Korea. Unfortunately I live in a state that has so many rednecks and a former friend of a friend's boyfriend is a big one.

       The British flag being shot up was a preview for the show '24' which is about terrorists. The first, I think like 7-8 seasons took place in the US now I guess it's in the UK area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I hadn't noticed it but a friend said there was hints about the show throughout the game. Like the clock ticking.

       To everyone saying the masserati spot was leading to something big about  the 1 per-centers crushing the souls of the us normal people, i think you should re-watch. yes its an awkward spot because you dont think the average superbowl viewer would be in its target demo, but the actual copy just tells the story of how the brand as been slowly doing its own thing waiting for the other high end brands to get complacent and predictable and then allow masserati to strike to gain more market share...my take on it at least after quick re watchings and some basic research

       Here's an article about them wanting to go more mainstream and increase sales

       Correct, there was a post earlier today about it with Tim Russet and interviews with Bush and Kerry.  Wasn't it just Bronco's ball, 4th, and they didn't kick?  What just happen to turnover the ball?

       I'm not watching a second of it. Not any YouTube analysis, no blogs, no nothing. Same for the Olympics.

       Watch what you're inputting into your brains, folks. The subliminal imagery and messages have layers. You might be setting your own psyche up.

       Hey so I'm a Bronco fan and it just got too agonizing to finish and there were a set of clips, not really commercials, that depicted the British flag first on only had it being shot once, second one I saw multiple times with some creepy ass ominous music playing in the background ... can anyone tell me what those were all about? I assume that it led up to something but because I didn't finish the game I didn't see it so just wondering where someone was going with that. Thanks.

       Did anyone catch the, "we're hermetically sealed in here" by the announcers before heading in to the last commercial? They were discussing weather, but still, weird words to have at the tip of the tongue or at the top of the mind.

       Great catch!  I remember the statement but didn't think anything of it.  Makes sense considering the prevailing conspiracy is a chemical attack at the SuperBowl.

       Thanks! I usually don't watch the SuperBowl but found it kind of… strange. It was so militaristic, even for America. I usually don't write that aggressively but it really pissed me off.

       Right before commercial, I heard this without knowing the context.  All I know is that is 22 / zip and the Bronco's are getting their butt kicked.  Maybe we'll see a field goal for a nice odd 3-22 reference

       No, Last year it wasn't like this at all. There were some rumblings about Detroit and such, but not all the American flags, soldiers, and "Prepare" warnings. When it was in Indianapolis (close to where I live) there was nothing of the sort. No snipers, no armored cars, just lots of fun and frivolity. People on my facebook are saying they are happy to see the patriotism, but it down right scares me. Really.
