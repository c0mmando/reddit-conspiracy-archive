        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday I wrote a comment about how the &quot;mainstream&quot; understanding of gravity is definitely <em>not</em> the only theory out there. </p>

<p>Naturally, I was scoffed at and asked to explain myself. I spent a good deal of time putting the following together, and although I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised, no one bothered to respond.</p>

<p>Because I think this information is extremely fascinating, I&#39;m sure some of you might agree, so I&#39;ve turned my comment into a self-post:</p>

<p>This is my summary of the work of <em>other</em> people, not my own beliefs. I happen to find these particular individuals extremely compelling and honest in intention.</p>

<p>First, I <em>highly</em> recommend the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Antigravity-Propulsion-Classified-Technology/dp/159143078X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391281887&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=paul+a+laviolette">Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion: Tesla, UFOs, and Classified Aerospace Technology by Paul A. LaViolette</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Covert-Wars-Clash-Civilizations-Oligarchs/dp/1939149045/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391281920&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=breakaway+civilization+joseph+p+farrell">Covert Wars and the Clash of Civilizations: UFOS, Oligarchs and Space Secrecy by Joseph P. Farrell</a></p>

<p>The latter is more speculative, and the first two are very technical, and extremely informative, about this entirely new approach to gravity.</p>

<p>This new approach can be (over) simplified in the following statement: Gravity is a <em>push</em> not a <em>pull</em>.</p>

<p>One of the first of the great 20th century scientists to figure this out was the enigmatic Thomas Townsend Brown, who in 1923 realized the following (and I quote from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Covert-Wars-Clash-Civilizations-Oligarchs/dp/1939149045/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391281920&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=breakaway+civilization+joseph+p+farrell">Covert Wars</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Brown] began to cultivate the thesis that a radiation (other than light) prevailed in the Universe, independent of our Solar system. [He] felt that this radiation could be gravitation...that it exerted a pressure (however small) on all forms of matter. This gave rise to what could be considered as a new theory of gravitation.</p>

<p><em>Such a theory called for gravitation being a push and not a pull.</em> This seemed logical in that Nature abhors a vacuum. A mechanism for the transmission of gravitation theoretically was needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brown firmly believed in the interconnectedness and coupling effect between gravity and electromagnetism, and he spent his entire life experimenting in these fields, much of it <em>deep</em> in black ops because of the significance of his findings.</p>

<p>After holding some demonstrations, a story ran in 1924 in the Los Angeles Evening Express called &quot;Claims Gravity is a Push, not a Pull.&quot; It read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In plain words, his theory is this: That ether waves some outside space push from all directions against the earth, and against other objects and planets in space, forcing objects the way the wave extends instead of drawing them, according to the old Newton theory of gravitation.</p>

<p>By means of his equipment he conducts experiments with the X-ray, which is of the same family as light and the ether wave, and by means of which it is possible to test the theory. By means of this machine, he says, that since the X-ray is deflected, the gravity wave, being of the same family, also can be deflected.</p>

<p>If this theory is proved so thoroughly that it displaces the Newton theory, inventions of the future will revolutionize human industry. Be deflecting ether waves that are pushing against objects, man can control weight to such an extent that his deflecting machinery would enable him to lift a battleship out of the sea and set it on dry land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why stop with battleships?</p>

<p>By 1927, Brown had applied for his first patent for his &quot;gravitators&quot; or &quot;gravitors,&quot; simple dielectric devices charged with high voltage that would then lift, and the return to their ground state in step-wise quantized fashion.</p>

<p>In 1928, Einstein was writing yet another unified field theory paper coupling gravitation and electromagnetism, and <em>that same year</em> Brown had received a British patent for a technology that demonstrated, and therefore, <em>locally-engineered</em> this coupling!</p>

<p>Quoting writers <a href="/r/josephpfarrell">Joseph P. Farrell</a> and Paul Schatzkin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, lest the reader object that this effect was simply &quot;ionic wind&quot; (this explanation was precisely used to discredit Brown), it is worth looking at the actual wording and claims of the patent:</p>

<p>The invention consists  simply of surrounding or impregnating mass of any non-conducting material with an electro-static condition. This is accomplished by applying high-voltage but low-amperage current to opposite ends of material that does not transmit electric force (dielectric or insulator).</p>

<p>In other words Brown has sandwiched a layer of a material that <em>does not conduct</em> electricity between two layers of a material that <em>does conduct</em> electricity. </p>

<p>The material that does not conduct electricity is called a &quot;dielectric&quot; or &quot;insulator&quot; and the material that does conduct electricity is called an electrode. </p>

<p>Because the dielectric layer interrupts the flow of electrical energy in the apparatus, the circuit is not completed, and this is one reason why Brown and scientists called in by him to test his results (back in 1929) unite in saying the electrical energy present is not the cause of the force liberated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When voltage was applied, the pendulum moved upward toward the positive pole, and then returned to its ground state in <em>stepwise quantized releases</em> of energy.</p>

<p>Why was Brown convinced there was an electro-gravitic coupling being demonstrated?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because while conducting experiments with it, Brown noticed <em>varying results depending upon planetary and stellar positioning relative to the galactic center.</em></p>

<p>When the Sun and Moon were aligned in the direction of the positive thrust of his gravitator, the displacement of the apparatus was greatest. In other words, the apparatus responded to conditions of local celestial space, and indeed was uniquely sensitive to them.</p>

<p>This is turn affected the quantized release of energy as the gravitator returned to its ground state. The quickest and greatest discharges of force and the quickest return to the ground state occurred, Brown noticed, when the Sun and Moon were on opposite horizons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brown began to call the concept &quot;gravitational atoms&quot;. With it, Brown is suggesting that space-time is <em>not</em> a continuum, but like the implications of quantum mechanics, is a quantized phenomenon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1920&#39;s, Brown developed a device that, with the application of a minimal amount of electrical energy, appeared to release another form of energy that propelled the device.</p>

<p>In part because the movement of the device appeared to be influenced by the movement of the sun, moon, and other planet, he believed that the internal force was gravitational in nature, and was embodied within and released by the materials of the devices themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IOW, Brown was saying <em>that space itself was a dielectric, and the material universe was an asymetrical dipole in a state of non-equilibrium</em>. His gravitators were not just idle curiosity and not &quot;ion wind&quot;...they were the &quot;only way to go&quot; if mankind ever hoped to venture to the stars.</p>

<p>Astronomer Tom Van Flandern has taken it further with his concept of &quot;C-gravitons&quot; which are thoroughly explained in the book I linked earlier. </p>

<p>Flandern is essentially saying that space is filled with both a light carrying medium (LCM) as well as an incredibly small and fast universal gravity medium (C-gravitons). These gravitons push celestial bodies together by bombarding them, rather than being drawn together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity acts by means of some sort of agents making contact with matter, despite the fact that no such agents are yet known to physicists. Conceptually, the only way that &quot;agents&quot; have to act on bodies is by means of collisions.</p>

<p>A sea of rapidly moving agents everywhere outside a body would tend to push down on the surface of the body, giving rise to an apparent force of attraction toward the center of the body.</p>

<p>Moreover, two bodies would shadow each other from some of the agents, giving rise to an apparent force of attraction between the bodies, since fewer agents would be available to &quot;push&quot; from the shadowed side than from the opposite side of the body. </p>

<p>Consider a spherical body of ponderable mass. Although the hypothetical agents are flying through it all the time, some of them are always colliding with the atomic particles making up the body, producing push-like forces.</p>

<p>When a collision occurs, the agent rebounds and therefore is not available to collide with other atomic particles deeper in the spherical body. This means that more agents strike every atom from above than from below, because of the shielding effect of the nearby matter.</p>

<p>The resultant of all such collisions must therefore be that every particle of the spherical body is &quot;pushed&quot; in the net direction toward the center of the mass, where the most shielding from push-collisions occurs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t recommend van Flandern&#39;s book (and LaViolette&#39;s) enough if you want to understand why there&#39;s an <em>entirety</em> different perspective on gravity out there, and it has almost completely been swallowed up by the world of black ops and the Breakaway Civilization.</p>

<p>TLDR: Gravity is a <em>push</em> not a <em>pull</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you being pushed down by gravity, toward the earth - i.e. as an emergent force from the vaccuum which surrounds you (and the earth) in space? Or pulled toward it due to your huge ass?</p>

<p>If space is a vaccuum; it has a predilection toward emptiness, and thu could theoretically PUSH bodies of mass away/out of it self.</p>

<p>What if the vaccuum of space is what is, from all equal directions pushing/compressing matter; matter just happens to tend to also coaleasce and thus winds up in sphere&#39;s as it is rejected from the vaccuum of the universe.</p>

<p>Gravity is this pushing force -- not pulling you into bodies, like a planet...  but pushing you AWAY from emptiness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, GR makes FAR more claims than that. For example, it predicts gravitational lensing, a result of gravity&#39;s effect on the stress-energy tensor. What in this half-assed collection of vaguely philosophical statements purported to be a theory predicts that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the theory necessarily has to clash with the current model.  To give you an example:  While studying the sun, scientists couldn&#39;t figure out how fusion was occurring, even with quantum tunneling it seemed like protons could never overcome the coulomb force and combine to form heavier elements, yet it was happening.  The solution to this was to create another force that just so happened to describe the phenomena they were observing and the equations were made to fit the observations.  This became the strong force.  The problem is, we can&#39;t really say if this force is something completely separate from electromagnetism or if it is actually just an aspect of how electromagnetism functions on quantum scales.</p>

<p>Another example is the Planck Length.  It is for all intents and purposes the smallest unit of measurement possible in the universe, and we&#39;ve based a lot physics (Planck units) around this constant which has allowed us to simplify the equations.  But the truth is this is a human-imposed limit and if the theories of Dirac and Milne hold any validity, than these &quot;constants&quot; may actually be variable and our framework may end up being limiting.</p>

<p>Finally there are the good old &quot;dark&quot; forces.  I find it <strong>very</strong> interesting that they came to be when we were attempting to map out rotation around a Galactic centre, accepted knowledge and intuition told us that stars closer to the origin of the Galactic arm would spin faster around the centre, but this is not the case.  Entire Galactic arms seem to rotate on-pace with eachother and the existence of dark forces was needed to reconcile the anomaly.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just trying to say that current models &quot;work&quot; because we have constructed them that way, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there aren&#39;t other ways to describe observed phenomena.</p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t just about Walter Wright.</p>

<p>And &quot;our models and equations&quot; are but one of many &quot;models and equations&quot;. There is no absolute truth to the standard model and to assert so is plain unscientific.</p>

<p>Anyway, you seem to keep missing the point and I&#39;m getting tired of this conversation. Even with the conspiracy crowd, nothing seems to push buttons more than questioning conventional scientific belief. It&#39;s amazing how quickly your open minds turn right back into those of the people you seem to despise most when you all go on and on about government corruption. As if modern academia doesn&#39;t suffer from the same exact problems that any other authoritarian hierarchy does.</p>

<p>Look, new ideas are great and are necessary. However in this case his idea is the complete opposite to how we see gravity working. We have our standard model which supports our current hypothesis. We have equations which prove it works. There&#39;s nothing to suggest we have it completely backwards.</p>

<p>Problem number 1. The whole point here is that the ideas being taught in mainstream physics are incorrect, so of course you&#39;re going to say &quot;what?&quot;. This is one of those forget-everything-you-know-and-start-over-from-square-one type of things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>two objects in a vacuum will pull towards each other</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume you&#39;re talking about the Casimir experiment here. The idea here is that vacuums are not really vacuums and that there is still a force present that is <em>pushing</em> the objects together (so called &quot;zero point energy&quot;, &quot;vacuum energy&quot; or &quot;quantum fluctuations&quot;). Space cannot be empty, think about it. If there is nothing in space, then how does space have volume? Two things cannot be separated by <em>no thing</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, there is a lot more evidence supporting the idea that electricity or magnetism are the primary force of the universe than you&#39;d imagine, with a lot of compelling physical evidence and <em>actual reproducible experiments</em>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsda1U3Vdfk">This video series</a> provides a lot of explanation of how the universe is better modeled with gravity as a push.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t specifically referencing the Casimir effect.  I mean by basic experimentation, one can observe gravitational attraction.</p>

<p>furthermore, the use of such dramatic terms as &#39;primary force of the universe&#39; is laughable.  on the scale of forces, the electromagnetic is nothing compared to the weak force, which in itself is tiny compared to the strong force.  gravity itself is way way smaller than the electromagnetic, so if anything the &#39;primary force&#39; would be the strong force.  you can thank that one for why you&#39;re not exploding into subatomic bits.</p>

<p>Going to have to disagree, as you are still talking in terms of strong forces, weak forces, etc. These are things that all need to be cast away if you wish to examine the universe as a magnetic one. It&#39;s literally starting from an entire different premise. It&#39;s a bold statement, I know, it&#39;s not lost on me how ridiculous it can sound, but if you actually bother to do the research you can see how magnetism creates the entire framework for the effects we describe as the &quot;strong force&quot;, &quot;gravity&quot; and even quantization and the self-organizing patterns we observe in nature.</p>

<p>You say the strong force is the reason we don&#39;t explode into bits, but I assert that we&#39;re not exploding into bits because we&#39;re being <em>compressed</em> together from an outside force, as magnets would do. Everything <em>pushing</em> against everything else. It&#39;s a different perspective.</p>

<p>you literally dont understand. mainstream physics states that all forces except gravity are a result of electromagnetism.</p>

<p>and relativity posits that gravity is a push, not a pull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m talking about explains why magnetism is responsible for the curvature of space.</p>

<p>More importantly, I&#39;m concerned with cause and not effect. Magnetic poles are points of absolute stillness. They are the fulcrums upon which wave motion is able to exist. Magnetism is the omnipresent still &quot;vacuum&quot; from which all wave motion (and hence everything physical) is created and to which everything returns after going through its complete wave cycle.</p>

<p>For instance, take a look at this periodic table that emphases the <em>periodic</em> nature of the elements and how they&#39;re born from wave motion. A particular thing to note that is that inert gasses are at the null-points of the waves. They are the points of stillness from which the other elements are born.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/80TYdKE.gif">http://i.imgur.com/80TYdKE.gif</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that these are from 1926 and actually predicted the existence of some then-undiscovered elements and isotopes.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s really too much to explain here, but I&#39;m not just &quot;blinded by semantics,&quot; I&#39;m talking about a different theory of the universe entirely, one of two-way balanced, rhythmic, interchanging vortex motion. </p>

<p>statements like this are what i have a problem with. even assuming that the theory you are supporting is correct, the language you use indicates that you dont understand it.</p>

<p>&quot;the points of stillness from which the other elements are born&quot; is fucking nonsensical. the theory you&#39;re talking about is interesting, and both the images you linked to are interesting, but the elements are not &quot;born from each other&quot; in any way, shape or form.</p>

<p>elements are born from the mathematical rules that determine which configurations of subatomic particles are stable.</p>

<p>the periodicity of the elements is a result of the octet rule which creates a recurring &quot;cycle&quot; of reactivity and other traits.</p>

<p><strong>the underlying theory you are describing is valid, but the language you&#39;re using to describe it isnt valid at all.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m talking about a different theory of the universe entirely, one of two-way balanced, rhythmic, interchanging vortex motion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>nothing about that sentence makes any sense. if you said that in a room full of scientists, you would be laughed out of the room.</p>

<p>your words may sound profound to you, but none of the meaning you attribute to them is not making it across the language barrier.</p>

<p>i&#39;m a second year university student studying chemistry, and most of what you say sounds like fucking jibberish.</p>

<p>again, i&#39;d like to clarify that <strong>i dont think the theory is bullshit</strong>, i just think that you lack the words to properly communicate what you are thinking.</p>

<p>its almost like we&#39;re speaking different languages.</p>

<p>the language you use indicates that you dont understand it.</p>

<p>I disagree. I use the language that I do because I have a <em>greater</em> understanding of it. ;)</p>

<p>My approach to the universe is a holistic one, a fractal one, a true <em>unified</em> theory. <em>Everything</em> lives and dies, compresses and then expands. It is the lifecycle of the wave. All bodies in all the universe are the same in all respects, whether they are electrons, cells, rocks, metals, trees, men, planets or suns. All of them live and die in the same manner. All breathe in the charging breath of life and breathe out the discharging breath of death. All of them compress heat and polarize when they breathe in, and expand, cool and depolarize when they breathe out.</p>

<p>Think about this...</p>

<p>The one amazing thing about all matter, which is not known today, is that all matter wants to explode, it wants to die. To live, is an effort. To die is effortless. Matter is not held together from within by the attraction of gravity, as generally supposed, it is compressed together by a force exerted from the outside toward its center. Life is hard to maintain, for that reason, and for the same reason it is easy to die because it wants to die. It is against all modern scientific belief, because the general belief is that a material nucleus holds the atom together. Nature does not work that way. Atoms do not have nuclei. Nature creates her atoms the same may that you would compress air into a tire. It is hard work. You pump it in from the outside toward its middle. Then you put a cap on it to imprison it. If it is not sealed and imprisoned it would escape without effort by you. It does not need help to expand. It only needs help to be compressed.</p>

<p>Consider a living man, in his normal environment of temperatures and pressures, being subjected
to an electric pulsation frequency of a 10,000 volt current. That tremendous abnormalcy expands
every cell in his body so suddenly that
they violently explode. All expanding bodies are always
exploding slowly, over long periods of time. We do not use that word for slow expansion, however.
We do not say that a decaying tree, which takes fifty years to go back into the ground, is exploding.
If you burn it, however, the flame is a series of quick explosions which will do in two hours what
nature intended should take fifty years.</p>

<p>Consider your car battery in the same way. If small wires are used the charge in your battery
explodes slowly. You
can drive hundreds of miles because of those slow gradual explosions which
gradually discharge your battery. If, however, you connect both poles with a large wire and touch
the ends together you discharge
the whole battery instantly. A brilliant flash of intensely hot flame
appears from an environment which was cold. That is what radioactivity is.
It multiplies the
frequencies of slow, invisible radiation to fast visible radioactive fusion.
If, for another example, you wind a tungsten wire with silk, then
pass a hundred thousand volt
current through it in a vacuum tube, you will see a brilliant white flash of intensely white hot light
which lasts for only about one millionth of a second. That light is so hot that it instantly explodes he tungsten. Nothing
but helium gas remains in the tube. Also those radioactively multiplied
voltage frequencies are so quick that the silk thread has not been even singed.</p>

<p>Anyway... My point here is I&#39;m talking about something completely different here and it requires different language. I really don&#39;t care what the traditionalists think, if semantics are that big of a deal to you then you don&#39;t really have any business trying to explore reality. Unification requires more generalization and less micro-specialization and vernacular. I&#39;m laughing at them just as much as they&#39;re laughing at me. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it can. What I&#39;m talking about is more than theory of simple physical mechanics. It is theory of <em>cause</em> and an explanation of the dynamic processes of nature. It is the <em>why</em> magnetism gives rise to the vortex motion that creates our reality.</p>

<p>As far as the mathematics of it all goes, I really don&#39;t feel like going into depth of it all here, but it is just the mathematics of dual-opposed vortex motion. I&#39;m simply giving brief overview of where I&#39;m coming from and how I frame the universe, which is the most important part. You can apply the scientific method to things all day long, but it&#39;s not going to get you anything particularly meaningful if you&#39;re not asking the right questions, which you generally aren&#39;t. If you were you wouldn&#39;t be so obsessed with explosions and would instead be spending more time investigating implosions and implosion-based technology. Nature works in vortices. Implosion. It is a two-way universe with <em>compression</em> and expansion.</p>

<p><strong>you may be right, but you are speaking a language that only you can understand.</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>that sounds majestic and profound, <strong>but it isnt scientifically meaningful language</strong></p>

<p>its the exact kind of language you use when you&#39;re having a discussion with someone who knows exactly the same things you do. unfortunately, nobody knows exactly the same things you do. words mean different things to different people</p>

<p>the vast majority of people on earth have no idea what the concept of &quot;infinity&quot; really is. </p>

<p>any attempt to describe it falls into the same language traps.</p>

<p>the best words to describe the concept in your mind, impart an entirely different meaning to someone else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The one amazing thing about all matter, which is not known today, is that all matter wants to explode, it wants to die. To live, is an effort. To die is effortless.

</blockquote>

<p>but none of this is scientifically meaningful, its all stuff that people think is so obvious that they dont think about it, ever.</p>

<p>its the kind of thing that blows your mind when you&#39;re really stoned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider a living man, in his normal environment of temperatures and pressures, being subjected to an electric pulsation frequency of a 10,000 volt current.

</blockquote>

<p>these arent profound concepts. you&#39;re just thinking about them in a way that makes them seem profound. i have smoked more than enough weed in my life to know the difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider your car battery in the same way. If small wires are used the charge in your battery explodes slowly. You can drive hundreds of miles because of those slow gradual explosions which gradually discharge your battery. If, however, you connect both poles with a large wire and touch the ends together you discharge the whole battery instantly.

Also those radioactively multiplied voltage frequencies are so quick that the silk thread has not been even singed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>again, not profound, just basic common sense that people dont think about because its so overwhelmingly obvious.</p>

<p>and radioactivity is the word used to describe the stability of atomic nuclei, the word you&#39;re looking for is radiation.</p>

<p>and electricity creating heat and light by passing through a region of high resistance is not profound at all, its a well documented scientific fact that most kids think is boring as shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway... My point here is I&#39;m talking about something completely different here and it requires different language. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>it does require a different language. and you havent found it yet.</p>

<p>i find that the best method is to speak by analogy, create a familliar situation and then show how that situation is analogous to something unfamilliar.</p>

<p>I.E. the way elements bond to each other and form compounds can be considered roughly analogous to how different personalities interact.</p>

<p>the way humans co-operate to form a society can be considered roughly analogous to the way cells co-operate to form an organism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really don&#39;t care what the traditionalists think, if semantics are that big of a deal to you then you don&#39;t really have any business trying to explore reality. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>put down the bong and wake up to yourself mate, nobody gives a fuck what you think if you&#39;re not going to put in the effort to communicate with them.</p>

<p>the only reason i even bothered replying to you is because i had my own &quot;enlightenment&quot; moment a few years ago where everything made sense, i have had a few years to ponder it and figure out ways to communicate it to others.</p>

<p>the difference between us is that i know what does not work. and i can tell you with 100% certainty that what you are doing does not work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unification requires more generalization and less micro-specialization and vernacular. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>no, it simply requires more emphasis on similarities rather than differences. differences should still be noted, but the similarities should be the primary focus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started to agree with this question, then thought through it more clearly while trying to explain it.</p>

<p>Imagine an earth-sized body and a moon-sized body in isolated space.  The theory suggests there is an equal pressure bombarding each body from all directions.</p>

<p>Standing on either body, the gravity-pressure pushing you toward the body from empty space is identical. However, on the earth-sized body, more of the gravity-pressure coming <em>through</em> the planet toward you is reflected than on the smaller body (where less is reflected.)</p>

<p>If the theory is correct, it should have some interesting testable predictions. Imagine standing on a giant thin disc with the same mass as the earth. According to Newtonian gravity, the gravitational force should be pretty similar to earth&#39;s actual gravity-- however according to the gravity-pressure theory, you should practically float away (unless you are standing along the edge of the disk) because there would be so little material to reflect gravity-pressure coming through the disk. This would be analogous to how light easily shines through a thin rubber disk, but not through a spherical rubber ball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was glad to see you mention Dr. Paul LaViolette, who I think is one of the most underrated physicists of our age. He has advanced multiple physics theories which make testable predictions that are being confirmed, yet his books are all but out of print and he has been virtually ignored by the greater scientific community.</p>

<p>LaViolette&#39;s pioneering theory of physics is called Subquantum Kinetics, and it has been out-predicting the standard model for a decade or so now in various areas. A nice list of these predictions and verification can be found <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_galacticsuperwave02.htm#Predictions%20Part%20II:%20physics%20and%20astronomy">here</a>. I&#39;ll list a few of the notable ones for the lazy:</p>

<p><strong>Prediction No. 1 (1973 - 1978):</strong> Subquantum kinetics predicted that the electric potential field in the core of a subatomic particle should be Gaussian-shaped and should continue outward as a periodic field pattern of diminishing amplitude having a radial wavelength equal to the particle’s Compton wavelength, further that this field pattern should be positively biased in positively charged particles. Prediction published in: 1985 (IJGS), 1994 (Subquantum Kinetics), and 1995 (Beyond the Big Bang).</p>

<p><strong>Verification (2002):</strong> Particle scattering form factor data for the proton and neutron is found to be best fit by a model in which the nucleon core electric charge density distribution has characteristics similar to those that subquantum kinetics had predicted. Energy boosting during collision, however, did cause the target nucleons to exhibit a wavelength slightly shorter than had been predicted.</p>

<p>(Relevant to this thread) <strong>Prediction No. 2 (1985):</strong> Subquantum kinetics predicted that gravity should have two polarities correlated with charge and that the electron should produce a matter-repelling gravity field. Furthermore it predicted that monopolar electric discharges should produce longitudinal electric potential waves accompanied by a gravity potential component. Published in: 1985 (IJGS), 1990 (ISSS), and 1994 (Subquantum Kinetics).</p>

<p><strong>Verification (2001):</strong> Drs. Evgeny Podkletnov and Giovanni Modanese discover that an axial high-voltage electron discharge produces a matter-repelling gravity wave that travels in the direction of the discharge exerting a longitudinal repulsive gravitational force on a distant test mass.</p>

<p><strong>Prediction No. 3 (1978):</strong> As a basic requirement of the validity of its methodology, subquantum kinetics predicted that photons should gradually redshift with time when passing through regions of low (less negative) gravitational field potential, e.g. intergalactic space. It predicted a &quot;tired-light effect,&quot; that distant galaxies should appear redshifted without the need of postulating recessional motion.</p>

<p><strong>Verification (1979 - 1986):</strong> Dr. LaViolette checks this photon redshifting prediction by comparing the tired-light non-expanding universe model and the expanding universe model (standard Freidman cosmology) to observational data on four different cosmology tests. He demonstrates that the tired-light model consistently makes a closer fit to observational data on all tests. His findings, which were published in the Astrophysical Journal (1986), confirm the subquantum kinetics tired light prediction and the notion that the universe is cosmologically stationary.</p>

<p>Et cetera. I&#39;ll buy his book someday when I&#39;m not so poor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If gravity is a &quot;push&quot;, it&#39;s potentially plausible that all forces are fundamentally &quot;pushes&quot;, which would suggest that all forces are merely serial recombinations of a basic Prime Mover. If this is true, it supports the Luciferian model of fractal universal experience, and in conjunction also supports full individual agency. This would mean that any and all strategies designed to misinform, confuse, agitate, and suppress individuals operate solely on the false belief that there is only one Universe that is experienced individually, and that things can only be changed by collective action - a near impossibility in systems so large and complex as our societies and the things that govern them. That all such strategies are, ultimately, suppressions of pure will, such that the driving force behind the experience of willpower is the Prime Mover itself.</p>

<p>The fractal nature of the universe means that information is always made available to every possible perspective in some way, in whatever large or small way that perspective allows. That there is always something to remind you of what could be, but it is not always easy to see. This may explain the basis for and constant recurrence of themes of worlds-within-worlds, of death and rebirth, across all our stories. It may explain why things like The Matrix and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and The Fountain exist - imperfect renditions of the potential within you, seen through another world.</p>

<p>However, like those reminders, this nature also requires that perspectives themselves never have a fully complete set of information - because to access all information in the universe, is to interact with everything in that universe simultaneously, which is logically absurd assuming a Prime Mover basis. Godel&#39;s Incompleteness Theorems, extrapolated to matter-as-energy-as-experience and to any given scope of perspective. This means that the misdirecting and confusing forces in the universe are an accident and result from a misunderstanding. A grasp of power without the knowledge of consequence, followed by knowledge of the past without the power to change it, followed yet again by power with lacking knowledge of why to use it in this newly oppressive way. The suppressions of will are a product of fear, the fear that too big a change is destruction, the fear that destruction is never followed by rebirth, because rebirth is so easily forgotten in the confusion and changing of life.</p>

<p>Maybe the truth is that acting on your own is always enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about the push over the pull - I don&#39;t think that is correct, however I have been thinking, for some time now, that gravity is a weak subatomic interaction / entanglement and that creating a high voltage (lit: covering the group of atoms with a huge layer of electrons) acts as an electro-gravitic shield. The more atoms in the group, the stronger the gravitic effect, hence size = gravity. </p>

<p>The work of Bifield-Brown, Townsend and Tesla all seem to point to this being the case. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t though about this recently, so thanks, OP - I needed a prod to open that internal dialogue again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it is true that mainstream physics has largely gotten itself lost in it&#39;s own mathematics to the point that pretty much everything you read about theoretical physics that was written in the last 90 years is garbage, there is an even better theory of gravity than the one you&#39;ve posted here.</p>

<p><a href="http://milesmathis.com/">http://milesmathis.com/</a></p>

<p>If you are interested in a <em>physics</em> and reality based re-evaluation of physics, than there is no better place than that site. He goes back to the basics and re-builds physics from the ground up, using nothing more complicated than calculus. He gets rid of all the fancy math that has become the modern standard and shows that it only serves one basic function: <em>to hide the fact that modern physics has no flipping idea what it is doing</em>. When you need to borrow stuff from nothing to make your equation work, <strong>your equation is rubbish and needs to be thrown out</strong>, not fudged and fudged again to make the numbers work out. Modern physics is a huge patch of band-aids on a huge mess of broken equations. This is why they keep needing to add new fields and new &quot;dimensions&quot;. Because the equations don&#39;t work, but rather than go back to the first postulates and try to see what is wrong, they just keep patching and patching, until there is nothing left of the patient but a mess of bandages on long-ago bled out corpse.</p>

<p>You might object that modern physics appears to be so successful that it can&#39;t possibly be wrong. But it is only right by way of pushes and shoves to match data posto facto via constants and other fudges. The true and correct equations don&#39;t need these band-aids, don&#39;t need to pull energy from no-where, don&#39;t need any extra dimensions that can&#39;t be seen, and don&#39;t need any fancy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q185InpONK4">equations that they don&#39;t even understand themselves</a>. You&#39;ll notice if you watch the video one of the tricks that mainstream physics uses a lot. They re-assign variables <em>in-between lines</em> when solving! So, for example, the variable <em>r</em> might mean radius of the nucleus on line 1, then it&#39;s the radius of the electron cloud in line 2, with out mentioning it. Many examples of &quot;success&quot; aren&#39;t even that. For example, the so-called Higgs boson had such a large range in it&#39;s predicted mass that they could have found anything. The rush to give out Nobel-Prizes for the discovery is just the mainstream rushing to give out awards before the stink of the buried corpse at the heart of physics gets too strong to hide. After all, it&#39;s about money now. Why change course when there is sooooo much money being made on the current course? </p>

<p>Getting back to Mile&#39;s site, it&#39;s best to start at the beginning and work your way down, because if you skip ahead, you&#39;ll be saying &quot;no way&quot; to yourself a bit too often. If you just skim the writing, and skip to the equations (which more than a few people are guilty of), then you won&#39;t understand what is being written, so I beg you to take the time to read. Much of what is there completely overturns modern physic&#39;s understanding of the world, yet he can solve many problems with nothing more than algebra that take mainstream physics pages and pages of math, and get the right answer. Even better than the right answer, because often many <a href="http://milesmathis.com/catas.pdf">&quot;anomalies&quot;</a> go away. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t really summarize all of that site here. But to bring more relevance to the OP to my post, here&#39;s part of his formulation of gravity:</p>

<p>He takes Newton&#39;s famous equation for gravity F=(Gm<sup>1</sup> m<sup>2</sup> )/r<sup>2</sup> and breaks it down. He realized that since the equation is true (and he shows later how to properly bring relativity into it), any attempt to <strong>add</strong> electromagnetic force to it would fail. The EM force must be contained <em>within</em> the equation!</p>

<p><a href="http://milesmathis.com/uft.html">Here</a> is the paper where he shows how to do this. Gravity unified with electromagnetism and relativity, and no tensor calculus. </p>

<p>I highly recommend the entire site for anyone who is dis-satisfied with the current state of physics. I don&#39;t 100% agree with everything on there, but I agree with most of it. </p>

<p>And, for those who are dis-satisfied with the state of the world, he has a<a href="http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html"> non-science writings site </a>too. In fact, I used to think that all conspiracy theories were bunkum, until I started reading his non-science site. The article that changed my mind was <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/37.pdf">this one</a>, about how the vote for GMO labeling would be stolen. I read it, having voted for labeling myself, knowing no-one who voted against it, with it leading in the polls. I thought he was wrong. Turns out the next morning that he was right. Sometime after that I subbed here, because of what I read there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote this reply, but felt unsure if I should post it. Anyway, here it is, take it or leave it. </p>

<p>I used to be deeply intrigued by quantum physics, but lost my passion for it after losing my respect for physicists, since most didn&#39;t pursue 9/11 truth. (Bit crazy of me). I still have a decent understanding of our physical world to paradoxically <strong>not</strong> understand most of what you&#39;re saying. It&#39;s pretty difficult to see the red line in your post, but it feels like you want to promote a link between electromagnetism and gravity. </p>

<p>The fact that they even exist separately is the reason for there not being a link between the two (tautology, I know). They can both be described in a similar way, but there are major differences between them. The electric force is an incredibly strong force, while gravity is very weak. In fact, only the spin of the electron which gives us magnetism is much stronger than gravity. All mass exert a gravitational pull (or push, just to toy with the idea) but it can&#39;t be neutral like the electric force.  </p>

<p>I also see Tesla&#39;s name be thrown around randomly in fringe ideas, especially by those who promote &quot;free energy&quot;, which I find sad. Tesla wanted to transfer cordless electricity, which people mistake for free energy. It&#39;s not free at all.</p>

<p>Neither do I like that a term like &quot;dark matter&quot; is used as a buzz-word while shunning most of the physics that it&#39;s based on. Even though I haven&#39;t read Tom van Flandern&#39;s book. </p>

<p>I tried really hard to make sense of any ideas you presented, and the only thing that kind of could be correlated with modern physics is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity acts by means of some sort of agents making contact with matter, despite the fact that no such agents are yet known to physicists. Conceptually, the only way that &quot;agents&quot; have to act on bodies is by means of collisions.
A sea of rapidly moving agents everywhere outside a body would tend to push down on the surface of the body, giving rise to an apparent force of attraction toward the center of the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This concept works similarly to the Higgs boson, but that explains what gives elementary particles <strong>mass</strong> (matter) and not gravity. When some elementary particles (not all) move through the Higgs field, they interact with the Higgs boson, thus giving them mass. But to even go there, you have to accept the standard model, which is far, far more difficult to comprehend than electromagnetism, special relativity, and other simpler concepts, that are still too complex for 99% of people to understand. If you can tell me how lightning works, then we can talk. </p>

<p>My reply is very confusing even to me, but it&#39;s only in response to this thread. Physics is a beautiful thing, and once one understands it, you really see the world in a better light. Especially if you understand how light itself works. </p>

<p>I know that the tone in this message sounds demeaning, but it&#39;s not my intention. I really wanted to understand what your message was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great comment.</p>

<p>My message, I <em>think</em>, was that <em>we don&#39;t have all the answers</em>.</p>

<p>I know that this is common knowledge among the vast majority of scientists, but for the layperson, I think many mistakenly believe that we have most of this shit figured out.</p>

<p>Through the work of these individuals (Brown, LaViolette, van Flandern), I&#39;ve come across an entirely new perspective of reality that I find extremely fascinating.</p>

<p>What I want is to reopen the discussion about all of this. I don&#39;t pretend to have the answers...my knowledge of physics has always been one of my weaker subjects. </p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think you should completely dismiss the connection between electromagnetism and gravity. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s keep the dialogue open on this. You seem extremely informed, more than I, and people like you are exactly why I post to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, so thanks for reinforcing that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definintely want to read more but the first question that jumps out to me is; if this is true why are our mathematics so good at figuring out gravitation?

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great question and unfortunately I don&#39;t have the time to research it and answer right now.</p>

<p><em>However</em>. What I can say is that our mathematics <em>were actually quite poor</em> when we were first figuring this stuff out, <em>especially</em> with our first satellite experiments.</p>

<p>In fact, in the 60&#39;s, the predicted behavior of our first satellites was <em>so</em> far removed from what <em>actually</em> happened, that they scrambled to find the errors in the equations.</p>

<p>Werner von Braun (ex-Nazi) was still employed at the time, and he made some <em>extremely</em> provocative statements regarding the bizarre behavior of those satellites and how the math behind their interaction with gravity was completely on the wrong track.</p>

<p>After von Braun made those statements, he was removed from his position.</p>

<p>Again, this is what I recall from my past research into this subject, but what I&#39;ve gathered is that in the 50&#39;s/60&#39;s, they had to seriously reevaluate the math and concept behind gravity, and perhaps much of that disappeared into the world of blackops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God, what an experience to have these kind of ideas (as vague as they are) floating around in your head and then find out there is a subreddit and books on the subject. Two years ago I had my one and only UFO sighting and it was of a fast strobing light that &#39;relocated&#39; from place to place in a very &#39;quantized&#39; fashion. Not flying. Then, within minutes the military came screaming in from every direction looking for &#39;it&#39;. They circled the location I first saw the light and then left. How does one react to seeing something break the laws of physics? By spending six months plus online trying to find the &#39;truth&#39;. I never found it of course but can&#39;t help feeling like it&#39;s on the tip of my tongue. For some reason I&#39;m drawn to the example of ancient Rome having singing statues. Priests in the basement of the temple lighting the fire to make the steam to make Medusa moan. They were <em>this</em> close to the industrial revolution but the idea that if you can make a statue sing you could also do work with the same technique never got through. Knowledge squandered. I can&#39;t help but wonder if we aren&#39;t in a similar situation where whatever &#39;it&#39; is is not fully understood by the people that have it and not shared for fear of what might happen or the wrong hands getting it (surely history is full of examples). My personal theory is that we may actually have some sort of anti-gravity device but no one has figured out how to mount a gun to it yet.
Thanks for this post full of information, even if it leads to another rabbit hole for me to get lost in!
I&#39;d like to add for benefit of other redditors that the only personally meaningful information I discovered in my quest was that the owner of Bigelowe (sp?) Aerospace has a second home near me and plays golf in the neighborhood I live in and where I saw the UFO. Somehow the idea of &#39;executives take joyride in anti-gravity device&#39; was comforting compared to contemplating aliens from another planet!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is strange at all it&#39;s long what I assumed to be the case.  There are characteristics about the gravity effect that seem to make that self-evident through the simplest observation.  I think it is not recognized because of the shape and scope of planets as a whole, but you can observe mechanisms throughout nature that if you looked at with a slightly different perspective would be identical.  Motion in the universe is not really complicated, it is fairly uniform and we see the same patterns above and below from giant to small.  We sometimes are blind to that when the scales and dimensions grow below or above our ease of perception from our small, human bodies.</p>

<p>He predicted that asteroids have natural satellites, was initially dismissed, and then later completely vindicated.</p>

<p>He also has traced back the paths of thousands of comets and determined that many of them (and many asteroids) originated from a massive body in the solar system that exploded 3 million years ago. </p>

<p>This explains why comets are moving so quickly and does away with the need for a hypothetical &quot;Oort cloud&quot; for the origin of the comets which has never actually been observed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One other thing that Brown discovered . According to some of his notebooks he became aware of surges in the readings of &quot; incoming sidereal radiation&quot; which captivated him so much so that he would actually sleep in his lab at the foot of some of his recording devices, waiting for that next &quot; glitch&quot;. When he matched those glitches with other recording stations around the world he discovered that they all hit the instruments at the same time.....no matter the distance. And this he felt was some sort of communication system, layered ontop of the natural actions that he had been noticing since the twenties.
Was he correct in that?  Another unanswered question to ponder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey ol buddy. So here&#39;s where you are mistaken. The antiquated, 19th century concept of a <em>static</em> unmoving aether was disproven over a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>However, evidence suggests that we&#39;re dealing with a very <em>dynamic</em> aether here. This has <em>not</em> been disproven. </p>

<p>In fact, this dynamic aether very much evokes parallels to the ideas and philosophies of some of the most ancient civilizations on the planet.</p>

<p>If by dismissing the concept of aether you&#39;re referring to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson-Morley_Experiment">Michelson-Morley experiment</a>, then you have some catching up to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.blue-science.org/articles/2013/06/07/open-system-physics-demystifying-free-energy/">Not only did Michelson-Morley not disprove a dynamic/kinetic Aether</a>, more thorough work conducted by Dayton Miller (the preeminent physicist of his day) in the 1930s, and others since, seems to refute the findings of Michelson-Morley entirely.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aetherometry.com/Aetherometry_Intro/EAintro_aether.php">It is a poorly grasped truism that the Michelson-Morley Experiment ended once and for all any notion that an Aether did or could exist.</a> </p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley Experiment did not, in any way, do away with any possible consideration of the Aether. What it did do away with was consideration of a fixed aether that, to boot, was electromagnetic in nature. Einstein himself supposed, until well into the 1920s, that there could and should be an Aether and that, in all likelihood, it would prove to be gravitational.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infinite-energy.com/iemagazine/issue38/einstein.html">The Albert Michelson-Edward Morley experiment of 1887 (at the Case Institute in Cleveland, Ohio) appeared to rule out a static aether.</a> But certainly, this experiment did not eliminate a dynamic aether of some kind that might form something like an &quot;aetherosphere,&quot; which was, at least near the surface of our planet, nearly in rotation with it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aetherscience.org/www-energyscience-org-uk/tu/tu18.htm">It&#39;s necessary to review an aspect of aether theory from the viewpoint of the null result of the Michelson-Morley Experiment</a>. Most physicists put this on a par with their belief in Einstein&#39;s theory in their blind acceptance that the aether, as something in space that regulates the speed of light, simply cannot exist.</p>

<p>19th century physics offers an explanation as to why the Michelson-Morley Experiment failed to detect motion of the Earth through the aether. The experiment was merely one aimed to advance our knowledge of physics by testing the standard assumption that there exists an aether which offers a single absolute frame of reference relative to which the speed of light in vacuo is constant. </p>

<p>It was not a test to prove the existence or not of a real aether! It was a test to verify or disprove an assumption made by the physics community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the standard model has become tautological and unfalsifiable, so anything that challenges the standard model is called pseudoscience right off the bat, citing the standard model as the reason why it&#39;s incorrect.</p>

<p>It&#39;s politics. The proponents of the standard model are the ones who get to control the narrative right now, so of course they shoot down anything that would challenge their authority. It&#39;s like asking the government to pass laws that would limit its power.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that everyone&#39;s pet theory is correct, but there are a lot of ideas with compelling evidence behind them that require proper addressing. The idea that gravity is a <em>push</em> and not a <em>pull</em> is one of them.</p>
