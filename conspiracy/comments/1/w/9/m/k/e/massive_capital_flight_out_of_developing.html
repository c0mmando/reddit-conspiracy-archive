        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why this isn&#39;t getting more attention in this forum, but the wheels of a major global financial collapse are in process this very moment. The tl;dr summary: credit is suddenly tightening due to slower economic growth in China and fears of Central Banks in Europe and the USA ending their &quot;easy money&quot; policies. The result? Massive capital flight by elites out of countless so-called &quot;emerging markets&quot; (read: poor countries) to supposedly safer countries such as Japan and the United States. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem: currencies are dropping globally in these poorer countries, jacking up inflation and slowing economic growth as their populations cannot afford basic goods and services. Furthermore the countries are hamstrung since they must service outrageously high debts before implementing any temporary stop-gap spending to stimulate economic growth. The slower economic growth across billions of people across the world will likely fuel slower economic growth in the so-called &quot;advanced economies&quot; (that is, Europe, the USA, and the rest) as well as risk aversion by firms globally.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following financial news (as a part-time adviser) for over a decade and this is looking bad, bad, bad. Argentina&#39;s currency is dropping more than it has in a decade; same for multiple other countries. The sheer scope of the capital flight is astounding: South Africa, Indonesia, Turkey, Argentina, Ukraine, Bulgaria, etc. This is going to make the 1998 Asian financial crisis look like a walk in the park. </p>

<p>The frustrating part? The easy credit policies of Central Banks are a chief culprit, since this has predictably fueled risky investments in the poorer countries of the world. Combined with zero capital controls (due to secret &quot;free&quot; trade deals), major firms can just yank capital out of these poorer countries, resulting in financial collapse. </p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be a CRAZY week ahead.</p>

<p>The icing on the cake? HSBC is massively overleveraged and looking more and more like Lehman Brothers Part Two (not to mention JP Morgan and Citibank).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find global economics to be one of the most glaring weak spots on reddit in general. Not just in here.</p>

<p>-As an aside and it has nothing to do with reddit-</p>

<p>My neighbor a couple of years ago, late 30&#39;s working on a graduate degree, bought a car on credit. She gleefully exclaimed to me that she had no trouble financing the car and hadn&#39;t realized how wealthy she was until she discovered the easy willingness of lenders to give her the money to drive away the car.</p>

<p>I tried to explain to her that taking on debt was not wealth. It fell on deaf ears. She equated creditworthiness = wealth. The propaganda machine is working perfectly.</p>

<p>The serfs in here soldier on, still arguing about JFK and chemtrails while their lifetime earnings, and their ability to earn, is being stolen from them at every juicy opportunity.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll see some headlines in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about Bilderbergs and Rothschilds and Jamie Dimon and HSBC, but they really don&#39;t seem to grasp in here the global banking/corporate takeover that is in the late stages of stealing the population of the world blind.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re stealing from all the people everywhere, everything they&#39;ve got - you absolutely need mighty military power, a strong international propaganda machine, and absolute control over the media.</p>

<p>They focus on economics here in bits and pieces. Somehow the end result of economic servitude and penury on a global scale seems to elude them here, as they continue to flit from one catastrophe to another without seeing the big picture of total resource theft.</p>

<p>Argentinian here. The inflation here is EXTREME. Since 2011, the inflation we suffered is by more than 200%. <a href="http://www.inflacionverdadera.com/">Source</a>.</p>

<p>Since the start of this year, we suffered the oscillation of dollar by more than 3 Argentinian Pesos.</p>

<p>This is an error. &quot;Emerging&quot; economies have lower debt-to-gdp ratios than the &quot;developed&quot; world. The &quot;emerging&quot; economies won&#39;t be hit as hard as the &quot;developed&quot; ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About Argentina&#39;s criss. Is not a conspiracy. Is just a mix between incompetence, ingnorance and anti capitalism doctrines. Our economy minister is a 35y Marxist without any expirience nor in public or private management. And our president is insane and acts like if she is queen. Also the oficial party trys to modify the constitution so the &quot;qeen&quot; can hold the power till the year 2024 by allowing limitless reelections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would think that - except that TPTB is heavily manipulating gold as well.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been selling paper gold off to depress the price, and buying physical gold for at least all of last year.</p>

<p>The gold price is artificially low.</p>
