    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And unfortunately, the US school system has really failed as opposed to say a country in Norther Europe like Finland or Sweden or Norway. Not saying that education is without bias in those places, but I have had some friends from those areas telling me about <em>mandatory</em> classes in their high schools about doing taxes and other useful skills, as well as having mandatory classes about &quot;Interpreting Media&quot; which teaches you to listen to what is not being said.</p>

<p>They have college day assemblies FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS ( 3-5 grade ).</p>

<p>In almost every school they have college pendants all over the place, each teacher has their college colors or pendant on their classroom entrance and in their class, they have degree displays where all the teachers pin their degree up, it&#39;s insane.</p>

This branches one of two ways from here: Something does happen and they say <em>we told you so</em>, or nothing happens as a way to cry wolf for something bigger down the road.

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, interesting. I have seen articles over the last several months about anti-russian group(s) trying to pick fights with them. Like I said, I don&#39;t follow MSM networks for obvious reasons so I haven&#39;t noticed any &quot;fear mongering&quot;. Based on these two articles alone, it just seems like they are taking what is already known to be real threats and spreading the word to keep your eyes up and ears open. If this &quot;russia&#39;s bin laden&quot; is a serious threat, then I would call the reports more warnings then any kind of mongering. If you have more sources to back up over sensationalizing of the topic, I would love to check it out. Plus a link to russia not wanting US security there would be an interesting read as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, where did I say &quot;Russia was a shit-hole&quot;? You are putting words in my mouth.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is obvious that in Russia there are various issues that anyone who is not willfully ignorant will see; there are areas of poverty and underdevelopment in many places in Russia (typically isolated areas, the quality of living in places like Moscow has undoubtedly risen in the past ~15 years), political corruption, presence of quite a large gathering of organised crime, oligarchs due to the swift move to privatise the economy, etc. This is not to say these issues are exclusive to Russia, but they exist.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am not relying on that thread to mold my opinion on Russia, I was merely using it is an example. Reject that thread if you want, but don&#39;t reject the obvious facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> predicts a false flag event at every major sports event it&#39;s &quot;valuable information&quot;.</p>

<p>When the news media discuss the very likely possibility of terrorist attacks at the Sochi Olympics it&#39;s &quot;fear mongering&quot;.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain this?</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s the size of the audience. Very good point.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was absolutely convinced that there&#39;s be false flag attacks at the London Olympics. Doesn&#39;t get much bigger than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant the size of the audience they&#39;re trying to spark fear in. The MSM has a huge audience so people here see it as fear mongering I guess.</p>

<p>But I agree with your point, barring some real evidence, what both <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does sometimes could be considered fear mongering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, where did I say &quot;Russia was a shit-hole&quot;? You are putting words in my mouth.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is obvious that in Russia there are various issues that anyone who is not willfully ignorant will see; there are areas of poverty and underdevelopment in many places in Russia (typically isolated areas, the quality of living in places like Moscow has undoubtedly risen in the past ~15 years), political corruption, presence of quite a large gathering of organised crime, oligarchs due to the swift move to privatise the economy, etc. This is not to say these issues are exclusive to Russia, but they exist.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am not relying on that thread to mold my opinion on Russia, I was merely using it is an example. Reject that thread if you want, but don&#39;t reject the obvious facts.</p>
