       Bandar is probably going to end up killing a shitload of people (he already has, but more), or a smaller amount of people but in a way where the shock factor is equivalent to a larger vanilla body count.

      <p>
       Russia gets blamed for corruption/didn't care/let it happen, media blathers on for weeks, turning public opinion against Putin, probably some more anti-gay bullshit thrown in there to spice up facebook feeds, blablabla.

       Exactly. And unfortunately, the US school system has really failed as opposed to say a country in Norther Europe like Finland or Sweden or Norway. Not saying that education is without bias in those places, but I have had some friends from those areas telling me about
       <em>
        mandatory
       </em>
       classes in their high schools about doing taxes and other useful skills, as well as having mandatory classes about "Interpreting Media" which teaches you to listen to what is not being said.

       The actually
       <em>

       their citizens to be informed so that the government does not run amok.

       I work for a school district in Illinois and I can tell you as plain as day, their new scam is indoctrinating these kids to go to college ( at least junior college ) NO MATTER WHAT.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have college day assemblies FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS ( 3-5 grade ).
      </p>
      <p>
       In almost every school they have college pendants all over the place, each teacher has their college colors or pendant on their classroom entrance and in their class, they have degree displays where all the teachers pin their degree up, it's insane.
      </p>

       I hate it so much, these kids do not even know how screwed they are.

       Conditioning, pure and simple. They are already on about a 'terrorist threat' before the games are even here. This branches one of two ways from here: Something does happen and they say
       <em>
        we told you so
       </em>
       , or nothing happens as a way to cry wolf for something bigger down the road. Either way, they get to yet again remind people of the "threat" of terrorism being just around the corner, and that they'd better be afraid or else.

       I've been noticing this for weeks now. The other thing I've noticed is the pro-NSA idea that 'americans are slipping back into a
       <em>
        dangerous
       </em>
       pre-9/11 mindset.'
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear that something's going to happen to "remind" us back into compliance.  The idea being that while americans are all focusing on the danger that Sochi faces, something will happen to one of
       <em>
        our

       beloved sports events...

       Hmm, interesting. I have seen articles over the last several months about anti-russian group(s) trying to pick fights with them. Like I said, I don't follow MSM networks for obvious reasons so I haven't noticed any "fear mongering". Based on these two articles alone, it just seems like they are taking what is already known to be real threats and spreading the word to keep your eyes up and ears open. If this "russia's bin laden" is a serious threat, then I would call the reports more warnings then any kind of mongering. If you have more sources to back up over sensationalizing of the topic, I would love to check it out. Plus a link to russia not wanting US security there would be an interesting read as well.

       Because there are obvious concerns with mainly the infrastructure of the games and the city of which it is being held. Just look at that reddit submission yesterday that showed that while Russia is trying to make Sochi look beautiful, there is widespread hardship behind the curtain.

       Yes, Russia is a wonderful place. Millions of people live there and are just as content as anyone. If this shocks you then you need to turn off your tv and go visit Russia instead of letting third-party sources with agendas tell you how the world is.

       Firstly, where did I say "Russia was a shit-hole"? You are putting words in my mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, it is obvious that in Russia there are various issues that anyone who is not willfully ignorant will see; there are areas of poverty and underdevelopment in many places in Russia (typically isolated areas, the quality of living in places like Moscow has undoubtedly risen in the past ~15 years), political corruption, presence of quite a large gathering of organised crime, oligarchs due to the swift move to privatise the economy, etc. This is not to say these issues are exclusive to Russia, but they exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I am not relying on that thread to mold my opinion on Russia, I was merely using it is an example. Reject that thread if you want, but don't reject the obvious facts.

       That article is addressing the problem of aboriginal rights. Many other countries, including the United States, have had the same issues (but I would argue to a much larger degree). Australia is very generous with the social security benefits to aboriginal people. I don't see how this is at all comparable to Russia.

       Half of it is just politics, the American news media is trying to find every embarrassing thing about the games to paint Russia in a particular light. Its like going to a party and complaining about the lights, the sound system, how much better your party was a few years ago.

       I meant the size of the audience they're trying to spark fear in. The MSM has a huge audience so people here see it as fear mongering I guess.
