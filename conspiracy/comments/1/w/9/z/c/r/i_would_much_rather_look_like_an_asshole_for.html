       I had decided that I was done with reddit, deleted main account, sat low for a few months as a lurker and you know what...
      </p>
      <p>
       FUCK THIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now I have this account to
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       speak my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This site has so many shills and interest groups in it, along with people who still cater to the disney-version of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention real life. Its not like you can tell your friends about your version of the world because you will be instantly labelled as a conspiracy theorist or seen as weird. I mean, most of it is pretty heavy stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you have the masses which just sway in the direction the wind is blowing, a wind with a source, and a source with money, power, and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to shout out my opinions on this site now and I am sure to attract some shills, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to avoid it. Now I welcome it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have soured my favorite site so FUCK THEM.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm only using words. The pen is more powerful than the spear.

      <p>
       Some people on this subreddit have inspired me and I thank them. They are why I am writing this message in the box.

       This sub/website is not full of shills. You don't have any knowledge that is unique or ground breaking, your friends alienate you because you are a nut who looks for grand schemes in every shadow. It's funny to me when conspiracy theorists post things like "everyone treats me like I'm crazy when I talk about xyz" and yet they never think to themselves "damn, I am probably crazy." I understand the need to have an interesting life, but this idea that you (and others on this sub) are somehow great truth Sayers is just as ridiculous as the religious figures you all mock. If I was the government I wouldn't even propagate any conspiracies because you nutters are already going crazy and destroying yourselves. There is no consensus here, everyone thinks everyone else is a shill whilst maintaining that they know the "truth." It is laughable to brainwash yourself into believing there is some grand malevolent puppet show controlling everything, and it's sure as hell a lot easier than actually making a difference. You know, starting a foundation to raise awareness, actually doing research or working to fund research, running for political office, anything. Your keyboard wars and mad assertions do nothing but discredit you and make a mockery of your paper thin theories. Good day!

       Wow. You know me so well, person on the internet who I have never met. Please, give me more insights into my life and my friendships. You must be really shitty at reading, because I specifically said that I do not tell the people around me all of the conspiracy theories that I happen to believe. But hey, don't let that get in the way of your bedtime story.

       My life is already interesting. I am traveling all around the world and having a great time with my great job. You don't seem to understand the purpose of this sub is to ask questions.

      <p>
       Since you are too dense to even acknowledge the existence of special interest groups on a major US media outlet, then I certainly don't expect you to be able to figure out the actual people who make up this sub apart from the ones posting to make it look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will give you a hint, the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       people who make up the framework of this sub are the ones asking questions. The right questions. But once again, you probably have a broken bullshit-detector, if you have one at all.

       Do you think the world is a cartoon? Do you think you can speak about "the government" that makes up thousands of people in power, and act as if they are deciding as a whole to be a certain way?
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of your post is just as idiotic as the first part. Do you understand the internet at all. You think that typing your opinions to millions of people is pointless as far as changing the world goes? And whether or not you chose to believe it, my life on the internet is just one small part of my life. Maybe you are projecting your own life onto other people because you are insecure.

       Also, I have started a foundation and it was a tremendous success. It saved the lives of hundreds of children. And not figuratively. It

       saved their lives.

       I don't doubt there are PR people and such on reddit. Those are what you consider shills? I was under the impression that "shills" referred to people spreading disinformation for the government, the "illuminati" or whatever. If shills are just advertisers, then no shit! And if
You did really start a foundation (it's the internet, you wouldn't lie would you?) good for you! You took a step in the direction of actual progress instead of sitting here posting lizard man youtube videos. Asking questions is one thing, but what goes on in this sub is not so much asking questions as it is science fiction being passed off as fact. Lastly, I don't even know what vote brigading is, but I have no control over people agreeing with what I said or not.

       Obviously you missed my point and or didn't bother reading that very short wikipedia link. My point being, shill is just a word used to describe PR people and pundits hired by US corporations and the US government to sway and manipulate public opinion. These people absolutely exist and they've only become more prominent with the rise of the internet and grotesque overreach of power by both our government and capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even from a completely objective view point. Advertising isn't effective and mostly ignored or not available (reddit), targeted PR/shilling is ultra effective, actionable and tremendously cheaper than traditional advertising. Source: i've worked at Organics, AKQA and DRAFT FCB (top advertising agencies in SF) and even these design focused agencies would pay for PR services, they would even pay to have negative content/comments removed or hidden on trending content if it was bad for the client or brand. Also most agencies employ "community managers". their job is obviously to manage social campaigns on FB/twitter/reddit/whatever but often times they're using services like this
       <a href="http://buyredditvotes.com/">
        http://buyredditvotes.com/
       </a>
       and some agencies even have software that can create hundreds of fake accounts on social networks with a single IP and single email address.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i do agree that people have been tossing the word around way too much and it's rather silly to label people who don't agree with you as a shill. Obviously behavior like this only creates more division but you need to understand that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is attacked regularly so people jump to conclusions, i blame
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       for this.

       I'm constantly alienated in social situations because of this, I'm called a zealot and paranoid regularly.

       A quote from tesla always seems to pick up my spirits "anti social behavior is easy when surrounded by conformists". So embrace being an asshole because it's in the name of integrity and moral virtue, I rather look crazy amongst acquaintances than live a life of conformity and moral corruption.

       He was a great engineer, but a pretty shitty person. He believed in reprehensible things, and held a lot of strange and self contradictory beliefs. He isn't considered anti-social because he was ahead of his time or held people to absurdly high moral standards, he was considered anti-social because he was rude and was a crusader for messed up shit like eugenics.

       You really want to reach people you need to be smarter then the rest of the blow hards everywhere else. Why do you think youtube channels such as stormcloudsgathering has so many hits?

      <p>
       It is cause people dont wanna see behind the veil. They just want small intellectually digestible bits of information. Pretty pictures and ominous music is key. Humanity wants to be led into the future. I firmly belive what Loki in the avengers said that humanity was breed for enslavement.

       I know it was a movie but that whole scene has stuck with me since I first saw it. Now you can bitch and moan post your comments and make a website but here is the truth fellow redditor.  Unless you get people behind you then you will be nothing more then a name on some watch list.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself have my own reasons for giving up. I dont see it making a bit of differance. The so called good guys spread disinformation just as bad as the other side to try and get others to join the cause of the day. I dont see shit going good for anyone in the future I just take care of me and mine now. Fuck agendas and helping others I dont see it benefiting me in anyway but making me feel better and sorry but me maintaining my so called humanity dont rate higher then survival.

       Hey man can you tell me what it is that you gain from constantly looking thru here and fucking with other users? Now I understand the lure of a noble cause but for fucks sake dont you people have jobs? Or family? Surly you can find something more meaningful then looking for a place to leave a comment then on someone's post you know will get you fucked with.

       Lol flytape your warnings whomever they were directed at mean nothing to these people. Your sub is completely compromised in the fact of that everyone that is talking to him is getting downvoted. I am no expert on the way a downvote brigade works but this I am sure is a prime example.

       Why so many redditors from Calgary?  Methinks perhaps it has to do with the UofC, Mt. Royal University, SAIT, &amp; ACAD.  And maybe it's because Calgary has such a younger demographic.  And lastly it
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       be because of the oil &amp; gas company HQs here (though I doubt it).  Calgary is all in all, despite it's high property values &amp; mediocre public transportation system a great place to live.  And elboya does indeed look like a great neighborhood.

       I'd say the demographic is likely a major factor. I notice there are so many young people there or moving there. It is still a boomtown. IDK about the unis, uofc is nice and SAIT is... well... SAIT. I think it is because of all the job opportunities.

       I mentioned the schools because of the ages of the students, and the fact that they tend to be more tuned into tech stuff.  And Calgary has a few post secondary options.

       yup, you got me.  How will I ever go on living with such a burn.  My life is so empty &amp; meaningless without you guys to tell me how empty &amp; meaningless it is.  That's why I rely on the scrubbing power of Scrubbing Bubbles.

       I'd say we need active users doing independent research and compiling evidence OUTSIDE of this sub. Like we either need our own blogs or take some of the regular AWESOME contributors and have them organize a blog. We could track traffic more readily and not really rely on JUST reddit for our theorizing and the subsequent spamming. I would prefer a blog to a forum, like GLP, it's just too confusing to the "everyman" who might actually read a blog.

       So we agree, you must think that people on conspiratard are idiots.

       Why else would you assume that they were too dumb to click on r/conspiracy and find the posts. Or to just click on your username and see where you commented.
