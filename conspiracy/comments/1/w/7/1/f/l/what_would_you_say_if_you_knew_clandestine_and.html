    <div class="md"><p>First I would question the &quot;rather die&quot; assertion. You will regularly trade your rights for benefits (you must trade a property right in some money to buy a Big Mac). Perhaps you mean you would rather die than <em>voluntarily</em> give up a right? But certainly still, presuming you don&#39;t suffer from some death wish, you must have some consideration of scale: Say your neighbor puts his flower pot on a 1 square foot part of your land abutting his property. He leaves the pot there for 20 years, and then brings an action to quiet title to that square foot in his name. Would you give your life to keep you neighbor for adversely possessing a square foot of your land? </p>

<p>Then, of course, is the right in question. The 4th Amendment. The 4th Amendment is not an absolute guarantee against government search. By its plain text it&#39;s a prohibition of &quot;unreasonable&quot; searches (along with a probable cause standard for the issue of warrants). Reasonableness is subject to judgment and 4th Amendment jurisprudence is very complex because of the subjunctive nature of that amendment.</p>

<p>You do not and will not live in fear. So what&#39;s the harm? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t mean to pick apart your comment, but it&#39;s the top for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I prefer questions, makes me think.  My assertion is rather simple.  In my statement I said supposedly had rights, and no I would not trade,  exchange, volunteer to give up those illusions of freedom had I had them to exchange in the first place but that is a much deeper philosophical discussion. </p>

<p>As far as death wish,  actually the opposite is true,  my intrinsic desire to be free, unchained from my own one dimensional existence is my pinnacle of self actualization,  despite the high probability of never obtaining that goal. Back to my statement the premise is simple and cliche - I would rather be free than safe and I do not think I should sacrifice one to have the other. I would rather die from a bomb on a plane than be molested in any manner to board that very plane. </p>

<p>Freedom comes with responsibility,  I will not spout out amendment this and amendment that. Our rights are an illusion a carrot on a string we chase, maybe in hopes of perserving the ideas they stand for.  Those rights are supposed to be inalienable, maybe people need to understand that word because there in lies the crux of the illusion.  If this were true none of what is going on now would be up for debate, yet we are still being spyed upon, Americans are murdered with out authority to do so except by having the virtue of might. People are tortured and held indefinitely without charge and we are molested to board public transportation etc..  </p>

<p>The illusion is a lie.  We accept our reality out of fear.  I am no living in fear....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your statement about your desire for self actualization is profound. </p>

<p>To say you would rather be free than safe presupposes you can have one without the other (for any meaningful period of time). I agree rights are illusory, but no more so (or, perhaps, not many degrees of magnitude more so) than language. We could spend days enumerating the conditions necessary for communication to occur (and there are many conditions). But, even in our act of communicating, there would be (must be) an assumption that we share the same set of denotations -- that speaker and listener attach the same meaning to  words. We make this assumption (perhaps implicitly) though we know this ideal is never truly realized. </p>

<p>Same with rights. (I happen to be a lawyer with a degree in national and international peace and defense -- which only means that I have had the opportunity to explore some of the concepts we are discussing in settings institutionally structured for the purpose.) When I argue for, say, redress of violation of my clients&#39; rights (and I do so all day every day), I do so with a tacit understanding of the elusive nature of the concept for which I advocate. You obviously get this as your ultimate desire (freedom) is likewise illusory.</p>

<p>So answer me this: You say you &quot;would rather die from a bomb on a plane than be molested in any manner to board that very plane.&quot; What if <strong>you</strong> were to board the plane freely but had the option to choose whether the bomber be &quot;molested&quot; or not. Which would you choose? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To allow them ( the bomber) to board unmolested. It is his right as well, conceptaully right or wrong it is also their freedom. Does that have consequences.sure.</p>

<p>My freedom while conceptually bound by various constructs that exist - my cage if you will / all of our cages-and the attempt to exit said cage - is more about regaining my human sensibilities and gratification (this is the philosophical actualization) of them to an extent that I cause no harm to no one but maybe my self, I know I&#39;m going to die at some point (death instinct- we all are afficted by it) and I want to enjoy the ride, if by chance I&#39;m dead because of a bomber should I not have had the ability to live as free as possible or more restricted because of the perception of an unrealistic fear - not everyone agrees and through the keyhole of their cage I.e. the dogma that fuels the motives of one who believes their illusion to such an extent they are willing to die - blow up an airplane- is thier freedom ( i am willing in the idea / concept of being free) and while I do not agree with killing they do have the right to pursue it, this is not to say one may not defend oneself, but defense should be upon imminent threats not paranoid statistical anomalies that in most of these cases are propped up by greater powers justifing budgets and endless wars where the very enemies are created as their loved ones have been themselves bombed into oblivion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is giving up rights is not a choice.  The government does not ask me if I want to give up my 4th amendments rights, they just take it away.</p>

<p>We can talk about the electoral college and how you should vote for what you want, but that disregards the fact that we live in a constitutional republic and not a democracy or mobocracy.  The people are not suppose to be able to give up their rights, it is a direct cause of the two party power grab that we see the suggestion being poised.</p>

<p>In the deep levels of covert MIC and PTB machination, the left hand often has no idea of what the right hand is doing.  The system is purposefully designed this way.  It is often the case that one arm of the system implements measures to give the impression of one thing while the very opposite was the intention all along.  That might not make much sense to you, but it&#39;s certainly the m.o. of many of these types nonetheless.  Just ask Mr. Larry Silverstein.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The only confusion here is that <em>you</em> fail to understand that the architects of 911 <em>were</em> in fact the very same as the architects of the post 911 surveillance system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you considered whether your assumption is wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>And, like many that have done a thorough investigation of who in fact was responsible for 911, I&#39;ve realized that I&#39;m <em>not</em> wrong.</p>

<p>The forces that were responsible for 911 were the very same ones that have implemented the current surveillance state that we live in.  It&#39;s all part of the contrived, manipulated <a href="http://www.propagandamatrix.com/diocletian.html">Problem-Reaction-Solution paradigm</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We already know that fewer than 5000 people were killed on 9/11.  If we give up basic privacy, then anyone (including all local politicians and judges and legislators) can be blackmailed into doing anything, like killing off all the rest of us.  </p>

<p>So, NO.  Even as we now know that this level of data collection does NOT in fact prevent terrorist attacks, it is still not worth what we have lost due to this level of data gathering.  </p>

It is obvious from his behavior that Obama is not in charge, but being blackmailed also.  I can&#39;t tell if my senator, Diane Feinstein is being blackmailed or if she is merely an idiot.</p>
