       I'm doing a paper on different sub-cultures in America and the Conspiracy Theorist group is one that I wanted to cover. Something I always wondered was how families/friends react to your beliefs as a conspiracy believer.

       My dad won't comment and he's so smart that I think he has to know what's going on but doesn't get involved in the conversations because my mom would become a wreck
      </p>
      <p>
       My oldest brother and sister agree with me/us(husband and I), we have a private facebook page where we share links and stuff..
      </p>
      <p>
       My other sister I think wants to believe it but her husband does not so she tends to side with him more often than not..
      </p>
      <p>
       Friends for the most part think we're a little bit crazy but when we give them proof they never have much to say after that..

       No, I get the reference. I don't know how to interpret it in terms of my question. So you're saying that the friends and families you deal with would rather 'hide their head' than listen to your beliefs?

       I think OP should know it doesn't matter. By now you should have or be developing your group of people for when SHTF. People are already divided intellectually/emotionally into the do-somethings and the know-nots, won't do shits.

       By presenting them with this information you're changing their mind. I think many times people forget that things they know are things they may have not if not some "outside force" (institution, colleague, chance) intervened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know this: you are changing someone by exposing them to any information, whether you have intention of leading them or not. That is what is so damaging about information being with-held or omitted, it is what we
       <em>
        think we know
       </em>
       , not what is completely unsure, that is the most damaging to us. If we are to keep moving forward we mustn't be stuck. We can escape from ignorance and arrogance in this way.

       My friends are slightly skeptical, but believe me a little. I tell them just be ready when shit goes downhill. My family is even more skeptical except my mom. She seems more afraid ever since a guy we know got interviewed by secret service though and went back to pretending the news is real.

       Thanks for posting. Do you find yourself reluctant to share your beliefs? From the little bit of research t hat I've done, so far, those that run into skepticism from close family figures are reluctant to keep sharing it.

       My father agrees with some of my views, in fact I picked up some ideas from him that I further researched. My mother thinks that I believe too much bullshit. One brother agrees, not sure about the rest.

      <p>
       Edit: I have one cousin and about 3 other friends who I talk to about these things on a semi regular basis.

       You say that you enjoyed life "Before I got into looking into...", how long have you held this belief? And what was the inciting incident, if you don't mind my asking.

       I stopped discussing my beliefs with disinterested or disagreeable people some years ago, a few years after Reagan was elected. I noticed that no one changed their mind, so why bother. I have a brother who is completely incoherent in his conspiracy beliefs. Up until ten years ago we could have some interesting exchanges and he turned me on to many good books but now we do not communicate. The last few meetings nothing came out of his mouth that was not conspiracy related of the most obscure and incomprehensible nature.  I believe that most conspiracy theories are better descriptions of reality than accepted truth but I do not feel the need to enter heated discussions with nonbelievers, no one changes their mind. I offer information and sources politely if possible then leave it alone.

       Lemme guess, you're a psychology student. A field which in modern days is anchored on the Milgram experiment and the Stanford prison experiment, petty findings. Pavlov, B.F. Skinner, Freud etc. are all hacks, conducted non-empirical science, and created more confusion than good.

      <p>
       Your attempt to categorize people shows what a pseudo-science psychology is.

       It's a good guess, but nope. English major with an interest in niche cultures. No psychology or analysis, just information. When you try to apply scientific theory to information, you pollute the information.

       I hope my post gave you some insight into the mindset of those who question.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I still think your attempt will bear little fruit. The questioning "culture" should be considered "fringe" more than "niche". There is no adherence between the people other than maybe a common distrust for authority.

       Most of them have to deal with some facet of politically perpetuated culture. I'm including groups like the Tea Party and the Occupy Movement folks as well.
