<p>My oldest brother and sister agree with me/us(husband and I), we have a private facebook page where we share links and stuff.. </p>

<p>My other sister I think wants to believe it but her husband does not so she tends to side with him more often than not..</p>

<p>Friends for the most part think we&#39;re a little bit crazy but when we give them proof they never have much to say after that..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By presenting them with this information you&#39;re changing their mind. I think many times people forget that things they know are things they may have not if not some &quot;outside force&quot; (institution, colleague, chance) intervened. </p>

<p>Know this: you are changing someone by exposing them to any information, whether you have intention of leading them or not. That is what is so damaging about information being with-held or omitted, it is what we <em>think we know</em>, not what is completely unsure, that is the most damaging to us. If we are to keep moving forward we mustn&#39;t be stuck. We can escape from ignorance and arrogance in this way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped discussing my beliefs with disinterested or disagreeable people some years ago, a few years after Reagan was elected. I noticed that no one changed their mind, so why bother. I have a brother who is completely incoherent in his conspiracy beliefs. Up until ten years ago we could have some interesting exchanges and he turned me on to many good books but now we do not communicate. The last few meetings nothing came out of his mouth that was not conspiracy related of the most obscure and incomprehensible nature.  I believe that most conspiracy theories are better descriptions of reality than accepted truth but I do not feel the need to enter heated discussions with nonbelievers, no one changes their mind. I offer information and sources politely if possible then leave it alone. </p>

<p>BTW, I still think your attempt will bear little fruit. The questioning &quot;culture&quot; should be considered &quot;fringe&quot; more than &quot;niche&quot;. There is no adherence between the people other than maybe a common distrust for authority. </p>
