       In the movie Resident Evil, the Umbrella Corporation is described as an international corporation which secretly specialized in genetic engineering, biological weaponry and pharmaceuticals while appearing to the public as a supplier of food and other consumer products. Sounds pretty familiar, right? Creeped me out a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be an exaggeration and I obviously don't think they're creating monsters (at least not the kind from the movie) but there's  no doubt that some shady shit is going on with that corporation.

       The "game" version of anything is always better than the movie! In any game, you have to work hard and think to get to the end, movies just spoon feed you with no action needed other than shoving food into your mouth-hole!

       whenever some "popular" kids movie comes out, there's always a series (all the current home consoles and a portable or two) of games to go with it that often come out several days before the movie even. and they're always shit games that often don't even follow anything even close to the plot of the movie.

       Well thats just capitalism taking advantage of the popularity of the movie. No harm, no foul... unless said game actively collects user info and is relayed to our friendly government agencies. Looking at you disney.

       I remember going into a game store when it was released and they had this huge tv with the game playing. Couldn't get near it because of the people. Surprized they were allowed to put that game on display because of the rating.

       The "game version" is almost never better than the movie, atleast if it was a movie first. However for things like resident evil, doom and hitman that were games first, the movie is usually awful.

       Well they do own a private army.  Also "Monsanto Protection Act".  So they are positioning themselves to be an Umbrella like corporation.  Basically they are the "evil corporation" in various forms of media.

       No, you're right.  That is assuming we go by the Scahill article instead of any of the other sites that come up in a google search claiming; "yes", "no", or "it's too hard to follow the paper trail through shell corporations so maybe-ish", they didn't buy them.  But they contract them to at least be their "intelligence" arm.  Somehow that doesn't make me feel any better. The fact private armies like them exist alone is bad.

       No, but Tyco/Covidien/Mallinckrodt, a major global medical/pharmaceutical company has their US HQ here in St Louis about a 10 minute drive from Monsanto HQ, and you can stop by Express Scripts', the largest pharmacy provider on earth, global HQ at the half-way point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mallinckrodt back in the day processed a large fraction of the nuclear material used in the Manhattan project right here in St Louis, and today they are one of if not the largest global manufacturer of synthetic opioids.

       I would also like to point out that Eli Lilly is a de-facto government lab that has many floors under the city of Indianapolis. I have been in the basement and I know someone who has been to the -4th floor - nobody really knows how deep it goes. One of the reasons that buildings in Indianapolis cant be over a certain size is because the bedrock prevents them from sinking a big enough foundation - but the joke is that Lilly just has the whole place tunneled out...

       I wasn't comparing the zombie aspect I was comparing the malevolence of the two companies. I'm not sure why you're fixated on the zombie thing or my posting history like that has any relevance to my credibility or like it has anything to do with an opinion post. You're just trying to be inflammatory and honestly it's not effective. Not sure why this thread made you so angry but I think it's something you should work through on your own. When you have an interesting point or opinion please come back and join the discussion.

       Those 3 things bring PROFIT.

       You can not be serious. You're not fooling anyone here, man, we are actually informed about the dangers of genetically modified foods, the dangers of pesticide-resistant plants, the fact that Monsanto  developed some of the most devastating biological weapons ever used and have an unbelievable amount of political influence  within our government.

       If you think you know anything about organic chemistry, then there is your answer. It is a herbicide, that when not synthesized correctly can readily convert into one of the most deadly compounds ever known to man, 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD)

       chemists are not perfect and these kinds of things happen all the time from a lack of full understanding of chemical mechanisms.  Take Thalidomide for example...

       you dont need to put quotes around herbicide, both 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D are common herbicides.
      </p>
      <p>
       and it doesn't seem accidental to you because your biased view leads you to believe everything is a set up.  just google the thalidomide phenomenon that I mentioned above. completely accidental and resulting in the mutation and deaths of tens of thousands of newborns due to a minor chemical error that caused the R enantiomer (perfectly safe and still used today) to convert to the S (which causes mutations in newborns).
      </p>
      <p>
       a few degrees over while preparing 2,4,5-T can result in the unnoticeable conversion to TCDD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto makes herbicides among other things, so that's probably why the US Military went to them and Dow Chemical to mass synthesize an herbicide that would defoliate the heavily forested area that was causing us to lose thousands of soldiers from guerrilla ambushes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Names like "Agent Orange" are created by paranoids like you to try to scare people into thinking it is a conspiracy and that companies like Monsanto are evil "Umbrella-like" corporations out to destroy the world, rather than rich motherfuckers trying to save a couple bucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if the US Military knowingly used the contaminated herbicide, this is fucking war and they're killing each other anyways... that's the real problem, not Monsanto?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah Monsanto isn't too popular right now, not because people think they are going to take over the world, but because they would rather save a buck than dish out healthy, GMO free foods and products (which would cause their product yields to plummet resulting in huge losses in sales).
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is making you eat their food, that would be evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason this all makes sense to you is because you are looking for a big conspiracy, not because it actually makes sense.

       ... Say what? What about the patent trolling? GMO crops turn up in nearby fields, and they sue and take everything from those farms. They don't care about food production being at it's best, they care about having a monopoly on food. Of course they care about their public image, that's why they managed to get studies of GMO fed rats pulled, and pushed their own study that only ran for a fraction of the time the other studies ran for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying GMOs are bad, but how Monsanto is going about it is totally wrong. Rather than trying to handle the pests and diseases, they decide to juice up the crops, make it have genetic pesticides, that supposedly don't make it to human consumption... In short, Monsanto either doesn't know enough about it's own GMOs or it doesn't care enough to interrupt profit.

       That is absolutely not a fact. GMO seeds do contaminate natural farms and Monsanto does sue those farms over it, there are many cases of it. Not to mention the corporation suing over the seeds that are sowed from the farmers crops so that the farmers have to keep buying new seeds every season which draws small farms into debt and makes it very hard for them to stay in business.

       Show me the case, because every one I've seen cited has been as I described, farmers attempting to use Monsanto products without paying. And Farmers that Purchase Monsanto seeds sign a contract saying they will repurchase rather then replant the Monsanto seeds, this contract is freely signed and if they choose to use 'natural' seeds over MST seeds they are still free to do even with the contract, but if they breech the contract then, yes, they can be held legally responsible. Monsanto spend billions developing GMO strains it only makes sense they want a return on their investment.
