       Last year I was in Houston, TX on super bowl sunday and the sky was filled with chem trails. I found it to be ironic that the day that everyone was to be inside watching the game, the sky was filled with chem trails.
      </p>
      <p>
       This year I plan on taking pictures throughout the day to document the chem trail progress. I was thinking I would start a thread the day of and just update with pictures during the course of the day. I thought it would be interesting to get a few members of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       involved. I just wanted to make a quick post to get some feedback.

        A contrail is an abbreviation for "condensation trail," which is a visible white vapor trail produced as water vapor condenses from aircraft engine exhaust. Contrails consist of water vapor or tiny ice crystals. The length of time they persist varies from several seconds to a few hours, depending largely on the temperature and humidity.

       So you're saying that contrails

       linger for hours. So how do you tell the difference between contrails and chemtrails?

       There are many legitimate explanations for that. And none of them posit that a plane took off with more weight than it could possibly carry and sprayed it in the air for some sinister agenda, all without a single person, out of the hundreds of thousands necessary for such a plot, waving their arms with
       <em>

       Contrails are big problem for the military. They spend billions developing Stealth technology to defeat radar and then the plane gives the game away by leaving a contrail from horizon to horizon. They are continually experimenting with new fuels and additives to prevent this happening, so it's not unreasonable to accept that, very rarely, it may be possible to see two aircraft in formation with only one of them leaving a contrail.

       Good answer.  I think the gist that we are trying to arrive at is that one cannot visibly discern between contrails and chemtrails.  Thus, all these pictures that are being posted on the internet of trails are as useful as looking at a horses ass and saying that one's a unicorn and the other is a regular horse.  I believe TPTB are geo engineering.  I mean the Air Force is on record saying they will own the weather by 2018.  I'm just getting tired of seeing streaks in the sky causing the chicken little effect.

       Yeah, I know what you mean. Pictures really don't prove or confirm anything. I wish there was a reasonable way the public could test the air for spikes in certain materials. It might be easier to connect spikes of aluminum or barium found in an air test to the 'chemtrails' that were currently visible in the sky. I think that it would be difficult to relate materials found in soil/rainwater to the chemicals sprayed in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember watching a few curious youtube videos of a man who was documenting the skies where he lived and also this strange spider web material that was showing up in the area:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NNv6rYR1S8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have personally never seen anything like that, but it would be very interesting if that material were to be tested to show what was in it.

       Because it is water vapor, basically. A chemtrail is a mixture of aluminum oxide, strontium, barium, and cocktail of other deadly shit that is engineered to float in the upper atmosphere and reflect sunlight before it reaches the surface.

       Contrails are, largely, made of the same stuff as clouds. Why then
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       a contrail linger and spread like a cloud does?
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly about the chemical make-up of chemtrails would make them more likely to hang about than your standard run-of-the-mill crystalized water vapor? Do you realize how much a 20 - 50 mile long contrail (or chemtrail if you prefer) weighs? You expect a plane to be able to take off with that much mass on board?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure your mother is proud that you can recite some elemental compounds, but do you or anybody else have a single shred of evidence that they are present in your chemtrails?

       Have you ever seen the space shuttle transported? It's transported on top of a jumbo jet. Your argument about mass and weight doesn't hold water.

       Ok. I suppose that is an acceptable explanation for chemtrails hanging around like clouds do. Can you explain why clouds and contrails can't do the same thing? Since you can't do that, can you explain how you tell the difference between a contrail and a chemtrail?

        Have you ever seen the space shuttle transported? It's transported on top of a jumbo jet. Your argument about mass and weight doesn't hold water.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The space shuttle itself (the part that rides on the back of a jet) has only a portion of the mass of the entire configuration (rockets, boosters, fuel, etc). I think it weighs somewhere in the realm of 150,000 tons, but I don't remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       The composition of a cloud varies but we can use and average density of about 1.003 kilograms per cubic meter. If we look at a condesation trail that stretches 100 kilometers (whether it dissipates or not, doesn't matter) and is roughly 1000 square meters in the other two dimensions (100 meters wide and 100 meters tall).
      </p>
      <p>
       The volume of that contrail would be 100m x 100m x 100,000m or 1,000,000,000m
       <sup>
        3.
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       Apply the density of 1.003kg/m
       <sup>
        3
       </sup>
       and we get 1,003,000,000kg or 2.2 billion lbs. With a "b". In tons thats 1,100,000. Over a million tons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets cut that in half and we are at around 500,000 tons. In half again and its around 250,000 tons, one more time and we finally fall under the shuttle weight (if I recalled it correctly) at 125,000 tons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many contrails take up much more volume than this as jets tend to fly farther than 100km. Some of the "chemtrails" that people post pictures of that stretch across the sky are much longer than 100km. And chemtrails must be at least similar in density to contrails because we can see them from the ground and they behave similarly to contrails and clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me again how my comment doesn't hold any water. Because it looks like it holds millions of tons of water.

       into this debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear similar logic when people "debunk" UFOs by denying that spaceships, no matter how advanced, can cover the incredibly vast distances between solar systems in a reasonable amount of time. Turns out space-time itself can be stretched and shortened, something we've known since Einstein's days, and with enough power it can be manipulated so that the ship doesn't move through space, it makes space move around it, rendering vast distances a moot point. The obstacle to overcome is not distance, but power generation. NASA has a funded program to build a craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the issue of the weight of the chemicals can and has been overcome. There are fleets of aircraft devoted to spraying. As I said before, this stuff is nano-engineered. A few tons of it per aircraft, multiplied by say 100 aircraft, and now we're talking about some real damage.

       Geo-engineering itself isn't a bad idea. We have ways of seeding clouds and changing weather patterns, for example, that can be put to good use. The materials used are inert. But somewhere along the lines some different uses were dreamed up, requiring metals like aluminum which can be heated in the atmosphere by powerful microwaves beamed from earth (like HAARP and the dozen or so similar installations like it around the globe). Other metals conduct or reflect communication signals, useful for such activities as communicating with deeply submerged submarines. Some metals conduct energy and can be used as weapons. Problem is, they're also toxic to the biosphere. Sure, they're also naturally occurring, but not in the quantities that are floating down to the surface.

       The number of planes doing this is irrelevant. The size of a single chemtrail is too big and weighs too much to be put there by a single plane. Are you suggesting that several planes are flying in lines dupming their chemicals in sequence, one plane picking up where the previous left off? Why? To make them look like contrails?

She even mentions that all the materials she was concerned about were normal purchases used for normal (read: non-chemtrail) applications. She brings forth no evidence what-so-ever aside from her testimony (which isn't first-hand btw).

       You seem very sure of that. Care to share the source of your claim (and don't just link me to what in the world are they spraying) – I mean a verified sample taken directly from an alleged chemtrail (not just a rain sample taken 10 miles away). If you can produce a lab report which supports any of your claims you will make Internet history.

       Presence of metals where? Barium and aluminium occur naturally in the environment. Barium is released by fossil fuel power stations, and aluminium during the smelting process. Taking a sample at ground level and claiming it came from a chemtrail is absurd.

       I remember when the
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/feb/22/usnews.theobserver">
        Pentagon admitted that global warming is the greatest threat to civilization
       </a>
       . They squeezed the announcement between Bush's repeated lies that WMD had been found in Iraq and another terror alert that turned out to be a figment of someone's imagination. In other words, the news flew under the radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pentagon recognized the threat and I thought "great, now maybe we can get some real action. The only organization in the world that can address the threat in any sort of systematic and direct way is the U.S. military." I was really heartened because I have followed this issue for decades and know that our survival as a civilization depends on fixing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, be careful what you wish for, because the Pentagon, in its infinite, twisted wisdom, decided that the best solution was to blanket the sky and reflect back sunlight so the planet wouldn't warm as much, perhaps averting the worst predictions for climate change. In other words, to someone who only has a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Of course, the news wasn't announced, but lo and behold all sorts of patents were issued for geo-engineering and the Pentagon elicited contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You go ahead and keep sniping about lab results. Tell people you won't believe it until one of those planes spraying that shit lands in your backyard. I guarantee you, by then it'll be too late.

       On your first link I have to protest about you describing it as peer-reviewed scientific evidence – its geoengineeringwatch.com, which is hardly neutral on the subject. Having said that, I'm not denying that geo-engineering takes place. The official line is that scientists and politicians have agreed not to do it, but I expect there are numerous secret programs going on to militarise the weather, as there have been since the Vietnam war. But that does not account for the long white trails criss-crossing the skies which I am told to "look up" at and to accept, without any further evidence, that they are artificial clouds of chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second link is the recent interview with Kristin Meghan. KM blew the whistle on chemicals coming onto her base which she couldn't account a need for. She also found inexplicable levels of environmental chemical contamination. She rattled too many cages when she asked questions. She does not claim these chemicals were part of a chemtrail program. In fact, in her first ever interview, she said that she first became aware of chemtrails through watching
       <strong>
        <em>
         What in the World Are They Spraying
        </em>
       </strong>
       – in other words, she doesn't know anything that anybody else could have found out simply by going to youtube. She has recently started distancing herself from talk of 'chemtrails', insisting she is only here to talk about geo-engineering.

       Geoengineering has solid science behind it, is talked about by government and has been performed for many reasons in the past. Trying to deny it at this point is simply being ignorant. Trying

       If a contrail is water vapor and clouds are water vapor, and clouds linger for hours, why couldn't contrails linger for hours?  I don't deny chemtrails being real and believe geo engineering is going on but I still don't know if your claim provides a tell tale sign of true chemtrails.

       Because it is a comparatively small amount of vapor. It dissipates within minutes. The thickness of chemtrails compared to regular clouds is like tissue paper compared to fluffy pancakes. The chemtrails are
       <em>
        engineered
       </em>
       to spread out quickly and dissipate. A cloud is not engineered, see what I mean?

       Thanks for the reply.  I don't want to commit an hour to the video at the moment but I will get to it.  I understand what chem trails are and believe that there is geo engineering going on.  But my question is, how can you tell the difference between the two because jets leave contrails everyday.  Is there a reference point in the video which speaks to that query?

       My understanding is that a contrail will dissipate within a few hours. The contrail shouldn't spread outward, it slowly shrinks down in side. It will always remain in fairly the same shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemtrails will linger for 9+ hours (sometimes lasting all day and into the night) and they "spread out" and grow, which creates fog and long tube like cloud formations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a very general picture I found:

       The picture of the trails looks like they are at different altitudes, perhaps they behave differently.  But I'm with ya.  If there is a time laps video showing a chem trail turning into a cloud formation that would be pretty good evidence.

       No. I mean the handfull of planes, artillery,  and rockets that they hit rain soaked clouds with to either cause them to dump the rain or postpone it. Not quite the same as chemtrails.

       So they plan to attack the superbowl with a drought?  I don't mean to be a smart ass here.  Maybe chemtrails are real, maybe not.  I keep an open mind about everything.  But one thing is certain, chemtrails cannot provided a direct assault on a football stadium.  When discussing something as controversial as chemtrails, words and meanings should be very clear.

       I can't say anything about the validity of OPs assertion other than it sounds unlikely. I just left a link to some research ...

       Believe me, I have done plenty of research into it.  But like all of the conspiracies that I have researched, I never commit to an absolute.  I have strong opinions about whether something happened or didn't, but I will never state one as a fact until it is.  ex.  I believe that the Bush family was involved in the JFK assassination, but until it's a fact, I will entertain all possibilities.  Same with chemtrails.  My point was that if OP wants to be taken seriously and have a serious discussion about chemtrails, he needs to understand what they are, how they work and most of all, he needs to stay away from posting sensational headlines.

       Totally agree. I check these posts because occasionally they offer some good info. I'm like you in that I don't take something as "fact" until it's a fact, but I think there comes a point when there's a preponderance of evidence and it's safe to assume it's true.

       So how does that support the claim that chemtrails contain inorganic substances such as aluminium oxide, strontium, and barium?

       The chemical alter weather patterns and block sunlight from reaching the surface. You can create droughts, floods, and everything in between.
