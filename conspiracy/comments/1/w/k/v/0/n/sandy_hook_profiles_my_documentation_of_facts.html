       I do not, I'm just an interested citizen. By that I mean, I have a job, family, etc so this is just an interest in the pursuit of truth, kind of a strange hobby of mine.

       All of them. Each minor child victim has parents who are now actively engaged in the issue of gun control legislation. Some not from a mere Google search, but it is all there. There are a few kids where it is only one parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is a coincidence, it is ALSO fascinating that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       That this event would call ALL the families to such swift and certain action so quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter which way you look at it, the families' responses- jumping in to legislation, speaking at meetings and with lobbyists, teaming up with congressman, starting their own non-profits after leaving their other jobs-  it is noteworthy.  Either it was planned, or in one fell swoop, all of the mourning families felt called to very engaged action.

       That's just the normal compression caused by a telephoto lens. Things that are far apart look like they're close together.

       It looks to me like they are walking around a corner. I have terrible depth perception and know not much about technology and film, but to me it just looks like they're coming out from around a corner, walking around the corner of a building. ?  Can you explain further.

       Depth perception wouldn't be relevant in a video like this since a longer mm lens compresses objects to seem close anyways

       Starting at 48seconds, there are 4 (I think) layers.....The actors (the crying lady and the guy holding her being one layer), the guy walking away from the camera, the guy facing the camera in blue, and all the other people.  The crying lady and the guy look REALLY staged.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Also notice, the camera doesn't start panning until JUST as the consoling guy in blue and his crying friend are walking off of shot.

       Oh thank you, thank you!
      </p>

       There are a few things about this story that struck a personal chord, and as someone incessantly seeking the truth, I continue to do so.  I am not a "conspiracy nut"- as in I dont assume everything I hear has a spin, or is fabricated.
       <em>
        However
       </em>
       , by the same token, I do not believe everything I hear blindly either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think having a central place (at least for me) to put my ideas and information is crucial to getting closer to what is going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a family member recently call me "weird" for being interested in this....Wondering why I "care so much", things along those lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is sad that looking for the truth has to be done covertly, while blindly accepting statements without supporting evidence is A-ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to keep looking, and check back here for more info.... I'm going to find some other coincidences!

       So you are clearly dismissing evidence that is being presented because you don't like the person?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds a lot like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       in here. Glad to see this subreddit would rather tell shill then look at what is being presented.

       Also, just because someone provides proof to your beliefs does not make them a shill.

       I'm not dismissing any evidence. I'm pointing out that this guy and one or two others always show up asap on a few select topics, and do their best to derail threads. The evidence he pointed out is legitimate, but the reason for it is still derailment nonetheless.

       It's like 9/11 threads where shills will point out flaws in particular (mostly irrelevant) claims by 9/11 truthers, while ignoring more obvious problems with the official story.

       However, everyone ignores his points, pretends it wasn't made and just calls them a shill. It's just as misleading as real shills are by blatantly ignoring facts and pushing this subreddits own agenda.

       Occam's Razor? She homeschooled her kid because he wasn't one of the kids that was "supposed" to be there that day. She got her kid to feel anxious and agree to be home- what kid doesn't want that. My son is impressionable that way- and she just, kept him home. End of story. Her son was not supposed to be there, and so she kept him home. When people asked her about it, she came up with this "warm touchy feely" story about how her son "sensed" something and intuitively refused to go to school.

       Are all of the houses in that area as far off on tax value vs appraised?  I'm familiar with tax vs appraised value, but haven't seen discount gaps at that level, granted it may be an east cost thing, but it would be interesting to see if these families were getting a "discount" on their property taxes.

       I don't live very far from Newtown (Sandy Hook) and can tell you that so many homes with the same sale date for 0.00 is not typical. It makes no sense. I looked up other streets, random ones, with NO victims' families living there, and sale dates differ, sale prices are reasonably what you would expect, and aside from the occasional ownership transfer from parents to child for example which would indicate a $0 purchase, nothing that looked like the victims' families...... also of note:
      </p>
      <p>
       the Town of Newtown, the State of CT and the Iroquois Gas Co Inc purchased "transferred" property into their names on 12/25/09 for $0 as well.   This went on all over town.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may be a legitimate reason for this, so I am not coming up with some random reason to fit a hypothesis, just noting that it sticks out as another anomaly.

       And in terms of assessed vs appraised, what would cause a value discrepancy of $200k+ ie the property owned by the Gays.
      </p>

       Besides the reduced property takes to be paid by the home owner, what else would this signal?

       Oh that part- yes I see that often on our assessor's database and I do not know enough about real estate to know what it means exactly, but I can tell you that
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       IS common. I'm not sure why. What is NOT common is all the prop transfers that occurred all over town on 12/25/09 in the zero dollar amount.

       Yeah, the transfer date and the $0 price tag are the big picture, the value assessments are less important.

       Absolutely nothing.  Huge discrepancies in appraised vs assessed are VERY common.  If you want to get weird about it, as a homeowner you can appeal an assessment when they try to base your assessed value on recent sales nearby.  That's kind of common in affluent areas.

       I'm familiar with moderate discrepancies. +/- 10% and challenging an assessed value. And I have seen large ones, but didn't know if these home were out of the ordinary in that neighborhood or pretty standard in the east.

       This is extraordinary on the surface. I'm going to forward this to a real estate friend of mine to see if he has any insight into this. The dates all being the same is beyond coincidence in my book.

Life would feel easier, safer.  I had a look of the inside for a while, and I know that isn't the case. THAT is why I do this. The facts are there for you to take, too.  All I'm doing is using public records.)

       ...No. Gah this is frustrating/annoying.  What I can say is that I never thought I'd be posting to this sub, I thought all "you people" were nuts or something. But I can say that due to a job a had for a while I was firsthand witness to the way good people are urged to do things to put a spin on something, and then the way it is reported differently in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to say a lot on this except that if I didn't have some of the info that I have now, I would have never been driven to do this. This is my free time and I'm digging for facts on a national tragedy that has speculation surrounding it?  I have friends, a family, hobbies. But this is important, and suffice to say that NONE of us here are wasting our time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can't do it alone.  I wish I could tell you more.

       I was thinking that too- of course there are all different explanations, short of calling the assessors office and asking for someone to explain it. Which I may do, but it is such sensitive territory I have to operate with some 'savoir faire' here.

       Not sure what that means?

      <p>
       Edit: I was just taking notice of the fact that public records shows that one of the victim's mothers has an alias and that one of the two last names she uses is Lafferty. (Which happens to be the maiden name of the principal) Which is no crime. However, the obituary lists the victim's aunt as having the same name as the mother's AKA. So, it could be a mix up, an error in the obit, a woman who uses her sister's identity, or faulty event planning.

       Again, as I continue to reiterate, I'm merely pointing out things that stick out
       <em>
        to me
       </em>
       ; I'm not pointing fingers, placing blame, or even speculating as to what is really going on here. I am smart enough to admit that 1.I have no clue, and 2. Something is amiss based upon the totality of the circumstances IN MY OPINION.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not spout things off to people who don't want to hear it, I generally keep these thoughts to myself, and I enjoy thinking methodically and rationally to achieve a truthful conclusion. This situation seems to merit a second look, and so that is what I am giving it.

       I agree, a lot of this stuff is. But if I fact check it and find it to be true based on the info available, I figure ill share it. Anything interesting, unusual, coincidental, surprising, blatantly a lie, etc. If it catches my attention, I make note. Doesn't mean it is "something", but I'd hate to come across something one day and wish I'd kept a record of my findings.

       I needed to hear that! I know how it appears, but as someone who worked for the government for ten years, I was witness to the myriad ways the powers that be do things, usually even the Guys at The Top are just the puppets on the string. I've seen names changed, hidden, files buried, destroyed, ignored and altered...all I'm the name of getting more money for the budget out of the legislature.

       Wars dont actually happen, because that would take like THOUSANDS of people all working together... someone would talk! There would be whistleblowers! Hungry journalists would be all over that shit! Heck Bill Clinton couldn't even get away with a blow job but you think THOUSANDS of people could keep their mouth shut about a conspiracy as big as a war? &lt;/sheeple&gt;

       Right! Can you believe the members of r/conspiracy, they think they are so important that there would be an entire subreddit (or more) dedicated to trolling them. That would take thousands of people (or at least thousands of different sock accounts) and I see NO evidence of that.

       This is awesome. Great work. I'm guessing that your post will either hit the front page and hover for a day, or get downvoted to obscurity.

       In a perfect
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       world we would have a tab next to "hot" "new" "rising" etc, labeled "fact finding" or something. The downvote feature could be removed from the comments section. If something posted is conjecture, it is deleted. Only verifiable facts can be posted.

       I'm glad to see that your post hasn't been brigaded yet. There was a Sandy Hook post last week that was brigaded by at least 3 different subs and the OP of the post was shadowbanned from all of reddit!
Keep up the good work, I'm adding it to my growing list of incredible anomalies. Thanks again!

       A town that keeps coming up as having had different family members living there at one point or another is Pawling NY.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had never heard of it, but I expected it to be large, due to its reappearance as a town where several people connected to the event lived.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the 2010 census, 8,463 people lived there at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone known anything about Pawling NY and why it coincidentally came up so many times?

       hahaha Fair enough! I have to take a look again, this is a LOT for ONE person to do, and I jotted it down but am not sure. That's why I'm starting these threads, so that then when I get more connections I can post it. When I find the other info on it I will put it up here. I know it was more than 3, though, that had connections there. Enough that it was noteworthy - to me. And remember, I am NOT supposing anything. Just making observations.

       Thanks! I can't imagine posting without
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       form of reference, citation, proof or at least supporting information.  I know that it seems oxymoronic at times to cite the internet AGAINST another internet source- but all we can do sometimes is fight fire with fire because it is all we have got.  Which is why, I look to state records that are public, ct.gov, and Town Assessor's sites. I go to websites for corporations and seek bios listed there, I don't base it off of other forums. I try to get to the source. Please keep visiting, investigating is both a hobby and a profession for me, I am fortunate. This topic is both emotionally gripping as well as frustrating, so I love the challenge.

       Thanks so much. It feels important, ya know?  There are so many intangible mysteries out there, things I may never know in this lifetime, that seeking the truth on a more tangible one, albeit a lofty pursuit, feels worth the effort. I'm just glad someone is reading any of this and not saying "Oh here is another nut!"

       Most of the victims' families- that I can find anything about- had just moved to Newtown within a few years of the event. Not many were long time townies, and not many have stuck around. I'd love to run a time line of the family names, showing when they moved in, and when they left town.
      </p>

       A nice chart would show a lot.  Data, facts, numbers people.  It's the way to the truth.

       I would double check these numbers, cuz I already see a mistake. Dylan Hockley hadn't been here two years.  The other thing that strikes an off chord with Noah and the official story is he had severe autism. As well did Emilie, Josephine, Jesse and Olivia. Some have theorized that Sandy Hook was operating as a Special Ed center with only kindergartners. Not a K-4 as the official story states. Plus where are all the 3 rd and 4th graders who could verbalize and explain what happened on that day much more articulately. They always interview the young ones.

       Some of that I haven't looked into myself, so I can't speak to it yet. But certainly the "foreknowledge of the event" raises so many questions. How many websites malfunctioned? Are we to believe in illogical coincidence over veritable proof? That part baffles my mind. It was not even well coordinated.  Donation sites going up BEFORE the event?  I'm perplexed at how more people higher up aren't up in arms.

       So him presenting proof to OP (who said the majority didn't live there long) is trolling? So even though there is clearly proof showing he researched and provided information we'll call him a troll since you don't like his post?

       Have you delved into the case of Veronique's brother taking control of Noah Pozner's charity fund and the lawsuit that's been filed between the two because of it? Nothing like a bunch of money coming between family.

       Supposed scammers set up fund in Noah's name, no proof of any wrong doing but just another angle that the families are mostly worried about the almighty dollar.

       Here's one that you can ask any infantryman in the Armed Forces:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible for a severely autistic kid, scared of loud noises such as the 2-stroke engine on a leafblower who weighs less than 140lbs to don a considerable amount (weight-wise) of body armor, tactical gear, FOUR guns, and ammunition to then break into a school, jump through the broken window, go on to achieve an INVERTED kill-to-injure ratio in an incredibly short time while expending enough ammo to ENSURE that almost ALL of the victims would die (3-14 bullet wounds EACH??)
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a professional raid, done by a team of trained killers. See "Port Arthur Massacre."
      </p>
      <p>
       The late Joe Viallis wrote a piece on Port Arthur that shows why an "op" like SH simply CANNOT succeed without incredibly well-trained and disciplined gunmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Port Arthur is what was responsible for taking guns out of Australian/New Zealand citizens' hands forever...FYI.

       Definitely echoes of Port Arthur - I was thinking that from day one, too.

       How weird was that story about the group of "nuns" on the day of SH?  Funny how we haven't heard anything about that since...

       Could be true. I have NO clue as to the WHY behind it. I don't pretend to be knowledgeable enough. I do know though from my time working for the government, I saw HUGE efforts to cover small things in "the name of doing good" with all of these other agendas working, and it was just sickening how good people would so easily keep quiet and do things that seemed out of character for money, prestige, trust from superiors, etc.

       This seems to be the most commonly asked question by skeptics when someone challenges the official story.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This statement is highly contradictory. The fact is, it is all about gun control. Whether it's an inside job or not, the change that the government is proposing because of this incident is restricting gun ownership, period. Just listen to the Presidents SOTU where he used Sandy Hook as an example of why he's going to act unilaterally in signing new gun laws. With or without the  Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as there being better way to make American's acquiesce and give up there guns, there's no better way then to quilt them into it. "But it's for the children!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you give an example of what would work better?

       It may even be that it is not the government doing this, it may be a smaller sect of people with their own agenda. The governments involvement may just be limited to the coverup.

       Why would your friends be any more credible than a random blog?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive gotten to the point where im convinced everything that the mainstream media is covering is either an outright lie, or is a fluff piece meant to distract you from the real news.
      </p>
      <p>
       To demonstrate my point, ask the next three people you talk to what their opinion about Casey Anthony and then ask them their opinion about the LIBOR scandal.

       Luckily I don't like the mainstream media either. I don't follow the main media sources although I have family/friends in the industry the majority of what they cover is not what is on MSNBC, CNN, etc. I form my own opinions through my own sources, what I hear from friends of friends (some cover big things), etc. I've photographed politicians and know how the events work/are controlled to present themselves in a good light. (I'm in Illinois so gotta love the corrupt Chicago politicians although the central/smaller town politicians are much better)
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I don't follow the coverage of major trials on the 24/7 networks like George Zimmerman and Casey Anthony. It's purely for viewers, not news.

       Great stuff. If you haven't come across Let's Roll Forums, there is a lot of material there about Sandy Hook

       Because thread topics stay visible for weeks/months, you get a lot more detail than is possible on reddit (where posts slide off the front page, and are "lost" forever after a couple of days).

       Harvard Journalism Professor Andrea McCarren told a tall tale about meeting Sandy Hook school librarian Sally Cox walking down the street and supposedly Sally Cox told her that the shooters mom was a kindergarten teacher at Sandy Hook. This "fact" was later changed, and it was dismissed as just an internet rumor (that was started when Andrea McCarren decided to LIE)

       This dumbass woman, despite knowing her son was crazy, left her gun unlocked at her house.  Her son shot her and then went to the school and murdered a bunch of little kids.  My source for this is reality and the realization that thinking anything other than this is fucking retarded.

       Just start looking at this piece by piece instead of as a whole. You may be right with what you believe, but there are questions that deserve a second look. Do you have one single question about the event? If someone could answer one question for you about this event, what would you ask. Try to take this seriously, I'm assuming that you will write back with something witty, but I'm really interested to know if you've had a chance to look over the whole thing, and if so, if you have any questions at all.

       I've just noticed that people will cling to their comfy beliefies and the warm feelies that the security of that brings them. At one point in time, I was one of those people. I didn't even realize it. I thought I was aware, educated. I thought I "got it".  Now, I think I get it because I know that I don't get it. ha ha

       Being able to say, Wow, there are a lot of things at work here, and a lot going on that I can't say for sure about, and I'm not privy to a lot of facts about x,y,z.... takes strength. It takes me stepping back and finding a comfortable place within the unknown.  My ignorance was bliss, yet my awareness now is empowering.

       I have a million doubts that the government, who apparently is all powerful and can do whatever they want, would fake the murder of children to force congress to vote on some gun control law that didn't even pass.

       Thanks for answering. And to continue down the same path, if you don't mind, what is it that convinced you that it was just Adam Lanza acting alone? I'm honestly not putting you on blast, just wondering if you've considered that he may have been a patsy, and if you had considered it, what swayed you that he wasn't.

       You're asking me why I think that fire is hot.  I could explain the radiation of heat and nerve cells sending messages to my brain and why there's pain and blah blah but that is just a waste of time.  Fire is hot beacuse when I put my hand up to it I feel heat.

       Oh thank you, thank you!

       There are a few things about this story that struck a personal chord, and as someone incessantly seeking the truth, I continue to do so.  I am not a "conspiracy nut"- as in I dont assume everything I hear has a spin, or is fabricated.
       <em>
        However
       </em>
       , by the same token, I do not believe everything I hear blindly either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think having a central place (at least for me) to put my ideas and information is crucial to getting closer to what is going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a family member recently call me "weird" for being interested in this....Wondering why I "care so much", things along those lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is sad that looking for the truth has to be done covertly, while blindly accepting statements without supporting evidence is A-ok.

       Just start looking at this piece by piece instead of as a whole. You may be right with what you believe, but there are questions that deserve a second look. Do you have one single question about the event? If someone could answer one question for you about this event, what would you ask. Try to take this seriously, I'm assuming that you will write back with something witty, but I'm really interested to know if you've had a chance to look over the whole thing, and if so, if you have any questions at all.

       Some of that I haven't looked into myself, so I can't speak to it yet. But certainly the "foreknowledge of the event" raises so many questions. How many websites malfunctioned? Are we to believe in illogical coincidence over veritable proof? That part baffles my mind. It was not even well coordinated.  Donation sites going up BEFORE the event?  I'm perplexed at how more people higher up aren't up in arms.

       Yeah, the transfer date and the $0 price tag are the big picture, the value assessments are less important.

       The name on the deed is who purchased it, with the date 12/25/09, so calling around would do nothing really. The name on the title is the name listed on the assessors site.

       Have you delved into the case of Veronique's brother taking control of Noah Pozner's charity fund and the lawsuit that's been filed between the two because of it? Nothing like a bunch of money coming between family.

       Supposed scammers set up fund in Noah's name, no proof of any wrong doing but just another angle that the families are mostly worried about the almighty dollar.

       It looks to me like they are walking around a corner. I have terrible depth perception and know not much about technology and film, but to me it just looks like they're coming out from around a corner, walking around the corner of a building. ?  Can you explain further.

       ...No. Gah this is frustrating/annoying.  What I can say is that I never thought I'd be posting to this sub, I thought all "you people" were nuts or something. But I can say that due to a job a had for a while I was firsthand witness to the way good people are urged to do things to put a spin on something, and then the way it is reported differently in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to say a lot on this except that if I didn't have some of the info that I have now, I would have never been driven to do this. This is my free time and I'm digging for facts on a national tragedy that has speculation surrounding it?  I have friends, a family, hobbies. But this is important, and suffice to say that NONE of us here are wasting our time.

       But I can't do it alone.  I wish I could tell you more.
