    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       I am a 23 year old from Houston, TX, and one day last year I was pulled over by a police officer and proceeded to have one of the strangest encounters I have ever heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its late at night, very late, and I am returning home from a friend's house when I pass a patrol car lying in wait near my neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is West University, an upscale "city" within Houston, and it is a local cop.  Lights flash in my rear-view.  "Damn."  But I haven't been doing anything wrong, and from my experience I know that cops will often pull over young looking people to try to bust them for drugs or being drunk.  Fine, let them look.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims my license plate light is out, and returns to his car with my insurance and info, presumably runs it and comes walking back to my window.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well everything is in order, so I decided to only give you a warning."
      </p>
      <p>
       How gracious.  Fine, everything up to this point is inconvenient but typical.  Until the thing he says next:
      </p>
      <p>
       "If you could just look this way, please."
      </p>
      <p>
       I turn towards him, and he is aiming something at me.  It looks like a bulky cell phone, with a short antennae that is emitting a red, laser-like light, that is shifting back and forth in rows like a bar code scanner.
      </p>
      <p>
       I immediately shield my face and ask "What is that, what are you doing?"
      </p>
      <p>
       He instantaneously gets furious.  I won't transcribe every word, but here's the gist:
      </p>
      <p>
       He acts like I am being ridiculous for trying to hide my face.  I tell him, "I've been pulled over before, and this has never happened, don't try to act like this is normal.  We both know this is not normal."
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims it is just a camera.  When I ask about the not-a-camera-red-laser-shit he says its for night vision.  "No its not,"  I tell him, "I work in film, I know what night vision looks like, and it doesn't look like that."
      </p>
      <p>
       He tries to convince me that its a new thing they are doing, taking photos to stop people from claiming that they never received a ticket.  I point out that this makes no sense.  No one has EVER gotten out of a ticket by saying "Well you don't have photographic proof it was me, so I don't have to pay!"  He was claiming to solve a problem that logically cannot exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic is not his strong suit, he begins to yell at me.  "ARE YOU SAYING THAT IF SOMEONE CAME OVER HERE AND STARTED TAKING PICTURES OF YOU, YOU WOULD WANT ME TO ARREST THEM?  DO YOU THINK ITS ILLEGAL TO TAKE A PICTURE OF SOMEONE?" (Seriously, he actually said this.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I calmly point out that that is not at all what I am saying.  I am, however, refusing to allow him to take my photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You can either let me take this photo, or you can go to jail."
      </p>
      <p>
       Bullshit.  An empty threat.  I know a lot of people would have believed him, but I have a problem with authority and refuse to let police officers' fear tactics cloud my thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Every time I have gotten a ticket, I have signed something confirming I received it," I say, "I would be happy to sign something now."
      </p>
      <p>
       He mutters something under his breath, takes a picture of the side of my head, and LITERALLY throws the ticket into my car, sulking off back to his patrol vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I tell this story is manifold:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I want to know if anyone else has had an experience like this.
       </li>
       <li>
        I want to warn people that the police state is become more intense, and the only way they will succeed is if normal people simply give in.  By remaining calm and politely refusing, their tactics cannot continue their slow perversion.
       </li>
       <li>
        I want to illustrate the method by which the federal gov't pushes its agenda on local municipalities:  My local police force was NOT thinking "Man, all these people are getting out of tickets because we aren't taking pictures of them.  We better get some cameras."  They were offered this technology, and their budget is dependent on whether or not they would adopt it.  THEN they were given the "reason" that they would tell citizens it was adopted.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       When the excuses they give for violating privacy/enacting totalitarian measure make no sense, we must ask ourselves, "What is the REAL reason?"

       Sounds like it was some sort of scanner to help build a profile to help facial recognition software read faces.

       I remember working on a movie set at night when a guy came in with a green laser on a tripod that mapped the whole environment so they could insert the special affects.

       the military-intelligence corporations/agencies developed a lot of software/technology that was used in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan which most Americans do not know about--this technology is now being turned inward on Americans...it sounds like some kind of facial recognition/scanning technology...obviously, they already have your state drivers license photo/info--but the more photos the better (especially if they are more recent). many officers now have scanners which read your license plate--the officer's computer will automatically make a sound for different infractions (a cash register sound for unpaid court fees, etc)...they can also press a button and pull up your circle of family/friends as well...
      </p>
      <p>
       According to page 140 of
       <em>
        Top Secret America
       </em>
       (2011):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then he persuaded the department to buy seventy military-grade infrared cameras to mount on the hoods of patrol cars. Now, instead of having to decide which license plate numbers to type into a computer console in the patrol car, an officer can simply drive around while an automatic license plate reader moves robotically from left to right, snapping digital images of one license plate after another and then automatically running them against the computer databases. That allowed Harvey to drive through a housing project, or park at the side of a busy street, and just wait for one of the sounds he'd programmed into the computer to signal a hit on a license number: a boing for lesser offenses, such as driving on a suspended license or traffic violation; a gunshot or siren for more serious alerts, including convicted gangster, sex offender, felon or murderer...
       </p>
       <p>
        When an officer got a hit, he could pull over the driver, and, instead of having to wait twenty minutes for someone back at the office to manually check records, he could use a handheld computer to instantly call up eight databases. He might find a mug shot or a driver's license photo, a Social Security number, the status of the driver's license, traffic violations, past charges, aliases, any outstanding warrants, and even pawn shop sales--basically everything but fines on overdue library books...
       </p>
       <p>
        ...These police sweeps, called Blue Crush by the Memphis Police Department, sometimes netted thousands of arrests, far too many for the local jail system to handle.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       : also noteworthy is that police departments, whether they be state or local, are creating their own databases...other agencies like DHS and the FBI, too...I would guess the FBI's is the largest--the book refers to it as being named "Guardian"...wonder if the local/state PD's get $$$ for every photo they chip in ???

       Hmm, I wasn't aware of that.  I know for sure they want to do a lot more with it though.  My friend told me the end goal was to have a front mounted camera on every cruiser that is turned on for the entire duration of the officers shift.  The camera would scan every license plate within its view, run each one through a database and see if the license plate comes up in connection with any crimes or warrants.  The idea then was that if they found a vehicle belonging to a wanted suspect they would then send in an unmarked police vehicle and wait for the suspect to go to the car and then bust him for whatever warrants he/she had out on them or arrest them for whatever crime they may have commited.  My friend was working on the database that would make this possible.

       Scanning with lasers for mapping purposes requires a tripod or stand. My brothers girlfriend works for a CSU in the NYPD and has complained at dinner enough about how finnicky and sensitive said devices can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly doubt a random patrol would have access to a handheld version for the purpose of mapping your face for biometric recognition, but I want to look at it from a pragmatic point of view, the funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand how well we are able to adapt technology for easier/superior/cheaper use, but she works for a fairly well funded portion of the NYPD and their tech seems archaic compared to this.

       You made the mistake that the police are interested in investigating crimes instead of committing them, or paying a snitch to initiate them.  The
       <em>
        "power"
       </em>
       goes out to evidence labs all the time leading to 100's of unsolved crimes, but since none of those crimes are terrorism, no funding.
CSI doesn't get the cool tech like on the TV show.
NCIS wouldn't be given any other tech but photoshop to cover things up.
MRAP'S and Traffic/Revenue Cameras get all the grant funding from the feds.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Developed by the private tech company In-Q-Tel, nicknamed the “Wizards of Langley,” the Picosecond Programmable Laser (PPL) is leaps and bounds ahead of the x-ray machines, millimeter wave scanners, and residue detectors the TSA currently uses in airports across the country.
        <strong>
         In contrast to the current models, which all require either direct contact or extremely close proximity to the subjects
        </strong>
        , this new device works:
       </p>
       <p>
        "by blasting its target with lasers which vibrate molecules that are then read by the machine that determine what substances a person has been exposed to. This could be Semtex explosives or the bacon and egg sandwich they had for breakfast that morning."

       Although the link you provided describes the device as "mobile," there's a reason I used bold on some of the words above. I don't know what the "current models" that require close proximity to the subjects look like or who has access to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the link describes the device as a mobile one, and it's not very big, it seems feasible to me that it could logistically be employed in an automobile- though there are still laws that would make that tricky for LEOs.

       Sounds as though the cop was basically taking a mug shot of you ... which hitherto the police only did if you were formally arrested and charged.

       I remember watching a documentary about a guy who was explaining living off the grid and he mentioned some type of RFID biometrics device that can has facial recognition, it can read fingerprints iris' and IDs. I can't find the documentary now, it doesn't seem to be on netflix anymore, but he said practically anyone could buy one if they had the cash. He mentions it's a variant of the devices that bouncers use at bars to check IDs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it was one of these biometric scanners things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to find the documentary now on other sites to find out what the name of the device was. No luck yet though unfortunately.

       I think the documentary you are referring to is called "Track Me If You Can". By Aton Edwards. It's streaming on Netflix now. Sorry I don't have a link, I'm on my phone.

       Ahh yes, that's it. For some reason I was thinking it was called Living off the Grid or something along those lines.

       Thank you, it was kind of driving me crazy looking for it.

       I'm going to have to watch it again in the morning when I wake up now that I know the name. I remember it being pretty interesting.

       I had an experience like this a few years ago but was pulled over for 'running a stop sign' that I don't even believe these officers saw. I was passing through a VA hospital to turn around and saw their SUV out of the corner of my eye in a secluded spot. Immediately pulled over. Was smoking weed at the time, had a little under an oz. friend ditched me and I took all the blaim. They handcuffed me and asked if I was under the influence. I told them I was not and even it I was they would not be able to tell by my eye or pupils because of a surgery I had while I was young. They proceeded to take me into the VA and put me in a closet like jail cell. This would have made sense if they would have arrested me. I was give a ticket to a court hearing. And left. I was told I woul be charged on a federal level, and my car would be impounded. They also asked if I had done meth because of a broken bong peice they found. This was just a joke to me because I only smoke pot due to my glaucoma. I'm not into drugs and never have been. I was shocked, horrified, mistreated, and felt like an animal while they where waiting to write out my court hearing. I had just under an oz on me so they should have written me a ticket and let me go. The following December all charges where dropped and I heard nothing of it again.

       Really man?  You don't think anyone has ever caused a stink by claiming that they weren't given a ticket/had no idea what the police were talking about?  Even if nobody has ever gotten off their ticket, I guarantee they've frustrated judges across the nation with their bullshit stories.  Honestly though, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that some lawyer managed to get out of his ticket just by wasting so much time that nobody wanted to deal with him.

       I believe you and I'm creeped out by the story...but don't go talking about "logic" when you haven't really thought it through.

       You try that defense and see where it gets you. And when the judge asks about the fact that you had to present a drivers license to prove your identity before ever getting the ticket, try going "Nu- uh!"
