        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m just wondering if there are any threads about this. The government has been controlling its citizens with fear for a long time. Fear of booze, Communism, drugs, terrorists, etc. In an age where we can hop on a computer and hear the other side of the story we might not be as fearful as we once were because they don&#39;t control what we exclusively hear anymore. So now it is leaked that the government hears everything you say and do. We&#39;re scared of ourselves. We don&#39;t want people seeing what porn we look up and we can be prosecuted for that episode of Breaking Bad we downloaded. The Government has dirt on everyone now and can basically arrest anyone they want legally. Leaking this information to the public creates fear and control. So it would benefit the Government to have everyone fear them and the only way that happens is if we know about it. So has this been discussed elsewhere? I&#39;m interested in seeing what other people think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but its exactly what we want and a lot of people are focusing on it instead of what the government is doing right now. It may be a cover for something much more sinister that happening right now. The problem is we focus on saviors instead of facing real problems happening in real time. We should be doing something about the abuses happening now, instead of complaining about what has already happened. Nobody wants to challenge governments authority to do what it has been doing. The government is suppose to be working for us not the other way around. So instead of going to the government to get remedy we should be going to the people themselves locally and educating people to stop supporting government though participation. If we stopped participating in government this whole problem would be over simply because they depend on us to keep the system going.</p>

<p>Also I kind of have a hard time believing that snodwen wasn&#39;t being monitored himself. It seems like he got away a little to easily IMHO and the fact that he haven&#39;t been picked up or killed covertly is another matter. I don&#39;t by the argument that the information that the journalist has is a insurance policy since its getting released little by little anyway. Maybe the government is that stupid who knows.</p>

<p>I hope he is legit, but im not completely convinced that he is. I Hope i am wrong.</p>

<p>I always go back to the idea of &quot;systems of control&quot; from the matrix which is a philosophical teaching tool as well. They allowed neo to exist as a way to maintain control of the system by allowing dissident to continue in a limited fashion so they could stamp it out and start over again. At the same time neo was able to break out of that pattern and make real change so its not hopeless. It just depends on the individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm...He is exposing what the government is doing right now.  Spying on everyone in the world, including major allied world leaders who are not happy.  Who are currently shaming the US in speeches, laws passed and business contracts broken.  This is very much hurting the US government and the intelligence apparatus, and creating a sustained conversation about the role of those entities in our lives.</p>

<p>There is a case in court right now of someone being accused using mass collection data as evidence.  He&#39;s currently challenging the constitutionality of it.  Now that we know it&#39;s happening we know what to look for in cases like this.  This will make it easier to fight, not harder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with your idea is that you don&#39;t understand that THIS IS what&#39;s going on behind the scenes. </p>

<p>You want to talk about whats going on behind the scenes? Go check out the TPP (trans pacific partnership). Search &quot;net neutrality.&quot; Go find out what/who ALEC is and what laws they&#39;ve been passing. </p>

<p>What Edward Snowden has done was not planned by our government. They don&#39;t want us to know what the NSA can do because they&#39;re afraid the American people will finally get off their asses and do something about the slow rise of tyranny. </p>

<p>You want to know what&#39;s going on behind closed doors? Check out American War Crimes and drones. </p>

<p>But whatever man. Hash out your conspiracy. Good luck trying to prove anybody that Snowden&#39;s secretly working for the Illuminati. </p>

<p>Hey, I know! Maybe Snowden is a lizard.</p>

<p>Lets hope not. I just don&#39;t know for sure, and im not stupid enough to make assumptions. Im staying open either way. I dont get bent out shape like you do when I hear information that runs counter to what I believe. Hence, I stay balanced, while others are easily swayed by emotion which leads to manipulation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not what I believe. These are facts based on what Snowden and everyone working in tandem with Snowden has been trying to convey.</p>

<p>What &quot;bends me out of shape&quot; is the idea that Snowden is carrying out some elaborate plan to &quot;fool us all&quot; into what...? I don&#39;t understand what could be bigger than learning that: not only the NSA is spying on us, local authorities have also been spying on us, in the same way as the NSA, without a warrant or judge. </p>

<p>Unless the U.S. Constitution was re-written, while we were sleeping, then this is technically illegal conduct. </p>

<p>If you want to start talking about UFO&#39;s and how the Snowden story is keeping us from talking about that coverup, then maybe we would be getting somewhere. Now that&#39;s some I could believe in. I believe ET&#39;s have been visiting and exist. Is it fact? NO. </p>

<p>What&#39;s going on with the NSA, and what Snowden has released (and still is), is not something that government wanted him to do. And honestly, if that is what you choose to believe, then the government will be <em>SO HAPPY</em> to know that <em>YOU THINK</em> that it was all the Government&#39;s own ideas. </p>

<p>Trust me, they like it when you think it was their idea. It reminds them of how powerful we think they are (not the other way around). </p>

<p>Oh, I KNOW, maybe Snowden is really dating Greenwald, and promised him he would make him lots of money with his book deal. Maybe it was all planned so that Greenwald and Snowden could live together happy forever, rolling in money. Laughing at all us stupid Americans for believing that our government is spying on us. </p>

<p>Maybe the NSA doesn&#39;t even exist. Maybe it&#39;s all a cover up for something BIGGER.</p>

<p>Lets hope not. I just don&#39;t know for sure, and im not stupid enough to make assumptions. Im staying open either way. I dont get bent out shape like you do when I hear information that runs counter to what I believe. Hence, I stay balanced, while others are easily swayed by emotion which leads to manipulation. </p>
