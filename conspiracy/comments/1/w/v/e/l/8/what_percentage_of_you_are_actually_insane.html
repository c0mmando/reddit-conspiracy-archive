    <div class="md"><p>That video laid out to you the official facts of 9/11, as represented to you by the media, the government, and the 9/11 commission. </p>

<p>Now, maybe you are different, but when those &quot;official facts&quot; are laid out to me, they provoke a lot of questions.</p>

<p>Questions like: why didn&#39;t the military respond to the attack? how did a hijacker who was called a &quot;bad pilot&quot; execute a technically difficult precision corkscrew descent perfectly, the first time he had ever flown that plane? how did a third building collapse in New York? who made the insider trades before 9/11? Why were those trading records destroyed? </p>

<p>The reason why there is a 9/11 conspiracy is that these questions have never been answered (and never will be officially answered).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The definition of insanity is trying repeated behaviors and expecting different results. </p>

<p>I would say out of 100 self-posts, probably 2 are from users with real, diagnosed delusions. There&#39;s about 50 really open-minded and curious souls here that routinely add to valuable and researched content. Then there&#39;s like thousands of very angry, immature and uneducated folks who think what they&#39;ve learned by watching YouTube or reading a blog (but never picking up a book or have a conversation about anything they&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot;) is fact, displaying a fanaticism that deeply terrifies me. Then there&#39;s the whole brigade of trolls who are very effective at making this place the laughing stock of reddit. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you to determine who falls into which category. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read through some comments. One of his posts. 
Why do the terms &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;harm&quot; always have to equate to whether an individual can die from the substance. I&#39;d feel a lot better about the recent weed hype if people were just honest about the true &quot;dangers&quot; and &quot;harms&quot; to marijuana, which no one ever seems to cite when comparing against alcohol. Memory loss, lethargy and apathy, IQ loss, potential for increased risk of mental illness such as schizophrenia if used during youth, etc. Yes, weed may not kill you, but it sure as hell can be harmful if misused, and one might argue that the prolonged, accumulative effects of casual marijuana use IS more harmful on an individual than prolonged, casual alcohol use. </p>

<p>Read this and wonder the irony. Why can&#39;t people be honest?! </p>

<p>Many tests were stopped at the hands of the government. It&#39;s also been used by the government to get multiple agendas across. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright folks, I&#39;m outnumbered, you win. </p>

<p>But next time you&#39;re ready to jump on the next conspiracy, think about going to the <em>next level.</em> You know, the level <em>beyond</em> the conspiracy. The one that goes full circle back to common sense, but with all the bullshit and bad stuff left on the string. That&#39;s typically where the truth lies. </p>

<p>...even mean? You made a stupid choice posting this in here being blatantly aggressive and confrontational. You weren&#39;t trying to &#39;pose a question&#39;, you were trying to ridicule and troll. Go post it somewhere else where you can be in an echo chamber circlejerk talking about how insane other people are that you don&#39;t agree with. </p>

<p>I have an immensely open mind actually, though. Maybe too open.</p>

<p>But the 9/11 truther shit - that shit&#39;s way over-the-top, and any sensible person knows. that. You immediately become &quot;insane&quot; status when you start believing shit like that. Let&#39;s just be honest about it.</p>

<p>I mean, Ok, decent questions on the surface. And I&#39;m not even a hardcore anti-truther who has stacks of facts in my back pocket right now. But I do know that what happened was a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>Do you also believe the Sandy Hook shooting didn&#39;t actually happen?</p>
