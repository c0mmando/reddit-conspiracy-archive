       All I see are Video artifacts, and resloution distortion every-time I see a "Reptilian" video. So, NO. I don't. Unless some seriously good HD quality verified non edited raw footage comes out, I won't even bother to think about it... I have a mate at work, who thinks David Icke is the fucking ducks nuts... I warn him to tread carefully..

       People who believe conspiracy theories mostly are acting out against authority (govt, scientists, corps, police, anyone in authority).  The actual subject matters a lot less than the opportunity to try to poke at authority.

       I have really come to respect the work of Michael Tsarion and Mark Passio on this subject. They have collated the bulk of materials from ancient sources into one cohesive theory.

       This. Needless to say, those in power aren't your everyday (/s) shape-shifting reptillian extra-terrestrials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather, they lack humanity and what some would call (metaphorically) a soul. The "shape-shifting" element could be interpreted as their practice of dualism perhaps, or portraying themselves as having good intentions when in fact they are self-serving and sociopathic, perhaps evil in nature.

       Fuck the science, I love both theories. Why? It makes all the legends that have persisted around the world far more interesting then the simple truth that we are all just a bunch of monkeys living on a spinning ball of fire in a cold and distant part of the universe.

       Real understanding of science inspires more wonder and imagination than anything else ever has or could. Reptiles and oceanic moons, although interesting, don't even hold a candle to the fantastic and
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       truths and mysteries of the cosmos as we know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts of the universe bring about understandings and questions alike that are so compelling and powerful that we can't even begin to reconcile them with our limited intuitions and imaginative scopes. What the shit is up with the double slit experiment?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, the universe is so much stranger than any of us that it eliminates any need to indulge in ideas that on the surface sound more interesting than what we know to be true. We don't need to play with fiction in order to be stimulated, because the cosmos reveals itself to be much more wonderful than anything we can imagine ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dreams are
       <em>
        out there
       </em>
       , and they blow the ones we create in our minds way out of the water.

       So basically you think that we should just chuck imagination and story telling out the window in favor of the slow progress of science?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks, but fuck no.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about the rest of you but my imagination is infinitely more vast and complex then the oft compartmentalized ideals of the scientific community. One of the many reasons I still hold to my belief in fringe theories like Reptilians or the Hollow Earth is to piss off closed minded scientists. Unfortunately far too many of them cling to their beliefs as tightly as the religious "nut jobs" they love to bash for having the audacity to have faith in something without quantifiable evidence of its existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised to believe that one should keep an open mind about all things and explore every possibility no matter how trivial or insane it might sound. Doing so is the very foundation of discovery, it is in many ways the very essence of who we are as a people. As such I have a hard time respecting anyone who dismisses any concept because they haven't been handed the proof necessary for them to put forth the rather mild effort of believing something may be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said earlier, I understand and appreciate what science has to offer and would even be willing to agree that there is a good measure of mystery and wonder on earth and in the universe beyond. However, it is extremely unlikely that I will live long enough to explore other planets, interact with alien races or do any of the fantastic things that I can do simply by closing my eyes and using the natural talents that life has given me.

       Imagination and story telling are great and should never be discarded. What seems to be underestimated is just how much imagination it takes to make the leaps and discoveries that have been accomplished. The double helix shape of DNA, for example, wasn't derived from some slow and boring process of data analysis. It was an insane idea that may have been crazy enough to be true, so they tested it and it was right. The slow progress you speak of is the necessary follow through, where we must prove or disprove our theories so that our understanding becomes incrementally elevated, we find ourselves seeing a little bit farther, and we can apply our imaginations to new mysteries.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say your imagination is more complex and vast than those of the scientific community, but I can assure you that you have never in your life come up with things more mind boggling and incredible than the things they have not only managed to imagined but also went on to prove. Again, the double slit experiment is completely WTF. The known universe is much bigger than you'd ever come up with on your own, because it's bigger than anyone can wrap their head around. Any scientist that is closed minded is not truly a scientist because science requires an imaginative and explorative way of thinking. The scientific communities adherence to experiment and provability is not closed mindedness, it is part of a methodology that brings us the most incredible things we've ever known.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissing unproven concepts is indeed not a respectable position. Science does not take such a position. It is as agnostic about the reptilians as it is about the tooth fairy, in that it cannot be disproved but in such an absence of evidence there is little reason to give it significant thought. If ever there were some uncovered evidence whose existence was best explained by reptilians, scientists would be all over it. Exploring insane and trivial ideas is the foundation of science (heliocentric solar system, anyone?) and is not the domain of non-scientific query.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to explore other planets and meet aliens to find things that beat the crap out of your imaginative mind. Reading about the double slit experiment, event horizons, subatomic particles, dark energy/matter, the multiverse theory, and/or many, many other things can throw your mind off balance and make you wonder in ways that nothing you come up with on your own ever could. These are things we know about
       <em>
        right now,
       </em>
       and like I said, they are revealed by a universe that is stranger than you or I. The real weirdness of the universe is much greater than our mind's ability to invent weirdness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The unfathomable despair of universal heat-death is greater than that of C'thulu or the works of Homer. The evolutionary origins of biodiversity is more elegant and interesting than any creation story. The mystery of how the fundamental laws mesh with each other is more complex and difficult to imagine than any of Moriarty's machinations. In short, nothing any human has ever fictionalized has been as grand as the truth. There is no need to entertain ourselves with the supernatural when the natural is as spectacular as it is. If you want a story, or philosophical insight, the super can be much more than adequate. But if what you want is to feel wonder and amazement, science is so far beyond our stories that it is practically the only game in town.

       While you certainly make a compelling argument the sad truth is that many people in my country and every other country simply lack the educational background to understand even the vaguest notions of what you are talking about. The inherent problem with boiling everything down to scientific theory is that much of the very wonder you claim exists is lost on the common man and as such it is up to the storyteller to bridge that divide and convey those concepts in a fashion that the every man can understand and appreciate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth, as you so elegantly put it, is often a jagged pill that far too many could not begin to swallow. Hence the need for the supernatural, the fictional and even the mythical. It is often only because of minds capable of understanding those concepts and translating them that our achievements continue in the fashion that they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim that I have never in my life come up with something as big as the known universe, and yet dreamers such as me create universes all the time (Star Trek, Star Wars, Firefly, the glory that is Anime come to mind). I do it all the time and by drawing on what is known or dismissed by science and adding the very flavors and distinctions that many scientists completely ignore we make the impossible into the plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, we often inspire scientists so that they in turn can continue to inspire us. We take that which those in the scientific community give little thought too and turn it into the dreams that will one day inspire science to find the answers that so many others have casually ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, You and I should go out drinking because I have no doubt in my mind that it would be awesome. A few pints of beer, maybe a nice bottle of whiskey and a lively discussion about the possibles of a Hollow Earth or a Reptilian planet existing somewhere in the vast expanse of the multiverse sounds like a good way to start things off.

       Well said! I really didn't expect us to meet so closely to the middle here. I agree that current education doesn't get people where they need to be to understand these things, but I have so much trouble convincing my self that they can't. People understand sports statistics, economic doctrines and fluctuations, and fictional histories of invented worlds (I happen to have been watching Star Trek as I  typed each of my comments here). None of these things are more difficult to learn about than science, I think people just haven't learned that it's interesting enough to put adequate energy in to. It makes me sad that the common person doesn't see it all, because I believe that they could. I agree that this is one of the reasons that story tellers are so important. Without Neil Degrasse Tyson, Douglas Adams, Gene Roddenberry, and many others, I would not have ever bothered to learn about the things that amaze me now. It's the rainbow connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you like Star Trek and appreciate the way scientists and artists play off of each other, I highly recommend watching "How William Shatner Changed the World." It was a History Channel special a long time ago that tells the stories of people who invented things we use every day, and got their ideas from the Trek universe. It's awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       And oh man, cheers to that idea. Drunkenly discussing crazy ideas is the noblest of pastimes. I think you and I would have some very interesting agreements and divergences to mess around with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just have to add that I wish I could be more often surprised so pleasantly by people like you. I did not think we agreed as much as we seem to, and it's great to hear somebody that at first seems to disagree on almost all fronts use a cool head and open mind in order to find the common ground. You use that brain of yours well.

       It reminds me a lot of Transmetropolitan, which if you're in to comics at all is a must read. Picture Hunter S. Thompson living in the 23rd century and you've pretty much got the idea. Major techno-drugs, conspiracy investigations, and hilarious vulgarity to be enjoyed.

       Most people didn't bother to watch the series or read the books, I never quite understood why. It has so many elements you find in stuff like Neuromancer, Shadowrun and The Matrix but yet it gets ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       It definitely needs a reboot, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the whole Reptilian thing, to be honest I fell in love with the concept when I read that old article from the 30's about the engineer who found his way into some lost underground city. The more I researched the idea the more I learned about myths and legends from across the globe that relate similar stories. I decided that Alien Lizard People was far less interesting then the idea that Reptilians were just an evolutionary offshoot of more intelligent dinosaur species like the raptors. Since we know turtles, crocodiles and other species survived the extinction event it stood to reason that some of the Raptors could survive as well and would have been smart enough to hide out in caves to help aide in that. I mean hell, even bears are smart enough to stick to caves in the winter right? (generally speaking)
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I thought about it the more it seemed plausible, at least from a story tellers perspective. Today we know that there were 4 (5?) different variations of human ancestors, and with all the stories of Naga and Dragons from the India/China region then why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Diseases, geological changes, mini ice ages and sinking continents are all a matter of historical record. For all we really know all the evidence of this is lying on the ocean floor or perhaps even hidden in some vast cavern system that we just haven't reached yet in the modern era. After all, we've planned to go underground in the event of a Nuclear Winter and in the terms of survival that isn't much different then a mini ice age.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are just enough hints throughout the world, just enough myth and legend to make me wonder if Raptors were much smarter then we ever realized. Smarter perhaps then Dolphins, and at least as smart as humans a few million years ago. If we can hide down there then they could have, especially if their population was decimated and humans were growing in numbers. While I agree it isn't high on the scale of possibility it does manage to linger on the edges of probability just enough for me to not completely dismiss it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I could have just spent too much time reading Jules Verne, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and ignoring my science teacher. That's possible too. Either way its a much better story then evil lizards from Alpha Draconis posing as world leaders.

       I believe that jesus is a symbol for something else, not to be taken literally. I believe the powerful people throughout history have also understood that. for instance, 'god's son' is really 'god's sun'. that is why god's sun is the light of the world, and of course he gives 'his life' so we may live. I do not believe the man jesus existed.

       I'm open to any possibility... Except for the one about him being the literal son of god.  Romans were very good with record keeping so there is a very strong possibility that he existed.  Conversely, the Catholic church has always been very good at PR.  Well, not lately, but historically speaking, so there is a chance that he may be made up.

       Draconian's are recorded in history by many civilizations dating back to the days of antiquity. 
 The Sumerians give accounts of these alien beings. The word Annunkai (reptilians/draconian's) means
      </p>
      <p>
       "those who from heaven to earth came"
      </p>
      <p>
       Heaven, being the stars above us.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, as far as shape shifting goes (which is how most people think of reptilians), I do not think that there are reptilians disguised as humans currently living on earth.
If one, such as myself, knows about certain occult rituals, you would know that there are ways once can appear to take on whatever physical form they do so desire. I think that that is the closest thing one could ever do to shape shift.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that our human brains do have reptilian parts to it.
Also, snakes have pineal glands, so that is interesting.

       It boils down to Glamour. 
Which is atheric (light from the astral realm).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our human shells are made of sub atomic particles, which reflect light.
You can undergo a process, or ritual, that can change how the sub atomic particles are perceived by individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the specifics of the ritual itself, I am not sure.
However, even if I did know, I would not share such things on the internet. No offense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the internet makes the world small, I am sure one could discover such things with many hours of expanded research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that if you haven't ever tried an occult ritual before, I would not advise undergoing this one.
It is some advanced shiz that any non initiate should not be involved in.

       Do you know the history of 'demons'? Before the church got their dirty hands on them, they were called daemons and were there to help people. There was a daemon for everything, from science to inner calm and how to deal with life. A lot of them were good willed, some were indifferent and a handful showed human traits such as anger and violence. However in the whole they could be summoned to gain knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the church came along and didn't like the idea of people learning, because those that have knowledge are not so easily ordered around, so daemons were called demons and [haha] demonised.
      </p>
      <p>
       I obviously can't say if these entities really existed but I just want to clarify that they were NOT what those who can't read further than their bibles  believe them to be.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Passing through the corridor I came upon an aging knight
       </p>
       <p>
        Who leaned against the wall in gnarly armor
       </p>
       <p>
        He was on his way to see the king
       </p>
       <p>
        Wilson
       </p>
       <p>
        Wilson
       </p>
       <p>
        Wilson
       </p>
       <p>
        He led me through the streets of Prussia talking
       </p>
       <p>
        As he tried to crush a bug that scurried underneath his bootheel
       </p>
       <p>
        He said there was a place where we should go
       </p>
       <p>
        So he lead me through the forest to the edge of a lagoon by which
       </p>
       <p>
        We wandered 'til we reached a bubbly spring
       </p>
       <p>
        The knight grew very quiet as we stood there
       </p>
       <p>
        Then he lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing
       </p>
       <p>
        chorus:
       </p>
       <p>
        He said I come from the land of darkness
       </p>
       <p>
        I said I come from the land of doom
       </p>
       <p>
        He said I come from the land of Gamehendge
       </p>
       <p>
        From the land of the big baboon
       </p>
       <p>
        But I'm never never going back there
       </p>
       <p>
        And I couldn't if I tried
       </p>
       <p>
        'Cause I come from the land of Lizards
       </p>
       <p>
        And the Lizards they have died
       </p>
       <p>
        And the Lizards they have died
       </p>
       <p>
        And the Lizards they have died
       </p>
       <p>
        And the Lizards they have died
       </p>
       <p>
        He told me that the Lizards were a race of people practically extinct
       </p>
       <p>
        From doing things smart people don't do
       </p>
       <p>
        He said that he was once a Lizard too
       </p>
       <p>
        His name was Rutherford the Brave and he was on a quest to save
       </p>
       <p>
        His people from the fate that lay before them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their clumsy end was perilously near
       </p>
       <p>
        The Lizards would be saved, he said, if they could be enlightened
       </p>
       <p>
        By the writings of the Helping Friendly Book
       </p>
       <p>
        In all of Prussia only one existed
       </p>
       <p>
        And Wilson had declared that any person who possessed it was a crook
       </p>
       <p>
        [chorus]
       </p>
       <p>
        The Helping Friendly Book, it seemed, possessed the ancient secrets
       </p>
       <p>
        Of eternal joy and never-ending splendor
       </p>
       <p>
        The trick was to surrender to the flow
       </p>
       <p>
        We walked along beneath the moon
       </p>
       <p>
        He lead us through the bush 'till soon
       </p>
       <p>
        We saw before our eyes a raging river
       </p>
       <p>
        He said that we could swim it if we tried
       </p>
       <p>
        And saying this the knight dove in forgetting that his suit of arms
       </p>
       <p>
        Would surely weigh him down and so he sunk
       </p>
       <p>
        And as his body disappeared before me
       </p>
       <p>
        I bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk
       </p>
       <p>
        [chorus]
       </p>
       <p>
        But Rutherford and Forbin weren't alone. And suddenly an unexpected movement caught his eye. On the far side of the river he saw a shaggy creature standing in the weeds who stared across at Forbin with an unrelenting gaze. A gigantic &gt; mass of muscles and claws. The hideous beast reared back and hurled himself in the water and swam toward the region where Rutherford lay. And in a flash, the beast was gone, underneath the surface to the frosty depths below while &gt; Forbin, bewildered, waited alone. The seconds dragged by in what seemed like hours till finally the colonel felt it all had been a dream. Defeated, he bowed his head then turned to go. Suddenly with a roar, the creature emerged &gt; before him and held the brave knight's body to the sky. And the creature laid the knight upon the shore. And the colonel fell beside his friend in prayer that he'd survive. And Rutherford, brave Rutherford was alive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Forbin and the unit monster were crouched over the soggy knight carefully removing his bulky helmet when the colonel heard a sound behind him. He turned around and came face to face with an enormous shaggy horse-like creature covered from head to tail with alternating blotches of brown and white. It was a two-toned multi-beast, and atop the multi-beast sat the most beautiful woman the colonel had ever seen. After fifty-two years of undaunted bachelorhood, the colonel felt a feeling rush over him as he had never felt before.

       and if anything, the lizards in gamehenge represent unenlightened people who get saved with the knowledge of the helping friendly book that was stolen by wilson and returned with help from rutherford/mockingbird/etc.  I can see how maybe wilson would represent some sort of controlling elite but the lizards are never presented as bad people, just lost.  I'd say the lizards more likely equate with "sheeple" in this song than shape-shifting reptilians.  Having their sacred knowledge stolen and horded by Wilson.  Phish doesn't suck but they practically do.  And Mike Gordon woulda been sucking a little girl in a barn if it wasn't for the Hell's Angels.

       <em>
        Phish's Mike Gordon Arrested
Bassist booked for child endangerment
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Phish bassist Mike Gordon, 38, was arrested Monday, August 11th, on charges of child endangerment after he was found with a nine-year-old girl in a secluded boathouse during a show by the Dead in Jones Beach, New York.
       </p>
       <p>
        The girl's father -- who, along with Gordon, was an invited guest backstage -- has been identified as a leader of a Hell's Angels chapter. Gordon is reported to have been held by venue security and members of the motorcycle club until police arrived, with WNBC adding that the Angels "were not gentle with the sensitive areas of the rock star's body."

       Agreed. I'd say it's possible, but so remotely implausible I wouldn't give it a second thought without compelling evidence to support it, which to my knowledge does not exist.
