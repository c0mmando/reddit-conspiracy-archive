    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t realize what you are posting. There is another explanation. If the earth is not revolving around the sun there is no parallax. You just believe it means that the stars are too far away. </p>

<p>Red shift is not certain. Read about Halton Arp. An astronomer who has quite convincingly shown red shift comes from associated magnetic fields. </p>

<p>Both of the reasons in the article are not proof enough. </p>

<p>Then ask yourself. If each light year is 10 trillion kilometers and they claim the Hubble can see objects 13 billion light years away, do you really believe a photon of light can travel 1,00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers?  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t know the answer, but read about Halton Arp.  </p>

<p>I certainly would find it odd that the design of the solar system was created in the Middle Ages and so far has been largely unaltered. We knew it was true 500 years before we even had a means to verify it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Arp originally proposed his theories in the 1960s; telescopes and astronomical instrumentation have advanced greatly since then: the Hubble Space Telescope was launched, multiple 8-10 meter telescopes (such as those at Keck Observatory) have become operational, and detectors such as CCDs are now more widely employed. These new telescopes and new instrumentation have been used to examine QSOs further. QSOs are now generally accepted to be very distant galaxies with high redshifts. Many imaging surveys, most notably the Hubble Deep Field, have found many high-redshift objects that are not QSOs but that appear to be normal galaxies like those found nearby.[8] The spectraof the high-redshift galaxies, as seen from X-ray to radio wavelengths, match the spectra of nearby galaxies (particularly galaxies with high levels of star formation activity but also galaxies with normal or extinguished star formation activity) when corrected for redshift effects.[9][10][11] As more recent experiments have expanded the amount of collected data by orders of magnitude, it has become increasingly simple to test Arp&#39;s postulates directly. A recent study stated that:</p>

<p>&quot;... the publicly available data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF QSO redshift survey to test the hypothesis that QSOs are ejected from active galaxies with periodic noncosmological redshifts. For two different intrinsic redshift models, [...] and find there is no evidence for a periodicity at the predicted frequency in log(1+z), or at any other frequency.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the kind of weasel word junk that drive me nuts.  It isn&#39;t &quot;generally accepted&quot; just because someone says it is.  </p>

<p>So once they get the data, they &quot;correct&quot; it and now it fits their models.  </p>

<p>I find it fascinating to read about the state of academia.  Interestingly, Arp wrote about it himself.</p>

<p>The use of the Doppler effect for light in astronomy depends on our knowledge that the spectra of stars are not continuous. They exhibit absorption lines at well defined frequencies that are correlated with the energies required to excite electrons in various elements from one level to another. The Doppler effect is recognizable in the fact that the absorption lines are not always at the frequencies that are obtained from the spectrum of a stationary light source. Since blue light has a higher frequency than red light, the spectral lines of an approaching astronomical light source exhibit a blueshift and those of a receding astronomical light source exhibit a redshift.</p>

<p>You are being very dishonest or generally dense by assuming they are &#39;correcting&#39; data to make things up.</p>

<p>Arp was wrong.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, you can&#39;t make a career torpedoing your fellow colleagues work, or waste your time repeating their work to confirm, which is a hallmark of the scientific method</p>

<p>Actually...every scientist does exactly this? So in the face of a planet full of scientific method you think a one-liner on reddit changes anything?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you watched Thunderbolts of the gods? Pretty interesting. </p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is the fact you seem to be entertaining a crackpot theory with no valid science behind it as something to talk about.</p>

<p>Your definition of crackpot = anyone who doesn&#39;t believe everything he hears or reads.</p>

<p>Are there any opinions that you have that you would be reluctant to share with your work colleagues or family?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t you should ask yourself how that happened.  Is it a coincidence that you believe exactly what everyone else does, or have you been conditioned to a set of norms just like everyone else?</p>

<p>We could probably talk for hours - I would like to be convinced and this particular issue is not particularly set in stone, so could probably be a fairly &quot;safe&quot; issue to discuss without devolving into a fight.</p>

<p>So, are their any opinions that you hold outside of the &quot;mainstream&quot;</p>

<p>No, my definition of crackpot is false pseudoscience. Yours seems to be questioning proven facts as if they make you smart.</p>

<p>Do you accept evolution, climate change?</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious how absurdly stupid you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many popular conspiracy theories that have no foundation in reality:</p>

<ul>
<li>that the World Trade Center towers were brought down by planted explosive charges</li>
<li>that human beings are causing the planet to become dangerously warmer</li>
<li>that the Sandy Hook shooting was staged</li>
<li>that any of the recent mass shootings in the US were staged</li>
<li>that the nobility of England routinely engages in group Satanism and child abuse</li>
<li>that the elite are not human</li>

<p>On the other hand, there are many real conspiracies that are almost totally ignored by the public, even the supposedly &quot;awake&quot; people in this subreddit. Ignored but real conspiracies include:</p>

<ul>
<li>that Israel knew about 9-11 before it happened, and had a hand in coordinating it</li>
<li>white genocide</li>
<li>the war against Christianity</li>
<li>deliberate use of porn by Jews to corrupt non-Jews</li>
<li>Jewish control of the media for the purpose of mind-control</li>
<li>the predominant role of blacks in violent crime</li>
<li>use of the television and professional sports as a control device to keep the general population docile</li>
<li>use of the fraudulent hypothesis of man-made global warming to rob and dominate the people of Western nations</li>
