       I kind of think Chemtrails are bullshit. Or rather, that every white line in the sky is a government sprayed chemtrail. I have no doubts that our government could or would do something like this, however I would think that they could figure a way out to make it not so visible.

       Cereal grains are not traditional components of Asian or Native American diets.  Rice doesn't contain gluten.  Many people, expecially obese Americans, have undiagnosed Celiac disease or gluten sensitivity caused by eating wheat and related grains.

       I'm asking: can you check whether it's true ? You can't. You have to trust it is. Skycentrism gives everyone an opportunity to check things on his own. You can copy 'official' explanations you don't even understand or start to think on your own. Again, you prove you can't read. Cheers.

       You don't realize what you are posting. There is another explanation. If the earth is not revolving around the sun there is no parallax. You just believe it means that the stars are too far away.

       Red shift is not certain. Read about Halton Arp. An astronomer who has quite convincingly shown red shift comes from associated magnetic fields.

       Both of the reasons in the article are not proof enough.

       Then ask yourself. If each light year is 10 trillion kilometers and they claim the Hubble can see objects 13 billion light years away, do you really believe a photon of light can travel 1,00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers?

       Don't know the answer, but read about Halton Arp.

       I certainly would find it odd that the design of the solar system was created in the Middle Ages and so far has been largely unaltered. We knew it was true 500 years before we even had a means to verify it.

       You don't find it odd that our moon has so perfectly synced its orbit that it's face never changes?  Even by a few miles?

       Arp originally proposed his theories in the 1960s; telescopes and astronomical instrumentation have advanced greatly since then: the Hubble Space Telescope was launched, multiple 8-10 meter telescopes (such as those at Keck Observatory) have become operational, and detectors such as CCDs are now more widely employed. These new telescopes and new instrumentation have been used to examine QSOs further. QSOs are now generally accepted to be very distant galaxies with high redshifts. Many imaging surveys, most notably the Hubble Deep Field, have found many high-redshift objects that are not QSOs but that appear to be normal galaxies like those found nearby.[8] The spectraof the high-redshift galaxies, as seen from X-ray to radio wavelengths, match the spectra of nearby galaxies (particularly galaxies with high levels of star formation activity but also galaxies with normal or extinguished star formation activity) when corrected for redshift effects.[9][10][11] As more recent experiments have expanded the amount of collected data by orders of magnitude, it has become increasingly simple to test Arp's postulates directly. A recent study stated that:
      </p>
      <p>
       "... the publicly available data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF QSO redshift survey to test the hypothesis that QSOs are ejected from active galaxies with periodic noncosmological redshifts. For two different intrinsic redshift models, [...] and find there is no evidence for a periodicity at the predicted frequency in log(1+z), or at any other frequency."

        The use of the Doppler effect for light in astronomy depends on our knowledge that the spectra of stars are not continuous. They exhibit absorption lines at well defined frequencies that are correlated with the energies required to excite electrons in various elements from one level to another. The Doppler effect is recognizable in the fact that the absorption lines are not always at the frequencies that are obtained from the spectrum of a stationary light source. Since blue light has a higher frequency than red light, the spectral lines of an approaching astronomical light source exhibit a blueshift and those of a receding astronomical light source exhibit a redshift.

       There are many popular conspiracy theories that have no foundation in reality:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        that the World Trade Center towers were brought down by planted explosive charges
       </li>
       <li>
        that human beings are causing the planet to become dangerously warmer
       </li>
       <li>
        that the Sandy Hook shooting was staged
       </li>
       <li>
        that any of the recent mass shootings in the US were staged
       </li>
       <li>
        that the nobility of England routinely engages in group Satanism and child abuse
       </li>
       <li>
        that the elite are not human
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       On the other hand, there are many real conspiracies that are almost totally ignored by the public, even the supposedly "awake" people in this subreddit. Ignored but real conspiracies include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        that Israel knew about 9-11 before it happened, and had a hand in coordinating it
       </li>
       <li>
        white genocide
