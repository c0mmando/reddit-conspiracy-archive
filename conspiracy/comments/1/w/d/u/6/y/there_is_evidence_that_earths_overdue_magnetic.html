       Forget global warming, worry about the MAGNETOSPHERE: Earth's magnetic field is collapsing and it could affect the climate and wipe out power grids
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Earth's magnetic field has weakened by 15 per cent over the last 200 years
       </li>
       <li>
        Could be a sign that the planet's north and south poles are about to flip
       </li>
       <li>
        If this happens, solar winds could punch holes into the Earth's ozone layer
       </li>
       <li>
        This could damage power grids, affect weather and increase cancer rates
       </li>
       <li>
        Evidence of flip happening in the past has been uncovered in pottery
       </li>
       <li>
        As the magnetic shield weakens, the spectacle of an aurora would be visible every night all over the Earth
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <em>
        Excerpts:
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Experts believe we're currently overdue a flip, but they're unsure when this could occur."
      </p>
      <p>
       "The impact could be devastating for mankind, knocking out power grids, radically changing Earth’s climate and driving up rates of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is serious business’, Richard Holme, Professor of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences at Liverpool University told MailOnline. ‘Imagine for a moment your electrical power supply was knocked out for a few months – very little works without electricity these days.’"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Researchers predict that in the event of a flip, every year a hundred thousand people would die from the increased levels of space radiation." 
FEMA Camps and FEMA coffins???
      </p>
      <p>
       "Space agencies are now taking the threat seriously. In November, three spacecraft were launched as part of the SWARM mission to uncover how the Earth’s magnetic field is changing."
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Smoking Gun; In one area, there is evidence that a flip is already occurring. ‘The increasing strength of the South Atlantic anomaly, an area of weak field over Brazil, is already a problem,’ said Professor Richard Holme."
      </p>
      <p>
       "If a flip occurs, it would cause the Earth’s magnetic shield to be weakened for thousands of years, opening up our defences and causing cosmic radiation to get through."

       Depending on how it happens, it doesn't sound that far out of reason that the power could get knocked out, at least for the duration of the flip if not for extended times if equipment is damaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flip could act as a mild EMP.

       No but we know that the earth is big and that the field while also big is of a very low intensity. The moving field even if the swap were to happen over the course of a year wouldn't induce any significant current into conductors.

       Ok first of all, the magnetic pole has wandered up to 30 degrees over the last 200 million years, so its not unheard of. Second of all, pole shifts would likely not have anywhere near the effects you're stating, mostly just fucking with birds and compases.

       the poles themselves moving won't do much other than mess with animals, at least not directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       now the weakening during that flip makes things like CME and flares a lot dangerous IF one were to hit us during that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       also if you put the solar system in to perspective something like the sun that projects its influence nearly 2-3 times as far out as pluto something as major as a total reversal of its magnetic field has got to send out some pretty big ripples.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyone else notice these polar vortex's starting about the same time the sun calmed down?  the reality is science still isn't 100% sure what even causes our magnetic field (there are plenty of educated guesses) but even that is not a known.
      </p>
      <p>
       is it really hard to believe a massive event like the suns poles flipping has zero effect on earth? the reality is we have no fucking clue what is going on, or if anyone does they sure as hell aren't going to scare/warn the public

       Firstly, i believe they know the field is due to the iron core of our earth, secondly, if it's that dangerous, don't you think this would be more widely known. Yes, we could be more susceptible to solar flares
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       the field weakens (since it doesn't necessarily always weaken). Also, we know when these have happened, and they might have higher levels of Carbon-14, and possible had slightly higher radiation levels, but it did not appear to have that much of an effect on the animals living at the time (e.g. dinosars)

        they don't "know" shit, its still just theory as so far it is difficult if not imposible to actually sample the upper mantle, the lower mantle and core are assumed to be there to explain the ground penetrating radar results and how the waves bounce around etc.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       as for the actual dynamo its self it's all educated guessing same as the sun they haven't even been able to reproduce the effect of a dynamo in a lab so far to my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the flares just look to NASA's policy on asteroids, if its potentially dangerous they don't say anything until after, they don't want to start massive panic over near misses or possible scenarios
      </p>
      <p>
       look at it this way Mars is the way it is because it lost its magnetic field.... now if the field drops significantly for a long period of time we risk having large amounts of atmosphere stripped off by the solar wind.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF this happens everything is hypothetical as we have no idea how bad this could be or the chain reactions it could set off
      </p>
      <p>
       we lose it for a day were fine
we lose if for a week okay probably still fine with a little higher chance of cancer
a month well now its getting scary
a year well shit is probably pretty fucked
years... well who knows
      </p>
      <p>
       now it has flipped before but we dont know how or what was going on at that time, we have bones of the dinos there is only so much you can gain from that, they dont tell the story of cancers or radiation poisoning since a fossilized bone is made of stone particles that seeped in to where the bones were and solidified (none of it is actual bone) or the original materials
      </p>

       and last of all Magnetic fields until recently have been one of the least explored fields of physics

       First of all, consider that mars had
       <strong>
        no
       </strong>
       magnetic field for millions of years. Also, we can totally tell about radiation levels by looking at rock layers, they tell us that there was a higher concentration of radiation, but not a seriously dangerous amount, more above average levels than anything else.

       mars has been without it for millions of years, what else has been missing for millions of years.. it's atmosphere, that has been gone a very long time too, pretty sure they haven't been able to determine how long it took to happen yet.

       The polarity of our Sun changes approximately every 11 years, yes; but I believe OP was alleging a terrestrial magnetic pole shift, here on our planet. I also don't believe in "doomsday theories" or things of that nature.

       Yes also in the dried lava fields in Hawaii, they figured out that poles in the past would flip every 200 thousand years or so, it has been over 700 thousand years since the last one, we are overdue. The only thing they any tell is if it happens quickly or not. There is many great documentaries on the topic

       Yeah I'm still a little vague on what you mean by that. Given, you know wars and culture and things of that nature all of humanity and the word we doesn't really work for me so maybe you mean some subset of humanity, but which one?
