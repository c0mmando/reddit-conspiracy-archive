       Okay, let's look at the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a banker named Gabriel (which is a fairly common name, like so many other names out of the Bible. Lucifer is far less common) decides to warn high-level Freemasons about... something (??) by committing suicide by leaping out of a specifically numbered floor. Let's examine, shall we?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names">
          Gabriel often makes the list on the most common names in the United States and the UK.
         </a>
         Most Western names are Biblical / Roman / Christian. This is no more surprising or unusual than someone in the Middle East being named Mohammed. So are you saying that his parents knowingly named him after Lucifer, knowing that four decades later, he would commit suicide so that senior Freemasons would avoid unwise financial decisions?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_causes_of_death#Developed_vs._developing_economies">
          Suicide is the tenth most common cause of death.
         </a>
         Combined with the state of the economy and banking scandals and whatnot, again, this isn't too surprising.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The 33rd floor? Perhaps he-- I don't know-- WORKED there?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why not send an encrypted email to senior Freemasons? A suicide is hardly an effective mode of secret communication, for fuck's sake.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hey, maybe he committed suicide at eleven minutes past nine. DUN DUN DUN, that means he leapt to his death in order to warn the world that 9/11 was an inside job. The truth is out there, yo!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Has anyone looked into what kind of chemtrails were overhead?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What's the license plate of the car he drove? Maybe if we rearrange them, it would spell out some more secret Freemason messages. Or something.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Has no one here even heard of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">
          confirmation bias
         </a>
         ? Cherry-picking and rearranging facts and figures to suit a pre-determined narrative is not exactly intelligent, nor skeptical, nor open-minded.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       On the plus side, several of you really should go into astrology, you have a natural talent for stringing together irrelevant facts to say something meaninglessly vague.

       Instead what I found was a lot of quotes posted over top of pictures and image posts/cartoons.
I was pretty disappointed. If this is the legacy this sub is leaving it's pretty bad.

       I'm not justifying anything. I'm just saying that when you are searching for information that could be considered "clandestine" or "esoteric" in nature, you might need to employ more clever means to reach your goal - whatever that may be.

       Honestly, what would you expect from sorting reddit by top? You've been around the block. This place is full of disinformation, targeted opinions, and corporate sponsorship. This subreddit is not a haven from those elements of reddit - we are just rolling with the punches and trying to stay relevant.

       Some of us agree, but either more of us don't or the vote brigades decided that was a good way to keep people who are checking the sub out, like you were, from seeing it as a valuable resource. My sinking feeling is that those posts would still be at the top even without help.

       Successful people do kill themselves. But with the absolute house of cards that are Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan - you can't rule out that they'd have a potential whistleblower nixed.

       The reality is that we have security contractors that can and do, indeed, act as political and corporate hit men. They're really fucking good at it, too. People love movies like "Michael Clayton" but protect themselves with cognitive dissonance when faced with the reality that it's not just gang members and terrorists that will murder to protect their turf. When the FBI largely disbanded the mafia, organized crime just traded up.

       Obviously remnants of the mafia still exist, but they're no where near as profitable or influential as they were before the crackdown of the late 70's and 80's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their strategy isn't to stamp out the crime, it's to arrest the leaders, destroy the frame work of the organization and scatter the lesser pieces to the wind. That's what has happened to most terrorist groups, why the current "threat" is seemingly only from lone wolf types, because cells basically can't communicate without the feds knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also happened in Chicago, where the gang leaders were taken out but the conditions for territorial violence that remained just meant that gangs became small, unstable territories of as little as a couple of blocks, which has turned out to be far more volatile.
      </p>
      <p>
       They employ similar strategies when infiltrating resistance groups like Anonymous or the Black Panthers (which is history this sub really needs to pay more attention to, it's who they honed their tactics on.)

       The government is just trying to get a piece of the action by doing what they do best; acting like mafia thugs. These arrests do not negate the fact that Bitcoin is NSA created. It just means that the government doesn't like those specific actors.

       Nothing would "negate" that "fact" for you. Nothing that anyone does could ever convince you otherwise. You have willingly accepted the least likely explanation for a series of relatively benign events and will continue to reinforce that thought in your own mind through subceptive mechanisms, fighting off cognitive dissonance at every opportunity. No amount of logic could budge you from such an illogical path, especially when you've willingly and proudly pissed in the face of reason to reach such a path. No, you've made up your mind.

       Not crazy, just highly, highly illogical. Bitcoin is open source, so if there is an NSA backdoor or tracking mechanism in place, it shouldn't be hard to find. Can you point out the NSA "influence" in the code?

       The NSA is very good at what they do and a back door is a fear some bitcoiners have. Could even have to do with the network. It is foolish to dismiss this thought as readily as you accept satoshi

       Tor was sponsored and used by the US Navy but that doesn't mean it is inherently bad. Ironically, it's one of the best tools we have against the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't believe the NSA had much to do with the creation of Bitcoin. I do not doubt they have an interest in it for both identification, tracing, and encryption-wise. Again, that doesn't meant they are responsible for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I feel that the government and respective agencies are watching Bitcoin's rise and know they need to be somewhat preemptive. Being that Bitcoin is inherently difficult to trace, they want to funnel people into using payment providers that they can trace/monitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it makes sense they would say "Bitcoin is okay, but you have to use provider XYZ" (think Visa, MasterCard, Discover). This way they have a centralized system which actually undermines the Bitcoin itself.

       Yup. All these approval pieces in Forbes and other online news sites like the Wall Street Journal and USA today worry me about the Gov't's willingness for it to prosper.
      </p>
      <p>
       But its a sound piece of code. Everyone has been studying it for a long time and see no initial flaws in it. Unless the NSA has a computer that can crack the SHA=256 encryption instantly(and they probably do), then why worry.  The great thing about bitcoin is it can not be created within the system. Unlike the dollar which can be created from nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like the dollar is starting to crumble and bitcoin will shine very brightly. Lets see what happens in the next year or so.

       From New Mexico, his dad was a AF pilot. Could be a big conspiracy, or he could have just tried to cold turkey quit a medication or been put on a new one. Lots of people jumping from buildings and setting themselves on fire and shooting up schools and malls and homes in the last few weeks and driving into poles who weren't associated with banking. I don't know what the bigger conspiracy would be, honestly.

       One day, the powers that be will come for the patriots. When the bodies of dozens of outspoken anti-NWO activists all turn up within a space of 24-72 hours, the controlled media will report it with a chuckle, comparing the deceased "extremist conspiracy theorists" with the Heaven's Gate cult. SNL will no doubt do a parody skit.

       Why would someone involved in construction be "told" which agencies were planning it? Let alone what type of gas would be used? I fully believe the government is capable of such things and am very surprised a large sporting event hasn't been targeted yet, but this guy doesn't sound legit...  Like with the towers, if bombs or devices were being placed or planned, the agency would do it without witnesses- remove security, bring in their own crews, etc.  no one would know what the other hand was doing, except for the very top people.

       Absolutely true to an extent. For all we know the guy could be a contractor subbed out to the CIA front. Remember all the security and construction renovations on the WTC before 9/11? We never heard any statements or any other info on the renovations other than they were contractors tied in with the Bush family.

       Then you have the NSA. Thousands of people employed to spy on their neighbors and only one or two credible leakers have surfaced. What Im trying to say is that money can and does buy silence on a mass scale. If not then the threat of certain assassination or "suicide" does the trick on those with a conscious.
      </p>

       Has anyone dug up any information on the renovations and construction on the Superbowl Stadium? I personally havent.

       What was Thornton &amp; Tomasetti also involved with? The tear down and disposal of the 9/11 towers evidence AND in charge of the contractors for the WTC renovations prior to the 9/11 attacks. If anyone knew of unauthorized contractors planting nano-thermites with paint, construction materials or conventional means it would be this firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the first paragraph at least. T&amp;T got the blame for destroying most of the 9/11 evidence that got shipped off to China and scrap yards. They were the lead engineering firm in charge of contracting out the work and made the decisions.

       I could dig deeper but its already apparent those involved with 9/11 have their hands all over the new stadium and this years Superbowl event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidence or clues for an upcoming false flag? Just think of the opportunity if a event like the SB was "attacked". Justification to take away any rights that remain and the American people will eat it up.

       About a year or so ago, someone from the bank in Sienna (I think the oldest bank in the world) also committed "suicide" by jumping off of a roof.  Then a couple of years ago, someone from the Fed was found hanging in his basement -- supposedly also suicide.  I am wondering if there is a pattern here.  If there is anything irregular in the banking practices (and we know there is a lot!), and they are found out by middle-upper level employees.  If the employees make their concerns known, they could be asking for a noose around the neck.   Now I know this sounds like a conspiracy (so surely this is a good place to post) but 4 dead bankers by suicide in about 4 years is odd, I think -- also, there may be more.  There was also that guy affiliated with the Vatican bank who was found in Thames river, very close to a Morgan gold vault.  At the very least, these incidents deserve further investigation.

       Okay, let's look at the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a banker named Gabriel (which is a fairly common name, like so many other names out of the Bible. Lucifer is far less common) decides to warn high-level Freemasons about... something (??) by committing suicide by leaping out of a specifically numbered floor. Let's examine, shall we?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names">
          Gabriel often makes the list on the most common names in the United States and the UK.
         </a>
         Most Western names are Biblical / Roman / Christian. This is no more surprising or unusual than someone in the Middle East being named Mohammed. So are you saying that his parents knowingly named him after Lucifer, knowing that four decades later, he would commit suicide so that senior Freemasons would avoid unwise financial decisions?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_causes_of_death#Developed_vs._developing_economies">
          Suicide is the tenth most common cause of death.
         </a>
         Combined with the state of the economy and banking scandals and whatnot, again, this isn't too surprising.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The 33rd floor? Perhaps he-- I don't know-- WORKED there?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why not send an encrypted email to senior Freemasons? A suicide is hardly an effective mode of secret communication, for fuck's sake.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hey, maybe he committed suicide at eleven minutes past nine. DUN DUN DUN, that means he leapt to his death in order to warn the world that 9/11 was an inside job. The truth is out there, yo!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Has anyone looked into what kind of chemtrails were overhead?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What's the license plate of the car he drove? Maybe if we rearrange them, it would spell out some more secret Freemason messages. Or something.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Has no one here even heard of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">
          confirmation bias
         </a>
         ? Cherry-picking and rearranging facts and figures to suit a pre-determined narrative is not exactly intelligent, nor skeptical, nor open-minded.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       On the plus side, several of you really should go into astrology, you have a natural talent for stringing together irrelevant facts to say something meaninglessly vague.

       It was too long, and I didn't read it.  Sorry.  My intent was to give feedback on the post you wrote.  In my opinion, you should have edited it to make it shorter.  That's just how I feel about your long-winded and tedious comment.

       That's real nice of you to imply that I'm acting like a child.  Very classy.  /s

       And perhaps I will let you know, I wouldn't hold my breath, though.  Goodnight, statelessnfaithless.
