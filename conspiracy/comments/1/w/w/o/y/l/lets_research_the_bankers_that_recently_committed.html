<p>A Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. executive who predicted that Orange County was heading toward financial disaster 21 months before the county filed bankruptcy took a leave of absence from the brokerage on Thursday.</p>

<p>William S. Broeksmit, who helped pioneer the complex investments that contributed to Orange County&#39;s financial collapse, had warned his supervisors in memos that the county&#39;s investment pool should be sold and even questioned the firm&#39;s strategy.</p>

<p>From elsewhere online:</p>

<p>JPMorgan - Has been under constant investigation by the US government covering large areas of the finance sector (fraud / violating settlement agreement / billions from madoff / billions from trading scandal / Credit derivatives being transferred to European banking system / etc).</p>

<p>Russel Investments is an interesting company due to its parent organization and what it did. The parent company is Northwestern Mutual. It is one of the largest financial groups in the US and has significant ties across the globe.</p>

<p>Deutch Bank - one of the largest currency trading institutions in the world (has about a 20% control of that sector).</p>

<p>All 3 banks are powerhouse in the financial realm. All 3 banks have continual legal problems with the US and UK governments over illegal actions.</p>

<p>Remember when the US had its credit rating downgraded?
Remember when the article came out about the Us government being pissed about the credit downgrade, making threats towards S&amp;P for that downgrade?</p>

<p>Something from when there were only two:</p>

<p>Both of the men who killed themselves were intimately concerned with judging and safeguarding their bank from risk.</p>

<p>To give you an idea what sort of risk that size of a derivatives book is consider that the entire GDP of Germany is €2.7 Trillion. Remember that Derivatives are what Warren Buffet dubbed “weapons of financial mass destruction.”</p>

<p>Next question might be, when do these weapons become dangerous? The answer obvioulsy varies in accordance with the type of derivative you are considering. One huge group of derivatives that both JP Morgan and Deutsche both deal very heavily in are currency and interest rate swaps.</p>

<p>They become dangerous when there are large moves in currency values and interest rates. At the moment The Tukish Lira has been in free fall for days.</p>

<p>The Turkish central bank tried to defend it and could not stem an unstoppable tide. It then stunned everyone by raising its over-night lending rate (the interst rate it charges to lend to banks over-night) from 4.25% to 12 %! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are going to do anything, look at who the major holders are of those companies first.  Look at the top people on that company and research a few of them to look for a connection.</p>

<p>Continue that until you get to a private equity firm (they <strong>always</strong> come back to a private firm owning everything), determine which rich people own and manage their wealth through those firms.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good place to start.  You can use just about any finance website to do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read Michael Lewis&#39; fine book: &quot;The Big Short&quot;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what happened: In the old days of banking, a bank would make a loan and keep that loan on its books, so it had a reason to make good loans. But starting in the mid 2000s, banks started to sell off those loans to other investors. They could group a variety of loans of differing quality into one group called a CDO. The loans of differing qualities were in slices using a French word called tranches. Some of the loans were AAA (which means loans unlikely to default) with loans down to BBB (which means likely to default). </p>

<p>Unfortunately for the bankers like these looking to control risk, a screwy thing happened: instead of gathering some good loans with bad loans, banks were able to group only bad loans together into a confusing mess that the ratings agencies with their &quot;opinions&quot; classified, magically, as ALL AAA. So, foolish risk managers trusted the rating agencies and allowed a lot of bad loans that would never be repaid to be on their books.</p>

<p>These guys lost billions and only the short sellers came out smelling like a rose. These guys likely committed suicide because they were shown to be professional idiots who lost their companies buckets of money and showed they had wasted their lives. </p>
