       Just take a good look at the comment sections of just about any r/Conspiracy post this morning, especialy anything relating to the superbowl.  I mean, are they trying to get people to realize what they're doing?  It just seems so obvious to me.

       This happened with the Bill Cooper 9/11 thread as well:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjjj2/whatever_theyre_going_to_blame_on_osama_bin_laden/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjjj2/whatever_theyre_going_to_blame_on_osama_bin_laden/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Scroll down a bit and see the "list of shills." Compare that to the top commenter in the 9/11 thread being hijacked right now. The top commenter is in that list because back then, he had no activity whatsoever for that month, except for that thread. Again, this time around he has no activity this month aside from this hijacked thread and happens to have been upvoted all the way to the top.

       Yep - it's blatant to the point where I have trouble understanding how anyone reading the thread could fail to notice the manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so obvious with certain, specific topics - 9/11 being one of the biggest ones.

       I also noticed that impersonator earlier.  My hope is that there are others besides you and I who are starting to notice these things as well.

       They're not targeting the regulars. Not intentionally, anyway. They're firing chaff to confuse and repropagandize people who might be new, that show up because of what they saw during the Superb Owl.

       I've seen that phrase a lot today and it's a new one for me.  Is it just a play on occult symbolism or is there actually something more to the idea?

       I didn't think about the Moloch connection, but I saw it posted somewhere yesterday. My thought is that it's a great way to avoid those searching for s U p E r B o W l as a keyword very heavily right now, if you know what I mean.

       I thought you meant he was important as he had an imposter. You're suggesting the imposter is important and has the ability to instantaneously delete posts? I figured the imposter is just a troll.

       I just exposed his posting history and he bristled immediately. He said he reported me to the mods and 5 min later my post was unceremoniously deleted.

       My question is why obvious trolls have that much sway. That he is banned isnt much comfort, I want answers.

       Nice example from someone down below ,downplaying of facts and manipulation /derailment going on , very blatantly. 
Sometimes im not sure if these are payed shills or really stupid close-minded people.
Everything this wigglesworth guy is saying has long been refuted by experts and testimonies recorded all over, a few seen and heard in here

       At a certain point it doesn't even matter, both groups use the same tactics - dumb it down, start arguments, change the subject, change the argument, attack the source rather than the info, etc.  They do all of the same things either way and the effect is the same.  I think people are starting to catch on.

       The frequent labeling as "shills" in this subreddit, of those who simply express skeptical views, has utterly devalued the term to the point where it has now become meaningless. It's yelled far too often, simply to avoid discussion of facts.

       Regardless of meaning, it's the blanket labeling e.g. "the shills are out in full force" which is the problem - absolutely no apparent effort being made to distinguish wheat from chaff. You may only apply it to those "with a track record or obvious agenda" [though a track record of skepticism does not make one a shill] - and, if so, credit for that - but I've been around
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I've noticed the flood of downvotes, but I wouldn't call the people shills. I think most of them are actually regular citizens who take a hostile stance to conspiracy questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really bewildering to think that "9/11 conspiracies" are so divisive when any patriotic American should demand a thorough investigation of all angles that day. The term "9/11 conspiracy" doesn't refer to any specific plan. It just implies that we haven't been shown the full investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       How anyone can disagree with that shows their own level of cognitive biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       My biggest issue is just how hostile people can be to anyone who insists the government hides things from us.

       btw: he's awfully good at interrupting my twoofer youtube viewing schedule, now let me see, was i watching that chemtrail-during-9/11 documentary just now ?  oh no, i was doing research on the reptilian eyeflashes by Alex Jones in another youtube video, before i wanted to watch that thing about the russian-homophobic-NWO that started before i started watching this thing about zionism, right-y-ho, back to my favourite groupthink channels !

        It's really bewildering to think that "9/11 conspiracies" are so divisive when any patriotic American should demand a thorough investigation of all angles that day.

       Sadly I think most people have been successfully "re-educated" with the idea that jingoism is what is meant when referring to patriotism.

       They see everyone here as a bunch of loud mouth loonies that no one will ever listen to. Which is why it's so important to shout us down and pollute our tiny little subreddit, dig?

       I feel its important during times like these to point out that the number of upvotes and downvotes that you see is
       <strong>
        not the actual number
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The numbers are intentionally skewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       That post you made with "65 upvotes and 60 downvotes" is probably +6 -1.  Not +65 -60.  You haven't been vote brigaded...thats just how the website works.

       This website is mostly Americans. Football is big in America. I have never sat down by myself to watch a game, but I have certainly watched a Superbowl or two with friends and coworkers. But sure yeah, I'm sure shills wanted to upvote everything and point out the truther microphone guy and the lack of attacks predicted by this sub. /s

       So why do you bother to post?  You aren't going to convince anyone who isn't already convinced - and you're going to drive away people who are on the fence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question for you - surely you're accomplishing exactly what one of these "shills" we keep hearing about, by driving away people who are just curious or wondering?

       Assuming you mean Shanksville? Both of the boxes from flight 93 were recovered. Planes don't just have
       <em>
        one

       box either, there is a data recorder (FDR) and a voice recorder (CVR). They played parts of the CVR from flight 93 in court for the Zacarias Moussaoui trial which happened in 2006 (a lot of evidence was saved for this trial, including the Citgo and Doubletree videos from the pentagon crash), and supposedly for the victims families as well.

       I'm not saying this against or for the conspriacy, but if you're going to talk about the official story, you should at least have your events of what they porport correct, otherwise it makes you look uneducated on the very subject you are pretending to know so much about.

       This is what part was played in court:

       Again wasn't saying you had to believe it. Just that the official narrative did say they found it. You seemed to imply they said it wasn't found in your post. Judging by your reaction this is the first time you had heard this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting that you think it's both fake AND shortened to hide the real truth. If it's fake how is it hiding the truth by not playing it all? That makes zero logical sense.

       Officially, they were never found, but there's some people who worked on the cleanup who said they helped FBI recover 3 of the 4. Why they would cover those two up, and not the other for from Shanksvilles and the Pentagon seems odd though.

       I was just saying it's Shanksville, not Shawshank. Honestly though, I just don't even care anymore. At this point, so much damage has been done in the name of 9/11, it's practically irrelevant as to who is responsible.

       If you could see how narrow-minded and self-righteous you are coming across, you'd pity yourself as much as I do. I'm not saying you're wrong about what you think about 9/11, but using that one subject as a lens through which you view your fellow man is no less shallow than a hardcore athiest arbitrarily shitting on a Christian, because they are
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       certain of something that they will never be able to irrefutably prove. Being a condescending prick isn't going to give you any credibility.

        A declassified CIA document dated 7 Jan 1953 [1] describes the creation of multiple personality in 19-year old girls. "These subjects have clearly demonstrated that they can pass from a fully awake state to a deep H [hypnotic] controlled state ... by telephone, by receiving written matter, or by the use of code, signal, or words and that control of those hypnotized can be passed from one individual to another without great difficulty. It has also been shown by experimentation with these girls that they can act as unwilling couriers for information purposes."

       <p>
        A CIA document dated 10 Feb 1954 [4] describes an experiment on the creation of unsuspecting assassins: "Miss [deleted] was then instructed (having expressed a fear of firearms) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken Miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep) and failing this, she would pick up a pistol and fire it at Miss [deleted]. She was instructed that she would not hesitate to "kill." Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions including firing the (unloaded) gun at [deleted]. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened. Miss [deleted] expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened." BB 36, 37

        An 11-year old boy underwent a partial change of identity upon remote stimulation of his brain electrode: "Electrical stimulation of the superior temporal convolution induced confusion about his sexual identity. These effects were specific, reliable, and statistically significant. For example, the patient said, 'I was thinking whether I was a boy or a girl,' and 'I'd like to be a girl.'" After one of the stimulations the patient suddenly began to discuss his desire to marry the male interviewer. Temporal-lobe stimulation produced in another patient open manifestations and declarations of pleasure, accompanied by giggles and joking with the therapist. In two adult female patients stimulation of the same region was followed by discussion of marriage and expression of a wish to marry the therapist. [64] BB 88, 89

        "During World War II, I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I’ll call Jones. Under the watchful eye of Marine intelligence I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a 'normal' working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps (which was in on the plot) and became a card-carrying party member. All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, the loyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp."

       Much of the populace doesn't know about it. The Church Committee exposing what they did, still didn't bring about the cessation of government mind control experiments. It appeased people to the extent that they would think it's out in the open and the CIA must be sorry and ceased.

        14-year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducts disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MKUltra was abandoned a "cover story."

       As recently as 2006, government documents have surfaced that discuss approval authorities for non-consensual human experimentation involving mind control and severe and unusual physical and psychological intrusions.

       The Church Committee also investigated Operation Mockingbird- the severe infiltration of American media by the CIA. Like Mkultra, their investigation of the matter didn't equal its cessation. Carl Bernstein, of Woodward and Bernstein fame (the journalists who broke Watergate) did a thorough investigation of this matter not long ago and came to the conclusion that the CIA still views the media as very much "up for grabs."

       Just because some information surfaced about a CIA plot doesn't mean that the CIA has abandoned said plot. The amount of information we have on MkUltra precludes us from judging the "success" of the endeavors, but we know that many Americans were tortured by the CIA in projects that may very well have never ceased.

       Philip Marshall knew a hell of a lot about 911 and it's obvious to anyone that looks into it. And it's almost exactly one year since his and his kids death. RIP Phil and thanks for the effort.

       Funny how you conveniently didn't include
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wsy3p/woman_looking_out_from_the_95th_floor_after_the/cf57yb1">
        the start of the thread.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I was originally explaining to you what a chimney effect was, and explained that this is not what happened to WTC 1 &amp; 2, but did occur in WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then proceeded to post some of the standard conspiracy theorist conjecture that's already been refuted several times (fire not hot enough to melt steel, building fell at free fall speeds, etc.) and when I pointed out that your information was incorrect, and supplied the evidence to support exactly WHY your information was incorrect, you proclaimed that you didn't want to be bothered reading the information:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I'm going to be honest with you, I skipped through almost all of what you wrote because I'm tired of the debunkers tactics of shoving a shit ton of text that says nothing worth a damn
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="/u/GayUnicorn6969">
         /u/GayUnicorn6969
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See, where I come from, when someone makes a claim to something, they back that claim up with evidence to support it. That "shit ton of text" you chose to ignore contained information that supported my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you attempted to post some nonsense as to what "squibs" were:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Will you eventually concede that squibs can only occur in demolitions?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And when I called you on THIS, you suddenly decided you couldn't defend your position any further and
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wsy3p/woman_looking_out_from_the_95th_floor_after_the/cf63bxm">
        switched tactics to the old ad hominem attack as an attempt to retreat from the discussion.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, but if you are going to post bullshit, you should expect people to call you on it. This doesn't make me a paid accomplice of the government, it makes me a rational-thinking human. I'd suggest that you give it a try some time, but you may have to read a few things and I know how challenging that can be for you. ;-)

       You consider theory to be more relevant than fact and you keep twisting everything around it even as of now.

       Did anyone find it odd that the Super bowl was in New York, and that even though they gave been trolled by sub zero weather and terrible driving conditions (for the better part of January) the game looked like it was in perfect weather?  And only 8 hours later did the heinous weather resume.

       Links? Theories?  Geoengineering?  I like the way you think. Hadn't considered it, but then again, I didn't watch the game, so I probably didn't  think about the weather.

       Yeah exactly ! He tries to small-talk every argument or just dismisses it outright with explanations that defy logic , physics , common sense..
Doesn't add anything to his claims , and in the end just results to bashing the person putting forth information for debate.

       I see what you're saying, and it's entirely reasonable, but I have to disagree.  I think that, if what I am saying is the Truth, then I do stand to make a net gain.  Not right away, but in the long run.  But even if I'm wrong, at least speaking the truth is a theraputic exercise for me.

       I have no problem with that at all. In fact, I invite discussion, even though I sometimes know they have an "occupational bias", to use a different term.

       They don't create too much of a problem besides the blatant ridicule and downvotes on posts. It's a problem, but not critical. Especially if more honest people comment and browse "new" to suffocate their efforts.

       People that post an opinion you don't share aren't shills; this is a forum for debate and discussion. Just because you don't like what someone has written, doesn't mean others agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts like this serve little value, other than for the person posting them to make their feelings known. Why don't you go into these threads that you feel are being infiltrated and add information to the discussion? That would be your best course of action.

       Look person...I've been a participating member here for awhile now.  I know how a lot of this works.  I've been the victim of it, and I see it happen to others all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about posting opinions I don't agree with.  I go out of my way to welcome open, good natured, and lively debate wherever I can find it.  What I'm bringing to light is an entire group of people who make it their business to obfuscate the comment sections to the point of making this impossible.

       Why are you being snarky? Why have you edited your comment to link to my post history? I've shared my opinion, and told you that if you think you're truly under attack, then report it to the admins. What more can be done? You're not taking the high road by acting this way; you're attacking me, for no reason other than I provided a response.

       This happened with the Bill Cooper 9/11 thread as well:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjjj2/whatever_theyre_going_to_blame_on_osama_bin_laden/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Scroll down a bit and see the "list of shills." Compare that to the top commenter in the 9/11 thread being hijacked right now. The top commenter is in that list because back then, he had no activity whatsoever for that month, except for that thread. Again, this time around he has no activity this month aside from this hijacked thread and happens to have been upvoted all the way to the top.

       If you scroll to the bottom of this thread, you'll notice an account impersonating

        /u/iam_sancho2

       . The 2 was changed to a 3.

       And what are these supposed to tell me. I googled both of them. Phillip Marshall has nothing to do with anything except possibly some "black ops hit". He knows nothing about 9/11 or anything associated with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Barry Jennings isn't much better. Uncorroborated information that doesn't really say anything. There were dead people in WTC 7 before the second plane hit? Yet, he was on the 23rd floor and got down to the eighth floor, when someone save him. He heard explosions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the fuck is this supposed to tell me, without a shred of evidence, eye-witness testimony from one guy and NOTHING from the other expect a lot conspiracies. He wasn't even fucking there, are you are holding him up as proof? Really?!?

       What a waste of time that was.

       I was just saying it's Shanksville, not Shawshank. Honestly though, I just don't even care anymore. At this point, so much damage has been done in the name of 9/11, it's practically irrelevant as to who is responsible.

       Nice example from someone down below ,downplaying of facts and manipulation /derailment going on , very blatantly. 
Sometimes im not sure if these are payed shills or really stupid close-minded people.
Everything this wigglesworth guy is saying has long been refuted by experts and testimonies recorded all over, a few seen and heard in here
