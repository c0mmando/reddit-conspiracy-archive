        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1 month ago a 9/11 thread hit the top slot on r/conspiracy. I believe this is the only area the shills concentrate on for the most part; the top couple slots, because those are the ones that get fed to the 200,000 subscribers&#39; front page. Besides that, there&#39;s only around 600 people here on average, which is hardly anything to worry about for these hypothetically present shills, aside from suppressing posts that might make it to the top slot or two, or pushing garbage posts to the top in order to discredit this sub. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjjj2/whatever_theyre_going_to_blame_on_osama_bin_laden/">Thread 1 from a month ago.</a>. Scroll down a bit and you&#39;ll notice a &quot;list of probable shills.&quot; Notice <a href="/u/largemason">/u/largemason</a> is in that list, read why he made the list. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wus7b/with_the_super_bowl_going_on_this_cant_be_more/">Thread 2, currently 1 or 2 slot on this sub</a> Largemason again. This time he&#39;s heavily upvoted to the top, despite his post being extremely idiotic. Look at his history. This is identical to the other thread. He&#39;s probably a shill because this is his only post this month and it happens to be in a 9/11 thread. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So from this we can gather that the shills divert resources to 9/11 threads and only if they get attention from the 200,000 subscribers, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t really be worth paying a bunch of people to shill. I don&#39;t know if there are other topics they shill for, but I think this pretty much proves that they shill for 9/11 threads. </p>

<p>Besides this, I also noticed an account impersonating a regular user here. <a href="/u/Iam_sancho3">/u/Iam_sancho3</a> is impersonating <a href="/u/Iam_sancho2">/u/Iam_sancho2</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s possible. It could simply be 1 person doing the voting and creating content with 20 accounts. That would be extremely efficient because 1 paid person can control the content of a sub that reaches over 200,000 people. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed in the new que that many posts get 3 automatic downvotes within the first 20 minutes. These quick downvotes count way more than the upvotes later, since that is how Reddit works. Even if a post is great, if it has 3 downvotes early in it&#39;s life, it is almost impossible for it to be upvoted anywhere near the top of the front page. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short of a confession, how could you prove this to even the most stubborn people out there (like yourself) who will assume shills don&#39;t exist on Reddit until the shills themselves make a video admitting to it?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1v1ggh/exposing_cyber_shills_and_social_medias_underworld/cenrdlv">the existence of shills on social media is a fact and admitted to.</a></p>

<p>This means that it would be unlikely that shills aren&#39;t on Reddit, given that Reddit is such a massive social media website. Therefore, since shills are obviously on Reddit, and this person only appears on 9/11 threads once a month, it is reasonable to conclude that this is a shill. This is not some outrageous claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;ve no doubt there are plenty of PR people on Reddit, assuming that&#39;s what you mean by &quot;shills&quot;.

Assuming that someone, with an obvious interest in 9/11 and other conspiracy matters, is a shill basically <strong>purely because</strong> he expressed skepticism in a somewhat abrasive fashion...</p>

<p>We have 200,000 subscribers. They get the top 1 and 2 slots in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> fed to their front page. My post is dealing only with posts that made it to the top slot (and only with 9/11 coincidentally), therefore I am talking about these shills being interested in influencing up to 200,000 people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your second point, because there are much better ways to influence people. 200,000 subscribers may seem like a lot, but that&#39;s less than, oh, <a href="/r/gentlemanboners">/r/gentlemanboners</a>, and in line with a fairly obscurist cult TV show like &#39;Doctor Who&#39; [not to pick on DW, but it&#39;s on my list, so was easy to check. :)]. </p>

<p>There are <em>81</em> subreddits with more subscribers, so it&#39;s really not worth the effort, especially considering how few of those 200,000 are actually reading what&#39;s posted - 0.3% at any time. It&#39;s lovely to think we&#39;re &quot;important&quot;, but a good rule of thumb - those who actually have to say they&#39;re important, rarely are. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve no doubt federal authorities are reading this sub - sadly, given the sometimes violent rhetoric here, I have to hope they are - but actively participating? Not seen evidence for this, on any meaningful level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a specific type of content here that I think would catch their attention. And I&#39;m certain they are in Worldnews as well. That would be an easier case to prove.

<p>The posts he is shilling on were exposed to 200,000 people who are subscribed to this sub. The top posts here get fed to the front page of those users. You think the government has no interest whatsoever? You&#39;re the delusional one. If you don&#39;t believe in conspiracies, then get the fuck out. Go to another sub that doesn&#39;t interest you and bother them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are probably talking to someone paid to disrupt conversations here.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is just hide posts that do nothing but attack. </p>

<p>Also, just so you know, this sub is probably a lost cause, we have been trying to deal with shills hear for several years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My claim, if you couldn&#39;t figure it out, is that this person is a shill. Not that account. That person. This means they have many accounts and apparently were too lazy to make this specific account look genuine and was caught. </p>

<p>For anyone reading, please click <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/largemason">http://www.reddit.com/user/largemason</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ll see that this person I am talking to now is attempting to paint the picture that <a href="/u/largemason">/u/largemason</a> is very active in many subs, when in fact he has only posted a few times last month in the 9/11 thread I showed, and this recent 9/11 thread, plus one post in between about the holocaust. That is not even close to a believable account. It is clearly a lazy shill with 20 or so accounts and should be fired for incompetence. </p>

<p>Also, IP might be wrong, but I think it would be helpful if you could admit the possibility of paid shills is a real one. </p>
