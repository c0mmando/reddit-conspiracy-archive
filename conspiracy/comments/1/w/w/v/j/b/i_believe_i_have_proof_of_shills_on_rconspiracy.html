       1 month ago a 9/11 thread hit the top slot on r/conspiracy. I believe this is the only area the shills concentrate on for the most part; the top couple slots, because those are the ones that get fed to the 200,000 subscribers' front page. Besides that, there's only around 600 people here on average, which is hardly anything to worry about for these hypothetically present shills, aside from suppressing posts that might make it to the top slot or two, or pushing garbage posts to the top in order to discredit this sub.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjjj2/whatever_theyre_going_to_blame_on_osama_bin_laden/">
          Thread 1 from a month ago.
         </a>
         . Scroll down a bit and you'll notice a "list of probable shills." Notice
         <a href="/u/largemason">
          /u/largemason
         </a>
         is in that list, read why he made the list.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wus7b/with_the_super_bowl_going_on_this_cant_be_more/">
          Thread 2, currently 1 or 2 slot on this sub
         </a>
         Largemason again. This time he's heavily upvoted to the top, despite his post being extremely idiotic. Look at his history. This is identical to the other thread. He's probably a shill because this is his only post this month and it happens to be in a 9/11 thread.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So from this we can gather that the shills divert resources to 9/11 threads and only if they get attention from the 200,000 subscribers, otherwise it wouldn't really be worth paying a bunch of people to shill. I don't know if there are other topics they shill for, but I think this pretty much proves that they shill for 9/11 threads.

       I beleive you're on to something with this, but I would say they probably spend most of their time on the "new" sections of various subreddits, in particular r/conspiracy.

       They'll downvote something into obsurity rather than have to combat it after it reaches the front page.

       That's possible. It could simply be 1 person doing the voting and creating content with 20 accounts. That would be extremely efficient because 1 paid person can control the content of a sub that reaches over 200,000 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed in the new que that many posts get 3 automatic downvotes within the first 20 minutes. These quick downvotes count way more than the upvotes later, since that is how Reddit works. Even if a post is great, if it has 3 downvotes early in it's life, it is almost impossible for it to be upvoted anywhere near the top of the front page.

       I should have taken a screenshot, but there was a post where the comment section only had a handful of comments, the post itself did not have many upvotes or downvotes, but one of the shilly comments had like 250+ upvotes and two hundred or so downvotes. The other, regular comments had about 6 upvotes and a few downvotes.

       Must be some new definition of "proof", given there was no actual evidence is there that he was a shill the first time? Seems all you've got is that he disagreed with a post. OMG! Someone is being consistent in their views! Must be a shill! Er, no.

       Short of a confession, how could you prove this to even the most stubborn people out there (like yourself) who will assume shills don't exist on Reddit until the shills themselves make a video admitting to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1v1ggh/exposing_cyber_shills_and_social_medias_underworld/cenrdlv">
        the existence of shills on social media is a fact and admitted to.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that it would be unlikely that shills aren't on Reddit, given that Reddit is such a massive social media website. Therefore, since shills are obviously on Reddit, and this person only appears on 9/11 threads once a month, it is reasonable to conclude that this is a shill. This is not some outrageous claim.

       Oh, I've no doubt there are plenty of PR people on Reddit, assuming that's what you mean by "shills". This is more evidence of what I was talking about earlier this morning: the term "shill" is so over-used, it has become entirely devalued. Assuming that someone, with an obvious interest in 9/11 and other conspiracy matters, is a shill basically
       <strong>
        purely because
       </strong>
       he expressed skepticism in a somewhat abrasive fashion...

       Okay, the one thing I know for sure is that JIDF exists. I've caught a few threads riddled with Israeli drones. Whether or not our gov does it, that's another thing. However, it would not even slightly surprise me.

       We have 200,000 subscribers. They get the top 1 and 2 slots in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       fed to their front page. My post is dealing only with posts that made it to the top slot (and only with 9/11 coincidentally), therefore I am talking about these shills being interested in influencing up to 200,000 people.

       To answer your second point, because there are much better ways to influence people. 200,000 subscribers may seem like a lot, but that's less than, oh,
       <a href="/r/gentlemanboners">
        /r/gentlemanboners
       </a>
       , and in line with a fairly obscurist cult TV show like 'Doctor Who' [not to pick on DW, but it's on my list, so was easy to check. :)].
      </p>
      <p>
       There are
       <em>
        81
       </em>
       subreddits with more subscribers, so it's really not worth the effort, especially considering how few of those 200,000 are actually reading what's posted - 0.3% at any time. It's lovely to think we're "important", but a good rule of thumb - those who actually have to say they're important, rarely are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've no doubt federal authorities are reading this sub - sadly, given the sometimes violent rhetoric here, I have to hope they are - but actively participating? Not seen evidence for this, on any meaningful level.

       There is a specific type of content here that I think would catch their attention. And I'm certain they are in Worldnews as well. That would be an easier case to prove. I remember one thread where a guy who was 8 months old never posted a thing except for one in a worldnews thread that got like 200 upvotes and was at the top of the thread. It was about Israel, but I can't find it at the moment.

       One mans Propagandist is another mans PR guy, is another mans shill. What this comes down to is motive. If these people are simply engaging in conversation and stating opinions that is one thing. Astroturfing, buying accounts, trolling, multiple accounts all that. This is a complex issue and we shouldn't be pointing fingers, but at the same time we should be aware of the actors. Just like anything else.

       Apparently since I don't agree with 95% of what is posted here I am a shill instead of someone trying to expand my views while giving information I know of. Instead of information in rebuttal I get called and shill and that's all.

       Everyone gets called a shill, including me. That has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not shills are manipulating the top post in r/conspiracy. Assuming you aren't a shill and you are sincere in your posts and don't have some kind of strange obsessive need to defend the government at all costs, then I would say those accusations are bogus and the person accusing you is either a troll from
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">

       is very active in many subs, when in fact he has only posted a few times last month in the 9/11 thread I showed, and this recent 9/11 thread, plus one post in between about the holocaust. That is not even close to a believable account. It is clearly a lazy shill with 20 or so accounts and should be fired for incompetence.

       has to do mostly with NFL and 9/11 or a connection that can be made to 9/11. I just don't see the connection to him being a shill. So if he posted in UFO threads or something, it would make him legit? There are going to be people who disagree with you in life, you can't just write them off.

       I think you need to pay attention to the upvote scores.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, IP might be wrong, but I think it would be helpful if you could admit the possibility of paid shills is a real one.

       Of course there are paid shills out there, but let's not start a witch hunt.

       Question: are you denying the existence of shills/paid interns in general, or just on r/conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is that not your point at all?

       His very limited posting to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has to do mostly with NFL and 9/11 or a connection that can be made to 9/11. I just don't see the connection to him being a shill. So if he posted in UFO threads or something, it would make him legit? There are going to be people who disagree with you in life, you can't just write them off.

       It's... SHILLCEPTION!

       But I'm afraid "obviously" and "sure" aren't proof or even evidence. They're nothing but your opinion.
