<p>GHW Bush was involved in the assassination of JFK

<p>GHW Bush was intimately involved in drugs running and money laundering from his days as CIA Director.
It is not known how or why Noriega upset the American authorities. He was an integral part of the CIA&#39;s drug trafficking and money laundering operation from South and Central America.
He must of done something. He was replaced in a coup by GWH Bush.

    <div class="md"><p>Na.  Not making light at all of just how horrid the family is, but I wouldn&#39;t say the WB family is <em>the</em> most evil family this country has ever produced.  I&#39;d say perhaps they are the most evil <em>public puppets</em> that this country might have ever produced, but I wouldn&#39;t doubt that far beneath the social radar of any public scrutiny exist the family that has produced individuals that are the ones that <em>control</em> the WB puppets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And who controls them. The Harrimans are dead as are the Dulles brothers. They have passed from being puppets to puppeteers. Without them and a few others like them, the plutocracy would not have been able to accomplish the evil it has. They are the blade and they, long ago, put themselves into the hands of the wealthy. And now they are wealthy as well, and use other blades. Like Cheney. Rumsfeld. Tenent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeb Bush reminds me so much of Mitt and Ann Romney</p>

<p>All 3 of Jeb Bush&#39;s children have arrest records - Tagg Romney should be in jail for his dealings with Allen Stanford. </p>

<p>His Mexican wife also has an arrest record. She was caught smuggling jewelry and furs back into the country after flying off to Paris to meet with &quot;Carlos Slim&quot; who was in exile from Mexico after fleeing with a few billion in US dollars from the Mexican treasury after being charged with drug smuggling and corruption. 
She and Jeb used to vacation with Carlos Slim on his ranch in Mexico.
She was picked up for smuggling and arrested at the Allanta airport. </p>

<p>Mitt Romney got his seed money to found Bain Capital from an El Salvadorean drug trafficking family.
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2012/08/08-2">http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2012/08/08-2</a></p>

<p>Ann Romney should of been arrested over her $125,000 attempted fraud when trying to sell her crippled horse Superhit - who according to the vet was &quot;doped up to the eyeballs&quot;.</p>

<p>Jeb Bush is a hard core Neocon and an original signatory to PNAC in 1997 - the Neocon agenda. </p>

<p>The Bush family has a long association with and support Fascist policies, e.g. Eugenics. </p>

<p>Helping Hitler&#39;s rise to power and continuing to help Hitler even after America was officially at war with Germany. Prescott Bush was convicted of trading with the enemy in 1942.    </p>
