<p>The reason they don&#39;t use their full capabilities is because as soon as they did the American people would revolt.</p>

<p>Oh fuck did he really just explain the boiling frog concept? </p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason to believe this. It could be that slowly rolling it out lessens the impact of the information. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish you had the mental capacity to understand that what you just said is supporting my statement. Snowden is not the hero that people think he is. He is the slow roll out of the surveillance state. If he was a real hero he would have released all his information at once at let the public decide what to do. But by slowly releasing it everyone just sits back and lets the corruptions persist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is that more likely?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because everyday we keep hearing about new ways that they have been running surveillance on the entire world. If they didn&#39;t have more capabilities then the Snowden information would be done being leaked but the fact the he still has more information to leak shows they have more abilities than less. Is this concept to difficult for your mind to comprehend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surveillance is best effective when covert (entrapment, false sense of freedom). Otherwise overt (&quot;smile to the camera&quot;) it&#39;s main objective is to curtail wrong doing (similar to the mirror cognitive experiment).</p>

<p>Is Snowden an agent ? And whose ?</p>

<p>The government&#39;s reaction to the leaks means that either; a) they are true and exemplify the power of the surveillance state b) the government is play-acting as it co-conspires with Snowden (and Putin).</p>

<p>The &quot;dripping&quot; of information, instead of mass leaks like Manning-Wikileaks, is also important: a) keeps public attention focused, countering regular disinfo tactics by MSM (Bieber, Cirrus) b) keeps the government under pressure as the total information obtained and distributed by Snowden is kept unknown c) some information is extremely sensitive and can jeopardize the lives of agents such as their personal data, and best kept confidential, again unlike Manning-Wikileaks.</p>

<p>On the agenda part: a) The government co-conspires with Snowden in order to assimilate public opinion to this overt &quot;police state&quot; paradigm b) some group within the power-elite is unhappy with the breadth of the surveillance state and from within decided to derail it (tech industries, scholars) c) foreign power, China and Russia provided Snowden with the tools to fulfill his schemes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about this, too.  Something just doesn&#39;t feel right about the Snowden &quot;leaks&quot;, though I can&#39;t quite put my finger on what it is.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m still leaning towards him and his leaks being legit but I definitely have my doubts and, the information in the leaks being what it is (unverifiable to the average person), it&#39;s impossible to know for sure either way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He was controlled by the FBI, like for three, five years,&quot; she said. &quot;They knew what my son was doing, they knew what actions and what sites on the Internet he was going [to], they used to come...and talk to me...they were telling me that he was really a serious leader and they were afraid of him.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How could this happen?...They were controlling every step of him, and they are telling today that this is a terrorist attack,&quot; she added. </p>
