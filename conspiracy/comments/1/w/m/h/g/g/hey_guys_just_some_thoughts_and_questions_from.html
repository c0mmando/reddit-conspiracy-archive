       Now before you insult me for not believing let me say this. You guys have a usually pretty good and intelligent community. Although I don't necessarily believe in them I am aware of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes both sides of the issue (theorists and non) clash on Reddit. Both sides are filled with people  that make them look bad. I'm sorry to be rambling but I've been wanting to see what you guys would say for the longest time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said I have a few questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I prevent these conspiracies controlling my brother's life? I enjoy hearing them sometimes but its literally all he does. I want him to live a happy and easy ( not depending on our parents, sorry if its rude sounding) life. I feel as though he wants to be the martyr to begin a revolution and it pains me to think of him not being around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand being aware of the truth and all of that but how do I help him? I want him to be himself but also get a job, a girlfriend and a life. He's not happy and I can see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow what a long post. If you read it at all I just wanna say I'll respect you guys and the other guys because we will all be in this together in the future. I hope the mods don't delete this but all is well regardless. Thanks guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: going to bed right now. If anybody else comments I'll reply tomorrow. Thanks for being cool guys/girls.

       If he believes in it, you could convince him towards embracing action in some branch groups. If he starts making his own videos, gaining community contacts, he will go down a different path that may be better for him in the long run. It could potentially prepare him better for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       People on the other side of the fence are doing all kinds of entrepreneurial things, like running bitcoin businesses, being independent reporters who make income from youtube ads, donations, etc... moving to Chile and working in freedom societies. He's probably just unhappy because he's in limbo, but he could be more unhappy giving into a normal routine with all the ideologies already seeded in his head.

       I say branch because people take this stuff and run in different directions with it. Some people become hardcore gun toting freedom fighters who stock up for the end of the world and build bunkers. Some become infinite love new age keyboard warriors that think nobody should work but that government should make money out of thin air. Some become anarchist entrepreneurs and study free market economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say have him start listening to Philosopher + Voluntaryist, Stefan Molyneux, on youtube if you want him to get motivated to work harder and look closer at himself, while still embracing the "problems with the system" mentality. There are specific videos that may appeal directly to his situation.

       Yeah now I'm beginning to regret posting this. I am fully aware of what is going on in the world because he tells me what he hears. Whether I agree or not doesn't matter. I want him to lead a fuller life than the one he is leading.

       I guess I know what you mean. Its just disheartening seeing it control him. Im all for conspiracies and doing whatever you want. Maybe its just because its on a personal level. I just don't want to see him hurt.

       people routinely post threads on here feigning concern or trying to shame us into giving up questioning authority.    I figure the direct approach is best.   if you are a shill, or not - the answer is the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       take care.  good luck with your friend, be compassionate and understanding.  it's not easy.

        How do I prevent these conspiracies controlling my brother's life? I enjoy hearing them sometimes but its literally all he does. I want him to live a happy and easy ( not depending on our parents, sorry if its rude sounding) life.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have a feeling you have kids but he doesn't.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I feel as though he wants to be the martyr to begin a revolution and it pains me to think of him not being around.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He won't have to, by the time he even got some sort of plan together shit will be hitting the fan.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I understand being aware of the truth and all of that but how do I help him? I want him to be himself but also get a job, a girlfriend and a life. He's not happy and I can see it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's lots of guys out there just like him, can't get a job, girls don't want a guy who doesn't have a job. Basically he needs to know that he needs to get some sort of gig together, something that he loves to do. Yes it's easy to sit and say "meh, I'm not doing shit because shit is going to hit the fan" but no one really knows when it's going to happen. The Y2K people probably felt pretty stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       We might not see gas crash until 2030 and you never know maybe a break through will be made but you know what the secret of life is? Being ready for an opportunity when it happens. Did your brother buy any bitcoin or gold to get ready for when shit hits the fan? No? Because he didn't have money? Well if he had any kind of job he would've been in a position to buy some.
      </p>
      <p>
       But your brother is basically right to be mad at the way shit is and you do too. The "conspiracies" aren't even conspiracies, NSA and LIBOR should be enough for you to be taking the shit down.

       Tell him he needs to chill out and listen to the No Agenda Podcast. It livens up the conspiracy stuff.

       Tell him to not use the shit as a crutch. If you want him to get motivated take him out to get a lap dance, remind him how much fun chicks are to touch and that he should start getting a plan together to get the stuff that gets women (drives and food).

       Don't give yourself too much credit, bisexual girls are textbook. You probably have a history of abuse, it could be big abuse like someone fooling around with you when you were 8 or something that seems like it wouldn't be as big a deal, like your parents divorcing.

       It might no be denial, it's more about having chaotic relationships. Transgender people are "gay" but they're so gay they feel they're the wrong sex. Which is probably inside wiring.

       Then I would say that if you want to help your brother you should focus on the cause, not the symptoms.  My brother suffers from depression.  He is not into conspiracies, but he is always looking for proof that the world is shitty.  I think it helps him explain to himself how he feels.

       It's simple. If you want to control your brother's life then just do what governments do. Use the threat of violent force.

       Or you could just let him decide for himself how he wants to live his life... for better or worse.

       Your right. Overall I just don't want to see him die or get hurt. That's why I want to help or at least lessen the impact all this information is having on him.

       Edit: I mean lessen the impact as in not let it all overwhelm him.

       Maybe it's not conspiracy theory that's the root of the problem. If he's isolating himself and becoming fixated on one activity it's a sign of mental illness. If he's between 20-30 this would be a typical age for onset of a mental disorder like being bi-polar or schizophrenic. Maybe try to get the guy the some help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also be objective about it. I rarely read mainstream news other than here and my local paper. I prefer alt media because it covers a broad spectrum of topics and it's less influenced by advertising dollars. But to some people it looks like I spend all my time reading blogs written by people wearing tinfoil hats, which couldn't be further from the truth. I don't believe everything I read, but I'm an open minded guy who believes that you need to do some research and at least hear someone out. Look at watergate, how crazy did that sound at the time?That a sitting US president was so paranoid that he was keeping an enemies list, orchestrating burglaries and secretly taping everyone.

       We also can't force people to fit our molds. I have cousin who's talented with programming and CAD, has 2 degrees and could be making six figures. But he'll do about 2-3 contract jobs a year, netting him about 40k a year. He's in his early 30's living in his mom's basement and smoking pot 24/7 when he's not working. Is he reaching his full potential...fuck no. But the guy is happy, he's not hurting anyone, he's debt free and isn't a slave his responsibilities and debt like I am so I keep my mouth shut. Everyone has their own definition of happiness.

       Often time one's life is ran unbeknownst to you by things you're kept in the dark about, things you're not even aware of, and by forces more powerful than you can imagine.  In these cases, it is your "not wanting to believe in conspiracy theories" that keeps you ignorant and ensures your continued enslavement.

       Your above comment reminds me a bit of

       It might no be denial, it's more about having chaotic relationships. Transgender people are "gay" but they're so gay they feel they're the wrong sex. Which is probably inside wiring.
