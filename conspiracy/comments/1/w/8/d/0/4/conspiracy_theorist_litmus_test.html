        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I discovered something in Google Earth (not posted before on reddit), that I think most people will find more than a little curious. It would be interesting to see how people react to it - whether you think it is just an interesting coincidence, or whether it might be the result of deliberate agency.</p>

<p>By the way, there&#39;s no trickery. I have added wikipedia links with grid coordinates, and I would urge you to verify everything for yourself using Google Earth. If you do, please follow the instructions precisely, and please post to confirm whether your results tally with mine </p>

<p>Some of you may have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones">Georgia Guidestones</a>. They are a set of engraved stones which are allegedly associated with the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians and the New World Order. They can be located in Google Earth by pasting in the following grid reference: 34.231984, -82.894506. I&#39;ve put down a marker, and when you zoom in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/U3Nkhek.jpg?1">this is what you see</a>. The red line (of which more in a minute) goes all the way to the next site.</p>

<p>The second site is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a>, widely regarded as the scene of the worst mass shooting in US history. The grid coordinates are: 41.42, -73.278611. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9BdimsL.jpg?1">I&#39;ve put another marker here</a>.</p>

<p>I used the Google Earth ruler function to draw a straight line between these two points (a distance 722 miles). Those of you who know your US geography, will notice that the line appears to go <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4YyNtE9.jpg?1">quite close to Washington DC</a>. Hmmm, so what?</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s much more than just &quot;close&quot;. When you paste in the following grid coordinates 38°53&#39;20.28&quot;N, 77° 0&#39;33.48&quot;W  and press enter, you will be looking at... </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Xxd65bB.jpg">THIS</a>. </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives">US House of Representatives</a> on Capitol Hill, and the red line (from the Georgia Guidestones to Sandy Hook) goes straight through it. </p>

<p>So, where are YOU on the spectrum of possible reactions to this? A mildly interesting coincidence? Evidence of Masonic and US Government planning behind the events of Sandy Hook? Or somewhere in between? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you found though to be honest. We know that the guide stones were put up by ted turner under an occult pseudonym. We know that Sandyhook is a false flag meant to guilt the public into falling for gun control.(same as fast and furious) But what you illustrated doesn&#39;t really count as physical evidence. I don&#39;t know if you just subconsciously know these things are related (which they are, I&#39;m not disputing that) but consciously need some sort of linking factor? I&#39;d say keep track of the patterns in your head and not worry so much where there located. The NWO is going to spread it&#39;s tyranny everywhere so be prepared to recognize it anywhere and it&#39;s your RESPONSE-ABILITY to react to it accordingly by not getting on all 4s and sucking the man off.</p>

<p>However, when you create a path in google earth, it calculates the shortest distance overland between two points, and it  takes into account the earth&#39;s curvature. So the other images I appended are all accurate representations of that shortest possible route, including the image of the Capitol.</p>

<p>Not really.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s still using a modified merkatur projection which gives nearly accurate straight lines over very short distances only.  And the further north the line reaches, the more everything is distorted.</p>

<p>The problem is that the earth&#39;s curvature, for the purposes of that map projection, are approximated.  The Earth&#39;s curvature you see, is irregular.  Our planet is not a sphere but to make the math easier -- we pretend that it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine, but the only evidence that we currently have is that it does. </p>

<p>Anyway my contention is that this is not an accident.</p>

<p>It is possible that the Guidestones were specifically sited where they are (apparently in the middle of nowhere) because it was in line with a previously selected location (Sandy Hook) and the Capitol. </p>

<p>Or perhaps Sandy Hook was chosen because it is on a line with the Guidestones and the Capitol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response but I think you looking at this in a very superficial, and not very informed way.</p>

<p>Firstly, considering that many people in this subreddit (myself included) think that the events of Sandy Hook may have been pre-planned by masonic/illuminati elements within the government, it is not &quot;irrelevant&quot; - it demonstrates possible evidence towards that assumption.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you knew anything about the history of freemasonry in the United States, you would know that they are obsessed with grid lines and the siting of monuments in particular relationships with each other. Since both the Guidestones and the Capitol were built by freemasons, the fact that they &quot;point&quot; to a third, highly significant site is at the very least &quot;a mildly interesting coincidence&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe Sandy Hook was a Freemason planned event. I think it was most likely a kid going crazy because of SSRIs. That alone means there&#39;s no relationship to the other two points.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve considered the possibility that Lanza was under some sort of MKUltra type mind control and in that case it would have been planned. I&#39;ve read most of the threads here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about Sandy Hook but have never heard of it being a Freemason planned event before, let alone seen any evidence of it.

<p>I wasn&#39;t looking for &quot;irrefutable&quot; evidence. Just anything. And my intent wasn&#39;t to try to refute any either. I just wanted to see what you have.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not a Freemason. I&#39;m not a member of any organization and never have been (except amateur team sports). I&#39;m an atheist. I&#39;m anti-religion. I&#39;m anti-government. I&#39;m anti-corporation. I&#39;m retired. I was once described as &quot;quietly cynical&quot;. My IQ tests have always run 135-160. I drive an old Dodge PU that I paid $200 for 18 years ago. </p>

<p>Anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they are shills, its really annoying. They are as ignorant as ignorant gets.
worst thing being that they think they know whats really going on because they were &quot;let in&quot;. They dont even realize we know so much about whats going on without having been &quot;let in&quot; that we may know more. Its honestly really sad. When they are the only ones left, they will call out for help but we will no longer be there. </p>

<p>They really think they will be safe when all is done. They have no clue the actual implications of this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of curiosity, how did you discover this lineup?</p>

<p>What was the thought process that you used?</p>

<p>For example, did you draw a line between Sandy Hook and the capitol first and extend it? Or did you draw a line between the monument and the capitol first? Or did you draw a line between the monument and Sandy Hook first. If the latter is true, why did you pick that monument?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My base point was the Guidestones, because they have been linked with freemasonry (who are known for lining up buildings to other buildings and &quot;ritualised events&quot;).</p>

<p>I was originally looking at distances from the Guidestones to major crime scenes of the past couple of decades. However, I noticed that the line I created to Sandy Hook went straight over Washington DC, and when I zoomed and saw it passed through the Capitol Building, I almost fell off my seat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, unusual.</p>

<p>Seems like if this is really relevant, other Guidestones would do the same. Have you done Guidestones to the twin towers? One could be a coincidence, though an unusual one; but if all Guidestones pointed to something like this does, then you really have something.</p>

<p>By numbers, Sandy Hook at 26 fatalities was not the worst.  Viriginia Tech was 32. If you count wounded as well, Aurora was 12 dead and 58 wounded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t found any interesting places which are equidistant. If you draw an equilateral triangle (sides 722 miles) the third point is (disappointingly) in the middle of Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>The point with this Guidestones to Sandy Hook line is that it passes through the Capitol Building so precisely. I play around a lot on google earth, and this particularly lineup is the most exact I&#39;ve ever seen. </p>

<p>Incidentally, there is another straight line which links the &quot;3 Sandys of 2012&quot;, namely Sandy Hook Elementary, the location of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUEheeTJNak">Sandy Hook Boat tragedy/hoax</a> and the point in New Jersey where <a href="http://nypost.com/2012/11/18/billions-in-bearer-bonds-could-be-lost-due-to-hurricane-sandy-sources/">Hurricane Sandy</a> made landfall. </p>

<p>Even more interesting is the Greeley Massacre which also claimed the lives of 20 children and took place on 14 December. In fact I believe Sandy Hook was an &quot;homage&quot; to Greeley.</p>

<p>Greeley and Sandy Hook are also directly linked on this &quot;eeriley prescient&quot; business card from the 2011 film Dreamhouse. <a href="http://s1.directupload.net/images/130304/jr3a9ung.jpg">http://s1.directupload.net/images/130304/jr3a9ung.jpg</a></p>
