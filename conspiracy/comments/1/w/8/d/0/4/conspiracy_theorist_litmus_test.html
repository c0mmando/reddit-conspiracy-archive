       I discovered something in Google Earth (not posted before on reddit), that I think most people will find more than a little curious. It would be interesting to see how people react to it - whether you think it is just an interesting coincidence, or whether it might be the result of deliberate agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, there's no trickery. I have added wikipedia links with grid coordinates, and I would urge you to verify everything for yourself using Google Earth. If you do, please follow the instructions precisely, and please post to confirm whether your results tally with mine
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of you may have heard of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones">
        Georgia Guidestones
       </a>
       . They are a set of engraved stones which are allegedly associated with the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians and the New World Order. They can be located in Google Earth by pasting in the following grid reference: 34.231984, -82.894506. I've put down a marker, and when you zoom in
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/U3Nkhek.jpg?1">
        this is what you see
       </a>
       . The red line (of which more in a minute) goes all the way to the next site.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second site is the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">
        Sandy Hook Elementary School
       </a>
       , widely regarded as the scene of the worst mass shooting in US history. The grid coordinates are: 41.42, -73.278611.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9BdimsL.jpg?1">
        I've put another marker here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I used the Google Earth ruler function to draw a straight line between these two points (a distance 722 miles). Those of you who know your US geography, will notice that the line appears to go
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4YyNtE9.jpg?1">
        quite close to Washington DC
       </a>
       . Hmmm, so what?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, it's much more than just "close". When you paste in the following grid coordinates 38°53'20.28"N, 77° 0'33.48"W  and press enter, you will be looking at...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Xxd65bB.jpg">
        THIS
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it's the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives">
        US House of Representatives
       </a>
       on Capitol Hill, and the red line (from the Georgia Guidestones to Sandy Hook) goes straight through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where are YOU on the spectrum of possible reactions to this? A mildly interesting coincidence? Evidence of Masonic and US Government planning behind the events of Sandy Hook? Or somewhere in between?

       Well theoretically speaking, you can get that red line to go through at least 1000+ buildings, it's all a matter of where you place the markers.

       The Grid coordinates are all taken from the wikipedia pages (that I linked) for the three sites!

       If you use those grid coordinates, they create a perfect line, it's a simple as that.

       I'm not sure what you found though to be honest. We know that the guide stones were put up by ted turner under an occult pseudonym. We know that Sandyhook is a false flag meant to guilt the public into falling for gun control.(same as fast and furious) But what you illustrated doesn't really count as physical evidence. I don't know if you just subconsciously know these things are related (which they are, I'm not disputing that) but consciously need some sort of linking factor? I'd say keep track of the patterns in your head and not worry so much where there located. The NWO is going to spread it's tyranny everywhere so be prepared to recognize it anywhere and it's your RESPONSE-ABILITY to react to it accordingly by not getting on all 4s and sucking the man off.

       Map projections are always a little off -- reprojecting a 3 dimensional spheroid into 2 dimensions is problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So an actual straight line would, on that map, appear curved.

       I see what you mean. The screenshot which shows the entirety of the path (in 2d) can't be accurate, but I just posted this to give people an idea of what the line looked like.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when you create a path in google earth, it calculates the shortest distance overland between two points, and it  takes into account the earth's curvature. So the other images I appended are all accurate representations of that shortest possible route, including the image of the Capitol.

      <p>
       Not really.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still using a modified merkatur projection which gives nearly accurate straight lines over very short distances only.  And the further north the line reaches, the more everything is distorted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the earth's curvature, for the purposes of that map projection, are approximated.  The Earth's curvature you see, is irregular.  Our planet is not a sphere but to make the math easier -- we pretend that it is.

       I know, the earth is an oblate spheroid, but over a distance of 722 miles in an accurately mapped North America, the calculations are likely to be pretty accurate. Do you have access to more accurate 3d earth software which would settle this?

       Fine, but the only evidence that we currently have is that it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway my contention is that this is not an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible that the Guidestones were specifically sited where they are (apparently in the middle of nowhere) because it was in line with a previously selected location (Sandy Hook) and the Capitol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps Sandy Hook was chosen because it is on a line with the Guidestones and the Capitol.

       Thanks for the response but I think you looking at this in a very superficial, and not very informed way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, considering that many people in this subreddit (myself included) think that the events of Sandy Hook may have been pre-planned by masonic/illuminati elements within the government, it is not "irrelevant" - it demonstrates possible evidence towards that assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, if you knew anything about the history of freemasonry in the United States, you would know that they are obsessed with grid lines and the siting of monuments in particular relationships with each other. Since both the Guidestones and the Capitol were built by freemasons, the fact that they "point" to a third, highly significant site is at the very least "a mildly interesting coincidence".

       So, either you really don't know anything about freemasonry, and the fact that the grid that is Washington DC was intricately planned and built by freemasons, or, you're protesting too much because you're actually a freemason. I can't work out which.

       You're misinterpreting what I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe Sandy Hook was a Freemason planned event. I think it was most likely a kid going crazy because of SSRIs. That alone means there's no relationship to the other two points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no problem at all with conspiracy theories about the Freemasons. Sandy Hook just isn't one of them and is therefore irrelevant. It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       relevant to Big Pharma but I'm not going there in this thread.

       Nope. It's all about big profits for the big pharmaceuticals and conspiring to keep the side effects from the public. And that's not even close to the official story. They won't even discuss that part.

       I don't dispute this. Big pharma is always covering up negative data. But this isn't relevant to Sandy Hook which was a planned event. The crazed Adam Lanza is a media fiction.

       I've considered the possibility that Lanza was under some sort of MKUltra type mind control and in that case it would have been planned. I've read most of the threads here in

       about Sandy Hook but have never heard of it being a Freemason planned event before, let alone seen any evidence of it. I would not be a good skeptic if I didn't at least look at such evidence though. Could you point me to where I could see that evidence?

       I think the point of this subreddit is that we have to operate in the absence of names and irrefutable evidence. It's about building a case, of which my discovery of this link between the Guidestones and Sandy Hook is a part.
      </p>

       There is a masonic temple in Newtown which directly abuts Sandy Hook school. Gene Rosen has Masonic connections. Newtown is also the US hub for the Church of Satan.

       I wasn't looking for "irrefutable" evidence. Just anything. And my intent wasn't to try to refute any either. I just wanted to see what you have.

       No, I'm not a Freemason. I'm not a member of any organization and never have been (except amateur team sports). I'm an atheist. I'm anti-religion. I'm anti-government. I'm anti-corporation. I'm retired. I was once described as "quietly cynical". My IQ tests have always run 135-160. I drive an old Dodge PU that I paid $200 for 18 years ago.

       they are shills, its really annoying. They are as ignorant as ignorant gets.
worst thing being that they think they know whats really going on because they were "let in". They dont even realize we know so much about whats going on without having been "let in" that we may know more. Its honestly really sad. When they are the only ones left, they will call out for help but we will no longer be there.

       My base point was the Guidestones, because they have been linked with freemasonry (who are known for lining up buildings to other buildings and "ritualised events").
      </p>
      <p>
       I was originally looking at distances from the Guidestones to major crime scenes of the past couple of decades. However, I noticed that the line I created to Sandy Hook went straight over Washington DC, and when I zoomed and saw it passed through the Capitol Building, I almost fell off my seat.

       Yeah, unusual.

       Seems like if this is really relevant, other Guidestones would do the same. Have you done Guidestones to the twin towers? One could be a coincidence, though an unusual one; but if all Guidestones pointed to something like this does, then you really have something.

       Where's the third point if you were to make a triangle?

       Haven't found any interesting places which are equidistant. If you draw an equilateral triangle (sides 722 miles) the third point is (disappointingly) in the middle of Lake Michigan.

       The point with this Guidestones to Sandy Hook line is that it passes through the Capitol Building so precisely. I play around a lot on google earth, and this particularly lineup is the most exact I've ever seen.

       Incidentally, there is another straight line which links the "3 Sandys of 2012", namely Sandy Hook Elementary, the location of the

       I find the "20 bodies in the water" an interesting coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more interesting is the Greeley Massacre which also claimed the lives of 20 children and took place on 14 December. In fact I believe Sandy Hook was an "homage" to Greeley.

       Greeley and Sandy Hook are also directly linked on this "eeriley prescient" business card from the 2011 film Dreamhouse.

       What about Aurora? Isla Vista? Vegas? Or any other mass shootings?

       World Trade Center? Oklahoma City?
