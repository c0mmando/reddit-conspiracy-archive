        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many have suggested this be on the sidebar of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  I agree and advocate it&#39;s inclusion.</p>

<p>To make up/downvotes meaningless, you must change your <a href="https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/">Preferences</a>. About half way down the page, update and remove the following values:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t show me sites with a score less than (blank for none)</p>

<p>don&#39;t show me comments with a score less than (blank for none)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As stated, remove the values in there by default.  Both should be blank text boxes when you&#39;re done.  Click &#39;Save.&#39;  This will allow you to always see <strong>all</strong> comments in every post.  Known Reddit shills use downvote brigades (often times just one person with proxied multiple accounts, also the multimillion dollar &quot;persona management software&quot;) to censor what you see here.  Cripple that ability entirely, and see the open opinion of everyone here.  Not just the select few puppets of their choosing.</p>

<p>Spread the word to everyone.  Make their downvoting efforts meaningless.  Once widespread, they will be forced to use more drastic and visible censorship methods.  Do not allow this to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Irrelevant.  Their apparent goal is to hide certain topics from discussion.  With the default out-of-the-box settings, Reddit effectively hides posts with only but a few downvotes.  This forces the user to click &#39;show response.&#39; An action that not many people perform, making the censorship, for the most part, work.</p>

<p>Everyone should have vote based post hiding disabled.  I recommend you do the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my personal experience on this subreddit, the people that regularly post here often use the &quot;shills&quot; defense as a mechanism for defending their ideals. So, so, so, SO often have I simply posted a question or query on a post and the only response I get is &quot;rofl stupid shill&quot;. It is actually quite amusing how hypocritical people in this subreddit can be where they expect you to blindly follow what they say and if you happen to ask for clarification or post a dissenting view, then you get oppressed; the irony comes from that this is exactly the kind of thing that people in this subreddit complain about in real life society.</p>

<p>If people in this subreddit were actually interested in becoming somewhat credible, having a defense to your posts that doesn&#39;t involve calling someone a shill would be a good start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is only one group of people that are so fearful of being identified as a shill that they post about it frequently here.  Shills, thanks to very common actions, are incredibly easy to identify.  Once they are identified, they should be called out at every turn.  They labeled is with what they tried to make a derogatory title, and now the tables have been turned.  Shills fighting back from being identified.  Quite interesting to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) -120 karma count is largely due to the downvote happy denizens of this subreddit that automatically downvote people who disagree with them. </p>

<p>2) I am not anti-marijuana, and to say that I posted &quot;loads of anti-marijuana comments&quot; is not correct (in fact, I think I have been in a total of one discussion in which it was mentioned). I did not compare it to cyanide, I used an analogy involving cyanide to make a point regarding that legalising things for the sake of legalising things in the pursuit of personal freedoms doesn&#39;t make sense for all substances. Even if I was anti-marijuana legalisation, what would it matter? Do you consider it against a rule to have this opinion?</p>

<p>3) Regarding personal insults, yes, I will admit I do sometimes use them in an abrasive manner, however I do not think that is any worse than people constantly terming others as shills. Calling someone naive isn&#39;t necessary an insult, especially in the context of my response a few hours ago.</p>
