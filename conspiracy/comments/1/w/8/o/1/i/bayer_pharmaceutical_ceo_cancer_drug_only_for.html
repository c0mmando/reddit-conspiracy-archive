       This is ripe.  Just wait until other nations use baking soda like we used to, to kill cancer, and try to keep the news from us.  Or worse, they may start using weed.  This one is going to be fun to watch.

       Actually decent energy does sometimes help a bit, so don't think that your kind words are not appreciated and helpful in their own way.  They are, so thanks.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've thought about that very thing quite a bit actually.  He's in a
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       better place than the vast majority (if not all) of us here on Earth are.  And I say this whether one is Theistic or Atheistic.  In either case, I'd
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       rather be in his current shoes than otherwise actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, things are like this:  There either
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an afterlife, or their isn't.  If there is, then it is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       likely that he's in a
       <em>
        muuuuch
       </em>
       better place and a
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       better situation right now than he was while he was in his physical body here on Earth.  And if there isn't? then he's not alive to regret or lament anything anyway.  So it's all 100% good pretty much either way you look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it was lame that he had to go through two years of difficulty and pain battling cancer, but all's well that ends well I guess, and - again - he's
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       in a VERY good place right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main concern was/is for my sister - his mother - and other family members who don't look at the world in quite as consistently metaphysical a manner as I tend to.

       Fair enough. I know it usually feels good when a random stranger cares enough about any other random stranger to say kind words when going through something horrific. Its just more that, well, my words can't take away what he went through. Can't take away that he is no longer in you and your families lives. But, I do really think, regardless of any religion or what have you, that he has to be in a better place. And if there is an afterlife, the individuals who killed him by withholding that medication, will suffer for eternity. At least that is my hope. I pray that each and every second from the moment they decided to monetize healing people, is utter and complete agony.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another note, I am glad my words could do anything, no matter how little, to ease you and your family's suffering.

       Exactly.  This is part of why it is very much appreciated that you would take the time to be kind enough to say what you've said thus far.  So, again, thank you very much.

      <p>
       That's fair, agreed, and I understand that.  However, there really doesn't seem much about anything that can take away what he went through - not your words, not
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       words, not my actions or his mother's actions or anyone else's - so, within the context of the general lack of power that most if not all of us have to help the plight of any one individual if it is just in the cards for the individual to succumb to that very plight, the extending of positive energy from one to another I would say is always a very good thing.

       Physically, perhaps he's no longer in our lives.  He's
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       still in all of our lives, however.  I think about him pretty much every day and still talk to him/send him/his energy well wishes.

      <p>
       I think they'll suffer not so much for an eternity, but they will certainly have some serious, serious karmic re-balancing to do - in the process of which they will likely be the recipients of the same type of energy they extended and manifested to others.  Everything all comes back.

       Don't let that be your hope, my brother.

      <p>
       Let no one pull you so low as to hate them.

       To price a healthy existence is to succumb to internal American pressure. Sweet fuck, USA, what are you thinkin? Of all the advanced countries, you have the least to offer the world now. China, Brazil,  and Russia are more wholesome choices to explore. The American dream has become a gelatinous overindulgence, I hold no qualms.
