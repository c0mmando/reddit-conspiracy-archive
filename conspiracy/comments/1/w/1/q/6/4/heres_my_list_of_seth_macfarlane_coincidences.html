<p>Where he studied, Rhode Island School of Design, also says a little about what kind of people he may have connections to. That is, elite ones.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Greenberg">notable photography alumni student at RISD</a>, who graduated six years before Macfarlane, was almost certainly involved in the staging of Sandy Hook. See her &quot;End Times&quot; art exhibition and then see if you can stomach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svBktl_ofEQ">this</a>.</p>

<p>Seeing as how Macfarlane not only graduated from RISD but also holds an honorary doctorate (conferred in 2007), I&#39;d imagine he&#39;s pretty hooked up in the kinds of circles that appear to perpetuate the predictive propaganda machine. </p>

<p>Edit: Oh yeah, for the Sandy Hook stuff, <a href="http://unifiedserenity.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jennifer-greenberg-sexton-richard-sexton-phelps-sandy-hook.jpg">this might help you understand</a>. It&#39;s a whole lot easier to conspire when extended families and elite societies are in on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weird, sorry, the crucial link explaining that disappeared when I edited my comment. The kids are still alive. As in, the <a href="http://laurelzuckerman.typepad.fr/.a/6a010536460287970b017c34d8885c970b-pi">photos of the children they used in the media</a> were taken back in 2006. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv4-5yQL3-Q">Watch this video showing the older, present-day children in the most unlikely of places.</a> </p>

<p>Do you see it? I mean, it&#39;s not hard... For me, then, the real difficult part of understanding this whole event is fitting into the others, and trying to understand the why&#39;s beyond pure agenda-pushing (e.g. more gun control / psychiatry). </p>

<p>And most of what the conspiracy community has focused on has been the bloopers and the parent actors, but no one could explain where the children went before this Jill Greenb$rg link, and the Superbowl appearance of the actual kids, older. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, none of the first examples actually have to do with 9/11. And yes you are reaching way too hard on the Paul Walker coincidences. A grill lid does not have anything to do with a car, and the Brian quote you have to rely on assumptions and speculations. You said it yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of 9/11.. There was another episode in which Brian and Stewie go back in time prior to the attacks and incidentally stop them from happening. Well, moreso intentionally as the Brian character did it solely for fame and recognition, to appease his egocentric desires. From there, the storyline goes on to emphasize how the 9/11 attacks were &quot;necessary&quot; for the good of the country, else we would have descended into civil war (somehow; they failed to elaborate why exactly). </p>

<p>The point at which they return to the present, immediately after stopping their past selves from preventing the attacks, they watch a video of a plane hitting the WTC and high-five one another, and make a conspicuous remark as to how that could be misinterpreted by any 3rd party observer, an obvious reference to the &quot;dancing Israelis&quot; or Mossad agents rather who were arrested by the FBI on 9/11 after witnesses saw them high-fiving one another and celebrating the attacks as they were filming the WTC towers. The response from Mossad: They were there to &quot;document&quot; the event.</p>

<p>Sure is a strange combination of weapons to write into a Family Guy episode. Who uses windshield wipers to beat someone? This quote coming from the dog who replaced Brian after he got killed in a car accident, a very fast-moving car like Fast &amp; Furious. Oh wait kinda like Brian Terry who was killed in Operation Fast &amp; Furious?</p>

<p>Yeah bro these are all totally random coincidences not related in any way. Let&#39;s not look too hard into this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That show has many references to conspiracies. Such as the episode where Johnny is on trial for littering without a case. His mother argues it&#39;s a conspiracy much like the JFK assassination with a perpetrator hiding in the &quot;grassy knoll&quot;. Rachel MacFarlane is also credited for plenty of work on that cartoon(why would his sister also get voice work?).</p>

<p>Writing and boarding are sometimes done by different people. I don&#39;t know who would have boarded that episode and thus drawn in that poster. If Seth didn&#39;t do it I believe somebody wanted that movie poster in there.</p>

<p>Regardless the JB references are tiny in comparison to The Cleveland Show, American Dad, and obviously Family Guy. FG got cancelled and brought back twice. I don&#39;t know many other shows which get cancelled even once and brought back, let alone two times.</p>

<p>You need to know some people high-up in Hollywood to make that happen.</p>

<p>Think what you like but this post contains only references that I can remember. There are a lot more in his cartoons... ex: American Dad features a lovable grey alien to get people comfortable with this idea of ETs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That show has many references to conspiracies. Such as the episode where Johnny is on trial for littering without a case. His mother argues it&#39;s a conspiracy much like the JFK assassination with a perpetrator hiding in the &quot;grassy knoll&quot;. Rachel MacFarlane is also credited for plenty of work on that cartoon(why would his sister also get voice work?).</p>

<p>Writing and boarding are sometimes done by different people. I don&#39;t know who would have boarded that episode and thus drawn in that poster. If Seth didn&#39;t do it I believe somebody wanted that movie poster in there.</p>

<p>Regardless the JB references are tiny in comparison to The Cleveland Show, American Dad, and obviously Family Guy. FG got cancelled and brought back twice. I don&#39;t know many other shows which get cancelled even once and brought back, let alone two times.</p>

<p>You need to know some people high-up in Hollywood to make that happen.</p>

<p>Think what you like but this post contains only references that I can remember. There are a lot more in his cartoons... ex: American Dad features a lovable grey alien to get people comfortable with this idea of ETs. </p>
