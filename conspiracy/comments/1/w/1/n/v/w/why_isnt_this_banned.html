       Why isn't the use of biosolids as fertilizer ever mentioned or blamed for some of the diseases we see now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Biosolid fertilizer is used on almost all commercial farms now.  It is raw sewage (human piss, shit, spunk, vomit, tampon juice etc) chemically treated and then put into tankers to be squirted on your vegetables.  Some of you may be aware of the stench of this manure, it is not animal manure, it's human manure.  We are all eating human shit, even most organic farms use this human waste as fertilizer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be safe, but hey, it's a fucking disgusting thing for them to do to us.

       It seems the organic bunch have banned its use (thank god), but it's still used in most commercial farms.
      </p>
      <p>
       It came about because governments banned dumping sewage in the sea, so they put it in our food instead.  The Wikipedia page has lots of info.

       Is actually bad for people somehow?  From my understanding, feces has been used as fertilizer for crops for a long long time.

       It's disgusting to think about but the fertilizer is the by product from sewage treatment plants.  For example there is
       <a href="http://www.mwra.state.ma.us/03sewer/html/baystate.htm">
        Bay State Fertilizer
       </a>
       which comes from the Deer Island sewage treatment plant in Boston Harbor.  Before raw sewage was treated at Deer Island Boston Harbor was an open sewer.  The treated sludge from Deer Island has to be disposed of somehow, and there's some benefit when it's used as fertilizer.  It's probably the same all over the US and better than not processing sewage at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use non-toxic unscented dish detergent to wash all fruits and vegetables and then rinse them really well, but the fertilizer does get into the plants on a molecular lever so it is kind of gross.

       So what DO they use? Anything other than natural waste fertilizer is by definition non-organic. Are they using triple 12 chemical fertilizer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they ripping us of by charging the massive premium for organic that is grown in commercial industrial methods?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always used chemical fertilizer in my farming endeavors, mainly because it's cheaper than the high-quality natural animal waste fertilizer, and easier to apply.

       Fertilizer doesn't have to be poop, it can be composted things too. Also, you don't have to "fertilize" in the now common sense, there are other methods.

       Because the sad fact is, all the chemical byproducts left from "sterilizing human waste" are already in the groundwater, and raining down on us. Even if you farm organically, there's still much left in the water, worldwide. We've saturated the planet in chemicals &amp; pharmaceuticals.

       70% of all antibiotics consumed on earth...are taken by animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why you can buy fish tank antibiotics for prepping (and I personally would and with no liability for your own actions encourage you to do so) and compare them to the antibiotics you'd get from a pharmacy, and they'll be identical right down to the manufacturer and batch.

       Are you being serious?  Firstly animal manure comes from grass eating animals, their shit is so nutritious you can eat it.  If you eat raw human shit it can kill you.  Please read the Wikipedia link I gave, it contains lots of info on just how dangerous this practice is.

       So what is the problem? Sounds like you solved it, just take yourself right to the source and start eating that shit directly. Done.
Easy solution.

       That's the mammal manure. China uses fucking BIRDS, which is like, helloooooo?! The uric acid is directly in the poop.

       LOOK AT YOUR LABELS, folks. As fucked as the USDA is, don't buy products not made in America. "DISTRIBUTED BY" is a product to avoid, especially if they don't label the country of origin. Imported speciality foods are one thing (Nutelllllllaaaa, drool.) But look at your cans and boxes. Buy real food, locally as possible.

       I thought everything you detailed in the post as raw sewage...was the only fertilizer allowed for growing organic. Using anything else would be created/chemicals and thus not organic. 
Is there some difference between animal and human wastes that makes one or the other unfit for this purpose? 
The touted-as-healthy Japanese used human waste almost exclusively for centuries for agriculture, look into 'Nightsoil'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I notice the greenest place on my farm, even compared to the chemically fertilized areas, are the plants that thrive at or below our sewage discharge field pipe.

       Ok. So not to gross you out or anything BUT this is the SOLID portion of what comes out of waste treatment plants. Do you know what happens to the aqueous result of the treatment? Ooooohh snap! Right back into the drinking water supply! Turn on the tap... there it is! Thank goodness for chlorine, amiright? Any way this is actually a really good use of biosolids and it really helps to reduce point source pollution. Reduce, reuse, recycle.

       In good news, organic farms cannot use this toxic mix of pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, carcinogens, and human excrement. In bad news, poor people can't afford to buy organic! People think they're feeding their families healthy meals, vegetables full of vitamins and minerals, but...vegetables are what they "eat" just as we are...
