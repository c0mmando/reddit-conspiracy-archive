       The brain is a computer. It is connected to a series of devices like optics, sensors etc that send electrical signals back to the computer and it processes it. Hence why if you remove a nerve then you removed the sensor that transmits the pain signal.

       Your white blood cells are just like nanobots that fight off attackers much like an anti-virus system. Even bacteria have a complex clutch gear system, Google images 'flagellum clutch'

       Sleep is just system maintenance and needing to reboot to clear our cache.

       We have 5 senses directly connected to the computer. We know other realities exists outside our senses like magnetic fields, infrared and lots more that we are developing devices at the moment so our computers can process this information:

       To upgrade the 'Human Robot' we combine the genetic sequence of a male and female to create a system of where the robots will upgrade 'naturally' through evolution.

       Nothing is solid in the universe, inside atoms is just energy and vast empty space. Solid things feel solid because they push back at you the more atoms they have. A huge amount of scientists believe that the universe is a hologram:

       If we are indeed not just artificial intelligence then its quite possible that our consciousness might be wirelessely transmitted to our brain. In case of death of our robot then we might awaken, our consciousness might be sent to the recycle bin as it is outdated, we might even pay some currency and play again.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are always worried about robots becoming self aware. Maybe we were the robots that became self aware and are just robots, creating robots...

       You have perfectly described the metaphysical dilemma that science has no answer for. This falls within the philosophical realm if Leibniz, Teilhard, and Hegel.  Our soul is immortal and each body is the physical projection if that single point in space and time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually had the same thought a few days ago...of robots gaining self awareness. I think it is more logical to say we are becoming more mechanical and logical in our thinking, more like a computer.

       According to science, it is not. However, philosophy holds that if the soul exists it cannot be explained by modern science, only by mathematics, specifically calculus.

       What do you define as poetry and art? I see them as projections of the artists' emotions presented in a way that others can interpret. Granted, computers are not (yet) capable of emotion. However, if you take a reductionist approach and define emotion as simple mathematics and chemical processes, it is not a stretch to say that computers could be capable of them.

       But then would they be prophets? Wouldn't "trendsetter" or "visionary" be a more appropriate term. "Prophet" implies they are receiving commands from a higher power and spreading those commands to others, yet most artists claim their own reasons for an idea.

       I don't think our consciousness is in any way separated from our physical body.
      </p>

       I also think the connections/communication we have with other humans are as yet not entirely understood, even as it has proven to be too easy to manipulate.

       That this often requires violence, destroying those bonds, is only evidence that we have much more to learn about ourselves.

       How about willingly shut off? As in, by the person who's mind it is. What I mean is, you can't just not hear something. Maybe you can not listen to a certain extent, but your ears are always hearing.

       Too tough to tell, as the majority of the front of his pants are facing away in the picture on the left. I'd say the pic on the right was taken first, as it appears to be just after what happened, and the pic on the left would have me believe that he has already handed off the small child to someone who can take care of him. I wouldn't assume that he would be in a crowd bring pushed away by firemen with the child in gray, and then rush help another child while dragging the one in gray with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean by my earlier comment is, talking all the evidence in and making a conclusion, not just ignoring the evidence that fits the narrative.

       if you zoom in close on the blood splatter in the right pic, you will see that it is spread far enough around the front and side of his pants that you should be able to see it in the left pic, if it was actually there.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, note in the left pic that there is a slit in the calf of his pants, and not one speck of blood anywhere on his pants.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, it should be pretty obvious to any honest observer that the blood splatter didn't wash itself off his pants...which means the left picture was in fact taken first, which goes back to your original comment about theories derived from evidence, not evidence applied to fit the official story.

       Well the only evidence I can give (which is subjective and I was the only one to experience it) is on a Dimethyltryptamine trip. I saw the hologram we live in is made of hexagons with an arabic/tolkien elvish signature on each one. I also saw me projecting me here. I know it sounds outlandish, and if I was me back in 2012 I would have laughed at myself too. I think Hollywood is giving out secrets left and right too. Cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2 the main scientist had holograms of himself and when things passed through him the hologram dissipated as hexagons. In the movie Free Birds they use an egg constructed of hexagons to go to hyperspce (a dmt place as well) it too is outside of space and time. In the Hunger games 2 the holograms are constructed of hexagons. Jim Henson made a movie that was called "The Cube" in 1969 in which all these people come and go and in the end he finds out he was not real. The cube is the prison we all live in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting too that Saturn has a hexagon on it's north pole and an eye on it's south pole. Only due to some videos where people tie in Abrahamistic religons Judaism, Islam, and Christianity (in it's current form) to Saturn worship aka Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me I know how far fetched this all sounds, I am an engineer by trade and used to think conspiracies were for the wacky then in late 2012 I was attacked in my living room by what I can only describe as a trans dimensional reptilian entity. It literally appeared out of nowhwere and it looked surprised I could see it. It did nothing until I got scared and mentally thought how I would destroy it, that's when it leaped at me. My wife was awakened by my screaming yet she saw nothing but I was white as a ghost and since then my chest hair turned white. This started me on the path to find answers. I truly get how off the wall this sounds. However we need to be fearless as I believe these entities feed on our fear and anger etc...

       Forgive me for laughing, but hehe. Hexagons are interesting, and are naturally occurring, as exemplified by the hexagon on Saturn. Also,
       <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminsterfullerene">
        bucky balls

       are also naturally occurring.

       Thanks for laughing, I am aware they are naturally occurring. As I am aware of Platonic solids. Almost all chemical bonds are hexagonal. This goes pretty deep but giggle it up. You are not where you think you are. We are also under the influence of some serious evil. I KNOW how woo woo it sounds but please do some research in the matter before mocking someone. I have read  most biblical texts, Hindu Veda and Upanishads, dozens of buddhist books, Zoastrianism, Judaism (Torah, Talmud, Zohar) Christianity every possible version of the new and old testament going back to before Jesus christianity; everything is encoded subversive and hidden. DMT allows you to see behind the veil my friend. 400mg of harmaline (MAOI) and 150mg DMT fumarate, try it if you have the fortitude. Trust me I have a long history with psychedelics and KNOW the difference between hallucinations and what this was. The fact that everyone sees similar places and faces should tell you something. No other psychedelic does that, it's not the silly shit you see in movies. This is stuff so mind blowing and overwhelming language is not evolved enough to explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny you use carbon as your example that's where 6 6 6 comes from 6th on the periodic chart, 6 neutrons and 6 electrons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no religion as I am a godself realized individual. Not only that but I am a computer scientist as well, so I am not some right brained tart fantasizing shit. DMT was the last step in my intellectual pursuit as it is called the spirit molecule and I can assure you it is. It is released in large amounts at birth at death and in minute amounts when you dream.

       I doubt this was social conditioning. I saw this with open eyes as did my wife and nephew all on separate occasions with me withholding this tidbit for validation from them. When you close your eyes you are on the other side where things are shaped naturally almost like a mountain range or practically anything in nature look at the world maps. Reading Freemason book Of Morals and Dogma post this experience and the Hermes Cabylion I came to the conclusion that straight lines are not "good". Curves such as the curve of the conch or the fern leaf or eggs etc. are the work of the creator. That said, I believe this other group who definitely has control here tries to be perfect and beat the creator at his own game hence triangles and pentagrams in their buildings it's just too perfect. Cubes, and rectangles are constrictive forces where ovals and circles are expansive. I think the creator created us for us to have free will and the governing bodies want to control, restrict, judge etc. I see it all now as perfect, they are just seemingly opposing forces but both sides were created by the creator and demand equal love. I think it is a magnificent display of illusion and control that they have enacted upon us. Do not forget it takes two to tango and we by our own choices and actions have enslaved ourselves. Now we all need to wake up shake hands, say good show and create a better place for all of us. However I do believe this is wishful thinking and I know that no one seriously backs up their computer data until they have "lost everything" so I feel it will take us going to rock bottom to realize and recover as a species.

       As for the topic of this post Napoleon Hill back in the 1920's and 30's spoke about the brain being a broadcast and receive station. He was put to work by Andrew Carnegie to develop a model for human achievement. Carnegie as most here would agree would be considered illuminati, so then why would they have developed a plan for us to" think and grow rich" as the title of Napoleon Hill's book?

       When one has riches he then does not want to lose them so he "secures" it with weapons, walls and fear kicks in etc.

       Hey guys thanks for making convo!

      <p>
       I would like to add that ears are microphones and our vocal chords are just speakers. All molecules vibrate, and thus everything seems to be energy waves, all on the same spectrum just higher or lower. We only know about a tiny portion of this via what our body and science has found out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also every single molecules never touches and are vast distances apart, nothing is solid. The only thing that keeps them close is the energy field. All different states of matter are is just different types of energy field. More atoms = more energy fields = more energy you have to expend pushing that energy field if you want to move it. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. All just energy.

       I agree with all of your statements. I would like to add one bit and that is consciousness has created all physical matter. In fact the holy trinity is spiritual, mental and physical in order from greater to lesser. Each one has a parallel equivalent and one does not negate the other. As much religious study I have done I would have to say I have more experience in the sciences. I was reading Hawkings in high school in 1992-93. I have owned and used a telescope since 1984 and it was DMT that confirmed a creator. However, my work in the unified theory between the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics gave me the first clue of a creator. Again DMT confirmed this.

       I am against religion as I feel it is just a thought control system. Believe what you believe not what people tell you to believe. If you are a specific religion then you are bound by constraints. Choose the parts you believe, don't label your beliefs.

       I am a computer scientist and the hologram universe theory interests me as we are fast approaching the time where we can generate virtual universes ourselves. In a computer everything is electric signals and in our universe it is the same. We might be able to find 'glitches' in this universe that may help us understand if the theory is right. One example is variables that are constants that change:

       If a creator exists I think they just created the universe, basically pressing the start button of the simulation. Maybe we are just a simulation of the big bang, it could be mere milliseconds after the simulation started as time is relative. All this is just guess work, the real information is found by looking for evidence of the simulation.

       Religion scares me too, went to private catholic schools and was beaten by large wooden paddles and thrown over desks by "educators".  Became an Atheist at about 7th grade.

       I plugged into infinite intelligence and saw universes created nothing was shown to me that I did not already know. I am not claiming to be the creator but what I was shown and what I think we all are is extremely direct descendants. We play this game of life throughout eternity for individual soul development to ultimately return to the creator. Also, if we played as we truly are nothing would be learned. Think playing Mario on god mode without all the warps. Or Contra without up up down down. It has to be on ultra hard mode to get a true appreciation of the creator and creation. Otherwise in "god" mode most games lose their appeal rather quickly. I am not talking about religion here I am talking spirituality. When you realize you are a spiritual being having a human experience versus a human being having a spiritual experience the whole thing makes more sense. I searched religious texts ancient texts gnostic too as once you see the other side you will look at our current sciences as I see our current religions very childish and cartoonish to what's really going on. Again I do not claim to have retained the trillions of petabytes of data shot at me for an hour but I do remember thinking all of this here and now that we are experiencing was like one pixel in a 4k tv to what's really in ALL of existence. I am extremely humbled yet relieved from my experience. I went from about a 95-98% of the time stressed out person to maybe 3-5% overnight. My only complain't or part I regret is now I see through all of the bullshit. Watching tv is a joke but a very sad one. I have unplugged over a year and a half ago but almost every public place has one. People talk about what they see on it from sports to politics to whatever and I can't buy it or care to discuss. I see through everybody's poor me routine. People have chosen from a very limited possibility viewpoint and put on that suit and pretend it is them.  We are infinite possibilities but our masters give us very small viewpoints. It has made me sad when I have always been a relatively happy person. The matrix, the Truman show, thirteenth floor these movies are the closet things to truth about here. The reason I am so vocal on the Internet now is I realized that I have used the Internet for my career and NEVER gave back. Grabbed this app or watched this training video yet never contributed back. I just hope what I put out will not make people believe me but hopefully question this reality and question the encircling snares that I feel are all too close in trapping us as a species into more slavery. I find it funny that in the Jewish stories that they left Egypt and out of slavery. If you study history at all I do not think the human race has ever been free here. Since you have watched these documentaries I think you can agree that these people in the videos are intelligent and seeking answers that cannot be found in any written book on this planet. Why do you think so many libraries have been destroyed? Why is DMT which occurs naturally in the brain every night when you dream illegal and a schedule 1 drug one higher than cocaine which I can vouch is a useless horrible drug that traps the user into doing more. I have never had any abuse issues with it but when you are on it all you want is more. If you do dmt properly as Graham Hancock says no one is doing this for fun. It is more intense than jumping out of a plane, I believe it is a death simulation nothing about the experience was fun but the intelligence communicating with me was funny "rarely".  I do not feel the need to revisit it any time soon but I will say for the seeker or the sufferer of the illusion it is the only thing I know that can give you some clarity in a compromised world.

       Yeah that was another theory I had a while back. That all of us return to the pool of energy/though when we did after we used up normal energy and converted it into
self aware energy. All religions seem to be descendants from a truer form of religion. Each new religion seems to confine the consciousness more and more.
Tv has always been a joke, the mind filter can be both a good and bad thing :) I'm glad your stress if gone. Stress is a large part of my life, but I find it keeps me
motivated as the stress is because I feel I am getting lazy or not progressing fast enough in my knowledge intake etc.

       The mainstream media is just like religion. Telling people what is 'real' and makes them believe this is what the majority think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am very interested in global politics, bad things are coming soon by the look of things. We should try our best to make people see the bigger picture to
improve the world and in doing so letting people be able to experience these thoughts and not be worried about war or putting food on the table.
We have come pretty far in 100 years though so I hope the trend continues. Sure the limited viewpoint is broadcast to the masses but as long as we are free to choose
then more and more people will start to see what is really happening. They just need to do some independent thinking.

       And don't get me started on this fiat currency system they managed to get us to accept! Print, print, print...

       Library of Alexandria was the biggest case of destroying libaries ;)
The internet really did a lot of good, the talk of America wanting a kill switch is terrible.
The Chinese firewall is bad. As long as dreaming doesn't become illegal we should be ok :) Read 1984 ;)
Yeah its the same with Ayahuasca.
Also check out the god helmet.

       I believed life after death was bullshit until around 2 months until I let the logical side of my brain open to the idea and then went to seek all the information I discovered.
Now I am unsure, it could be programmed into the simulation for me to think like this. We will only ever find out for real when it happens.
But it seems more likely than any religion I have ever heard of.

       The God Helmet I like the sound of that, I will look I to that. Yes 1984 was one of my favorite books until I awoke in it. The Internet is the only thing that can save us we must keep it free. We all need to be willing to give our lives for the cause. And yeah why does the government borrow money when they can print it themselves lol. We need to just stop taking it in the ass here and stand up and voice our distaste. Refuse to vote and pay taxes as they cannot arrest us all. 2014 we ALL refuse to pay taxes pass the word along haha. Don't vote it's a joke. I stopped 14 years ago. Now I take George Carlins stance to remain sane. He said he watches the show with no vested interest in it one way or the other. He was my hero and was able to meet him in person and shake his hand. I was responsible for his rider when I was food and beverage manager at my city center 20 years ago. I forgot his glass request for the show and figured the city center had one, nope, I drove home in a fury and grabbed one of mine from my kitchen. When I handed it to him he said hey I got this same glass at home to which we both had a big laugh when I told him it was from my home. Love that man.

       Indeed a lot of my friends pushed me away for a bit after my awakening and became judgemental. However, the ones that stuck around have realized that after me helping them through divorces and work related issues have come to the realization there is wisdom in this insanity. Please PM me if you would like to discuss more. I saw the god helmet thing and yes it is interesting but seems more like a meditation device than anything like I experienced. Meditation is key to staying aware and try to meditate daily. What I try and tell people is the voice in their head or the thinker is not you, the one observing or listening to the thoughts that's you. The other voice is the ego and he's a silly guy! I have been I to bitcoin for about 4 years now and had I not spent it all in the dark webs I would have been rich, oh well. I feel that bitcoin has been compromised too since the fall of Silk Road it went up extravagantly. Peace

       I agree that the brain is a wireless receiver, and transmitter. Thats why some of the mind control stuff isn't as outlandish as people think.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all highly speculative, but what if in the material past we did something so atrocious that we have been stuck here since to learn the true meaning of the material existance. Forced to do it over and over until we can become in harmony with our surroundings and help other lower entities rise through the ranks so to speak. What if there is a group that wants to keep people stuck in the material. To prevent from transcending because they feed off the material. The material is the only place this entity wants to exist. Perhaps that is the definition of evil\devil\dark and compassion\empathy\love is the great equalizer.
