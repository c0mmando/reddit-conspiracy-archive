<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/us-media-blacks-out-snowden-interview-exposing-death-threats/5366499">US Media Blacks out Snowden Interview Exposing Death Threats</a> </p>

<p>This interview is nowhere to be found on the New York Times and this was filmed Sunday. MSM where are you at? Real journalists where are you at?</p>

<p>Quote from the article: <strong>&quot;The interview, broadcast by the German television network ARD, was largely blacked out by the US media. The New York Times carried not a word of what Snowden said, while the cable and broadcast news programs treated the interview with near total silence.&quot;</strong></p>

I think it&#39;s the fact that he implicitly says the US is using surveillance for ECONOMICAL reasons. There&#39;s definitely been a backlash about privacy, but when the WORLD realizes the corporate interests that are driving such surveillance, rioting will indeed ensue.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the point of watching people if they don&#39;t know they are being watched? Also remember this isn&#39;t just about the NSA. The NSA is the fall guy here. While/if the NSA gets its wings clipped the surveilance state will continue on in the public private partnerships between the security agencies and corporations like pay pal, ebay, facebook and google just to name the most obvious.</p>

<p>Most people have trouble accepting this idea but in case you are curious here is Naomi Wolf&#39;s take on it</p>

<p><a href="http://naomiwolf.org/2013/06/my-creeping-concern-that-the-nsa-leaker-is-not-who-he-purports-to-be/">http://naomiwolf.org/2013/06/my-creeping-concern-that-the-nsa-leaker-is-not-who-he-purports-to-be/</a></p>

<p>Scott Creighton thinks the point of the psyop is to ease the passing of legislation favourable to corporate interests.</p>

<p><a href="http://willyloman.wordpress.com/2013/06/19/the-missing-motive-of-the-snowden-psyop-cispa-yes-cispa/">http://willyloman.wordpress.com/2013/06/19/the-missing-motive-of-the-snowden-psyop-cispa-yes-cispa/</a></p>

<p>Yoichi Shimatsu believes Snowden is a dupe rather than a co-conspirator and notes the extensive ties betweens Greenwald&#39;s benefactor Pierre Omidyar and the nexus of private/public security corporations involved in internet spying.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/saving.html">http://www.rense.com/general96/saving.html</a></p>

<p>Could Greenwald be a spy, Shimatsu thinks that their are 250 million reasons to believe he is.</p>

<p>Mark Ames agrees</p>

<p><a href="http://pando.com/2013/11/27/keeping-secrets/">http://pando.com/2013/11/27/keeping-secrets/</a></p>

<p>In fact once you start to look closer at this theory it starts to make a lot of sense.</p>

<p><strong>If you accept that 90% of the mainstream media is owned by the intelligence agencies then why does it make sense that those media outlets would so enthusiasticaly cover the Snowden story when they have been so diligent at avoiding and minimising every other whistleblower story unless you also accept that Snowden is their boy. This is their coming out party.</strong></p>

<p>The most worthy thing to note about all this I believe is the misdirection. All the coverage is about the NSA. The security agencies do not need the NSA to operate.</p>

<p><a href="http://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/mass-surveillance-and-no-nsa-it-happens/">http://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/mass-surveillance-and-no-nsa-it-happens/</a></p>

<p>By all means rag on the NSA and their immoral spying programs. But don&#39;t forget to tell your political representative when you write them, because you are going to write them right, that Internet spying is unacceptable from any public or private organisation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So We the People have to fight <strong>two</strong> revolutions at the same time? Can we like put that on hold or something until after the SuperBowl? But seriously, We not only need to turn up and turn out for the Snowden showdown and get our lame asses into the game, but We need to first come up with a plan to get ourselves free and clear of this corporo-fascist pincer assault on our privacy and liberty. That being said, I suggest We adopt a strategy that redirects the malicious, duplicitous energies of these parasitic power junkies toward each other. As to specific tactics to employ to that end, I am not <em>personally</em> going to write to my freaking batshit bought-and-paid-for (trust me) representative who doesn&#39;t give a shit about my opinion. No, I have other ideas, eg, We found our own <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/20/science/20CODE.html">encrypted</a> telecommunications networks and non-profit banking entities. In no uncertain terms, We the People should assert and officially establish our own separate but equal estate independent of the government &#39;representatives&#39; who overwhelmingly represent the interests of their corporate masters. How to go about organizing this effort is another problem, but if entities like Bitcoin and Mozilla and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank">Grameen Bank</a> can do it, then We can look to those models for clues as to how to proceed. All in favor of getting in on this conspiracy say &#39;Aye&#39;. The rest of you feel free to write your &#39;official&#39; representative.         </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where to begin... I was going to use this as a reply to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1we1kd/new_edward_snowden_interview_instead_of_circling/cf1c5e0">ObeyTheCowGod</a> but decided to just make it my comment to the video. I feel it answers some questions in this thread. My answers come from Snowden, and a bit of my insights. Here is to everyone.</p>

<p>Did you see the whole interview? Its 30 minutes long and quite the view. Emotional, edited and cut for your viewing pleasure.(Question: Why the need to edit and cut? Why not just one camera where you can see both parties?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the point of watching people if they don&#39;t know they are being watched?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Information is beneficial to national interests of the US and not its National Security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yoichi Shimatsu believes Snowden is a dupe rather than a co-conspirator and notes the extensive ties betweens Greenwald&#39;s benefactor Pierre Omidyar and the nexus of private/public security corporations involved in internet spying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the issue is about Snowden here, not Greenwald. Edward Snowden left those documents to a journalist, someone who works to inform the people. Snowden let Greenwald decide what information should be release to the public.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could Greenwald be a spy, Shimatsu thinks that their are 250 million reasons to believe he is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone could be a spy. Snowden gave those files away to journalists. People who worked to inform the public about these revelations. They will decided when to release the information. Whether they are doing it for money, well duh, he is a journalist. That is his JOB. He kind of does get paid to do that. Although I do wonder myself why they can&#39;t just release these files all at once.</p>

<p>If you accept that 90% of the mainstream media is owned by the intelligence agencies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it seems easy to say that the MSM is &quot;owned&quot; it is not entirely true. They are rather just another tool to be used by these intelligence agencies</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then why does it make sense that those media outlets would so enthusiasticaly cover the Snowden story when they have been so diligent at avoiding and minimising every other whistleblower story</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, because &quot;those&quot; 10% are not &quot;owned&quot; by the intelligence community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>unless you also accept that Snowden is their boy. This is their coming out party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in order to answer your question, I have to accept Snowden is their boy. Exactly, whose boy, is Edward Snowden?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most worthy thing to note about all this I believe is the misdirection. All the coverage is about the NSA. The security agencies do not need the NSA to operate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont know if you truly did watch the video, but Snowden does touch upon this. Its about the advantage of government contractors.He describes it as a, &quot;complex topic, driven by a number of interests, between primarily limiting the number of direct government employees, and at the same time, as keeping lobbying groups funded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By all means rag on the NSA and their immoral spying programs. But don&#39;t forget to tell your political representative when you write them, because you are going to write them right, that Internet spying is unacceptable from any public or private organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The law states, Internet spying is unacceptable by a public or private organization. Spying implies intent to use information against the person(s). The government does not spy, as they do not use the information gathered, against us. They collect data, not use it.  </p>

<p>some words that really caught my ear. Said by Snowden himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter how deeply an individual is embedded in a government, no matter how faithful they are
in the government, no matter how strongly they believe in the causes of their government
(as i did during the Iraq war): people can learn, people can discover the line between
appropriate government behavior and actual wrong doing. it became clear to me that line had 
been crossed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and at the 12:28, did anyone else catch this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I...(appears to want to say i don&#39;t know) should not say</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit:For only grammar, I, am obnoxious.</p>

<p>We should be talking about what Snowden addressed in the video. The discussion is not about what payroll Greenwald is under. If you would like to discuss those things, feel free to created a new post, where we could discuss the issue you feel so strongly about. </p>

<p>I never discounted Sibel Edmonds&#39; concerns. This is the first I am hearing about her, so how can I even discount her concerns?</p>

<p>You would do well by not discounting Edward Snowdens&#39; concerns.</p>

<p>On the other hand, though, it wouldn&#39;t seem to make much sense for the intelligence agencies to purposefully out themselves and their blatant corruption to the masses.</p>

<p>I accept the validity of his revelations and their importance to millions of Americans but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t still have questions about the whole thing, mainly with regard to the fact that most of the information he&#39;s leaked has already been spoken of at length by previous NSA whistleblowers.

    <div class="md"><p>I can kind of make sense of that but why would the CIA, who also relies on operating in the shadows/with little to no oversight, want to shine a light on a fellow intelligence agency (and thus draw more attention to themselves, even if indirectly)?

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with this &quot;Snowden is a CIA black Op&quot; stuff is that it sounds exactly like the rest of the garbage about Snowden:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Snowden is a Russian spy</p></li>
<li><p>Snowden is a Chinese spy</p></li>
<li><p>Snowden looks like a little boy</p></li>
<li><p>Snowden is a drop out hacker</p></li>
<li><p>Snowden is a traitor</p></li>
<li><p>Snowden is a CIA black op</p></li>
<li><p>Snowden is just acclimating people to the security state</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The CIA controls the media. The  mainstream media appears to be covering this story with damage control in mind. They cannot just ignore it because then more people will realize the media is controlled, so they cover what they can and bury what they can. So if this is a CIA black op, then why would the CIA-controlled media be censoring parts of their own black op? </p>

<p>Another thing: Corbett is one of the main proponents of this theory. He runs on donations. He is losing views because more people are focused on Snowden/Greenwald. Anyone stop to think maybe he&#39;s jealous and riding this story for money? </p>

<p>Some people here think Snowden is a CIA black op because he was working for the CIA before. Would that make all CIA whistle blowers black ops? Some people think snowden is an NSA black op designed to give the NSA more power (stupid, I know), and other people think Snowden is just acclimating people to the security state. So which is it? This all seems like garbage to me. It&#39;s just made up shit by bored people who want new, edgy conspiracy theories because the NSA scandal went mainstream. Now they have to be different from the crowd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed with all of your points here and I haven&#39;t really come up with a credible reason for what the point of the &quot;op&quot; would be.  All it&#39;s really done is draw global attention to the corruption, abuse, and lack of oversight for the &quot;international intelligence apparatus&quot; (or whatever name you want to give it).</p>

<p>I guess my official stance at the moment is that he is legit, he is a patriot, and I owe him my thanks.  There&#39;s just <em>something</em> about it, though, some kind of nagging doubt that there <em>may</em> be something more to the whole thing.  Where are the bombshell leaks?  Does he not have them?  Do they not exist?  I don&#39;t know, these are the lingering questions that keep me just a tiny bit skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greenwald, on his AMA, specifically said he and others who report on this story submit leaks at specific times for various reasons. They have to comb through all of the documents, re-read them, write articles, submit them to the government for redaction requests (some elements of spying are legitimate), rewrite the articles, proof read and then submit <em>with strategy in mind.</em> Imagine if he wrote a shitty inaccurate article. The media would parade that around for years. </p>

<p>The pubic is fatigued with the story in general. But, even with the two stories submitted yesterday, most people still aren&#39;t aware that they basically said the GCHQ has a live feed of the internet and they target specific people with propagnda. Nobody is talking about this because very few people actually read the stories. This sounds a lot like they use the NSA spying for 3 reasons: </p>

<p>1) Spying on the population </p>

<p>2) Using the material to target certain areas with propaganda</p>

<p>3) possibly used in the Sentient World Simulation program</p>

<p>So most people saw the angry bird story and didn&#39;t even read the other one <a href="http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/27/22469304-snowden-docs-reveal-british-spies-snooped-on-youtube-and-facebook?lite">http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/27/22469304-snowden-docs-reveal-british-spies-snooped-on-youtube-and-facebook?lite</a></p>

<p>That seems like a pretty big story. Also, Plumlee has stated that there&#39;s basically 2 CIA&#39;s. One good, one bad. Being in the government doesn&#39;t make you a criminal gangster. So this is slightly more complicated than everyone is trying to make it out to be. It&#39;s easy to say &quot;Russian Spy!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the OP, but I can tell you personally how I&#39;m on the fence.</p>

<p>So far I haven&#39;t seen any direct evidence of domestic spying. I personally believe that it can be inferred based on the ease with which Snowden himself gained access to so much information, but so far all I&#39;ve seen is about information used against foreign targets and whose primary purpose is financial.</p>

<p>Both of these conclusions should have been self evident, based on a variety of sources prior to Snowden&#39;s revelations.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is still yet to come, but that would be why I&#39;m on the fence. As a superpower we do have a responsibility to gather intelligence on other nations. Whether or not this information is being properly used is an entirely separate matter. </p>

<p>....ALSO</p>

<p>There are also a lot of questions concerning a certain billionaire which was able to buy access to and prevent the release of many documents by a certain journalist entrusted by Snowden, which have been almost entirely ignored by this and other communities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im starting to lean on him being the pr frontman to a real leak/whistleblower.</p>

<p>i beleive the leaks are/were real and the info was going public regardless of what happened to the person really responsible for the leaks. </p>

<p>the person we see before the cameras is just the public face whos job it is to put the spin on the leaks and do damage controll when needed.</p>

<p>If the leaked info was real and could not be stopped the next best thing would be to get out in front of it.</p>

<p>i mean really everything that has been publicized so far has been more or less  common knowledge amongst the type of people who follow this sort of stuff for years.</p>

<p>maybe im wrong but i bet the real leaker is dead. probably picked up on some airline while trying to leave the country and dissapeared.  I dont watch msm hell i dont even have cable tv as im a happy cordcutter but i wouldnt be surprised to hear about somr flight getting grounded with somebody getting arrested for some reason that contradicts the inevitable cell camera youtube upload and eyewitness reports of what happened.</p>

<p>this edward snowden is a dog and pony show to controll the message from the real leaks and to serve as a warning to the real leakers coconspirators.</p>

<p>i could also just be suffering paranoid delusions brought on from various head trauma and substance abuse that hss plagued my life. this ed snowden might very well be the real deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting angle that I hadn&#39;t considered before.  My only thing is that if the real whistleblower is dead (or at least, we can assume, imprisoned somewhere), then why would any more leaks have to come out?  I guess I just can&#39;t come up with a reason for why the leaks would have to go public if the whistleblower isn&#39;t around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the leaks already were out and were either public already or in the process of going public. The whistleblower was caught and dealt with but not before the info he had was released. The point being the damage is done as far as the info leaked is concerned. Now its all about damage control. What was leaked how big was the leak who is involved in the leak how damaging is this leak going to be. These might very well be unknowns to the NSA/CIA. This would explain why Snowden is saying he leaves it up to the journalists to decide on what issues should be reported on. Its because he is not the real person behind the leaks and they have no way of knowing for certain how much stuff was leaked.
Another thought would be that by taking credit for certain leaks this snowden can also deny other more potentially harmful leaks. T</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, Snowden did what he did INITIALLY for righteous reasons. The problem is that with time it must have become clear that he would end up in a  morgue if he didn&#39;t find a way to use this information as a bargaining chip to assure his safety. This requires a go between connected enough to protect themselves, reliable in the eyes of the gov&#39;t, but who also has a vested in the information and could use control of said information for their own gain.  It would have to be someone with enough money to not simply be bought off. Basically a person with clear enough motives that both the govt and Snowden can feel confident they are not being played by a double agent. Ebay guy fits the bill across the board. The govt gets a handler for the whistle blower who can use reasonable discretion to Bavoid revealing anything truly worthy of sparking a revolution. Snowden gets some marginal guaranty of safety, and can still divulge his information completely to a select few, while also opening a line of communication to make clear what he can and cannot disclose to the world at large. Ebay guy  gets the information, clout within the govt and foreign powers for not releasing anything too serious, a unique position of authority in modern history , and a head start at creating a new consolidated MSM outlet.    Looking at it from this perspective it is still a conspiracy but a rational one.  Sniwden isnt a black op, jyst cooperating to the  minimum degree he is being forced to. The govt   motives are clear withiur the need to expkain WHT they wiuld create such a byzantine and elaborate scheme with so little to pitentially gain. Ebay guys wins from every angle and gains  tangible effective power in the world, which is the next goal a person would persue after pure wealth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take it as a given that the government is simply persuing a greater degree of  knowledge and control over the entire planet. No self aware power structure would choose to do anyrhing but that, if it was possible.Snowden acted on his moral compulsion to do the right thing, and must now backpeddle and  mitigate the consequences of his decision. All the people who are in a position to, are using this opportunity to get a piece of the action. It isnt really a secret that this is how the world probably works. Any question of adherence to the rules,  or the moral nature of anyone&#39;s actions inthis debacle misses the point that if you are really a PLAYER  in the game you ACT  if you are in a position to. The goverment  has the technology to observe and control so they do.  The whistleblower has the means and information (not to mention the training to convey it clearly... im sure they are trained extensively in the CIA on how to present information and how to withold it, in addition to theory covering propaganda and media). </p>

<p>Feel free to make a self post about this subject as I am not afraid in the least to defend myself against such ridiculous claims.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind that the rules of conspiracy will need to be followed and that I will give you permission in this one instance (if you make a self post) to formally accuse me of being a &quot;Holocaust denier&quot; for the purposes of this debate.</p>

<p>Here is where you will fail (I&#39;m telling you so that you can format your argument better)</p>

<p>I believe in the Holocaust. </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t believe in is giving people jail time for questioning an event that happened 75 years ago.  I don&#39;t believe that this one event in history was recorded without political biases. And lastly I don&#39;t believe that it was &quot;the biggest tragedy ever to effect man kind&quot;.  There have been far bigger mass murders and government policies that have cause a much greater number of deaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my god, why do people believe in Snowden? Oh, he&#39;s an extremely intelligent slacker who caught the attention of the government and was given special clearances he never should have had? A rebellious geek whose skills couldn&#39;t be denied despite his lack of formal qualifications? My god, he&#39;s just like me, so misunderstood and underestimated. He has a hot dancer girlfriend? He left it all behind to expose evil? my hero! It&#39;s so fabricated and sensational, I laugh when I see the guys carefully crafted &#39;hacker-punk&#39; look, or hear anyone seriously debate the morality of his perfect Robin Hood tale. Yet even the skeptics eat it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is anything &#39;fabricated&#39;? What happens if I don&#39;t &#39;believe&#39; in Snowden, is he a myth? What are you on about? 
So what he&#39;s a geek, do you have to be a non-geek to be believed? Here is a man who uncovered something that has is 100% proven to be true. NSA IS spying on everyone, it isn&#39;t made up, it&#39;s a fact.</p>

<p>Next fact is that it is extremely good to know what has been going on behind our backs. Or do you disagree with that?
If you&#39;d rather bathe in uncertainty to keep yourself sane than that is your right but other people are extremely grateful for what Snowden has done. I know I am and that is also a fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not neglect to address Greenwald. I linked to the user comment, which linked the articles that, you,  said I neglected.</p>

<p>We should be talking about what Snowden addressed in the video. The discussion is not about what payroll Greenwald is under. If you would like to discuss those things, feel free to created a new post, where we could discuss the issue you feel so strongly about. </p>

<p>I never discounted Sibel Edmonds&#39; concerns. This is the first I am hearing about her, so how can I even discount her concerns?</p>

<p>You would do well by not discounting Edward Snowdens&#39; concerns.</p>

<p>As to your first question, my post addresses the legitimate concerns raied in the article the said used posted. If you feel it does not address it in the right manner, by all means, please explain yourself.</p>
