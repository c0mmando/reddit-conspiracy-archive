       many people know that native american smoked tobacco in a "peace pipe" and treated it like a medicine for bonding not as a recreational drug.  my thoughts are that smoking tobacco does actually bring psychological benefits akin to the experience of true peace, and that perhaps to kill peace in the public mind smoking tobacco is first laced with chemicals and then shunned as an agent of death by the brainwashed public to reduce true peace in the minds of people.  anyone else have similar thoughts?

       Joe Jackson (The musician wrote a pretty interesting essay on smoking) here is a quote.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        LUNG CANCER, AND CONVENIENT NUMBERS
We seem to be obsessed with cancer these days, perhaps because the idea that something is still 
beyond the power of doctors and scientists scares the living daylights out of us. I don’t mean to 
trivialise; my father died of cancer. I do think, though, that we’re overly zealous in our search for 
scapegoats (recent media reports have claimed that we can get cancer from hair dye, soft drinks p 03
Smoke, Lies and the Nanny State
and oral sex). I also want to point out - turning the negative into a positive for once - that cancer 
is mostly a disease of the old, and another reason it looms so large is that we’re living longer and 
mostly healthier lives than at any time in history.
 Lung cancer is the disease most strongly associated with smoking, though even this is a 
statistical rather than a causative link. In other words, it has been statistically shown that smokers 
are more likely to get lung cancer, rather than scientiﬁcally shown that the cancer is speciﬁcally 
caused by the smoking. This is a more important distinction than it might seem. Much of the 
antismokers’ case is based on statistics, and statistics is not science.
 It does make sense - so long as you don’t mind bullying people out of their pleasures - to 
try to bring down the rate of lung cancer by getting people to quit smoking. But the evidence 
linking smoking with lung cancer is much less convincing than we are led to believe. For one 
thing, there is much disagreement about what the actual risk factor is. 
 The general consensus seems to reﬂect the pioneering studies of Professor Sir Richard 
Doll in the 1950s and 60s, which are still regarded as ‘benchmarks’. Doll reckoned that about 160 
in 100,000 smokers developed lung cancer as opposed to 7 in 100,000 nonsmokers; so you have 
about a 24 times greater risk if you smoke. This can also be expressed as ‘2,400%’. But beware of 
estimates of ‘increased risk,’ especially when expressed in percentages; they’re a good sign that 
someone is trying to frighten, rather than to inform.
 If you buy 25 lottery tickets instead of one, your chances of winning go up by 2,500%. 
But though the number sounds impressive, your actual chances of winning are still minuscule. 
 Likewise, if Prof Doll was right, you still have a 99.8% chance of not getting lung cancer. 
This is nothing more or less than a re-presentation, or re-packaging, of the same data. But it 
immediately sounds a lot less scary. Especially if smoking is something you love.

       Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of lung cancer across the globe.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        People who smoke are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke.

       If you believe death is peaceful, then, yes, smoking a lot of tobacco will probably bring you peace, albeit at the end of a protracted, painful, expensive illness.

       Tobacco was the first genetically engineered crop, in the late 1980s.  Surfactants and pesticides are unhealthy, but aren't found in the tobacco native Americans would grow and use.

       There is no basis for your claim. If you tell me I'm going to get cancer for smoking, and you told me the next week that you, in fact, just got diagnosed with lung cancer as a non - smoker shoudl I criticize you for not smoking cigarettes? Scapegoats are scapegoats, that's all. Say people start being diagnosed with a new type of cancer, and the only thing in common that they all have is that they wear Nike shoes. Do we blame Nike shoes? Do we blame the ability to be alive and the chance of cancer being a factor of having bodily cells? Statistics, when talking about the chances of something happening with any body, are complete unadulterated shitbowls of speculation. Basing my bodily function, and its ability to use its functions to fight off anything it comes across, with a completely separate body is blind research. We are all the same and completely different. I've legitimately been eating fast food, soda and fried-frozen oven food for 4 years. I don't go to the gym, run but I move around a lot physically. When I say "for 4 years" I mean : every fucking meal. Seriously. But I check out perfectly fine at every physical twice a year and I haven't been sick, for a single day, during that time. I haven't had more than 10 gallons of straight water in a year during my "unhealthy" tenure. And yet I'm healthier than most people I meet. Statistics when it comes to living and predicting "the future" is a complete farse.

       "Marijuana causes lung and throat cancer" --- and yet, it doesn't. Ever thought about sitting in traffic and inhaling all the exhaust? Do motor vehicles coming into effect and increased lung cancer rates not coincide? Yes, they do. There are thousands and thousands of products and by products that are released every year that cause cancer, glad you can settle on one that isn't proven to definitely cause cancer rates to increase. Sit in a room filled with carbon monoxide, you die. Smoke some cigarettes, there's no definitive proof that you're at a higher risk of acquiring lung cancer. Just after the fact-stats, that include people who are too proud to confess to everything they've done in their life that seems socially immoral.

       And I love it. It's been repeated, throughout my life, marijuana causes cancer. Just like cigarettes are accused of causing cancer. Just like oral sex causes cancer. And rock n roll was sent from satan himself. And Jesus walks on water. All theory, no proof because no one is honest. Tobacco industries are the least of everyone's worries. Have you ever had alcohol? I'm sure you partake from time to time, its poison. Direct, brain cell killing, liver raping, poison. And that's a fact.

       Define educated. A list of things about yourself, I'm sure. Now, scientific research cannot predict the future, or what's going to happen to anyone at any point in time. Nothing is definitive.  You're aware that even the constant of gravity is...not actually a constant. Do you not realize that most scientific studies are proven to be false? Plagiarized? Completely made up? It happens. All. The. Time. How do you think the researchers get funding? If they don't show any positive results they don't get funding, what a surprise. Now, e-cigarettes -- that shit is fucked. "Oh consumer, its water and nicotine." Right.

       In this case, it refers to an individual who posits that Satan exists and created rock &amp; roll. That Jesus existed and walked on water. That oral sex causes cancer.

       The interesting thing about science is that it is peer reviewed and repeatable. The moment those peers attempt to repeat the experiments and find differing results, the scientific community hears about it and goes about more experiments and more proving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if you want to deny the scientific evidence that smoking tobacco causes cancer, I can't stop you. Just like I can't stop anyone from believing in farcical fairy tales of a god who impregnates a virgin to give birth to himself to absolve his creation of the sin he created them to commit.

      </p>
      <p>
       I used to use a lot of snus and nicotine gum. Nicotine is an amazing drug. There's plenty of people who drink alcohol and then talk shit about cigarettes as if cigarettes = all tobacco. They are different and have different risks, snus's risks being relatively non-existent.

       Not sure what snus is...

       Google tells me it's that shit you put in your mouth. Yeah, a colleague of mine just had half his mouth removed because of that shit. Seems just as bad as smoking but statistically it's probably lower. I'm too lazy to look that up though especially since it isn't your main point.

      <p>
       Nicotine delivered in a manner that doesn't increase cancer risk? Yeah, that's a different animal and might be interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's quite a bit off topic of smoking ye olde peace pipe though, isn't it? Plus THC from weed would have a more potent impact, wouldn't it?

       I want to circle back on this, but I feel the cancer risks of cigarettes are very small.  Far less than we are told.  Around the exact same time, they blamed cigarette smoking on the massive increase of reported cancers.  Cancers likely caused by open air nuclear testing.  Tobacco was the good front to cover the governments liability for the cancers.

       Yes, they can be.  However our smoker to rates of lung cancer are significantly higher.  Abnormally so.  These is a distinct reason why cancer rates spiked during our heavy open air nuclear testing at White Sands.  The two coincide completely.

       Of course, one must bear in mind the tobacco they smoked isn't the same tobacco people smoke today; it has been hybridized over time to pack a bigger punch all around, and perhaps lack any moderating qualities the herb originally had. Tobacco was fine in the context of a stone-age culture; but it isn't fine in the context a modern consumer culture based on too much of everything. And by tobacco, I don't mean nicotine; which is an effective stimulant, and not a cancer and arteriosclerosis causing agent in tobacco.

       Tobacco plants absorb everything from the soil around it. You may realize that many houses have radon protection, which removes radiation when seeped in through the foundation of homes. Tobacco is filled with radiation and is notorious for destroying the soil it grows on. Being alive is the only ingredient you need to die. Everyone is greedy as fuck, what can you do?
