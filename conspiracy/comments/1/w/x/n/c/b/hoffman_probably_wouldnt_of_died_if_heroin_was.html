But three things for Heroin. If legal.</p>

<p>This belongs in this sub-reddit because our inability to deal with our addicts is now criminal. </p>

<p>1.Addicts would not fear treatment. Their addictions would be helped and eased into and out of. We might also have Ibogaine treatment for our opiate addicts.</p>

<p>2.Purer products. The inconsistency of heroin markets means that you may get something purer one day than you did the last. The average user doesn&#39;t know the difference and just shoots up. This can result in a hot shot and an overdose. Legalization means we would be able to buy certain purities with labeling guiding me on how much to use for my experience, height, weight, etc.</p>

<p>3.More education for the public to understand the signs and proper treatment without judgement and consequences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but on an industrial scale your heroin, tobacco, etc etc. It has certain standards it has to adhere to. </p>

<p>Heroin would be made en masse and would be homogenous enough to test the purity. The same way Cannabis in WA is being tested for THC and CBD. </p>

<p>Stores would sell only clean heroin and junkies would need much less to get their high. We would have labeling to provide guidance for doses based on height and body weight. Easily.</p>

<li><p>They might not fear treatment but there would also be much less incentive to seek treatment since they wouldn&#39;t have to be clean to keep a job or keep their children. Not many people self-regulate their activities unless they have a push or external factor, particularly when that activity is so pleasure inducing as to create new dopamine pathways in the brain.</p></li>
<li><p>Your argument here is actually against legalization. Heroin varies in purity even among the &quot;high grade&quot; junk and this often results in people taking what they think is the same dose as usual but is actually more potent. In addition, heroin has more types of tolerance than just chemical tolerance. Behavioral and situational tolerance also factor in heavily. A user might take several mid to large size doses at a party or with friends and be fine because they&#39;ve tolerated to socially using in that environment but then take the same dose at home to themselves or alone somewhere and nod off to never wake again.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not like heroin has a bad rap. It has exactly the reputation it deserves. Addicts shouldn&#39;t feel stigmatized but they shouldn&#39;t feel like they&#39;re doing what&#39;s best for them or that legality = safety. Heroin is an extremely dangerous and extremely psychologically and physiologically addicting drug, one of the few that I believe is rightly illegal. People underestimate it far too often and far too often they&#39;re the ones that die with a needle.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hoffman might or might not have ODed if it were legal. Personally I think he would have ODed much sooner if it were legal and he didn&#39;t have to be somewhat concerned about its effect in his career.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Translation: you started typing an opinionated reply based on an ignorant opinion and then realized just how mindnumbingly stupid you would look actually typing up reasons why heroin isn&#39;t <em>that</em> bad and should be legal.</p>

<p>Wake up and smell the coffee kid, you can&#39;t win an argument by wishes and dreams coupled by shooting down any opposing perspective. I don&#39;t care how much heroine you&#39;ve done or how awesome you think it is, it&#39;s a very dangerous drug and 8/10 times the people that underestimate it or overestimate their self control are the ones who OD and whose families people like myself have to counsel.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a few people come in for treatment because they genuinely realized they were killing themselves and that was actually great because the most successful people in recovery are the ones that want to recover for themselves. Recovery has to come from the addict, as therapists we just meet them halfway.</p>

<p>That being said, the people who are concerned or want to practice better health are far and away a minority compared to the people trying to get clean because of relationship pressure, a job opportunity or some other external factor pushing them. Recovery is recovery and it&#39;s always amazing to see an addict take that first step but it&#39;s generally expected that people there for someone else will relapse at least once and probably more. </p>

<p>The point is, heroin isn&#39;t something that legalizing it will remove the danger from. It is highly addictive and it interacts with reward pathways that are hard wired into your brain for survival. It&#39;s not as if anyone <em>wants</em> to be a stereotypical &quot;junkie&quot; controlled by the drug, most users I meet say they started because they didn&#39;t want to feel how they were feeling sober. When a powerful substance starts messing with your dopamine rewards though you can easily lose yourself. You might not think about it as losing control, but when a drug dictates who you spend time with and when you&#39;re not in control. It&#39;s sad but most users only realize they&#39;ve lost control too late and even then unless there&#39;s an external factor pushing them they may prefer that loss of control if it keeps making them feel that wonderful consistently. If heroin were legal, there wouldn&#39;t be as much of a reason for a lot of people to actually give up that source of pleasure, and even for those that wanted to there wouldn&#39;t be any guarantee of less stigmatization. </p>

<p>You keep on defending heroin though, maybe next week you can do a topic on why meth should totally be legal too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, you totally blew me away, documentaries are literally <em>THE BEST</em> sources.</p>

<p>Come back when you&#39;ve studied any amount of biochemistry/chemistry/psychology/sociology and have actually worked in a clinical setting with people suffering from addiction. Better yet just come back when you have more than some blog posts on a &quot;legalize it!&quot; forum and some half ass scare documentary extrapolating claims for some drugs to all drugs, then we can debate if you can put some sentences together that actually form an argument other than &quot;blah blah you&#39;re a fool blah blah prohibition&quot;.</p>

<p>P.S. - Prohibition does suck, in most cases. Heroin, meth and few other substances are very appropriately illegal. And Phillip Hoffman would have still died either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I majored in Social Policy, emphasized in drug war studies. </p>

<p>The government profits from prohibition and ruins lives over the possession of simple molecules.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they import cocaine and imprison us. Regardless if meth killed the first time you used it I would still support it&#39;s legality. This is about personal freedom to do anything you want to with your body as long as it doesn&#39;t harm others.</p>

<p>Drug users aren&#39;t dangerous unless they are using hard drugs (typically) and don&#39;t have access to their fix. Legalization would bring prices down to an affordable level and junkies would be able to maintain their addictions. </p>

<p>Harm reduction works so much better than prohibition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you majored in A) a major that doesn&#39;t actually interact with the psychology of the individual addicts or even generalized sociological effects of addiction at all, and B) double majored in something that doesn&#39;t actually exist. (That&#39;s per my Googling and basic knowledge, if you can show me where such a major program exists I&#39;ll fix that and wear the egg on my face. Unless you meant you took a class, which =/= a major.) Even if it were an actual program it&#39;s already admittedly biased seeing as how it&#39;s specifically about the drug <em>war</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Drug users aren&#39;t dangerous unless they are using hard drugs (typically)&quot;</p>

<p>And what, methamphetamine and heroin are soft drugs? Uh, no.</p>

<p>Clearly you&#39;re either choosing not to (possibly because you&#39;re rationalizing an addiction of your own?) or you&#39;re just too stubborn to comprehend this so I&#39;ll type it in all caps for emphasis. LEGAL STATUS, PRICES AND EVEN CHEMISTRY DON&#39;T MAKE HEROIN A SAFE SUBSTANCE FOR ANYONE. Even experience doesn&#39;t make that big of a difference, plenty of veteran junkies die of an OD every day because of a difference in purity (usually because of a dealer changing suppliers or changing their own product less) and plenty of first time users do too. IT IS NOT A SAFE SUBSTANCE. You can know everything there is to know about heroin and still overdose just as quick as a raging dumbass if you overestimate yourself or underestimate the substance. It&#39;s not just about drug users being a danger to others with this stuff, it&#39;s about them being a danger to themselves as well. Just because heroin is scheduled with weed doesn&#39;t make it as innocent and misplaced as weed is. Marijuana has no place being scheduled and especially not at schedule 1 because it has no real abuse or addiction potential. Heroin meanwhile is almost a metaphor for addiction and abuse potential is very high because A) It is very cheap comparatively, B) It is very, very addictive, C) Tolerance lowers very quickly and D) Effects are almost as soon as you finish pushing the syringe for IV users. </p>

<p>If you want to argue that people should have a right to kill themselves with drugs then by all means do it all fucking day, but don&#39;t pretend for a second that legalization is actually going to reduce rates of heroin overdose or abuse because that&#39;s bullshit, just like any claim that heroin isn&#39;t dangerous is absolute bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still do and will continue to disagree with you there and believe that heroin is something that should remain illegal, because I see the consequences of legalizing it and having open use leading to increased use, increased addiction and increased rates of overdose. I&#39;m all for reducing penalties for users and boosting resources for recovery and education though , and I know a lot of like-minded professionals. It is despicably stupid to penalize addicts with years in prison (which not only takes their freedom and ambition but costs taxpayers money). That money would be much better spent in more comprehensive education programs to keep people from getting started on a heroin addiction and more psychology-based recovery efforts to help those who have slipped into addiction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, no.</p>

<p>Penalties are still very stiff and include prison sentences instead of actual recovery efforts. The War on Drugs has wasted over a trillion dollars on incarceration and punishment oriented approaches to the problem which could have been better used for education, prevention, treatment etc. The only aspect of &quot;my way&quot; that&#39;s been tried is that it&#39;s illegal, and go figure that&#39;s the one aspect they&#39;ve got partially right.</p>

<p>We had a pretty good mutual disagreement, why&#39;d you have to go and convince me you&#39;re an idiot again by taking a statement of &quot;heroin is bad, should be illegal and addicts should get treatment instead of punishment&quot; and turning it into something as godawful stupid as &quot;because you think that you support cartels.&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you daft? I just stated above that Portugal &quot;removed criminal penalties.&quot; That doesn&#39;t equate with me saying they legalized drugs. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re dodging answering a simple question. You stated you feel the consequences of legalizing it would include increased addiction. I&#39;m pointing to an example of a country which decriminalized (removed criminal penalties for use) and, in which, the opposite happened. How do you explain that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you stupid?</p>

<p>Firstly, decriminalization and legalization are not the same thing. My entire argument was against legalization, so you&#39;re barking up the wrong tree. Also, just because penalties aren&#39;t handled by a criminal court doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t penalties to serve as a minor deterrent, and Portuguese officials still confiscate drugs and only amounts under a certain limit are decriminalized.</p>

<p>In addition, since you obviously haven&#39;t bothered to check anything past &quot;ZOMG NO JAIL 4 DRUGS!&quot; you should know that statistics for heroin, ecstasy and cocaine use have been increasing among adult populations since the policy was enacted. This may be because people feel less stigmatized but considering there is still education about the matter and treatment availability my smart money is on &quot;more people are using.&quot; There has been a positive trend in that less adolescents report using drugs.</p>

<p>There have been less deaths because, as I said, the money that was being allocated for prosecution and incarceration of drug users has been spent on education and treatment and gee golly whiz, once people know drugs are killing them and have support to quit they are more likely to quit. Instead of sending addicts to jail they&#39;re sending them to trained psychologists and addiction counselors and it&#39;s had a great impact so far.</p>

<p>The Cato paper reports that between 2001 and 2006 in Portugal, rates of lifetime use of any illegal drug among seventh through ninth graders fell from 14.1% to 10.6%; drug use in older teens also declined. Lifetime heroin use among 16-to-18-year-olds fell from 2.5% to 1.8% (although there was a slight increase in marijuana use in that age group).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not helpful linking to a 143 page document. Way to cite sources. Everything I&#39;ve read says there was a small, not <strong>statistically-significant</strong> rise in drug use among adults. More importantly there has been a decline in IV heroin use.

<li><p>There&#39;s no research yet to support it because to date there hasn&#39;t been a valid study in a country where drugs are legal. Given that usage rates among adults have still increased even in a country where they are simply decriminalized, even by a &quot;statistically small margin&quot; *(.7% to 1.1% of interviewees for heroin), it&#39;s a safe bet that they&#39;d increase even more if there was absolutely no push whatsoever to attend treatment or attain any education. </p></li>
<li><p>Okay, since you&#39;re apparently unable to read, you can check out page 18 and the following statistics tables. Even your own linked article points to an increase in use, and whether it&#39;s statistically significant or not it still represents an increase even with decriminalization policy in effect. IV use has thankfully decreased and this is mainly attributed to the preemptive education and the treatment for people who are found to possess drugs. </p></li>

<p>Again, stop trying to sound smart, because you are seriously lacking in capability at this point. You can&#39;t even spell &quot;cite&quot; the correct way or press Ctrl+F and type in heroin to search for statistics in a report, how are you even able to keep posting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could and you&#39;d be right, I made a typo. Unlike you however I proofread my own work and fixed it a soon as I reread it. You got me though!</p>

<p>Let me explain this like you&#39;re 5. Legalization is not parallel or similar to decriminalization in any way other than a lack of criminal penalties. People in Portugal who are found with drugs are sent for treatment rather than punished. This is in no way similar to legalization in which drug users would not even be referred to treatment when found with drugs. If you meant to parallel a situation to decriminalizaton then you should do so to decriminalization, not when someone talks about legalization (and taxation like OP was saying). They&#39;re separate terms for a reason.</p>

<p>You gave statistics pulled from the drug reform site you posted which pulled them from the Cato study. Like I said, that article happened to be on point. You shouldn&#39;t trust any web post that throws some statistics at you though, you should do some comparative research and find the studies for yourself. Do people not Google for themselves anymore?</p>

<p>Oh and keep saying teenybopper because it makes you look even more like a dipshit. Saying &quot;zomg&quot; once in sarcasm is one thing but picking an outdated slang in an invalid attempt to sound like the older/wiser one here is just pathetic.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re an idiot, but legalization and decriminalization can be discussed concurrently. Preferably, however, (see how &quot;however&quot; has commas around it? Learn from that) not by idiots who fail at constructing basic sentences and use expressions like ZOMG as insults. </p>

<p>Remember how you used the rate of addiction in Portugal after decriminalization to theorize how addiction rates may rise after a theoretical legalization? That was an apt use of both. Dumbass. </p>

I did at least provide a real argument supported by relevant statistics though, whereas you&#39;ve pretty much stuck with the grammar.</p>

<p>To tell the truth this was amusing at first when it was initially clear you were just another ignorant poster who hadn&#39;t done research outside of watching pro-drug documentaries and reading pro-drug websites, but now it&#39;s taking time away from better things I have to do. You can yammer about a &quot;victory&quot; if you like, anyone stopping by with half a brain and without a bias one way or another can probably figure out for themselves who made the most convincing argument.</p>

<p>It was relevant to the discussion to bring up Portugal. Their rates of IV heroin use are lower now, as I cited. It was obvious you were stupid, as well, as you couldn&#39;t fathom a reason Portugal would be discussed as they didn&#39;t legalize just decriminalize.

<p>Most of your post material has been attempting to call me out on grammar issues and throw insults as a one up, but you think you &quot;trounced&quot; me and can offer me advice on condescension? Talking about assholes, you&#39;re in a severe state of denial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a fantastic high school English teacher thank you, I even learned such amazing things as the appropriate capitalization of proper nouns and other terms (hint: high school and teacher aren&#39;t proper nouns and aren&#39;t capitalized unless beginning a sentence.) </p>

<p>I do deserve a dunce cap however for the simple fact that I keep coming back to this shit even though I say I&#39;m finished arguing with your pretentious stupidity. I&#39;m going to sleep soon so by tomorrow I&#39;ll hopefully have forgotten all about the waste of a few hours on here trying to debate something stupid with you.</p>

<p>As to your &quot;argument&quot; however, education is only half the battle and as long as it remains either compulsory to youth or as an alternative to punishment it&#39;ll continue to be a half-way effort that requires addicts to seek it to be effective. Adults can choose whether or not to pursue education on drugs just like they can choose whether or not to read those nifty anti-drug pamphlets and shit that are already widely available. The main difference and the main reason the Portuguese program has shown success is that instead of taking a punitive stance and throwing jail sentences at users and addicts, they send them to a panel consisting of a psychologist and an addiction counselor. This kind of system wouldn&#39;t be present in a legalized society because <em>drugs would be legal.</em> There wouldn&#39;t be any penalties whatsoever, administrative or criminal, unless you want to consider taxes a penalty. Portugal&#39;s system is genius because they still maintain that drugs are a health risk and illegal, but instead of smashing someone&#39;s life for suffering from a psychological and physiological condition they send them to treatment and get them an education about the matter. </p>

<p>It could be present if it was instituted that way. In some states it&#39;s legal to carry a concealed weapon, if the carrier of said weapons passes classes involving safety.  We could make it so that heroin would be legal- if a potential user got a card for it by going to a similar panel as you mentioned. </p>

<p>This would provide all the benefits of the decriminalization of Portugal with added bonuses. People have been overdosing from heroin laced with fentanyl. Decriminalization wouldn&#39;t solve that but legalization would. Organized crime would take a tremendous blow and the money from taxes would be a boon to people who need it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re the one who started disputing my claim that I believe the consequences of legalization would result in increased use, increased addiction and increased deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because it&#39;s nonsensical. When we look at Portugal, deaths by overdose and diseases spread through needles have decreased. That could be duplicated with full legalization as I described, with the added bonuses I described, and even less deaths as no one would be shooting up heroin adulterated with fentanyl. </p>

<p>Ridiculous, as the statistics and facts support my argument. They don&#39;t, however, support your notion that increased deaths would result with legalization. </p>

<p>Good luck with your anger and sexual identity issues (I know I&#39;m sexy, but humiliating you shouldn&#39;t really turn you on)- I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a connection there somewhere. Since you have admitted having grammar issues, and your writing is still painful (commas, learn to use them) I&#39;d think hard before pointing out someone else&#39;s typos- you started that bullshit in one of your &quot;attempts to seem smart,&quot; but you got me, I miscapitalized.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s cute that you&#39;re still thinking of me and think you &quot;humiliated&quot; me, but I&#39;ve been over this little squabble for a couple days and have moved on to talking to people who aren&#39;t fucking idiots trying to seem intelligent and don&#39;t argue for things like legal heroin.

<p>By the way, you&#39;re still a laughable moron.</p>

<p>Edit - Another &quot;by the way,&quot; if you can stop focusing on how many commas I use (,,,,,,,,) or imagining me in swimwear, maybe this article would interest you : <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/drug-dealers-unfazed-by-legal-pot-in-colorado">Link</a> . Surprisingly, people don&#39;t like being put on lists for drug purchases or having their identities out there when they can buy cheaper drugs through a dealer they know and have used before. Organized crime probably wouldn&#39;t take much of a hit, especially not in the short-term.</p>

<p>Maybe when you get done with that if you have time you can lurk around some drug use communities or talk to an actual heroin addict. The fentanyl doses aren&#39;t always accidental or some sick prank by a dealer, it&#39;s a product with demand in the subculture because of the added kick it has. While it happens far too often the odds of someone just happening to buy a fentanyl-laced dose from their dealer without knowing probably aren&#39;t that high, seeing as how fentanyl costs money and packs an extra punch which would provide a better selling point and more money for the dealer.</p>

<p>As to this issue, are you really taking the side that the black market for heroin wouldn&#39;t be destroyed if it were legalized? Black markets exist because of prohibition. That&#39;s self-evident.

<p>They also dosed an entire village in France with LSD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read he had four or five packets of heroin that were stamped with the ace of spades- and that this stamp hadn&#39;t been seen in NYC since 2008. He had used a couple of them and was then found with the needle in his arm. It seems like he saved a bunch of heroin from a good batch and then took too much of it. </p>

<p>Would legalization have saved Hoffman&#39;s life? It&#39;s impossible to say, but decriminalization has been extremely beneficial to the Portuguese. </p>

<p>I&#39;m for legalization, but he could have done that in our culture. He couldn&#39;t, legally, get ibogaine, but he could have gone to many doctors and gotten methadone or suboxone. He could have legally ordered kratom online. He wanted to keep getting as high as he could and he, apparently, wasn&#39;t concerned with pushing the limit- hence why he shot up and didn&#39;t smoke or snort. </p>

<p>If anything, it would decrease in potency. </p>

<p>As to this issue, are you really taking the side that the black market for heroin wouldn&#39;t be destroyed if it were legalized? Black markets exist because of prohibition. That&#39;s self-evident. No one would risk imprisonment to buy a potentially <em>lethal</em> product when they could buy the same product legally that they know won&#39;t kill them and will be of a known high quality. That&#39;s logically self-evident. </p>

<p>Really? </p>
