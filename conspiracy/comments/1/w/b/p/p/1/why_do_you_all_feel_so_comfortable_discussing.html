        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Part of the purpose of data mining is tagging citizens. Like what has been done in Ukraine via mass texts to the rioters who have phones within a certain radius, the NSA will use your activities as so-called &quot;freedom fighters&quot; and those who recognize the NWO against you. They will tag you and eliminate you. This is, of course, speculation, but what is the purpose of acquiring massive amounts of data if you do not intend to use it? Why would they want aware individuals spreading awareness?</p>

<p>I am risking my own safety posting here now. In future if Reddit is compromised, they will be able to gather data on which user subscribed to which subreddit, and there is no doubt they&#39;re looking at the fringe subs first. If you post here, you endanger yourself, so I don&#39;t understand why you all continue to do so. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This is only a question. Though I am trying to argue a point, I am genuinely curious as to why you all feel okay posting here. Maybe I am overly paranoid, but it is in my opinion to be as careful as possible until the full scope of the situation can be realized. Maybe I&#39;m missing something. </p>

Eat a dick if you&#39;re afraid of the NSA or any surveillance organization. They only count on you being ashamed of what you&#39;ve done in your life, and that you won&#39;t own up to what you&#39;ve done. Social norms play a huge factor in this. If you like something that others don&#39;t, and you deny you enjoy it, you only look like more of a cock than you actually are. If I like staged incest porn, and they try to say &quot;ahh well ### likes incest porn&quot; I would say SO WHAT BITCH? Lets here what you like. Fuck surveillance, fuck the machine and everything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>most local cops are probably ok on a day-to-day basis.  its this big brother NSA shit thats getting out of hand...</p>

<p>true story...</p>

<p>a friends niece is getting harassing phone calls, presumably from her estranged husband... so friend takes niece to local police to file a report. local cop asks what her phone number is, she tells him, he types it in and up pops a record of all her calls, <em>including voice recordings</em>. cop finds calls in question and makes his report. </p>

<p>evidently all of your communications are all just sitting there, waiting for some local cop to need them. when politicians say that there needs to be more info sharing and cooperation between local, state and feds, what they are talking about is giving every street cop NSA level access to you records thru what they call &quot;fusion centers&quot;</p>

I am more concerned with the future in regards to my safety, and less with being killed immediately. When Reddit becomes open to surveillance by the NSA, we will no doubt be tagged as dissidents, which will make it easier to lay criminal charges on us, or any number of things, at any point in the future whenever they want. I don&#39;t want to be tagged, and I don&#39;t understand why you guys are making yourselves vulnerable to be tagged. </p>

The only way we even have a chance of preventing something like what&#39;s happening is if we are cautious. You make yourself vulnerable by announcing yourself. If a burglar who is armed (and you are not) comes into your home in the middle of the day and is not aware that you&#39;re home, are you going to shout, &quot;HEY. GUY. I KNOW YOU&#39;RE HERE.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying we should silence ourselves, I&#39;m saying we need better avenues to discuss and garner support for what we see. There is no way we can make every single person realize what we&#39;ve come to realize (partially because the NWO has created a rift, causing an &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; mentality) so a revolution can&#39;t happen this way. There are not enough people on this side yet to feel secure in our positions so we can&#39;t be announcing our presence so carefree-- this is literally a matter of life and death. Eventually they will have the power to imprison us, and undoubtedly will (and already do) kill and kidnap us for this. That does us no good. Meeting formally with a think-tank is the right way to go about it, in my opinion. In-person communication and recruitment is the only secure method right now. If every single person on this sub started a somewhat secretive group in their area to discuss these things and bring new material and evidence to the table, there is less of a risk that ALL OF US will be monitored electronically. You guys are using their data mines for your discussions! To use another, more literal, analogy; that is like discussing the possibility of overthrowing the De Beers cartel in a diamond mine. </p>

<p>I realize these discussions are for awareness, but there are safer ways to go about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I replied to a comment farther down in the thread. I believe in-person groups are the best method. Not only are they more organized, but they are much more secure. Provided your group extends from you to individuals close to you, and from there individuals close to them. There is obviously a risk with that too, but like another user said, silence isn&#39;t the answer. It is the most secure means I can think of. I would also suggest a private IRC be set up. I believe there needs to be a cohesive organization for any real substance to come from these discussions. Awareness is important, but so is action. </p>

<p>Its similar to what you said, if the NSA is some nefarious agency with a malicious agenda, theyve already have our numbers. By not participating in the peaceful expression of our rights for fear of retribution, we would be bowing down and licking the hands that [doesnt] feed us.</p>

<p>Heres a little quote from one of the founding fathers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If you love wealth more than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, depart from us in peace. We ask not your counsel nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen.”</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve gotten back to the faith of my childhood. This sub has helped me analyze my own prejudices, dishonesty and beliefs. For that, I am grateful. It&#39;s helped me make wiser decisions about my money, career, diet and entertainment choices. With that said, I&#39;m going offline for the rest of the day and tackling the many other pressing issues in my life. I&#39;m not the same girl that came on here during the Boston situation. I&#39;ve put down the weed, alcohol and pointless relationships. Most importantly, I put down the fucking TV remote. I was literally wasting my life away. Ya&#39;ll don&#39;t realize you&#39;re actually helping people &quot;WAKE UP&quot; and discover their HUMANITY. For that, r/conspiracy, I am utterly grateful. I&#39;m go organize my life now. :P </p>

<p>Not trying to be mean, Reddit is just a website where things happena nd people hang out. Real dissident activity happens on other websites. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m already tagged as a dissident, I&#39;ve identified as an anarchist for a long time. If you&#39;re scared go to pintreset or something, it&#39;s probably safer cause it&#39;s filled with middle-aged women.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to puff myself up at all. In fact, I probably know less than most serious fringe-explorers on this sub alone. I&#39;m saying all mass congregations like Reddit and its various subreddits are <em>perfect</em> for data mining and tagging dissidents. Users tend to subscribe to subs relating to their hometown and tend to give out personal information in their responses all the goddamn time. It is the perfect mine for the NSA. My concern is similar to most people&#39;s concern about the NSA&#39;s general data mining. They can grab sexual orientation data from smartphones, and while this doesn&#39;t seem extremely harmful, it is still a major issue. Most people whose sexual orientation they know from gathering data like this have done nothing wrong and/or have nothing &quot;new to say&quot;, but it still concerns us because this is private information. That&#39;s my concern for this sub, especially because the data you guys provide by posting is nothing so trivial as sexual orientation-- you are telling them (if they are indeed watching at this point in time) that you are a potential dissident, and if things get heated to the point that Ukraine is, you are likely to participate in a riot based on your post history here. If they were able to ascertain your identity, you are fucked. That&#39;s my concern; not that any of us are going to leak anything they don&#39;t want leaked, or say anything particularly damaging. Do you understand?</p>

<p>Yeah, social media is often used by dissidents for organizing as well. Electronic tools can be compromised, so what else is new? Reddit isn&#39;t a public forum, it&#39;s not owned by the government but that&#39;s why there are ads. Using reddit for stuff you don&#39;t want the authorities to find out you know or plan to act on is kind of dumb, sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, no I wasn&#39;t meaning anything by it. I was talking to a friend of mine and our conversation eventually wandered to online surveillance protests (like the one Reddit is participating in on February 11th). Anybody involved in a protest would be liable to be tagged as detrimental to the developing order, and-- at some point-- may also then be a target for incarceration. This particular subreddit is a form of protest. By the way, I&#39;m not saying protests are wrong, but sometimes you have to consider what you&#39;re protesting. The NSA have the potential to be dangerous because currently they are powerful. I&#39;m not trying to scare you, it&#39;s just that the things I&#39;m talking about <em>are</em> scary. It feels like shit to be lied to by a government that claims to uphold Liberty, and it does feel scary to me. So if I take into account all the possibilities and probabilities (based on the information that&#39;s pouring in about their data mining) I think it&#39;s possible that Reddit will succumb to this as well, and that it&#39;s better to value security over protest. This doesn&#39;t mean silence. It means you think about it and research it and talk about it while also being concerned with the probabilities and taking &quot;just-in-case&quot; measures. Not silence at all, but a more effective way of communication that is secure long-term in case things get bad. </p>

<p>Again, maybe I&#39;m too paranoid but goddamn. </p>
