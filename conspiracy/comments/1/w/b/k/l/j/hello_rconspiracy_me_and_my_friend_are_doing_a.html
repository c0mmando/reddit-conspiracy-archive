       Most do not believe because of the concepts of Edward Bernays  wherein a big lie is repeated ad infinitum by 'experts' and because of the term 'conspiracy theorist'   which was a propaganda campaign by the CIA in the 1960's , It worked very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information about conspiracies  is highly compartmentalized  because people have a taboo about discussing religion or politics in their day to day lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Origin of the term Conspiracy Theory.

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        DeHaven-Smith has shown that the conspiracy-theory label was popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967.[20] The program was directed at criticisms of the Warren Commission’s conclusion that President Kennedy had been assassinated by a lone gunman. The propaganda campaign called on media corporations and journalists to criticize “conspiracy theorists” and raise questions about their motives and judgments. The CIA told its contacts that “parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They Do believe because they have looked into various situations and found the system rigged and exploited by greedy leaders who have virtually no limits on how far they will go to achieve more power or money.

       That's as it should be. They aren't believable.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's probably because of their tendency to have inflated ego's about how they have fooled everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       They really aren't that smart.
      </p>
      <p>
       We here have come to realize the pattern they use to 'fool' us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of any false flag operation, and there have been many, is that they set up a 'practice' or an exercise of what they plan to do, at the same time and place that  they actually do the real false flag event.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most likely reason they do that is in case they are caught red handed or for any reason their plan cannot be carried out after it has begun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then  their ass is covered by the claim that it was just practice. You do want them to practice don't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have failed to educate the population about the dangers of overinflated ego's among those with power.
      </p>
      <p>
       From policemen to top central bankers their unchecked ego becomes a threat to all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       They fail to recognize that  virtually all jobs require roughly the same amount of expertise. they are not super humans at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the same volume of information and professional abilities make up each job.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all boils down to how hard it is to get access to  those qualifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rich man and the CIA agent fail to realize that a mechanic or a cabinet maker have to know as much about their job  and have a similar number of special abilities that go with those respective jobs.but simply aren't compensated for their knowledge because they had cheaper access to the knowledge they work with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone has to win at life but the rest of us shouldn't be subjected to their unchecked egotistical  predation and greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       At a certain level ego becomes psychosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this generation will come to realize this problem and begin to address it. I'm here to nudge them along.

       Evidence.  That is why people believe.  Because of evidence.  Comparing evidence to known history gives you a good picture of what is really going on.

       These are all historically proven U.S. (domestic) or NATO conspiracies.

      <p>
       People choose to disbelieve conspiracies because it is comforting to disbelieve.

       Those same people are willing to believe that other dirty slut nations like Russia have conspiracies.  But they believe that America is pure &amp; virginal &amp; an exception to history.

       I cant really say for others out there, but for me, I grew up hypersensitive to the unjustness and corruption around me... I could never believe that the world was this perfect happy place... I just struggled with that whole idea.... I became fascinated with the why's behind everything... as i grew up and got older i became more aware of the things happening outside of my personal life and my realm of thinking, and i just researched and researched... they all started out as well-known 'conspiracy theories' but as i learned more about them, those theories became truths and facts, and those theories led to more theories.. ive just never not believed in them... when the mind is open to what others see as false, the mind is seeing the truth...

       The first thing is quite a lot of us are not really "conspiracy theorists" in that we do not have a theory of X, we just see holes in the government story (quite often it's the government) and that coupled with their track record of lying whenever they move their lips...well, one would be an idiot to trust a proven liar with no proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it seems today people have been conditioned out of this, our journalists do not fulfill their duty to inform the public and be our watchmen and the people trust whatever those in authority say. The thing is it used to be normal to never trust the government. Always assume they are lying. Why? Because if you find out they are telling the truth then you are pleasantly surprised, but when they are lying you do not lose your democracy because you weren't watching vigilantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nowadays the propaganda is working well and if you ask questions and do not accept pronouncements from on high, you are some crazy conspiracy nut. Wonder who benefits from that?

       By "conspiracy theories", do you mean theories about conspiracies, or do you mean some other thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about Watergate? Do you believe that Republican operatives broke in to a Democratic office? Do you believe that President Nixon and his staffed worked to cover up the details of that break in?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a theory about a conspiracy. Do you choose to believe or not believe it? Why or why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a theory about a conspiracy is almost universally believed to be correct, does it cease to be a conspiracy theory?

       It's not that I chose to believe in conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather I researched history and gave particular notice to corroborated conspiracies. This led me to conclude it was likely such things continue to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I theorize that something is likely not a conspiracy - it's because the preponderance of evidence has led me to that decision.

       There are different types of theorists. Some speculate alternative explanations for events where they are skeptical of the official reports. These theorists tend to compartmentalize their beliefs with their speculatory personalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some believe in the theories only after an efficient amount of credible evidence supports its claims. Othets jump over the pursuit of truth and believe in anything other than the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people dont believe in theories because they are either ignorant to certain things, as ignorance offers bliss, or because everything seems too overwhelming and they naturally put up a defensive barrier along their belief faculties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some choose to disbelieve because to believe in one, no matter how true, may require you to bekieve in another, setting off a chsin reaction that can be difficult to figure iut where it should stop. So, its easier to just not believe any in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, some may choose to disbelieve because they truely think conspiracy theorists are whack jobs.

       I understand, maybe I should've been a bit more specific. I don't mean to discriminate any beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see now that believing in a certain theory is not very different from believing in an "official" theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the real question should've went like: Why do you think one chooses to believe in a conspiracy theory, even though the government have released an "official" explanation? I'm not saying that these conspiracy theories are made up and fake. On the contray, I'm actually very interested in finding out more about them.

       One chooses to believe a conspiracy because their common sense screams "wrong/fail/lie" when given an official story.
I have a qualification in Psychology and think its hilarious the way you posed your questions as if there was something wrong with conspiracy theorizing as if conspiracy theorists are the idiots. 
As a psychology student yourself you should know about the Bystander Effect and the horrific incident concerning Kitty Genovese. This doesnt just work in a smoke filled room or a street but in the world with ranging effects. Official stories spouted by governments give people an easy solution to a problem, and an equally easy way to ridicule someone who disagrees with a specific narrative. 
By labeling and consequently attempting to degrade a person by calling them a "conspiracy theorist", it shows how much they themselves are victims of a closed existence and possibly they be incapable to even attempt to entertain a notion that alters their reality.
When someone calls me a conspiracy theorist in a negative way, i believe it shows how little they have in the way of critical thinking as they prefer it end a discussion with condescending laugh or a put down.

       Good stuff. I would definitely reiterate your first point as being absolutely crucial.

       If someone tells me a story that doesn't make sense (for instance it is self-contradictory, or is refuted by facts from other sources) then I cannot believe that story. It is not a "choice".

       "If someone tells me a story that doesn't make sense then I cannot believe that story". What about String Theory, or other dimensions, such as the 4th dimension creatures such as ants use? They dont make sense but may be correct theories. Just because you dont understand something or it doesnt make sense does not mean it isnt true. Also if you insist on fact checking everything, which is essential, then check the sources of these so called facts. If you are at school, the chances are you are being fed simplistic bullshit that ticks boxes, and a government narrative is what you learn.
Everything is a choice unless you believe in determinism which is horse shit imo.

       OK, but I was referring to news items (eg the Boston Bombing hoax) and not scientific theories (eg quantum theory). Ultimately, we all have to defer to experts on technical matters, and to echo your point, if you can't verify the technical stuff, you can check up the credentials of the individual who is doing it.

       Dont believe the news. Thats to distract you from what is really going on. Keep looking and you will find out as much as you want to know. Take everything with a pinch of salt, especially when it comes from the MSM. Also scientific theories are news items, and news items are scientific theories. Sorry to be picky, but you will learn (as everyone does) that everything is not black and white and even when an "expert" says "there were defiantly no explosions in the Twin Towers on 9/11" you should question that due to what you can see and eyewitnesses saw and your bullshit meter should go off and you should question more. That's all most conspiracy theorists are - alert people with a great bullshit detector.

       I will say also that the term conspiracy theorist has bad implications associated with it. I like to view it as more of a "truth seeker" or truth theorist. 
The reason that I have chosen to go down deep into the rabbit hole is because I had a moment of realization and clarity that if I was in a similar situation as some of the individuals we theorize about I would most likely lie and cheat and steal especially given the opportunities they had to gain more power. And I could see the drive for power consuming me and my family just like it has with the families we theorize about. 
To me it comes down to human nature and if you can trust the powers at be.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

        Why do you think one chooses to believe in a conspiracy theory, even though the government have released an "official" explanation?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What makes an "official" story more believable?  I judge theories by their content, not who is telling me about them.  If an official story raises questions that require answers in order to actually explain the official story that is raising the questions, and then those questions are not answered to support the official story, I think it's fair to say it's not a very good explanation.

       Thank you. That's a great approach to research. The quality of the evidence, not the source, should be your guiding light.

       I like your terminology of official and alternative explanations for events. The term conspiracy theory has become tainted and conveys pejorative meaning to most people.

       Of course there is such a thing as paranoid delusion and mental illness in our world, people who think everyone is out to get them are usually wrong. That is where conspiracy gets a bad rap.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality most of the rational 'conspiracy theories' found here are predicated on discrepancies or contradictions between the official record and the public record of some event, which indicate that the official version of the story has been fudged for some reason. It is not necessary to suggest an alternative 'theory' of what happened, just to recognize that there is some level of inaccuracy in the official record of an event.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more interesting question is why do some people choose not to recognize these discrepancies. The people who end up believing in the common conspiracy theories are simply those who choose to examine and consider the evidence personally with an open mind. Skeptics will usually argue that you and I are unqualified to be examining and considering evidence at all, that it should be left to the officially recognized 'experts'. This usually comes down to one of two reasons, honest skeptics just lack self respect, dishonest ones crave money or favor.

       There is definitely a subgroup within conspiracy theorists (and this sub) that will accept almost any idea that appears to be a conspiracy though, isn't there?
      </p>
      <p>
       An example, perhaps, is the current "Terror Bowl" thing going around some sites. Presented with absolutely no evidence or background, yet there are people who are completely willing to accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all conspiracy theorists are like this, of course, many are quite discriminating in what they choose to believe, and why... But there is certainly some number that just like to believe in anything 'alternative' (for lack of a better term)

       People believe in conspiracies because there is power in knowledge. If you feel, rightly or wrongly, that you know something that others don't then you are empowered. This is why
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       many conspiracies exist, not a yearning for the truth but a desire to have the upper hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I believe some people believe in conspiracies because they can't face the fact that sometimes bad shit happens to good people for no reason, so they need to take control of the situation in their mind and apply a logic to it that makes it seem like there is a course of action.

       Down votes? Was something I said in error? Sexy doesn't always mean the turn you on kind of way. Take alien technology helping to build the pyramids; it is a more exciting explanation than just a bunch of humans pushing rocks, because, aliens.
