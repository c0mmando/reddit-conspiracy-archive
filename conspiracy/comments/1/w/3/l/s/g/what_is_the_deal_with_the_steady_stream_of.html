       I noticed the exact same thing. Also add the video of the guy guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Solider that made the front page from

       Is it anti military to be adverse to blatant military propaganda and the glorification of our Empire's illegal wars? I think it's just thinking as human before thinking as a nationalist.

       Well you have to understand that a great number of those people do what they do because they care about you. People dont sign up to go to war, and the few that do find their way out quickly. The men and women in the military are not one in the same as the military industrial complex, they are your brothers and sisters here to look out for you. Do you think they agree with the decisions that the president makes? No, but none the less in the end they swore to do something bigger than that. They swore to protect your constitution from all who threaten it. If and when it comes time for that, those people you so despise, they are on your side.

       How would anything I've said indicate that I "despise" members of the military? What I despise is a system that indoctrinates young people and then puts them in horrible situations that force them to kill complete strangers for the agenda of the powerful and wealthy. I would say 99.999% of enlisted people are decent human beings who took the best option available for them to get out of poverty (or find purpose in life at a very confusing time) and have a better station in life. That sill doesn't mean we should glorify them being forced to kill people to advance the political and economic agenda of the 1%.

       Less than 1% of the military sees combat. So there really are not that many people out there forced to kill. And due to the rules of engagement they can not fire on the enemy, unless the enemy fires at them first. So its basically the common definition of self defense. The military is not at war nor are they looking for a fight. Currently the military is in the process of training the Afghan National Army and Afghan     Boarder Patrol how to keep their country safe, we arent out hunting terrorists. Don't believe all that propaganda the msm spews at you.

       For every real person there are 100 marketing whores and 1000 bots.

       The reddit business model works by collecting fees from various groups who want a license to use their marketing whores here. Basically this whole site is a big fucking payola scheme for power to purchase the right to post their propaganda.

       I myself have asked people if they know why they are so supportive of military now. They say because they protect freedom and deserve nothing less.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask them why in Vietnam why they didnt recive such support. Most say because they were stupid hippies back then that just wanted to be lazy and do drugs. I find it odd that none of them actually know of the goddamn horrors that happened over there. Also how they just accept the status qoe and never question anything.

       Not sure what you're talking about here, the anti-war movement of Vietnam was very educated and motivated and followed news reports closely. And American troops returning home from Vietnam in uniform were often subject to abuse and insults and called baby killers. This happened to a couple members of my family who were veterans of the Vietnam war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "support the troops" ethos/mentality/doctrine was a direct result of addressing the hatred for troops returning from Vietnam.

      <p>
       Which was very real.  However, the very real hatred expressed at returning troops due to the action of their government, gave the government a very powerful card to play for future endeavors.  We can see that here on Reddit.

       Devils Advocate:  One post leads to someone goggling similar stories and they all make it to the front page because they are in actuality really good stories.  I like the one about the guy spitting one and medic trying to put him in a body bag.

       Its just "cool" and easy to absorb knowledge. I don't believe the recent influx is propaganda (not to say it hasn't been).

       Just like how it's usually filled with celebrity bullshit.  r/worldnews is the real propaganda machine
