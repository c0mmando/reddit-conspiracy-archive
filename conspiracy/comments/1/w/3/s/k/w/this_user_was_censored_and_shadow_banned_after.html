      <p>
       Here is the content of his post:
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. A few points:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.
Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person.
With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.
You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him "fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?"
"Sorry," he says. "I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore." There haven't been any real journalists for months. They're all in jail.
Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It's always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons.
You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors.
This all happened in the country where I live.
You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality.
Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn't about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not?
You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant "liberty and justice for all." You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety?
Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?
I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen.
I actually get really upset when people say "I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything." People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.

       Universal spying is not OK because the excuse 'If you're doing nothing wrong then you have nothing to hide' is bogus, if you want your privacy respected then in their eyes you have had the audacity to do something wrong, I will only ever accept total surveillance when every politician in AU, NZ USA, CA, and England agrees to have a webcam strapped to their body 24/7, their desire to not be filmed 24/7 is as equal as mine.Fuck them and fuck Julie Bishop (AU's new foreign minister who gave Ed Snowden shit this week.)

       Nothing to hide? Spies can remotely put CP on your laptop. Don't have anything to hide? The state will be more than happy to provide you with something to hide and you don't even have to know about it.

       Is there any proof of that or just an assumption it could happen due to extrapolating all the things that we KNOW that can be done with technology and back doors?  If that is the case there is literally nothing one can do to fight it in court.  I figure more people would be using that as a defense, whether real or not.

       I'm not questioning whether it CAN be done.  I'm questioning whether it HAS been done to either silence people or put them in prison.  Like I said,  I believe if it has been done there would be instances we'd have heard of.  People fighting the charges etc.

       To my knowledge software has to be installed on the offending machine. Whether through a DNS spoof on the net, or some other means. Unless you have Windows, then they can just use Windows Update.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if they have found a way to jump the gap yet. I have heard stories that drive data can be remotely swiped without a physical connection to the computer, but they still have to be relatively close to the computer.

       Everyone has something to hide. I think most people don't think so because they're not aware of how much random stuff is illegal on the books (even if it's not normally enforced)

       I wouldn't quite say "damage control" as this insinuates they're saying or doing things after the fact. I was watching as this took place last year and that's pretty much how I recall it all going down. There was a lot of talk about

       gaming the system etc. I wasn't personally involved at all as I try to avoid reddit politics completely, but I was paying a bit of attention to it at the time.

       Since you edited your comment, the one I linked was deleted off bestof for no reason.  So the user in question pointed this out on his previous comment.  He was then banned from bestof, and conspiracy was banned from bestof.

       Sidewalkchalked added a comment when they changed "this" to what you see above. You edited your comment once it had upvotes to be more incendiary, one of those is underhanded the other is elucidating on a theme.

       Basically what happens is you start reading  it while you're peeing and then by the end of peeing you are hooked on the story and finish it anyways. Much like being on reddit while pooping

       Exactly, 1984 was not written because everything was all roses and crumpets. The trend was clearly visible at the time to all who bothered to look. Not that I want to take away from the impact of the book.

       I have been reading military stories from people on the ground and in the intelligence sub reddit as I think it's important to know and remember what  is happening for future reference. 
I have noticed that you are not allowed to post any current news or politics in any military reddit... I understand it is supposed to be for their own safety. But how are they supposed to be able to vote if they don't know what is going on? I don't think many people over there really know what is happening here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't help but think that I would be really
       <em>
        upset
       </em>
       to know that I was going up against al qaeda, which the US government has admitted to creating, financing and directing. That my fellow soldiers were being set up. And that all the time that I was fighting for my country, some fascists moved in and started a military state in my home town.
      </p>
      <p>
       That the citizens I was fighting for were being treated like terrorists (also being turned into spies and terrorists). That psyops was manipulating and experimenting on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That the TSA was popping off the testicles of boys while conducting a 'pat down' search on innocents. That the police were abusing their power, raping, beating, torturing and killing innocent people. That the rule of law, habeas corpus, and the constitution was no longer in effect. That false flag operations were being conducted by my commanders on my people. That the media had been subverted and controlled so that crimes were not being acknowledged. That the court of law and congress had no control over these rogue agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       General information wouldn't hurt. And I know I would want to know the truth. The guys on the ground are smart.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here are afraid. States want to secede from the union. We are all in trouble.  This is happening all over America and Europe. It is happening to all of us. Even the sheeple are no longer watching the news because the 'news' is not real - the lowest viewer rating in 20 years.

       Israel should be treated like any other country- to do otherwise is a disservice not only to the Israelites who report this information but the world community in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel does good things, and it does really bad things, just like the US, Australia, China, etc. or any other country on this planet. Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional.

       Why the anti-Semitism? And I don't think your name is the least bit funny. Israel has nothing to do with NSA. Liars start rumors about Israel being the cause of every virtual problem because of their anti-Semitism, not because it's "true" or anything.

       Nice denial going on there. You're replying to a post linking sources that are evidence to the contrary of what you're saying. You're not arguing them, instead you're daringly ignoring them and you're offering a blanket, blind, wild counterclaim. That's just denial.

       Great message, but let's not mislead people about the original author.
      </p>
      <p>
       They deleted their own account after a separate comment of theirs about their trip to Israel/Gaza made #1 in r/bestof, and mods there inexplicably censored it and arbitrarily banned all comments made in r/conspiracy from being submitted to r/bestof
       <em>
        for no reason.
       </em>
       Original OP had the #1 post of all time in r/bestof (which is what is written in this post) and they edited it and deleted their account in protest of the insane censorship by r/bestof mods.

       We belong to these social sites that have more control,more power than our own governments...A few people(as usual) have the dictatorial power to decide what stays on,what is deleted and so they become despots while at the same portraying themselves and the site as bastions of freedom.  Hogwash...Go read the Rules to the right.  All in the pretexts of manners,courtesy,etc...Its about simple control...Whenever a new site comes up,eventually it is ruled by despots and the advertising dollar...There are no exceptions. From google to reddit to facebook....They become popular, rich,tyrannical ,and then they go to bed with the authorities and get paid to pass your info to them...

       <a href="/r/bestof">

       . When I went searching for it I couldn't find the post anywhere on

       For those that know about this what happened to his bestof post? Why was it removed when it had firm footing at the top of all time

       He deleted his account in protest of the overwhelming censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why the top all time bestof post was deleted; he changed a bunch of his bestof posts, including the top one of all time, to reflect the content of a censored post.

       , then they changed their original post to use the karma/recognition that they had to make a political statement. This drama happened over a month ago and the mods got a lot of hate for it, before they came out with the exposé.

       Super accurate, too. And executed under U.S. orders, of course.

       Well, for starters, the user OP is talking about (
       <a href="/u/161719">
        /u/161719
       </a>
       ) wasn't shadow banned; he deleted his own account. The profile pages of both shadow banned users and deleted accounts will give you a page
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/E8Wy3oh.png">
        something like this.
       </a>
       However, if you look at those users' .json file, you'll see a difference:
      </p>
      <p>
       The .json file of a shadow banned user will show data:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/andrewsmith1986/about.json">
        http://www.reddit.com/user/andrewsmith1986/about.json
       </a>
       <br/>
       The .json file of a user who deleted his/her account will return a 404 error:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/161719/about.json">
        http://www.reddit.com/user/161719/about.json
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest, a CMV mod gave a better synopsis than I'd be able to write, so I'll link you to it. It puts the order of events in perspective.

       I seem to remember that this user got shadow banned because he posted a perfectly reasonable post about how Israel is fucking Palestine and treats it like a concentration camp, was then accused of anti-semitism etc etc and post was deleted so he edited every one of his posts to be the deleted comment.

       Right now? Spread the word, we need numbers. Stop supporting companies that support this shit. Support people who are trying to make changes and get the word out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Register for a political party, right now, do not wait until elections. If you wait until the elections then the corporations have already had their candidates chosen and that is who you get to vote for, your choice of corporate servant candidates. Register now and vote in the primaries with as many friends as you can convince. Make sure a non-corporate candidate is chosen and then whoever wins the elections, the corps loose and we win.

       This is not something that will be solved quickly, they count on the short attention spans of the populace to get away with whatever they want. So we either are in it for the long haul, or we might as well place the manacles on our own wrists.

       This person opens with the statement that they live in one of the arab spring dictatorship countries. Then ends with they live in the United States and how much they value the constitution.

       Thats a deliberate and thought-out lie. Its not just a simple lapse in judgement or error in wording.

       Live versus lived could be an error in wording, but I still think the entire thing is highly suspest. I'm not saying I disagree on the over-reach of spying and police state because I don't.
