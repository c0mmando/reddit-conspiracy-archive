    <div class="md"><p>No.
Snow is precipitation in the form of flakes of crystalline water ice that falls from clouds. Since snow is composed of small ice particles, it is a granular material. It has an open and therefore soft, white, and fluffy structure, unless subjected to external pressure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are pulling a prank or genuinely have never seen snow before. That&#39;s how snow behaves in many cases. If you compress it and try to &quot;burn&quot; it the suet from the lighters butane will make a black mark. When it does heat up the water is absorbed by the snowball.</p>

<p>There is a reason all of the videos are of the same lighter method. If they took the same snowball and set it down on a hot burner it would steam a little bit but mostly melt </p>
