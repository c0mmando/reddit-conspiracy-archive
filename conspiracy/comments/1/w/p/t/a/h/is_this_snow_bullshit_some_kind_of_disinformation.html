       To be fair, "chemtrails" are basic science too yet that doesn't stop people from believing insane conspiracies without a shred of evidence to support them and enormous evidence to the contrary.

       You're correct, people without knowledge of what happens with butane lighters and snow made this conspiracy happen.

       Do your research people. You really shouldn't post any wild theory you see in YouTube with a title "Omg, did you guys see this?!", especially when 30 seconds could easily tell you, no it isn't.

       I think it just comes from not seeing snow too much. This was the fourth time in my life that I can remember seeing snow. I think we should be pleased that some people are experimenting. We all know the state of education in this country, you can't blame anyone for getting this stuff wrong. Hell, I am excited people got away from the tv long enough to make these videos.

       Just something I noticed about the snow:  It seemed more "powdery" than usual upon first fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       By that, I mean that it didn't form snowballs very well.  They would disintegrate more easily when you threw them.  Doesn't necessarily mean anything

       No.
Snow is precipitation in the form of flakes of crystalline water ice that falls from clouds. Since snow is composed of small ice particles, it is a granular material. It has an open and therefore soft, white, and fluffy structure, unless subjected to external pressure.

       They are pulling a prank or genuinely have never seen snow before. That's how snow behaves in many cases. If you compress it and try to "burn" it the suet from the lighters butane will make a black mark. When it does heat up the water is absorbed by the snowball.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason all of the videos are of the same lighter method. If they took the same snowball and set it down on a hot burner it would steam a little bit but mostly melt

       The only strange thing about it is that people who don't regularly get snow, got it. That happens to be the South, and politically correct or not, it's not populated by a majority of people who would understand what's happening right away.

       What about the fact that I live in Western Mass and my snow didn't char and melted normally, but that another poster here who lives on the Cape, which got the same snow that hit the South had charring? If he's live on Martha's Vineyard, he KNOWS SNOW.

       The snow wasn't charring, have you ever held a flame from a bic up to glass?  The fuel is horribly dirty and leaves behind a ton of black "soot".  If you hold packed snow directly over a bic flame it's going to accumulate that crap.

       I'm saying I used my snow as the "control", there was no carbon buildup or plastic odor. Yes, I could smell the butane, but it was not plasticy. I'll make a video next time, snow is predicted for Wednesday.

       I tried it, and I live by the north Atlantic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used a match, got charring, and the smell was kind of like a new car.  Not sure how much of that was from pollutants, and the chemicals from the flame.

       I think it could be a part of Cass Sunstein's infiltration of conspiracy sites plans.

       Just like all the astroturfers that show up to derail any thread on the list. Notice that brigading and shilling happens only in threads about a few subjects, the rest are usually left alone.

       Another big problem in this sub is whenever comments get downvoted, everyone immediately cries "downvote brigade is here". Just because you haven't done the research on whatever topic you think is legit, doesn't mean that people are purposely down voting your thread, it just means you're wrong.
      </p>

       At the same time, other people need to realize that not everyone is on the same page with every conspiracy theory out there, and need to relay that information in a better way.

       You do understand that all snow does the burning trick. Snow is an insulator. It doesn't just turn into a puddle of water the second you put a flame next to it. And the turning black comes from the soot off the flame

       No, it doesn't. My snow didn't char and it melted. Yes, the other snow absorbs some of the water, but there was definite dripping.

       Well, that is a factor, because the snow is from Monday, I think. I'm going to try it again the next time it snows, both as it's falling and 24 hours later. I made a video, but ironically can't post it, though I'm about to say fuck it and just upload to my main YouTube account.

       If it snowed where you live recently, just go outside and grab a handful of snow and make a snowball and try to hold it in your hand for a minute. The snow is extremely cold compared to other snow you have probably handled.

       You're correct, people without knowledge of what happens with butane lighters and snow made this conspiracy happen.

       Do your research people. You really shouldn't post any wild theory you see in YouTube with a title "Omg, did you guys see this?!", especially when 30 seconds could easily tell you, no it isn't.

       To be fair, "chemtrails" are basic science too yet that doesn't stop people from believing insane conspiracies without a shred of evidence to support them and enormous evidence to the contrary.

       I'm saying I used my snow as the "control", there was no carbon buildup or plastic odor. Yes, I could smell the butane, but it was not plasticy. I'll make a video next time, snow is predicted for Wednesday.
