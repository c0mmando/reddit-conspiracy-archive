    <div class="md"><p>I live an hour outside of the city of Chicago and I frequent all the areas around in, the south burbs, the west burbs, and the areas directly north of the city which is evanston/skokie/kenellworth/winetka.</p>

<p>They are mostly all the same, the only difference being population size and political ideology, which isn&#39;t actually one way or the other on any issue in any place, as people are far more diverse than that.</p>

<p>The whole city doesn&#39;t agree &quot;guns are bad&quot;, that&#39;s just propaganda they try to push to bolster their anti-gun stance.</p>

<p>If they did, there would be no Mcdonald V Chicago supreme court case which lead to the striking down of the unconstitutional handgun ban.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much difference between the idiots living in or outside of the city, because they&#39;re all idiots that think the city is this wonderful place, because all they see is downtown and they completely ignore the corruption ridden poverty striken shit-hole that is the rest of the city, and even the downtown area fucking sucks because of how insanely congested it is and the problems that leads to ( especially in increasing peoples stress ).</p>

<p>People are brainwashed everywhere, and thinking that city people are entirely different from suburb people is wrong.</p>

<p>Chicago needs to be its&#39; own county, because they are essentially robbing other areas such as Skokie and Evanston who are actually able to properly manage their money, except that part where they can&#39;t 100% because Chicago fucking steals their money to fix their problems, which are further exaccerbated by corruption and greed.</p>

<p>Chicago fucking blows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s also nigh-implossible to enforce, preventing criminals from having guns is already hard when you don&#39;t factor in pot. And pot makes you pretty laid back, I feel you wouldn&#39;t want a gun if you had enough pot. </p>

<p>You can get pot illicitly today, you can be a gangbanger and get a gun illicitly. Neither of that suddenly changes even if there is a list of politically-motivated and well-armed pot heads. </p>

<p>Preventing pot heads (or on the other hand alcoholics) from getting weaponry legally will only create a larger demand for illegal weaponry as well as make a stink by the people whom care about this thing. </p>

<p>Perhaps it will come true, but I do not think it will make a difference.</p>
