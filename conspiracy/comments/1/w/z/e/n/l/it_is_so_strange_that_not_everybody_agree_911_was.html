       It is so strange that not everybody agree 9/11 was an inside job literally. I mean literally because it is an obvious fact that the Twin Towers were designed specifically to be able to not collapse by an airplane collision.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to make the Twin Towers collapse is by a controlled demolition. Which is possible only by having full access to the building, in order to plant the explosives inside the buildings. It is the most obvious kind of an inside job you can think of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder why this is not being used as the main proof. And why someone is still trying to deny it. It is normal information that is avaiable all over the internet. Every engineer is able to explain this, you don't have to be somebody exceptional to know this.

       Sort of hard to go with the conspiracy thing since its been over a decade and no one has some real solid evidence that it was a inside job. No way something that huge with so many pieces that need to work together seamlessly, could be pulled off with not one person having solid evidence. I can get behind the government using this as a springboard for war, but its a bit hard to believe they planned and executed it.

       Im now being accused of being a "shill"and a"troll" whatever that means lol. DSPROX is the exact reason why things like this cant be taken seriously in the media or anywhere else. No real proof, no real facts but they get very angry if you don't instantly agree 100% with their outrageous claims. Go down and read Algee's post, everybody.

       I agree that in order for 9/11 to be an inside job, too many things would have to be done perfectly.  On the other hand if you truly study the facts of that day it is literally impossible to believe this was anything but an inside job.  Throughout history FAR more difficult things have been orchestrated by FAR smarter people than the general public.  Try founding microsoft or google.  Try starting a fortune 500 company.  The profit margins are the same ( I am giving a very broad example with this comparison) when going to war.  There are very powerful, smart people out there who can easily pull this off.  I honestly would love to agree that this was a terrorist attack but I have still not seen any concrete evidence that this was a terrorist attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       a.  Numerous groups reported thermite in the remains. ( thermite can only be made in a lab)
      </p>
      <p>
       b.  Numerous architects and engineers agree this was demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       c.  Witnesses believed it sounded like bombs went off in the basement (ironic because  that's how you would do a demolition of this sort)
      </p>
      <p>
       D.  A large number of these "witnesses"  ended up mysteriously dying after 9/11.  Look into this one it's actually pretty interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.  You can see thermite along the outside of the building in numerous buildings.  ( if you look up thermite you will learn that it has a very unique color)
      </p>
      <p>
       F.  A lot of people make a TON of money when they go to war.  ( not sure if this is the exact reason, but it makes sense)
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been over a decade, but that does not change what happened that day.  People are still searching for an answer.

       A little research into the whole thermite and thermate thing and you would see that the original claim of this was made by amateurs who really have no idea what they were talking about. In fact lawsuits have came against these people for reporting inaccurate scientific findings. "far more difficult things have been orchestrated" like what? Starting a company? I don't see the correlation. Your list of things just contains speculation. No real solid evidence not even in the slightest. I respect the opinions, but i seem to see the same key words in alot of this type of writing. "mysteriously dying" "numerous" Alot of times it sounds like you guys are trying to convince yourself more than anything.

       Dude there are still operatives alive TODAY that have yet to reveal their clandestine missions as part of operation Gladio.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still weapons caches all over Europe that some super old dudes know about that are STILL KEEPING IT SECRET.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it far-fetched to believe that less than 100 people could orchestrate 9/11 in a manner that didn't implicate them?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like George Bush would have that hard of a time what with his brother running the security company for the airports that the planes were hijacked from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wonder how they were able to pull that one off, must of been so hard for the person in charge of the security tape to destroy that evidence...........
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not hard to get peopel to shut their mouths when their involvement in the conspiracy gives them a massive financial windfall, and then on top of that if they do reveal it they'll be killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money buys the "patsy" (person being used for their part in it like Larry Silverstein, he owns the buildings so you have to make him a part of it) and the threat of retaliation keeps the silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that hard, especially with 9/11, when you have the ability to just straight up make a fake company (because you have millions of dollars), and then hire them on a contract to come in during 2-6am to plant demolitions in a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like honestly dude, there are LEGAL MERCENARY COMPANIES.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think people are also shitty enough to to illegal things for money? Like, the mob just doesn't exist right?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no way people would do something that would slaughter thousands of people so that they can make money, that's never happened ever.............................................
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no way the president could ever be assassinated and then the assassination be covered up, there are just TOO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED herp derp.................
      </p>
      <p>
       Because we totally know who killed JFK...............................
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you doubt it's possible for 9/11 to be an inside job when all history proves otherwise?

       This is the kind of answer that lose me. weapon caches, brothers, Larry silverstein, mercenaries companies,mob. See what i mean nobody has any real proof just a bunch of wildly outrageous claims with no facts behind them. Not one thing you said can be proved.

       Wow, it's like you completely disregard that a simple google search would reveal all of the DETAILED INFORMATION on what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up Operation Gladio because now that the war is 70 years over and the people are about to die, some of them have come forward to reveal that they were indeed a part of Operation Gladio, of which there are official government documents proving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Securacom is the company that Marvin P Bush was the CEO of during the 9/11 events, and they provided security for Dulles Airport, the world trade centers, and American Airlines. You can look all of that up and verify it is true.

       Larry Silverstein was the owner of the WTC complex.

       Blackwater is a legal mercenary company, excuse me, "military contractor" for the United States Government, and they have changed their name multiple times, it is now academi.

       gladio, marvin bush, blackwater, securacom and blah blah blah. Sorry pal you lost me even further. Again just a bunch of mumbo jumbo. Not one thing you said there makes me believe "inside job" if anything you're lack of real information makes me certain that you or anybody else that would be posting on reddit have'nt got even a 1% clue as to what went on you are just spouting off alot of things to make people even more confused. Sorry to say but you are not helping you're cause.

       Like 90% of your post is made up of tin foil assumptions. There would have to be hundreds, or even thousands in on the 9/11 conspiracy. And all of them keep quiet and executed it for money? All history doesn't prove shit, the JFK assassination can't even be proven to be a conspiracy, and only 1 person died. You see the world through these tinfoil glasses and ridicule anyone who doesn't share your hair brained philosophy. It only demolishes your credibility when you refuse to have intelligent conversation about the issue. Do you think anyone is waiting to jump over to your side because they were convinced by your condescension?

       First of all there is no way that a 9/11 operation as suggested by many conspiracy theorists could involve so few people. There would be literally thousands of people who could, at least in some way, expose details that would threaten the secrecy of the operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But beyond that it just doesn't make sense. In the 12 years since the event (and much longer if we include planning - 20+ years if we believe in the "signalling" theories) none of the people with actual specific knowledge about any part of the operation have come forward. None.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not that hard, especially with 9/11, when you have the ability to just straight up make a fake company (because you have millions of dollars), and then hire them on a contract to come in during 2-6am to plant demolitions in a building.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And any of the tens (hundreds?) of people involved in the actual planting of those explosives will have realised at about 9:10am of 11 Sep 2001 what they had been part of.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Like honestly dude, there are LEGAL MERCENARY COMPANIES.
You don't think people are also shitty enough to to illegal things for money? Like, the mob just doesn't exist right?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You would need to hire exclusively sociopaths to have any faith that they'd be able to take part in a plot to kill thousands of innocent Americans and then keep the secret!
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you hire some people to secretly rig a building to explode? Probably (although the actual practicalities of explosive demolition make that questionable). Obviously you aren't about to tell them that you're planning to kill thousands of people, so how to you know they're going to keep that secret once they realise what they've been part of?

       Why? Look at how many people were required to know about the NSA wiretapping, to set up. The network, program it, etc. How many leskers did we have? Snowden, and 2 other guys before him that weren't taken seriously?

       Well the people in charge of NSA stuff like that take a sworn oath to not reveal secrets basically threatening their livelihood.Your comparison doesn't really add up to 9/11 inside job. All the people that knew about NSA stuff worked there. Just the sheer amount of people that would need to be in on it including media doesn't add up. I do believe the govt. benefited and took advantage of the fallout.

       What evidence do you have that all the people who worked on the NSA stuff worked there? How do you know there were no contractors? There are a lot of assumptions in your argument. There are in mine too. I realize that without hard data and facts all we are doing is speculating. It is still an interesting conversation.

       Snowden was a contractor they make them take that oath too. Not really many assumptions just stating that there would be too many people that would need to be in on it for not one person to come forward with solid hard evidence. Like in Annie Hall " so the bathroom attendant at the pentagon was in on it too right?"

       You base your logic on MOVIES?

      <p>
       Annie Hall, nonetheless, which was made by pedophile child molester director "Woody Allen" who is a known depraved sexual deviant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single one of his movies is about sex in one way or another, most of them blatantly. If it's not directly about sex it's about "love", or what this sick fuck thinks is love anyway, which is the most selfish way you could ever define love.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your support of the movie, what, you don't think it's possible for them to make the bathroom attendant not be present there for that moment in time if they need be?

       What you need to do is find literature/documentation/resources which establish cases where these types of secret programs have happened in the past and pair them up with other secretive programs that have then occurred subsequently so as to expose the pattern of conspiracies which have lead to the current state of our political system.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be easily achieved through many means such as exposing
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee
       </a>
       that shows how over 60,000 people didn't know they were working on a nuclear bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can gather more events such as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Show these to this person who denies peoples ability to keep things secret through many means, some more devious than others.

       The Manhattan Project
       <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/09/20/worst-manhattan-project-leaks/">
        was leaked

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_spies">
        riddled with spies
       </a>
       .  With that kind of program, they knew it's going to leak eventually, it was just a matter of keeping the lid on tight enough until the bombs dropped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as others have mentioned, it was a wartime effort and those involved had a unique sense of duty to country.  The tens of thousands that would need to be involved in the planning and execution of 9/11 probably wouldn't feel so sentimentally about killing 5000 of their own countrymen for the sake of eroding their own freedoms.

       I really think it's irrelevant if they brought the towers down. It sure would be shocking if they did, but we will never know and its just distracting us from the fact the the government has let terrorists attack in the past. I have no doubt in my mind that they allowed it to happen but all this demolition makes people  shy away from the subject. The 1993 bombing is a good one to look into to understand what im saying.

       Do you know what a last name is?
      </p>
      <p>
       In some cases, it's WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT IT TO BE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any gentile can legally change their last name to "silverstein" or "goldberg" or "nagler" or "feinstein", doesn't mean they're actually Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person can claim to have native American heritage as well, but that doesn't mean it's true, especially if they can't prove it through legitimate documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - Stop making generic claims that "Jews" did it. Do you have any idea how insanely fucking stupid that sounds, to claim that something done by an individual of a group represents the agenda of the entire group?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe one of the conspirators was Jewish, but who the fuck cares? That doesn't matter WHATSOEVER.

       HUMANS ARE EVIL. Not just Jews, or Germans, or Russians, or Americans, or Iraqis, or Saudis, or blah blah blah fucking names for groups of HUMANS.

       How about you look at who the current president was and what brother he had that ran which security company at which airport that the planes were hijacked from, the same airport which also had its' security footage go missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy that owned the buildings wasn't the purportrator, just a low level co-conspirator who didn't really do anything besides allow their plan to unfold, which still implicates him in it but he's not the mastermind by any means.

       Is English you first language? I'm guessing not. But this post is toxic to the whole cause of a true independent investigation. The subject matter undoubtedly attracts nutters, but fuck, these kind of posts really hamper any real discussion. The mechanics of the collapse of the towers is really secondary to a meaningful investigation into who had the means and motive to pull off such a well orchestrated attack.

       The problem with saying that the towers were built to withstand an airplane collision without collapsing is that they simply made the towers as sturdy as they thought they'd have to.  The only way to actually test that the towers were strong enough to withstand an airplane collision would have been to build the towers, fly airplanes into the exact spots at the exact speeds as occurred on 9-11, see them still standing, and then rebuild towers the exact same way for actual use.

       I didn't know if u were making a joke.  Yeah some people say it wasn't billed as unsinkable but it was described as unsinkable by crew members and in newspaper articles so it's kinda a fine line between who actually said it first.  It'd obviously behoove the engineers to not have to shoulder the blame for saying it was built to be unsinkable.

       Right but even those things are proven wrong.  There are so many outside variables that are impossible to calculate.  Something as small as the weather added in or the amount of traffic on the street causing the slightest shift in weight on the streets can change the outcome.  That's why they never have guarantees.  You only come up with 1 in a million or 1 in a billion etc.  The problem is that that 1 could be the first time out of a billion or the billionth time out of a billion.

       I don't believe the official story but I also don't think going to war hinged on the towers collapsing or not.  If the towers were simply crippled and 3000 people still died and the Pentagon was still attacked we would go to war anyways.   I don't buy into the whole "the symbolism of watching the towers come down rallied America to war" idea.  We were going either way.

       Are you an engineer, or are just saying? As far as I know the variables exeamples you have listed here are laughable. The computers simulation requires mainly the building structure against airplane structure + velocity + explosion from fuel. That's basically all you need to test it. WTF weather or traffic have to do at all with the collision?

       The beams in a building are affected by the weight in the building as well as the movement on the ground around the building.  This is why you can never have a perfect computer model.  You can never calculate exactly how these variables will be at any given moment in time.  You just determine as many most likely scenarios you can.  Again, this is why you never get a 0% chance of something happening.  It is always 1 in X (you do agree to that don't you?).  We don't have a full understanding of every branch of physics so small things that we might think to overlook could have a large impact on determining an outcome.  It's like the butterfly effect.  A small uneventful change in the environment can have a large impact elsewhere.

       Edit: and no I'm not an engineer but my buddy is a computer programmer/program designer and he helps design these sorts of mathematical-based modeling programs for a living and this is how he explained that shit to me.

       How is this got anything to do with this? I think even you could build some kind of a tower that can withstand a commercial jet impact. Without computers even. It's just a matter of doing it well enough and having big enough margins.

       The OP is saying that "these towers were built able to withstand jet impact and since they fell after being hit that is the end of the argument - had to be explosives."  I am just saying that even though these towers were said to be built in a way that the engineers thought would keep them standing even after a jet impact, there are unforeseen forces at work upon a collision that could cause the towers to fall.  The chance of them falling wasn't 0%, but slightly greater than 0%, making it not impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may be a smaller conspiracy, however, involved in the actual construction of the towers.  Perhaps they weren't built to the specs that they were advertised as being built to.  Maybe some corners were cut to save on some money in the building process and to cut down on insurance costs by having the highest possible safety rating.  I think it is likely that the towers did actually fall from the impacts.  This doesn't mean I agree with the official story.  I think there were elements at work within our government ensuring that the targets were hit, but I don't think going to war hinged on the towers actually falling, so I don't see why they conspirators would risk being exposed by rigging these buildings with explosives.  That sort of effort would take days of work and man power.  It would be hard to pull off and unnecessary in my opinion.

       If they only hit the buildings and didn't collapse it wouldn't be remembered as vividly as it is and wouldn't had such an impact on the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't say it's impossible that buildings couldn't come down from jet impacts, but in this case it is just out of the question. For me the biggest giveaway is the sudden symmetric collapse, in all 3 cases. The top part of the wtc 1 and 2 hardly leaned at all and after the upper parts were totally destroyed the rest of the building came down so nicely it's unbelievable. It would've looked more plausible if the upper parts toppled over and fell to the ground and the buildings would've been only partially destroyed, but no..
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are right, if they were made with very narrow margins in calculations regarding the plane impacts then it could be possible. I doubt this is the case but cannot know of course.

       Me neither. Might be the truth will never come out. No idea how much computing power it needs to fairly accurately model the incident, but I guess in 30 years it will be doable on a personal computer of some sort. Then we will be able to run a huge amount of simulations to see if the official theory is even plausible. Looking forward to that day!

       Haha, barely. The vast majority of the maths and modelling for the twin towers will have been done by hand. Computer Aided Design was a very new concept in the late 60s and would have been a minor part of the WTC's design at best.

       I don't think it was a inside job, and if anything, the government is fueling the truth movement to distract people from its own incompetency, or even some kind of internal conspiracy fuckup similar to that seen with the 1993 bombing of the WTC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to believe it was a inside job, back when my only knowledge of the event was from a few conspiracy sites, Loose Change, and Zietgiest. Then I started to dig into the conspiracy claims, and all I found were piles and piles of lies and misinformation. You even mention some of it in your post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        it is an obvious fact that the Twin Towers were designed specifically to be able to not collapse by an airplane collision.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why is that a obvious fact to you? have you ever researched it yourself? Because it is wrong in regards to 9/11. The towers were modeled to be capable of withstanding the impact of a 707, not a 767. This modeling was done back in the 1960's, which means that the calculations were mostly manual and vastly inferior to the methods available today. Also, the analysis was never released or documented, it was largely a claim made by the chief engineers who designed the towers, so there's no way to check how the analysis was done. Second, the engineer who did the analysis of a 707 impact (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_E._Robertson">
        Leslie E. Robertson
       </a>
       ) on the WTC said this after the events of 9/11:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We had designed the project for the impact of the largest airplane of its time, the Boeing 707. The 
767 that actually hit the WTC was quite another matter again. First of all it was a bit heavier than 
the 707, not very much heavier, but a bit heavier. But mostly it was flying a lot faster. And the 
energy that it put into the building is proportional to its square of the velocity, as you double the 
velocity, four times the energy. Triple the velocity, eight times the energy and so forth. [Sic; 
actually triple velocity means nine times the kinetic energy.]
       </p>
       <p>
        And then of course with the 707 to the best of my knowledge the fuel load was not considered in 
the design, and indeed I don't know how it could have been considered.
        <strong>
         But, and with the 767 the 
fuel load was enormous compared to that of the 707, it was a fully, fully fuelled airplane compared 
to the 707 which was a landing aircraft.
        </strong>
        Uh, just absolutely no comparison between the two.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/archive/leslie_robertson/index_textonly.shtml">
        [source]
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So it was an analysis of a smaller aircraft, ignoring fuel, traveling much slower,
       <strong>
        and deemed incomparable by the person who did the analysis
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So the towers were not designed specifically to withstand the events of 9/11, claiming they were is misinformation. (interestingly, they did survive the impact, and were later brought down by fires in addition to the damage from the planes).

       First of all, did you even read/comprehend my post? I provided a specific example with what OP based his argument on. You still want more? sure. You mention "there was no plane debris in sight" There were plenty of plane debris, documented by both first responders and photographic evidence.

       As for building 7, I do not want to open that can of worms. Conspiracy theorists rely solely on conjecture to support that section of the theory, claiming "it shouldn't have collapsed, therefore explosives".

       Some people see it and some people don't.  You will find that a lot of people try to argue things that they purely have not researched.  I have researched this thoroughly, and I can see how obvious it is that 9/11 was an inside job.  As much as I want to think that this was terrorists.... the facts basically prove that there is much more to the story.  I have done my research.  I have my opinion.  I am still waiting for somebody to give me any factual evidence that this was a terrorist attack.  I am 100 percent open to listen to anybody's point of view.  As of now the answer is literally staring the world in the face, but only a small percentage are bright enough to see it.  I have stopped arguing with people on this subject and have taken it as a learning experience. People who come to conclusions without logically thinking through facts are not worth my time.  Some people see life black and white and some people don't.

       you must be trolling. He just gave you facts and evidence twice. You're the typical truther that will never support his own argument with facts, instead bash someone who provides facts that so suit you. You also fail to realize each one of your theories is a contradiction of your last.

       I honesly don't know WTF are you rambling about. The crash nappened on the top of the building. Ok, the airplane was bigger, this means more damage - more damaged floors. But no way the whole building will collapse because of just one airplane crash.

       Well, I suggest you re-read it then, because I document how the same people who did the analysis that said the towers could withstand the impact of a plane, said it was not comparable to the plane impacts on 9/11.

       Why do you think that? Do you have some model of the towers that claims they could withstand the impact and resulting fires that happened on 9/11? or are you just basing that statement on what you've been told to think?

       People here should find the footage of an anchor asking people at ground level what they saw and many replied with it was one plane and then a bomb. This video has been deleted from everything. If anyone has it please let me know. The eerie thing is...those people were asked of their names on camera and ended up dead not long after.

       Not exactly. It was designed to withstand a collision with a plane that was a lot smaller and traveling far slower than those that collided with the towers on 9/11.

       From what i've found, it was a myth/tall tale.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The shipbuilders Harland and Wolff insist that the Titanic was never advertised as an unsinkable ship. They claim that the 'unsinkable' myth was the result of people's interpretations of articles in the Irish News and the Shipbuilder magazine. They also claim that the myth grew after the disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, when the New York office of the White Star Line was informed that Titanic was in trouble, White Star Line Vice President P.A.S. Franklin announced " We place absolute confidence in the Titanic. We believe the boat is unsinkable." By the time Franklin spoke those words Titanic was at the bottom of the ocean. It would seem that the White Star Line President was also influenced by the 'myth'."

        Reflections on the World Trade Center

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The two towers were the first structures outside of the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airliner, the Boeing 707. It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark.
       </p>
       <p>
        [...]
       </p>
       <p>
        The buildings survived the impact of the Boeing 767 aircraft, an impact very much greater than had been contemplated in our design (a slow-flying Boeing 707 lost in the fog and seeking a landing field). Therefore, the robustness of the towers was exemplary. At the same time, the fires raging in the inner reaches of the buildings undermined their strength. In time, the unimaginable happened . . . wounded by the impact of the aircraft and bleeding from the fires, both of the towers of the World Trade Center collapsed.

       My mom watched it happening on the news and commented how all the officials seemed false, she said it looked like a play when George Bush came onto the scene. I wasn't really old enough to know what was happening so I can't vouch for what she said but looking at the evidence has convinced me of the truth and I will stand by it when someone tries to convince me otherwise.

       A few of the things that changed my mind. The only reason I hadn't thought it was an inside job was because I wasn't truly aware of it as it was happening and took the facts my school gave me at face value. As soon as I really looked at it and paid attention, I realized it wasn't as it seemed.

       You're right. Its just a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       But look at every article that's posted here. They all share a common theme. They all present one side of the issue, and through intimidation tactics and name-calling, they do their best to make sure that the other side is completely absent from the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a closed circuit. You are not allowed to say anything negative about another member of the group, or the group itself, lest ye be banished. (see rule #10)
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not allowed to even discuss anything that is going on here in other subreddits. (see rule #9)
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a coordinated effort to push a specific agenda in a specific direction and if you disagree, you disappear. Its that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this is just a theory.

       Once again, proving he knows nothing about physics, it's far easier for him, a drop of ignorance in the ocean to become one with the ocean than the contrary. He's the one fighting the tide, and it's quite the spectacle watching him try.

A person could say that the majority of posters in here can't handle the idea that the world is a fucked up place where random acts of extreme violence, like 9/11 or the boston bombing or sandy hook shootings, happen. That the idea frightens them so much that they think it had to be orchestrated, that there needs to be a grand plan. In other words, the thought that these things happen and there is nothing they can do to stop it is more terrifying than a group like the illuminati or the government doing this things on purpose, perhaps to further an evil cause.

       I think that it's a valid point to flip this around, but I personally would love for any of those events to just be "fucked up crazy shit".  That would be more comforting to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is un-comforting is that in each case, there are always these loose ends that don't tie nicely to the story.  All I want is a logical explanation for each loose end, so that I can agree with the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       So its frustrating, when you question the official story, and get pushed off as a "conspira-tard", when all you are really trying to do is confirm the official story as credible.  I also don't want to be hushed, when I want more evidence, or confirmation of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point, the official story may lose credibility, and then its time for a "re-write".  Documenting history though, doesn't seem to like to follow the scientific process.  There is too much political pressure to ensure the first draft is correct.  Political careers often depend on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were so quick to find someone to blame for 911, we never really took the time to review everything.  Maybe the Israelis hood-winked us, maybe they didn't, I don't fucking know, but I'd like to know we looked at all the possibilities before we decided on going after Saddam Hussein. (Who's not Al Qaeda and didn't have WMD)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't look back at this and say, "what the fuck happened here", then I feel like you aren't making much an effort to look at reality.

       Just remember that there isn't always a clear cut answer for everything. Some things will never be explained, either because the people that did them are dead, there was a random accident or our understanding of events is lacking a critical piece of information. Also, never forget Hanlon's razor, never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity. Also, never underestimate the stupidity,  arrogance and pride of the average human.

       I think there are plenty of people on the edge of not knowing what to believe.  They come here and let their beliefs be challenged, to either re-confirm they are right, or to open an eye to something new.  These very threads are how we change.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I see this "wall of shills" as just another wave of people waking up.  Who want to know if what they believe still has merit, or if there is some new understanding that is widely held.

       The beams in a building are affected by the weight in the building as well as the movement on the ground around the building.  This is why you can never have a perfect computer model.  You can never calculate exactly how these variables will be at any given moment in time.  You just determine as many most likely scenarios you can.  Again, this is why you never get a 0% chance of something happening.  It is always 1 in X (you do agree to that don't you?).  We don't have a full understanding of every branch of physics so small things that we might think to overlook could have a large impact on determining an outcome.  It's like the butterfly effect.  A small uneventful change in the environment can have a large impact elsewhere.
      </p>

       Edit: and no I'm not an engineer but my buddy is a computer programmer/program designer and he helps design these sorts of mathematical-based modeling programs for a living and this is how he explained that shit to me.

       Do you know what a last name is?
      </p>
      <p>
       In some cases, it's WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT IT TO BE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any gentile can legally change their last name to "silverstein" or "goldberg" or "nagler" or "feinstein", doesn't mean they're actually Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person can claim to have native American heritage as well, but that doesn't mean it's true, especially if they can't prove it through legitimate documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - Stop making generic claims that "Jews" did it. Do you have any idea how insanely fucking stupid that sounds, to claim that something done by an individual of a group represents the agenda of the entire group?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe one of the conspirators was Jewish, but who the fuck cares? That doesn't matter WHATSOEVER.
      </p>
      <p>
       HUMANS ARE EVIL. Not just Jews, or Germans, or Russians, or Americans, or Iraqis, or Saudis, or blah blah blah fucking names for groups of HUMANS.

       How about you look at who the current president was and what brother he had that ran which security company at which airport that the planes were hijacked from, the same airport which also had its' security footage go missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy that owned the buildings wasn't the purportrator, just a low level co-conspirator who didn't really do anything besides allow their plan to unfold, which still implicates him in it but he's not the mastermind by any means.
