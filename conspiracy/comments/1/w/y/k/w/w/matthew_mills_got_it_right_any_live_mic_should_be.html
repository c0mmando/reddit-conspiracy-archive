    <div class="md"><p>Yes, go on and make fools of yourself.</p>

<p>What is needed is challenging context. Like when Social Security/social security of any kind is discussed, bring up why European countries abandoned Gold; why there is no discussion of a currency/circular stream based approach instead of a capital/interest based one. When there is a discussion about infrastructure of any kind, ask on what basis those panel experts expect any source of energy to come the next five decades.<br/>
Do not look distressed or anything, just ask that question and add that this is exactly the time between the 1970 and now, 1970 where the North Sea and Alaska went online and where any planner asking the DOE would have been given the sheet with very accurate predictions. </p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you do it like you want to do it?</li>
<li>What are your data, who told you that?</li>
<li>Can we do that indefinitely and if not, why are you advocating it?</li>
<li><p>Who controls the proposed process? Can it be locally sourced and controlled? Why not? Do you think this is a sane solution if not?</p></li>
<li><p>etc. play dumb, let them explain themselves out of the room</p></li>
</ul>

<p>edit: was meant to poke the interest at city hall meetings etc. grabbing a mike is... weird and futile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly think that you and people like you don&#39;t really want an objective investigation. You want one that is going to come to your predetermined conclusion. If a new investigation came out and said it wasn&#39;t the government but in fact Muslim terrorists you would cry foul and cover up all over again bc that&#39;s not the explanation you want. Btw thousands of educated people think that you are wrong as well like you told the guy above but I guess they don&#39;t count bc they don&#39;t believe in your predetermined conclusion.
