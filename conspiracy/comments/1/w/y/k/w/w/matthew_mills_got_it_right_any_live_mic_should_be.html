       I don't talk about it anymore unless someone else brings it up. I've been called terrible names, accused of being anti American, and have even had relationships damaged by my views on that day. I'm happy it's finally getting popular but it took you all 10 years to just start questioning it? Come on. I'm numb to it all now.

       What is needed is challenging context. Like when Social Security/social security of any kind is discussed, bring up why European countries abandoned Gold; why there is no discussion of a currency/circular stream based approach instead of a capital/interest based one. When there is a discussion about infrastructure of any kind, ask on what basis those panel experts expect any source of energy to come the next five decades.
       <br/>
       Do not look distressed or anything, just ask that question and add that this is exactly the time between the 1970 and now, 1970 where the North Sea and Alaska went online and where any planner asking the DOE would have been given the sheet with very accurate predictions.

       If it was about something constructive, perhaps. But the whole 9/11 truther movement is just a bit absurd. Thoroughly debunked, well researched, and there are much better ways to spend your time.

       Nice try but complete nonsense. Nothing at all has been debunked. As a matter of fact, the 'explanations' are so dubious that they throw up more questions. The sentence above is like a weak voice, pre-written and with no substance at all. 
Many scientists and people of value have asked for a thorough investigation but it is not granted, all of those also doubt the official explanation. That is thousands of educated people who have their doubts to your one-man empty sentence.

       I truly think that you and people like you don't really want an objective investigation. You want one that is going to come to your predetermined conclusion. If a new investigation came out and said it wasn't the government but in fact Muslim terrorists you would cry foul and cover up all over again bc that's not the explanation you want. Btw thousands of educated people think that you are wrong as well like you told the guy above but I guess they don't count bc they don't believe in your predetermined conclusion. The truth movement will always just say "Nuh uh it hasn't been debunked" with out ever offering any counter narrative or solid alternate explanation and will live on forever bc conspiracy theories never truly die.

       Look into the actual evidence and you will see that the official story is a massive cover-up.

       Two planes did fly into those towers, but they were allowed to do so, and they were not the cause of the buildings collapse.

       Everything you say is "debunked" is well accepted as debunked and we don't talk about those WRONG theories, such as bombs under the plane fueselage or military jets replacing the planes or any other absurditites like that.
