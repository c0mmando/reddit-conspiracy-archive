        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi Guys,</p>

<p>longtime <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> reader, I just wanted to float this as I haven&#39;t seen much discussion about it..</p>

<p>Im UK based but have kept up to date with all events surrounding the superbowl as I was intrigued as to whether, on this platform to tens of millions, anything was going to take place.. </p>

<p>I watched the song that flashed &#39;PREPARE&#39; over and over and im curious as to why such a clear and concise message such as &#39;PREPARE&#39; would be beamed to people on the basis that it has a darker meaning. </p>

<p>It seems massively obvious to say to people that &#39;somethings coming&#39; in one way or another, but why giving us a warning? What is the benefit if your going to come to try and fuck us anyway?</p>

<p>Feedback and thoughts appreciated</p>

<p>Sev</p>

<p>Speaking of distraction, why not throw in a false flag and declare martial law?  How about a cyber attack on the global financial network?  How about a default on US sovereign debt?</p>

<p>PREPARE.  Because the powers that be are running out of options, and they need to play a new hand to keep their aura of power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it boils down to, not everyone that knows what is coming wants it to happen, so maybe it is a warning from those people? Or, it could be another wave of predictive programming as usual. Everything is about preparing lately, or &quot;something is coming&quot;, it&#39;s being repeated in so many things on TV. I rarely watch TV anymore, I just flip it on to see what is being programmed into people these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The warning phenomenon is interesting. My belief is that a massive financial collapse (and/or other disaster event) of global scale is being planned. It is not a single government which is behind this but a trans-national elite cabal (referred to variously as the military-industrial complex, the illuminati, Freemasons). The US President, both Houses of Congress, the Supreme Court and security services are under the control of this cabal. Other Western governments are influenced but not controlled by this elite.</p>

<p>The individual members of the cabal are governed by their own rules, their own code of honour. One rule is that they never lie about their future intentions - it is beneath them. You only lie to people you are scared of, after all, and we are impotent paeons. A subsidiary principle of this would be that their intentions have to be advertised to the paeons. They warn us in plain sight that something is about to happen. </p>

<p>After perpetrating an atrocity or ritual sacrifice, there will be a signature using buildings or other architectural features on the earth&#39;s surface indicating that they were responsible. There is a very enlightening, but long video which covers this phenomenon <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ia2EZkCP1g">here.</a></p>

<p>If you want a more recent example, here is a post about a discovery I made using Google Earth in relation to the Sandy Hook ritual/event, which I believe provides a clear example of such a &quot;signature&quot;.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1w8d04/conspiracy_theorist_litmus_test/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1w8d04/conspiracy_theorist_litmus_test/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with all of your points here but I think an important thing to mention is that a financial collapse of some sort is mathematically inevitable regardless of any plans that may or may not be in place.  The bubble can only inflate for so long - it <em>will</em> pop eventually, likely sooner than later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with that. </p>

<p>The collapse could, and should have happened in 2008, but the corpse of the global economy was resuscitated like Frankestein using the shock therapy of TARP; QE 1,2,3 ad infinitum; bailouts of bankrupt states; bailouts of too-big-to fail banks and corporations and the massive rigging of financial markets to make the economy appear healthy (eg pumping up the stock market whilst suppressing the gold price).</p>

<p>I would add that TPTB know these were temporary measures, and have made the necessary preparations for the collapse. This will occur at a time of their choosing (but soon), and will likely be much worse than it needs to be for 99% of ordinary people.</p>
