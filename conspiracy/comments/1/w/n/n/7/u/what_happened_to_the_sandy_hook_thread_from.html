<p>Looks like OP&#39;s post was deleted.  Also a lot of the comments from the thread seem to have been deleted/removed, too.</p>

<p>OP&#39;s account, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/QuebecMeme">http://www.reddit.com/user/QuebecMeme</a>, is <em>also</em> deleted.</p>

<p>What happened here?  Anyone have any details?  Mods?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good. This mob mentality shit has to be handled w a firm hand. I can&#39;t believe how many folks here think user-generated YouTube videos are credible sources. There&#39;s much that is to be questioned, yes, but how about doing it effectively and rationally?! Are these uneducated &amp; emotional people who don&#39;t know how to essentially do a research project? </p>

<p>Using official reports, fact checking against irrefutable evidence, compiling it in an organized and professional manner is what needs to happen. Posting cropped images w no sources, frantic illogical reasoning and &quot;righteous anger&quot; is what&#39;s destroying this sub. They&#39;re making us all look like paranoid idiots.

<p>You were earlier exhorting others to meet this standard, and I agree, it&#39;s what we should be aiming for (although we usually have to settle for just &quot;evidence&quot;, because conspiracies are issues where many of the facts have been withheld or covered up.)</p>

<p>Because religious or political convictions can be a distorting prism, it is preferable to set that prism aside when trying to objectively analyse (possible) conspiracies. </p>
