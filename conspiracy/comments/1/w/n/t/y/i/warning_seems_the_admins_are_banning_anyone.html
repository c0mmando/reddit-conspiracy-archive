<p>Because there&#39;s no proof that it is actually you, it&#39;s simply not allowed.</p>

<p>The proof is that all the other sites you own also claim the same identity. If my twitter account, @WreckSomething says I am <a href="/u/wrecksomething">/u/wrecksomething</a> whose name is &quot;Wreck Something&quot; there&#39;s no reasonable doubts left, are there? This is how <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> mods often verify identities after all, and real names are allowed there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posting a name most likely wouldn&#39;t get you banned</p>

<p>In this case it did. Even though a reddit user was self promoting and identifying, purposely linking their .org domain name, youtube handle, twitter account, reddit account, and real life name, simply quoting that person&#39;s own reddit activity is shadowban worthy? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The formation documents consist of a &quot;charter&quot; (called a Certificate of Incorporation or Articles of Incorporation) for a corporation or a Certificate of Formation or Limited Partnership for other entities. The formation documents will include basic information, such as the company&#39;s name and an address for its agent for service of process (a service that can be provided for a nominal fee by a number of professional Registered Agents with offices throughout the country). The charter is also required to contain the corporate purpose, which can be as broad as &quot;any lawful act or activity,&quot; and the total number of shares that the entity will be authorized to issue.[4] <strong>Other provisions may be included, such as those providing for director and officer indemnification and certain corporate governance procedures, but these are not mandatory. The charter is not in fact meant to provide disclosure of business or financial information, but rather is the contract between shareholders and the company that can be amended only with shareholder approval. The bylaws of a U.S. company, which are separate from the charter and contain more detailed governance rules, are not required to be disclosed by a private company.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, but there is also more going on here.</p>

<p>A limited purpose public figure actually has a fairly precising definition lexically,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>those whom have &quot;thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in reality, that definition is really expanding to include people who are thrust into the spotlight by virtue of happenstance. It&#39;s this slow adaption of the concept of &quot;limited&quot; in the phrasing which intrigues me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legally speaking, you&#39;re wrong, too. The LEGAL definition of a &quot;public figure&quot; is as follows - &quot;n. in the law of defamation (libel and slander), a personage of great public interest or familiarity like a government official, politician, celebrity, business leader, movie star or sports hero. Incorrect harmful statements published about a public figure cannot be the basis of a lawsuit for defamation unless there is proof that the writer or publisher intentionally defamed the person with malice (hate).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are plenty of <em>weird</em> things about the Sandy Hook that are worth investigating. </p>

<p>However...too many conspiracy theorists (a term I&#39;m not using in the pejorative sense) lack adequate bullshit filters and suffer heavily from confirmation bias i.e. <em>This sounds like it must be true, it fits with what I&#39;ve heard so far, so I will write about it as if it is, indeed, the truth.</em> and not bother to nail down the facts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.helpfreetheearth.com/news785_bostonactors.html">Combine that with a negligible grasp of the English language, the web design skills of an autistic duck</a> and the firm belief that: </p>

<p><strong>EVERYONE IS OUT TO GET ME ALWAYS WITHOUT EXCEPTION IT&#39;S NEVER MY FAULT I&#39;VE DONE NOTHING WRONG CENSORSHIP CENSORSHIP CENSORSHIP OBAMA 1984 HITLER REICHSTAG</strong> </p>

<p>...and you get posts like this one. </p>

<p>You talk about your post being deleted, reddit is compromised, etc. But the fact is, perhaps you did post some personal info that went against reddit&#39;s policies, eh? </p>

<p>Seriously man, chill. Reddit is not out to get you. The year is 2014, not 1984. Reddit is not a &quot;compromised&quot; platform and is still quite relevant (because people are still using it). </p>

<p>If you want to do <em>serious</em> research, present yourself seriously. Otherwise you&#39;re just noise. You and others like you come across as the &quot;nuts&quot; on the Conspiracy Theorist Spectrum and, simply put, <strong>You. Are. Not. Helping.</strong></p>

<p>The homeless guy with lice standing on the corner could be dropping bombshells of truth. But no one&#39;s gonna listen to him. He&#39;s nuts, right? Conspiracy theorists, pfft!</p>

<p>Presentation matters. </p>

<p>Adam Lanza Death Date in SSI:  12/13/12</p>

<p>I get that there are typos. But, come on.</p>

<p>Also, if you STILL ask the average person I know about Nancy Lanza, many &quot;intelligent, educated&quot; people I know would say &quot;Oh, didn&#39;t she work there? Like not as a teacher, but a volunteer aide or something?&quot;  despite this: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to ask myself, are you really this foolish, or just a govt shill?  Are you honestly of the mind that the strongest, most powerful Navy in the world does not properly protect it&#39;s Pacific assets while docked and did not know that a massive attack was approaching?  A full load of aircraft carriers, bombers, and attack planes? The official lie was that a telephone was not present to allow the notification that an attack was approaching.  This is obviously untrue.  First link in a quick search to determine if I speak the truth, or of you speak the truth.  Things aren&#39;t looking so good for you, I&#39;m afraid.  <a href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=408">http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=408</a></p>

<p>To think the relevance of prior false flag attacks that propelled the American public to act against it&#39;s own best interest on multiple occasions is foolish.  This tool has been used against us many times, and we should not allow it to continue.  The evidence that Sandy Hook did not happen according to the official conspiracy theory is overwhelming.  If you&#39;re not a shill, I wish you much luck in discovering the shrouded truths that surround you.</p>
