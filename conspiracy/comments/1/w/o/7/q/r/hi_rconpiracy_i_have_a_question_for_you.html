       Fiat currency is the destroyer of empires. The modern world does not understand currency nor do they understand economics. I am vehemently opposed to fiat currency because it allows governments (and corporations) to grow painfully large. In the short run, flooding markets with free money can help ease recessions. In the long run, inflation builds which encourages debt instead of saving, which leads to the society we have today. Fiat currency enslaves citizens through debt, and threatens an entire generation with financial calamity.

       I disagree with you. It's not the nature of the fiat currency, i.e. money backed by nothing. The problem lies with the debt that comes with the money.

       Well I have to agree with you, but the nature of fiat currency is that printing more is irresistible. It's like saying yes to storing the Mexican cartel's weed. It's just not a good idea, cause you know you're going to abuse it.

       You're right, but there's no way to hold the FED accountable today as it grossly mishandles its authority. Whereas a government-controlled fiat currency would allow heads to roll if it was mismanaged.

       Seashells could theoretically be used as currency. As long as it does its job.

       The beliefs you hold are very different as well ..  parakeets and

        /r/relationships

       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do you think makes you purchase a wild jungle bird while billions of other people are content with dogs, cats and the similar small mammals ?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think makes you want to be involved in other peoples relationships and hand out advice like some Counselor ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it very weird that you try to play the card of the people here being somehow different from all other people in the world while you yourself, being a 22 yr old female immigrant, bird owner with a boyfriend with Psoriasis, is a pretty fucking unique position to be in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I come to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of conspiracy's are proven true. Iran-Contra Drug Smuggling, NSA spying, The vicious mad-dog like behavior of FBI, CIA, DEA for generations. They tried to deport John Lennon for being Anti-war ! They tried to get MLK to kill himself ! Not only was JFK assassinated, but his brother Bobby Kennedy as well, but it MUST have been just wackjobs ... right ... So what makes you think they are telling you the truth or have your best interests in mind ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Before NSA revelations I was called "paranoid" for refusing to carry a cell phone .. now those same people say "well we could guess it was happening" .. NO, NO YOU COULDNT ! I guessed and was ridiculed for it.

       Yes. It feels like there are more people who doubt the official story, which doesn't actually make it "controversial" as OP puts it.

       I don't believe in "conspiracy theory" as a term. There are truths, lies, and things we don't know. I have several doubts about many notions, but besides 9/11, I don't proclaim to know.

       The "conspiracy theory" term is in my opinion used as a rationalization for inconvenient truths, or the possibility of them being true. Many people call themselves conspiracy theorists today because they're sick of the stigma and want to wear it like armor for it to not hurt them. I don't.

       You have to ask yourself first if there really is a consensus among the population. As you put it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Do you have any specific ideas on why you see what an overwhelming majority of the world's population does not?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which ideas would that be? Belief in God, 9/11 inside job, moon-landing hoax, vaccines linked to autism, etc? I only believe one of these examples to be true. And since you try labeling me, you tell me which one it is.

       You want to know why people think that there is a conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy =  An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act. Also can be defined as a secret plan or agreement to carry out an illegal or harmful act, esp with political motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So. Why they fuck are you asking such a general and ignorant question?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you're a shill and troll. Or you're a 9 year old, or an ignorant ant. Either way, it's truly none of your business. I think that there is no question that SOME people at high up levels in our and other govt's are involved in conspiracy. How could one not?

       Recycled comment from the last time this was asked here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most do not believe  in the false flag operations and attacks on America by the government because of the concepts of Edward Bernays wherein a big lie is repeated ad infinitum by 'experts' and because of the term 'conspiracy theorist' which was a propaganda campaign by the CIA in the 1960's , It worked very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information about conspiracies is highly compartmentalized because people have a taboo about discussing religion or politics in their day to day lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Origin of the term Conspiracy Theory.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       DeHaven-Smith has shown that the conspiracy-theory label was popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967.[20] The program was directed at criticisms of the Warren Commission’s conclusion that President Kennedy had been assassinated by a lone gunman. The propaganda campaign called on media corporations and journalists to criticize “conspiracy theorists” and raise questions about their motives and judgments. The CIA told its contacts that “parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”
      </p>
      <p>
       They Do believe because they have looked into various situations and found the system rigged and exploited by greedy leaders who have virtually no limits on how far they will go to achieve more power or money.

       Yes. It feels like there are more people who doubt the official story, which doesn't actually make it "controversial" as OP puts it.

       I don't believe in "conspiracy theory" as a term. There are truths, lies, and things we don't know. I have several doubts about many notions, but besides 9/11, I don't proclaim to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "conspiracy theory" term is in my opinion used as a rationalization for inconvenient truths, or the possibility of them being true. Many people call themselves conspiracy theorists today because they're sick of the stigma and want to wear it like armor for it to not hurt them. I don't.
