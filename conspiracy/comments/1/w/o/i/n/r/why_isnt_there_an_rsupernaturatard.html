        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been thinking lately, there are plenty of subs that discuss controversial beliefs, opinions, UFOs, ghosts &amp; what have you, but there aren&#39;t any subs dedicated to &quot;satire&quot; of those, so why is <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>? </p>

<p>This is not an invite for <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> members, I&#39;m asking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> why <strong>they</strong> think conspiracy theories are a better target for mockery, I don&#39;t really need to know why someone who does needs to justify it, but how <strong>this</strong> community feels about it &amp; their ideas as to why it is targeted.</p>

<p>I ask because after all the activity I was witness to awhile back, while civil discourse is good, &amp; calm discussion about certain conspiracy theories can be enjoyable, I noticed a lot of personal attacks &amp; character defamation, which is never relevant to the discussions, &amp; if you ask me, just disrupts the conversation, which is convenient. (But that&#39;s entirely speculation)</p>

<p>Is it just because we are a popular subreddit, or is there something I&#39;m missing, I am a relatively new redditor after all, 4-5 months IIRC, or maybe I&#39;m mistaken &amp; there is a satirical subreddit for every controversial one, though I failed to find any.</p>

<p>If this post is in any violations of the rules I apologise &amp; understand if it is removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find that many of the weird accounts that frequent this sub often use the tactics of disinformation and propaganda, which only makes me more suspicious of them and only makes me think there is something they do not want people to know about.

    <div class="md"><p>Based on my own experience, I prolly used to fall into their same belief system, that while I could reconcile that yeah, shit like Watergate and JFK happened, but in general, the world and humanity was good and government was a good thing and blah blah blah. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t stress about the &quot;trolls&quot;, guys. They just haven&#39;t seen the larger picture yet. It&#39;s part of the exposure method, we get small clues along the way and our ego rejects anything our denial can&#39;t handle. They&#39;ll get here eventually. Love them til they love themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but why is most of the content on <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> aimed on the most part at mocking this sub for political topics?</p>

<p>Why spend so much time poking fun at certain claims about 9/11, but not at people who claim to see ghosts?</p>

<p>If being updated more often is the excuse then that&#39;s basically saying it&#39;s more fun to laugh at something that will get more attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this is definitely deeper than I gathered, but most certainly helpful, basically when I see these tactics, should I just ignore them? I feel that I would probably do an equal disservice to this sub if I try and argue the points, because I am not a smart man, but I have to say, these links are quite helpful.</p>

<p>[EDIT]; And to note, I have seen these tactics used, specifically the &quot;anger trolling&quot; and it was rampant in <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">/r/conspiratocracy</a> IIRC.</p>
