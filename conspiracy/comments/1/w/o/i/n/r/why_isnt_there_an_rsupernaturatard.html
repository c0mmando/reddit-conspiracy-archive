       I have been thinking lately, there are plenty of subs that discuss controversial beliefs, opinions, UFOs, ghosts &amp; what have you, but there aren't any subs dedicated to "satire" of those, so why is
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not an invite for
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       members, I'm asking
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       why
       <strong>
        they
       </strong>
       think conspiracy theories are a better target for mockery, I don't really need to know why someone who does needs to justify it, but how
       <strong>
        this
       </strong>
       community feels about it &amp; their ideas as to why it is targeted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask because after all the activity I was witness to awhile back, while civil discourse is good, &amp; calm discussion about certain conspiracy theories can be enjoyable, I noticed a lot of personal attacks &amp; character defamation, which is never relevant to the discussions, &amp; if you ask me, just disrupts the conversation, which is convenient. (But that's entirely speculation)
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it just because we are a popular subreddit, or is there something I'm missing, I am a relatively new redditor after all, 4-5 months IIRC, or maybe I'm mistaken &amp; there is a satirical subreddit for every controversial one, though I failed to find any.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this post is in any violations of the rules I apologise &amp; understand if it is removed.

       this sub literally gets harassed just for not believing a official narrative. We see shadowbans and posts removed daily. This non-stop harassment was meant to deter us, but we have found it reinforces the truth: We have come closer to the reality of our government's actions and there is a active effort to try to silence that.

       Oh, come on. We all know that mentally healthy people spend an inordinate amount of time and energy on people that they think are insane. They care so much about you and want to lead you back on the right path by displaying their animosity towards you.

       I find that many of the weird accounts that frequent this sub often use the tactics of disinformation and propaganda, which only makes me more suspicious of them and only makes me think there is something they do not want people to know about. Whether they realize it or not, they do  their agenda a great disservice. I find these tools invaluable:

       Well this is definitely deeper than I gathered, but most certainly helpful, basically when I see these tactics, should I just ignore them? I feel that I would probably do an equal disservice to this sub if I try and argue the points, because I am not a smart man, but I have to say, these links are quite helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       [EDIT]; And to note, I have seen these tactics used, specifically the "anger trolling" and it was rampant in
       <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">

       Once you think someone is using those tactics deliberately, I would call them out. If they persist with the stupid stuff, they are wasting your time by trying to have the last word. I would ignore them completely.

       Ghosts and UFO's don't get updated very frequently and there's not much variation.

       Don't stress about the "trolls", guys. They just haven't seen the larger picture yet. It's part of the exposure method, we get small clues along the way and our ego rejects anything our denial can't handle. They'll get here eventually. Love them til they love themselves.

       Well this is definitely deeper than I gathered, but most certainly helpful, basically when I see these tactics, should I just ignore them?
