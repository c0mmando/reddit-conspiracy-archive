       All the social conditioning of the past 50+ years has been HIGHLY intentional. God and religion has
       <em>
        purposely
       </em>
       removed from your life. The recent "demonizing" of the Tea Party and "radical fundamentalists" has ALL been part of the programming. The introduction of drugs, "immoral" behavior, the staggering rate of STDs, the "random acts of violence", the paranoia about your neighbors or the government, the fear of removing guns from your home, the introduction of "fast food" (and the removal of real survival skills, like knowing how to cook or heat your home without electricity or fossil fuels), ALL OF IT HAS BEEN SOCIAL CONDITIONING. ALL OF IT, INTENTIONAL, WITH AN END GOAL IN MIND. Fracturing the people and causing mistrust.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They" don't want you to DO THE NEXT RIGHT THING. "They" want you to panic, that's why the majority of apocalyptic themed entertainment is centered around MASS HYSTERIA and RAMPANT VIOLENCE. "They" want you to panic, fear everyone, kill your neighbors, riot, loot and burn. "They" want justification for rounding up citizens and martial law. This whole NWO order you guys fear, it's ALL ABOUT TURNING ON EACH OTHER AND NOT MAGNIFYING THE GOOD. Not having faith in God or humanity IS the big secret plot, guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       When SHTF (and it will, it's only a matter of weeks or months, the WHOLE WORLD ECONOMY is about to bust apart, even my brother in Moscow is saying the actions in Ukraine are going to spill into Russia), you have to remember ONE THING. (Sorry to those not in the US, but you can gleam from this advice what you will, I'm not trying to rally patriotism, but the HUMANITY in all of us.) Humanity has faced worse than this before, the plagues, crazy earthquakes and fires, the Civil war, the Dust Bowl, etc. American ingenuity HAS ALWAYS counter-fought the "repression". (The British are coming, I'm gonna warn EVERYONE AND SAVE LIVES!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever happens, don't REACT with your first thought. Trust in God, trust in humanity, trust that PEACE can always overcome HATE. There's a reason the "peace mongers" and "justice minded" end up assassinated. There's a reason Occupy was subverted. It's the same reason they're pushing the threat of random violence and fear of gun owners. "THEY" want us to hurt each other. They want "just cause" to authorize militarization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking you, you dear redditor, look into your soul. Do you really BELIEVE that violence is the answer? Do you REALLY BELIEVE you have more of a right to survive than others? Do you REALLY believe that you're safer protecting your own interests or family, rather than banding together? Do you really believe there is no God? Or was that all part of their malevolent plan all along, to make you weak and afraid? (Don't recoil at that "label", I don't think you're weak or afraid. I think you're angry for good reason. I think you needed to feel some sense of "control" about all the things that are no longer in your control. That is what spiritual death IS, taking your will back, thinking your will is greater than God's.) Oh ye of little faith, the Bible tells us it is "foolish" to say "There is no God". It doesn't say it's a unpardonable sin, the Psalms and Proverbs are all filled with amazing insight into our current situation. God will rain "fiery ash" upon the wicked, if that's not a nuke, WHAT IS?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't dismiss this "rant" as some "bible-thumping moron". If you've looked deep enough, you've realized this whole thing isn't just about money and power and technology toys, it's a spiritual battle. Christianity has always challenged Zionism, bankers and religious manipulation. Jesus came to say the kingdom of God lies in the hearts of men, not a physical location. The temple wasn't necessary for communion, the communion lies between human souls and God. It isn't about the tassels on your cloak or even the use of money. It's about the LOVE of money and how you obtain it and what you use it for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't dismiss this as saying Christianity is greater than any other religion. Many religions focus on "being good or kind", but limit the "duty" of humans to only being responsible for themselves. You ARE your brother's keeper and we're all brothers in Christ. Christianity is the evolution of all the "right" things about olde religions, with the "self serving" parts removed. Humans are meant to live communally and in one spirit. The biggest deception has been about what that spirit is and the RESPONSIBILITY of the individual. You are NOT happy with your life because you lack true spiritual connections. (If you were happy, would you really be on reddit right now? Would I? No, I'd be going to focus on my spiritual strength and communing with others, which I'm literally about to go do, as soon as I post this. But I feel a sense of duty to warn my "brethren", other lost sheep as myself.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't just downvote this or leave a scathing remark. I'm not sure I've expressed myself clearly or in the most appropriate tone, or even expanded at length in a fashion that some would call "well researched". I am admitting to all that. I'm just asking YOU, for one second, to think really hard and deep about the social conditioning, and consider the larger SPIRITUAL aspects of it. You want your freedom? It lies in FAITH. You want power? It lies in FAITH. You want to know truth? It lies in FAITH. YOUR SOUL WAS MADE TO REVEL IN THE WONDER OF GOD. Take back your soul, reddit. It's time. It's time for humanity to overcome evil. God bless. (Seriously, may God bless you and your day. GROW. LEARN. THRIVE.)
      </p>

       Hope" is the thing with feathers—
That perches in the soul—
And sings the tune without the words—
And never stops—at all—

       Everybody can see your strength of feeling of this issue after reading this, and that you are a genuine person who believes their approach will help others.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I expect many here will feel (as I do) that religion is not, and never has been, the answer to humanity's problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some, might also say that the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are key pillars of humanity's oldest conspiracy - the systematic mind-control of the masses through childhood conditioning, to believe in omniscient and punitive supernatural entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Countless billions of humans have based their lives on  religious rules that were created (by other humans) in order to enslave them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being loving, compassionate, respectful, fair, generous, open-minded, honest, trustworthy, courageous are positive behaviours which are completely separate from religion.

       This is such an important concept that is lost on so many. Being from the north and then going to college in the south was eye-opening. Blind faith in religion is one of the biggest hinderances towards true progress because the devoutly religious have some of the strongest connections to their own beliefs compared to others.  It [too] often creates the situation of "we're in a giant car headed for a brick wall and everyone is arguing about where they're going to sit."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can manage to use religion to open the religious' eyes to what's going on that it could be a powerful tool, but more often I see religion just become a distraction from the real issues.  Religion is not necessary to be a good human being.

       I enjoyed reading this and i really appreciate your perspective. But Christianity is probably the single most destructive control mechanism used by the elite and even if it wasn't being used to manipulate millions it would be used to distract people with the afterlife. Christians are perfectly content with a life of total shit because "at least i have heaven waiting for me".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also worth mentioning that christianity has been used since the 50's to divide people, marginalize racial groups and overemphasize identity politics. If anything religion needs to be completely stripped from our culture before any absolute systemic change happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion is subjective, make virtue your religion.

       Ok, this attitude I expected, because it used to be my own. I used to THINK this way, but I didn't really FEEL it to be true. That's why I kept searching for answers, for a purpose, for authenticity. I KNOW when I see or experience TRUTH, I suspect you do too, or you wouldn't be in this sub, right? Because you KNOW when you've been deceived, even if you haven't fully realized it, but the mind, body and soul still SEEK TRUTH, until you find it. Then you KNOW peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity has been destructive,
       <em>
        when used politically
       </em>
       since before Jesus even died.  That's how the Jewish council was able to circumvent the existing political structure, when both Pilate and King Herod refused to condemn the man, for OBVIOUS political motivations. The message of Christ was too powerful for the elite, challenged by not only his accusations against the power structure, but because Jesus WAS EDUCATED in the "law of Abraham". He was able to use the Torah to validate his own divinity. He was able to point out the hypocrisy and manipulation OF MEN. He was able to persuade others to stop feeding the corrupted "church". That's why they wanted him dead, not even REALIZING their own roles in the fulfillment of the prophecies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same power struggle and befuddlement of church vs state has always existed in the US. That's why the Pilgrims came, that's why the Salem Witch Trials happened, that's why the Mormons were run out of New York, Illinois, Missouri, etc., that's why the Tea Party exists today. (Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.) Christianity
       <em>
        has repeatedly
       </em>
       been bastardized by men, ironically, against what was Jesus' whole message: Study the word of God, live with those who KEEP the word of God and do not fear or pity those who don't, but show them the way to peace. Never did Jesus call for war, suffering, wealth hoarding, political motivations, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       No "true" Christian church has taught that this life doesn't matter, that the focus is on the afterlife. Life is a gift from God that is supposed to be honored, not because it makes God happy, but because the human heart was designed to be glad and grateful. God doesn't require worship, he gave us worship (and the Word and the promise of eternal life) so that we could understand our purpose. So that we didn't have to fear. So that we understand what "trials and tribulations" are: the opportunity for growth and deeper understanding. You gotta stand in the rain to see the rainbow, and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a drastic difference between being a "decent" person and being a "devout" person, and that difference is FAITH, HOPE &amp; LOVE. Sure, atheists can be decent people, but do they really have a sense of purpose? Are we merely meant to have a few good relationships, successfully feed, clothe and shelter ourselves? What is a community without a sense of purpose, why should groups of any sort exist, without a common goal? What's the POINT OF LIVING if there is no afterlife? We're just an evolution of stardust and molecules, just randomly bumping around the universe? Why are we all here?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a favorite quote about Virtue, it comes from a biography on Bill Wilson, the founder of AA, and is an expansion on Aristotle.
       <em>
        Virtue must be it's own reward, we CANNOT expect ANY satisfaction from doing WHAT WE KNOW WE MUST.
       </em>
       Our souls were not meant to merely satisfy our own needs. We humans ACTUALLY feel better, when we care about others and give selflessly (LOVE). Otherwise, that nagging voice, your conscious (or even your subconsciousness), will question your own motivations, your purpose, your own morality. Without a clear guide from the divine, how is a person to KNOW happiness, fulfillment, peace?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really appreciate you taking the time to respond, but I also hope you take the time to study your own mind, body and soul. There's a very powerful reason religion has been manipulated and why it has evolved. The Word of God is historical for a reason. More has been revealed, not to break down previous understandings, but to EXPAND the consciousness of man, to give us greater confidence, and to help us understand our purpose in a more tangible way. We live in a world with the internet for a reason. You, organized bits of elements, are talking to me, organized bits of elements, because other organized bits of elements had previous conversations about other organized bits of elements, and we are able to expand on those conversations because WE HAVE A PURPOSE. It isn't just to breed a better version of ourselves, or to become so advanced that we don't need this planet. Life, Earth, your family, the written language, math, science, comedy, drama, all your pets and experiences and memories and EVERYTHING is all here for YOU, for your soul to grow to know God, to find a deeper understanding of yourself, and TO BE HAPPY.
      </p>
      <p>
       Happiness doesn't exist in a vacuum. We are meant to act like our creator, to love without expectation, to give without receiving, to seek not to be understood, but to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't intend to make anyone uncomfortable or to push my agenda "down your throat". I still have much to learn and I'm sure I've gotten a few points "wrong". I guess I'm looking for a community of sorts "online", but maybe that's a mistake. I don't think so, though, when reddit has things like random acts of pizza or how the community responds in crisis. Humanity is still fundamentally good, but that doesn't exist without religious influence. Maybe I should say SPIRITUAL instead of religious, that probably has less of a visceral reaction for some folks. But I was angry at the God of my childhood for a very, very long time. And it didn't make me a stronger, more correct or enlightened person, it kept me in an adolescent state, angry or fearful at what I "couldn't control". It's only by letting go of my will that I am able to appreciate the will of God. After that, all blessings flow. Everything becomes a lesson, an experience to learn, a chance to help others, LIVING instead of DYING. Life is growth, we know that through biology. But how do we THRIVE, instead of merely SURVIVE?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sigh, there's so much more I want to express, but I'm literally beat. I'm actually excited to keep reading the book I'm working on, to move on to the others, cuz I'm learning new ideas every day and this amazing brain makes new connections with what I read here, with what comes out of the mouths of strangers, with whatever I hear on the radio. I'm excited to be learning not only more about myself and God, but I feel like every single day, I get a clearer picture of the past. I'm able to understand motivations that used to baffle me, simply because I'm building empathy and a deeper knowledge of HUMANITY. Maybe that's the real reason religion has been so repressive, it's a very powerful and exciting motivator. It helps you live not for greed, but for purpose. It's very disruptive to the power structure when you live in service; it builds its own support and helps others to rise above. Maybe that's the real conspiracy, the attempt to undermine our own means of support.

       The problem right now isn't that peaceful protest doesn't work, the problem is it only works if the numbers are great enough, and unfortunately, I don't think the numbers are great enough yet.

       Or, any time a "peaceful" protest starts, participants are ridiculed by the media...Because obviously- the ruling class controls the media, which in turn controls what the people believe.  So people like you- who either don't realize this, or refuse to come to grips with it- are pretty much beaten, until you accept the fact that peaceful protests get nowhere...

       That's a terribly pessimistic opinion and also not accurate to what I meant. When I referred to the numbers we needed, that means that there are enough peaceful protesters for any media manipulation to mean absolutely nothing. They would have no other options than either allow the protest or use violence against a very large amount of the population that couldn't possibly remain silent in those numbers.

       Good points and good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion:  They know as well as we do that the collapse is inevitable.  And they have been planning for it.  Keep in mind that it will be the USD that collapses and with it the USA.  However, that which economies can be rebuilt upon will never be destroyed.  Gold.  And who is buying up all the gold?  The parasites are just moving their operations East where they will repeat the same scam in Asia.  The West will become third world to exploit for natural resources and cheap labor.  This cycle will repeat itself until there is nothing left to steal.

       And that is, indeed, the question.  What do "they" know that we don't?
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely "they", like you and I and many others, realized long,
       <em>
        long
       </em>
       ago that their usury/pyramid scam was destined to fail from the start - it was and is mathematically inevitable, as you said.  My point here is that, knowing this, there had to have been (and, in turn, has to be) a plan in place for when this collapse occurs (and, likely,
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       it occurs as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's difficult to speculate on what those plans might be without seeing what form the chaos/mass disturbance ultimately ends up taking but I would bet that the end goal is and always has been something very much like the theoretical "NWO".

       This is kinda my whole point. The reason money is SO important these days is because religion has been removed from our lives. We don't think in terms of how we can love and be of service to the least of us, we're too focused on "GETTING WHAT'S MINE!" I think this was part of the design all along. That's why the people always rise up, because they see the greater good is more important.

       Just a small point: usury is actually just the practice of making money on money. So if I bought a piece of gold knowing its value would later rise and then sold it at that point id be engaging in usury

       Because while we're fighting about our basic needs, they run away with the money, which is a false resource. The real resource is community, I CAN'T, BUT WE CAN. Together, we can feed, clothe and shelter each other. Alone, fractured, confused, paranoid and scared, I can't. It's just too dangerous and overwhelming.

       Amen brother, and thank you for this post. It lifted my heart. You are not alone in your thinking. We are living in the end times, and the Bible says (paraphrasing) The people living in those times will recognize the signs. I think many people are starting to wake up to the true nature of humanity and our spirit. Remember all this is a test from the Almighty, and God loves us so much that he has given us every possible tool we could need to pass that test. We just need to use them. Keep spreading the word, brother, and if you would like to talk more please feel free to message me. I love communicating with like minded brothers in Christ :)

       Don't lose all faith because of misguided "righteous anger". That's never been the true message of Christ. I wish more Christians understood that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no coincidences. Nothing is random. Science shows us the universe has order. I just found $5 today in the snow as I was hungrily walking home in the freezing cold. Sure, people drop money in the winter because they're distracted by the cold. But for me to find it wasn't chance. It's windy, the snow is blowing around. I don't normally walk on that side of the road, but that's where the bus stopped today. I didn't NEED that $5 to eat today, I have crappy food in the cabinets. But God saw I needed reassurance today that I can break the cycle of my stupid co-dependant relationship and move forward with faith that GOD WILL PROVIDE.
      </p>
      <p>
       That may sound like a load of hogwash to you, but to this soul's astonishment, it was literally manna from heaven. I didn't even really realized I asked, and God provided. I feel gratitude and that feels GOOD.

       All abraimic religons are tools of slavery, they purposely hide the truth about this universe and how it works, there is one set of laws that man is governed by and they are not made by MAN, perhaps for a lack of understanding we call it Gods law and perhaps the idea of a being with such power was enough to quell our desires to exceed him and thus the entity of God serves as a tool to keep us humble. But these institutions have hidden true knowledge and instead expect you to follow blindly, albeit Christianity and the teachings of Jesus Christ, seem to be a remaining bastion of hope, but it still requires you to FIND the TRUTH and KNOW it, without that you are no better than the other blind religious folk who bend their knee when told.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that Humanity is on the brink of evolution, we must become spiritual beings of consciousness in order to free ourselves. We have been corrupted by knowledge, greed and ego, technology is now on the brink of doing things we never imagined and with that power comes responsibility, we as humans do not care about anyone other then ourselves, we know there are millions of starving people all over the world and yet we take little or NO action to help them, the problems of today have occurred because we have allowed them to, out of fear and ignorance, the steps towards fixing this problem requires basic thought process, how do we expect anything to change if we do nothing, things don't just magically fix themselves...
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead we isolate ourselves and distract ourselves with material possessions to afraid to do anything different in case we lose everything we've worked so hard to accumulate, people need a new perspective and need to realise what they are actually living for, pieces of paper? that puts a value on something we already own? Governments are meant to work for the people, the lands and everything owned by the Government are ours, the Government is meant to enforce our rights not break them, this capitalist regime has failed, it in itself is to focused on the ego, it goes against natural law. And no I don't know the solution to this and I am not one in favour of socialism, but I am in favour of a debate, a discussion of possible solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem we have is that we don't question anything any more, we allow them to tell us anything and we happily accept it, or we accept it our fear, we are to accustomed to this life, we live in fear of our Government, we dare not speak out, we obey orders and blindly continue in this charade because we're ultimately brain washed and it's hard to accept these things, it's hard to change our mentality, but if we wish to be free, then we have to take action, we have to make an effort otherwise the world will continue on its path of destruction, there cannot be change without action, praying and waiting for God as comforting as it is, is not a solution, we can save ourselves and we must.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself and I say this with all honesty am willing to die for this and I would rather be DEAD than allow what is occuring to continue.

       You are so close to knowing the absolute TRUTH. The way you describe the government is actually closer to the definition of a church. Any hidden knowledge that you're referring to isn't being withheld, it's being protected. Any Christian faith that discourages deep study is indeed a cult and something to avoid. The Bible reveals it's own deeper truth, if you have the faith to look for it. I humbly suggest reading some books. Get lost in a book and let your mind ponder what associations you get from memories or what drives you to cross reference. Science is finding more discoveries every day, that reinforce the original translations.
      </p>
      <p>
       America isn't just caught up in the material possessions, we've lost the communion with our spiritual nature. That is the truest natural law, the universal truth that rings deep in all of us, WHAT AM I HERE FOR? The fact that you say you're willing to die for "liberty" already means you're free. You have faith, you just haven't trusted that God has provided it to you as a pathway to discover yourself. Look deeper, Oh lord, I sound like a Jedi...

       Perhaps they are protecting the knowledge, or at least some are, because the Church and its history are not very well regarded. Their war against gnosticism or pagan beliefs is probably the biggest conspiracy of our time, the history behind these beliefs and their relationship with Jesus Christ will blow your mind, they are not what the church wants you to think, it is not a belief where humans are the centre of the universe, no rather it is a belief that we are one in the same with the universe. So many great people have realised this truth and have left clues everywhere, literally.

       I urge you to check out this video, please exercise an open mind and do your own research to either disprove or prove what you have learned. The church has taught people the literal religion, but this is completely fictitious it does not reveal the WHOLE TRUTH, all these concepts that we are so familiar with are not meant to be taken literally they are metaphors to help you understand.

       Everything this guy is saying is pure TRUTH! Organized religion is dangerous and evil for the most part these days yes. Open your HEART &amp; SOUL to God and stop being led astray by these thing "RELIGION" has made you believe. The world has twisted Christianity and made it seem to you guys as some man made destructive force but you guys have let the devil pull the blinders down over your eyes. Christianity is the only way to go. Now go do your research and pick up a Bible and try to open your heart to God, then come back here and speak.

       I find it fascinating that many here will post some poorly constructed YouTube video about how Christianity was some Jewish-contrived lie to subjugate the masses (oh the irony that you all claim to want to dismantle corporate powers but ya'll LIVE ON YOUTUBE...), but they don't take the time to research Biblical translations and get to the Greek or Hebrew roots. The Bible has ALWAYS been an allegory (not to be taken on the absolute literal level, but to be analyzed for a deeper understanding!), so the original wording IS important, because some translations are a perversion of power, but the message still carries through. It's the original underground movement against a repressive system and intended for STUDY. Jesus was the original protester, clever, peaceful and POWERFUL. His walk matched his talk, and maybe some fundamentally dishonest people recoil from that. It's probably too frightening to have to practice RIGOROUS honesty.

       Sir if you believe the Bible and Christianity is the only way to find out the truth then you are sadly mistaken, to think your beliefs or your religion is the one and only way of understanding this universe, is purely egotistic. Buddhism, Taoism are great religions based on this understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       look into syncretism, we must break down the barrier of labels, what you understand has given you this sense of enlightenment, but your own religion is preventing you from reaching complete enlightenment.

       You're assuming my understanding of Christianity NEGATES other religions. I don't believe the Bible is the only inspired literature, but I DO believe it is a prophetic, divinely inspired work. Jesus and Buddha have very similar ideologies and came to them in the same fashion, perhaps the very same school of study, the denial of self. The evolution of man and religion has been a progression. While you may recoil at this thought, I do believe that the Bible doesn't negate the Koans or the Torah. It builds upon them.

       Did you read anything I wrote? That the real agenda has been to intentionally strip God and Christianity from America? You DO get that the Declaration of Independence was written with the words ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, hence the belief in a Creator? You get that's why we're actually hated, not because of our wealth and power, but that our government recognizes the power of God and USED TO attempt to separate the politics out of government? We hold these truths to be self-evident, because they confirm themselves, time and time again, throughout history, that God is present in humanity, but that man constantly tries to become God.

       Look at your own resentment towards religion. If you're REALLY honest about it, you'll realize that anger is based on fear. Fear that you can't be forgiven or that you can't live honestly. That's why most people reject the religion of their youth, they feel that same adolescent "wtf, they're all hypocrites and no one is perfect so all religion is bullshit!" mentality. Look around you, America is STUCK in an adolescent phase for a reason, all this godlessness and division (oh, you're a Chiefs fan? I'm a superior person to you, because I like the Patriots. Look at all our Super Bowl rings, LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE OF OUR SUPERIORITY!). All of this madness serves a purpose. Fuck, football got people out of church! If every American went just ONE DAY A WEEK to their mosque, temple, coven, church, etc , would we have senseless violence? Would we have people stabbing each other over cell phones or sneakers? Would we stand idle (Lord, American IDOLY) by while corporations dismantle the Constitution?!
      </p>
      <p>
       CHECK YOUR OWN BIAS. It's been subtly layered upon your psyche by large corporations that don't want you to give your 10% to God, who don't want you to realize all these THINGS YOU PURCHASE are ultimately worthless and who don't want you to live the mantra "live simply, so that others can simply live". You're buying the lie that YOURSELF is the most important factor in every decision, instead of thinking about the WHOLE.

       You're in violation of human rights. Spreading your propaganda has handicapped science and human growth for centuries. You have every right to believe in jesus, Buddha, or the flying spaghetti monster. But keep it to yourself. Until you religious nuts start paying taxes you don't get a fuckin opinion.

       The problem most people have with the concepts you have here is that they don't want to believe in a higher power and give in to him, it does not sit well with some people and that goes for me as well, that's because it's slavery on a whole other level.
      </p>

       so we reject it, some people continue searching for an answer and some just give up, those that continue will find what they are searching for, I guarantee that.

       There is truth in what this man says, but it is also tainted with the belief that God will fix everything so long as we have faith in him, this unfortunately is incorrect, all this does is create generations of people who think through their prayers and inaction that they will have a positive impact on the world, although the intention is good, logically doing these things and not acting (DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM) will achieve nothing. this is where religion has led us astray and this is where some religions teach us to attack anyone who sees differently. These faiths have intentionally misinterpreted concepts and teachings for their own agenda, to control large populations and make money. PERIOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we must do, is ask why is there so much suffering and violence in this world, do we care that is is occuring? If yes, then do something, research, find out why these things are occuring.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've written above is a start to fixing the problem and is the only way we're going to fix the problem.

       I don't think it's through faith alone. Faith without works IS dead. People need to get over their own self-centered mentality and get back to real communities. I believe in voting, in protest, in petitions, in using the rights that we still have to reform the system. I will never condone violence though, or even destruction. Yes, I want corporations to lose their government influence and to pay LARGE fines and incur jail time. But I still fundamentally believe that democracy works, if the population is involved and educated about the process.

       I'm church shopping, I can't seem to settle on one set of "rules" and beliefs just yet. There are things that appeal and frighten me with every one I've tried so far. But my Catholic mother reminded me that I don't fully understand something until I take the time to research and experience it fully. More than anything, I'm looking for a deep Biblical study, that kind of "ignores" specific dogma, do you have any suggestions?

       This is kinda my whole point. The reason money is SO important these days is because religion has been removed from our lives. We don't think in terms of how we can love and be of service to the least of us, we're too focused on "GETTING WHAT'S MINE!" I think this was part of the design all along. That's why the people always rise up, because they see the greater good is more important.

       You're assuming my understanding of Christianity NEGATES other religions. I don't believe the Bible is the only inspired literature, but I DO believe it is a prophetic, divinely inspired work. Jesus and Buddha have very similar ideologies and came to them in the same fashion, perhaps the very same school of study, the denial of self. The evolution of man and religion has been a progression. While you may recoil at this thought, I do believe that the Bible doesn't negate the Koans or the Torah. It builds upon them.
