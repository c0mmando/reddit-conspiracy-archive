<p>And this video is just another view of the same event, but a longer version, but missing some audio. 
<a href="http://youtu.be/51pnmGgDmBs">http://youtu.be/51pnmGgDmBs</a></p>

<p>This is honestly me just looking for answers, not trying to stir up the pot. I was involved in a thread a few days ago that went south. This incident, the men running in the woods, is still one of the bigger puzzles to me. If anyone has any other clips related to this part of the mystery, please let me know where I can find more information. I feel like about a month or so ago there were many more videos of this, one that had full audio where the reports are saying something along the lines of, &quot;they&#39;ve got him now, they&#39;ve got him surrounded and on the ground&quot;, just kind of the stuff you&#39;d expect the news to be saying, but now I can&#39;t find it anywhere. Thanks for any discussion that helps answer this question. I am also totally open to a &quot;non conspiracy&quot; answer. I&#39;m just looking for some verifiable proof as to what exactly happened with this guy (or guys), who they were, and why they were running from the cops. I&#39;m having a hard time with it because I believe a parent would be running toward the cops, the school, their kids and an off duty officer would stop and show credentials or verify himself. What scenario makes sense here? Thanks for your time. </p>

<p>Those are OPERATIVES fleeing the scene...as ANYONE familiar with shooting knows that an inverted kill-to-injure ratio is NEAR impossible for someone with LOTS of experience...let alone for a half-retarded kid who was afraid of the sound of 2-stroke engines on leaf-blowers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is an inverted kill to injure ratio? I&#39;m mean I can figure it out, but really break it down so people have to think about what you&#39;re saying, I think this is a huge point. One kid went in to the school and killed 26 people, you&#39;d think that he would have injured at least one student with a stray bullet. </p>

<p>Where did you hear about the nuns? I haven&#39;t read or seen anything about them. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t say retarded, it isn&#39;t needed, and it&#39;s rude. I appreciate you&#39;re comment a lot because it offers something new to me, but there&#39;s no reason for &quot;half-retarded&quot;. Sorry, I&#39;ll get of my soap box. Thanks for the comment.</p>

<p>You do know that the word retarded comes from the Italian ritardando meaning slow and that by attaching a hurtful negative connotation to it, you are giving that word power, correct?  It&#39;s just like the term handicapped, which numerous people use instead of disabled( or in many cases, lazy ).  Handicapped originally meant those who were too disabled to work, that had to beg for alms on the side of the street - outstretched &#39;hand&#39; holding a &#39;cap.&#39;  You shouldn&#39;t be offended by the vocabulary someone uses.  Words are simply grunts, pixels, or printed lines that bring thought into physical manifestation, and every grunt has a different meaning to different people.  Allowing that word to control your emotions is allowing the system that you&#39;re so adamant about fighting against control you even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t the one who made the original comment, just pointed out that you <em>feel</em> that way because you&#39;re conditioned to from a very young age - all for the sake of division and control.  There is no such thing as political correctness.  Let me rephrase that: politically correct isn&#39;t even correct.  Just because someone is black doesn&#39;t make them African American.  They could be Aborigine.  Doesn&#39;t it seem odd to you that there are so many rules of how to act or what to say that we create for ourselves with no clear motive of why?  What makes damn, shit, or fuck any worse than any other word?  How is darn any better than damn?  They mean exactly the same thing.  How is the word fuck taken so negatively when it&#39;s meanings fornication or surprise convey the same message?  It is only because someone has told you how to feel when you hear that word, so that the word has power over others and separates/divides/identifies those who will blindly obey from those who ask questions or simply do not care.  You are told by others specifically what is ok to say. You are told by others what is ok to put in your body and experience. You are told by others what is ok to think.  All for the sake of control under the guise of civility and &quot;freedom&quot;.</p>

<p>So, if somebody is detained by the police near the school, the were &quot;fleeing&quot; and obviously guilty of something? The police never make mistakes. I hope you never serve on a jury.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three on foot, two &quot;dressed as nuns&quot; in a van with a &quot;shot out&quot; window.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The van was supposedly observed on a road somewhere in Newtown more than an hour after the shooting. Why do you say they were &quot;fleeing&quot;? Where did you hear that there was a &quot;shot out&quot; window? I&#39;ve heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ztCRDi5ww">this recording of the police radio</a>, and I didn&#39;t hear that. Still, if the police want to question them, they must be guilty of something!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as ANYONE familiar with shooting knows that an inverted kill-to-injure ratio is NEAR impossible for someone with LOTS of experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, because people familiar with shooting have lots of experience with shooting six year-olds multiple times. What the fuck do you expect to happen to first-graders when they are shot at least 3 times each with 5.56mm ammo?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, there are tons of sources and people who know, but they probably just want to be left alone and allowed to grieve the loss of their community.</p>

<p>Partially why they prefer to remain anonymous is because of the deniers calling them or emailing them or showing up and harassing them.</p>

<p>Early reports on a major incidence always have inconsistencies.  News outlets want to be the first to tell a story or set a narrative, even if that means they don&#39;t have all the facts or their sources aren&#39;t the most qualified.  News media has been this way since movable type, perhaps even earlier.</p>

<p>Instead, it would be smarter to designate a secured area within the school to hole up in, like a janitor&#39;s closet, office, or boiler room. After the shootings, they would go to said area, lock the door, stash their weapons, change clothes and simply wait for the knock of the friendly FBI agent. They&#39;d stroll right out the front door and their weapons could be removed at a later date. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just looked up some information about Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, Principal (formerly) of Sandy Hook Elementary School, deceased in shooting.</p>

<p>Her daughter, Erin Lafferty, was married in 2013 and the article in People Magazine lists her as working for..............</p>

<p>&quot;Mayors Against Illegal Guns&quot; at <a href="http://www.demandaction.org">www.demandaction.org</a>  </p>

<p>See article here:  <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20717335,00.html">http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20717335,00.html</a></p>

<p>I wonder what the younger Ms.Lafferty did prior to working for gun control. Did she &#39;coincidentally&#39; always lobby for anti-gun legislation and then in an ironic twist her mother was shot down in Sandy Hook?  Or, like she says, does she work for this cause due to those events, and if so, I find that interesting. Not to say a person <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be driven by a motivating event in their life such as this one, but how many of the surviving family members ended up- somehow- working for anti gun legislation, lobbying, etc. ?</p>

<p>Founded in 2006, Mayors Against Illegal Guns on <a href="http://www.demandaction.org">www.demandaction.org</a> site, lists that it was motivated by first 2012&#39;s Aurora shooting THEN Sandy Hook. Those two events. Specifically. </p>

<p>Thoughts? </p>

(Warning total speculation ahead) If so, you can assume that she knew what her spouse was involved in. Assuming they date for a year, are engaged for a year, and then are married in 2013, that means she was directly or indirectly involved with this organization for a year or more before the SH shooting.</p>

<p>Edit: wow I just reread that, that is the shit that gives conspiracy a bad name. Sorry. I was just spitballing ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It IS a loose correlation full of conjecture, but with so little truth to go on, these are the type of dots we are forced to connect. I say Grey Work. It IS interesting bc in 2012 George Hochsprung, husband, along with Erica Lafferty, dawns daughter, were codefendents in a motor vehicle case on the CT docket, and charges were dropped when plaintiff did not show for his deposition. Also, Erica was on small claims docket once for a ~$900 credit card debt. All on public records. In any event, that just shows that Erica isn&#39;t a well to do child if she&#39;s getting sued by a credit card co for under a grand, and that the elder Hochsprung stood with her in court on the driving charges, not DUI nothing criminal, maybe prop damage or something? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, then, is the most common/probable explanation that there were NO murders, there was no violence, and it was all staged? OR is the truth the horrific fact that lives were sacrificed to support legislation? </p>

<p>Even before I became interested in/aware of the fact that was I was spoonfed may not be true, I noticed immediately how odd it was that there was not more medical care presence, bodies being rushed to ambulances, blood even outside the school..etc. Certainly a scene as horrific and tragic as the type of brutality that was reported would merit much more medical care on site. </p>

<p>So, then.... It would be telling to find out more about the lives of the &#39;deceased&#39; and their parents from PRIOR to the shooting. </p>

<p>If the theory stands, that would mean that (maybe?) many of these families were not &quot;Newtown townies&quot;, born and raised and now raising children. That the families - the victims- all would have started infiltrating the town over x # of years, and that little by little after the shooting they would have started migrating away.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to compile a comprehensive list of the families of the victims, and start there. That is the way I&#39;d handle this if I were &quot;on the case&quot; for work, so if anyone can help with a list of the families involved, other info, that would be great. Although a quick Google will give me the names of the children, if anyone has any side notes/facts/interesting tidbits, I&#39;ll keep track.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Karen Dryer has been interviewed by multiple sources in the media and is reported to have said she lives on the same street as both Madeline Hsu and Caroline Previdi. Karen Dryer&#39;s name is actually spelt- Karen Dreyer, and is the same person as follows:</p>

<p>Karen Eifert Tersak Dreyer. Based upon several name searches, and an obituary for Karen&#39;s mother which lists a Karen Eifert Dreyer of Sandy Hook, married to Joseph, as having a daughter Chiarra Tersak and a son, Logan Dreyer. According to several sources, young Logan was pulled out of the school when, due to exhibiting anxiety/fear behaviors he could no longer attend school without panic. Karen speculated to reporters that maybe her young son was &quot;psychic&quot; or &quot;clairvoyant&quot; and that immediately after the tragedy his fear of school magically disappeared. </p>

<p>There is a neighbor she says lives across the street who stayed home that day because of &quot;the flu&quot; but I couldn&#39;t find the name of the child, or the child&#39;s family. </p>

<p>Karen Eifert is 43, she is the Director of Public Affairs at the Pentagon&#39;s Defense Info Headquarters, with places of employment listed as the Pentagon, the US Navy, and the US State Dept as well as the United Nations. </p>

<p>She says that Madeline Hsu and Caroline Previdi were neighbors on the same street. None of the 6 homes on Moccasin St in Newtown where Karen lives are in any of the last names associated with the shooting. Nor were they before. </p>

<p>Interestingly, many houses on that street and other streets were transferred ownership citing a Sale date of 12/25/09 for $0.  I&#39;m not sure if it is a computer thing and there is an error, but so far on 12/25/09 houses on all of the streets where Sandy Hook families live were transferred into people&#39;s names for $0, and also into the ownership of The Town of Newtown 12/25/09 $0.00</p>

<p>Here is Karen Dryer (Dreyer)&#39;s mother&#39;s obituary. Note that Dreyer/Tersak/Eifert are all connected, showing that Karen Dreyer IS Karen Eifert, Pentagon Defense Info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be great if a filmmaker did a very innocuous, non controversial documentary &quot;SANDY HOOK: WHERE ARE THEY NOW?&quot; and <em>GASP</em> -- o my! Look at this! Every single person involved, related or interviewed has left the area. Every. Single. One. </p>

<p>Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, principal, was there for 2 years. Her husband retired from his job as a teacher in a town nearby and moved to &quot;their&quot; upstate NY home as they had planned for his eventual retirement. He cited his &quot;sudden&quot; retirement&#39;s cause as the traumatic death of his wife. And so, as it is so taboo to call out a grieving person (because if he really DID lose his wife in a tragedy, what a horrible thing to infer) so lies hide well among grief and loss, because it is untouchable -  the American public will tiptoe on the eggshells and time will pass and things will be swept under the rug.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s information from the prosecutor&#39;s report. It&#39;s not clear if the &quot;man from New York&quot; is the same as the one mentioned in the Newtown Bee.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the time the unknown male was encountered by the Newtown police outside of SHES until after the staff and children were evacuated, all responding law enforcement operated under the belief that there may have been more than one shooter and acted accordingly.18
For example, K-9 units were brought in to search the area and officers were posted to act as lookouts to ensure the safety of those evacuating the school building. Some people were located in the areas surrounding the school as the searches and evacuations were taking place. Some of those individuals were treated initially as suspects and handled accordingly, including being handcuffed, until their identities and reason for being there could be determined.
Some of these detentions included:</p>

<p>1. The initial unknown male who turned out to be a parent with a cell telephone in his hand;</p>

<p>2. Two reporters located in the woods around SHES, who were held at gun point by Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) police officers until their identities could be determined; and</p>

<p>3. A man from New York who was working in a nearby town and went to SHES after an application on his cell telephone alerted him to the situation at the school. He drove to the firehouse and went up to the school on foot. He was taken from the scene of the school in handcuffs and later to Newtown Police Department. It was later determined that he did not have a connection to the shooting and had gone to SHES to see what was going on.</p>

<p>As noted above, on December 14, 2012, there was a concern that there may have been more than one shooter. This was based upon a number of factors:</p>

<p>1. The initial police encounter with the unknown male outside SHES;19</p>

<p>2. Reports by school personnel during the shooting on a 911 call of seeing someone running outside the school while the shooting was ongoing;</p>

<p>3. The location of two black zip up sweat jackets on the ground outside of the shooter’s car;</p>

<p>4. The discovery of an Izhmash Saiga-12, 12 gauge shotgun and ammunition in the passenger compartment of the shooter’s car. A police officer moved this shotgun and ammunition to the car’s trunk for safety purposes;</p>

<p>5. Shell casings that were located outside of the school; and</p>

<p>6. The apparent sound of gunfire coming from outside of the school;</p>

<p>The subsequent investigation revealed there were no additional shooters based upon:</p>

<p>1. Searches of the area and examinations of local business security surveillance videos;</p>

<p>2. Persons detained revealed they were not connected to the shootings. In the case of the initial unknown male, he was identified as the parent of a student and had a cell telephone, rather than a weapon, in his hand;</p>

<p>3. Witness interviews which indicated that no witness saw anyone other than the shooter, with a firearm;</p>

<p>4. Witness interviews in which it was determined that a number of SHES staff had escaped from the school through a window and had been running outside the school building during the shootings;</p>

<p>5. The shotgun located in the shooter’s car had been purchased by the shooter’s mother previously;</p>

<p>6. The two sweat jackets were both C-Sport brand black zip up hooded sweat jackets with no size listed and were located immediately outside the shooter’s car;20 Both are believed to have been brought there by the shooter;21</p>

<p>7. The live shotgun shells (other than the one found on the shooter and the ones found in the shooter’s car) that were located inside and outside of the school were in locations where first responders had been. Additionally, there were first responders who reported missing live shotgun rounds. Moreover, the shells were found in locations where there had not been reported sightings of any non-law enforcement individuals;</p>

<p>8. There were no expended shotgun shells found in the actual crime scene nor were any expended 12 gauge shotgun pellets or slugs recovered;</p>

<p>9. The only expended casings located outside of the school building were 5.56 mm casings located just outside the school’s front entrance, consistent with the shooter’s entry into the school; and</p>

<p>10. The officer who heard what he believed to be outside gunfire was in a position to have heard the shooter’s gunfire coming from window openings in the classroom in which the shooter was firing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. I&#39;m questioning DEEP as well as having a problem with #6 the two sweater jackets. Why would one person bring two of the same jackets? I&#39;m glad that this was posted, leads to more discovery, thanks again to the poster. </p>

<p>Edit: Does DEEP work with biohazard waste? Maybe there for blood clean up? I&#39;m reaching for a connection, I know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention they are laying in the same manner, like two people side by side shed their hoodies as they were walking toward the school. Also first hand accounts of some of the teachers in the school said that when they exited the school they saw that all four doors were wide open on the Honda. I&#39;m under the belief that this was a hit, probably Mossad, and they drug Lanza to the scene to leave as the patsy. Remember Lanza was on the FBI radar and also diagnosed by a team of Yale doctors so he was on the radar of the powers that be to be a perfect patsy to be used in a psy-op. <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/01/22/sand-hook-shooter-treated-at-yale/">http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/01/22/sand-hook-shooter-treated-at-yale/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weird. And wouldn&#39;t the cops not want to touch the &quot;crime scene&quot;? Thanks for the link. She says black sweatshirts strewn around. That&#39;s weird, too. There&#39;s just so many things that don&#39;t make sense. You know how we have black ops and shit, and they are responsible for the deaths of innocent children, I wonder if these school shootings are &quot;pay-back&quot; from other countries equivalent of black ops teams. Maybe it&#39;s easier for the government to blame it on a &quot;crazy&quot; person, with no motive at all, than it is for them to tell us the truth, that we are constantly under attack because of our countries actions in foreign countries. That is the whole &quot;for public safety&quot; charade that they are pulling; if the public knew what was actually happening, that we were actually dealing with spec. ops. from other countries that we would be in such a state of panic and we&#39;d demand so many more answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m inclined to believe something along these lines. I&#39;m definitely not convinced that no one died, I&#39;m also not convinced that Lanza acted alone. Or even acted at all. If you look at Mossad hits you can see how they operate and always leave a patsy behind, allowing everyone ultimately responsible to get away scott-free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s probably why the parents interviewed were actors. The &quot;real&quot; parents probably couldn&#39;t actually hold it together or be trusted to not go off script in a tirade of emotion. I&#39;m sure there probably was loss of life, and of those lives lost the parents are probably stuck signing a non disclosure agreement (under the guise that it is a matter of national security) that would send them straight to jail if they were to murmur a word about what they actually know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t see shooters, who were part of a false flag, running at all. You know the surrounding area is going to be crawling with cops and media within minutes. Plus there is a chance that some random witness or security camera might catch something. </p>

<p>Instead, it would be smarter to designate a secured area within the school to hole up in, like a janitor&#39;s closet, office, or boiler room. After the shootings, they would go to said area, lock the door, stash their weapons, change clothes and simply wait for the knock of the friendly FBI agent. They&#39;d stroll right out the front door and their weapons could be removed at a later date. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those were the assumptions that it was Chris Manfredonia that was cuffed and stuffed as per the above video accounts for. However after closer inspection of helicopter footage it shows Manfredonia standing uncuffed talking casually with officers in front of the school.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to point out that the man making the account of the person sitting in the back of the police car wearing &quot;camo pants and a dark jacket&quot; was later asked to elaborate on what he saw and he refused saying, I&#39;m not commenting on anything. The one guy who talked had the FBI at his house the next day, I don&#39;t want any of that. Fast forward to 2:22 <a href="http://youtu.be/5TPLjVpwEzc">http://youtu.be/5TPLjVpwEzc</a></p>
