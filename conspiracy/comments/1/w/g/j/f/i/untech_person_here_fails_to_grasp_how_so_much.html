<p>So then I browsed <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>, <a href="/r/moderation">/r/moderation</a> log, and <a href="/r/FrontpageWatch">/r/FrontpageWatch</a>. I never did find the threads I was looking for --but the vast quantity of redacted/removed/moderated/and disappeared threads I DID find, just from the last 24 hours, was huge.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gobsmacked at how much conversation gets taken down and disappeared around here, it is quite shocking. And plenty of stuff with thousands of upvotes --on seemingly humdrum topics -- yanked.</p>

<p>And where do the threads go that haven&#39;t been removed, but yet are current and cannot be found? I&#39;m very perplexed by the way Reddit operates. I don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m completely confounded by the &#39;system&#39; here.</p>

<p>Also, good luck finding an appealing subreddit name. If you think <a href="/r/Topeka">/r/Topeka</a> is badly run and want to create a replacement, how are people going to find it?

Address the content instead of introducing pop culture, black leather coats, or any other pigeonhole tactics that happen to slip into your stream of consciousness. This banter right here is literally the <em>splinternet</em> that op was referring to. This thread hasn&#39;t been about elucidation, illumination, or any attempt at truth, just undisciplined , fragmented minds being too distracted by red herrings to progress dialogue. As of this moment, literally ever response to the above comment has made <strong>zero</strong> effort to actually engage in thoughtful human exchange.

<p>That is not how I define mumbo jumbo. The original response was vague and obtuse mumbo jumbo. I merely recognized it as being derived from a film. Why are you so fixated on the fact that I mentioned a film? The concept of an imprisoned mind isn&#39;t new and nobody is arguing that, though I do disagree with the abstract concept the original responder put forth. I think you&#39;ll find that despite the most monumental efforts of hidden powers on reddit, your mind may wander where it pleases. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The vast majority of post burials <em>can</em> be attributed to the nature of the website. People upvote somthing and it stays, downvote and it disappears. Interestingly, thematic content that is more consistantly downvoted into oblivion probably says more about the theme itself than any people that are intentionally seeking to remove it. This is because the vast majority of users are just normal people and themes that are consistantly snuffed out likely just get identified as bullshit by the average user. This isn&#39;t to say that people don&#39;t try to manipulate things here. It is a popular social media site after all. But the number of average users greatly dwarfs the people actively seeking an agenda of censorship. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, OP posed a question and explicitly requested unambiguity. The response in question was decidedly not so. The response was rife with unnecessary vagaries, analogies, and mystery. OP was right to ignore the response as the responder ignored the request. </p>

<p>Sure. I can agree with this. But this is the first time you&#39;ve suggested such a thing. You initially said that OP should be happy with his response.</p>

<p>No. I never claimed the reason it was mumbo jumbo was because it was derived from a film. I claimed that it was vague, indirect, and obtuse. I also noted that it was derived from a film, but my declaration of ambiguity is unrelated to my familiarity with a film. The response was in direct opposition to OP&#39;s request for clarity. It was also derived from a film. Don&#39;t mix these two thoughts or make one a classification of the other. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t base my stance the the response was mumbo jumbo on the fact that it was derived from a film. I pointed out that the abstract nature of the response was an issue, and the even the quote it was derived from was abstract and mysterious; qualities the responder was obviously trying to take on. Had OP not specified a request for layman&#39;s terms, the nature of that response would not be an issue (though I may have argued the idea itself). The film really had nothing to do with any of my claims, save for the claim about the responder intending to sound mysterious.</p>

<p>In an attempt to shed some light on your initial question; rapid voting can shuffle posts around, people can upvote really mundane things (and thats ok) and people can downvote things they aren&#39;t interested in (despite the quality of the post). Also, mods are (usually) just more people and they can and do remove posts and comments that break rules, and sometimes they remove posts and comments that don&#39;t break rules (they are human, and humans aren&#39;t always rational). Reddit is also kinda wonky in that stuff can seem to vanish from existance. Whether this is intentional or not is something I can&#39;t answer, as is the question of who and why if it is indeed intentional. </p>

<p>Perhaps after you have been on Reddit for more than 3 months you can form a more coherent opinion.</p>

<p>As if my ability to form an opinion is based on how long an account has been active on a website. </p>

<p>Because everything must be part of some overarching plan. </p>

<p>Thanks for noticing.</p>

<p>Actually, in this instance, yes, it is.  The OP asked others because he claimed to be <del>new</del> untech <del>to Reddit</del>.  You happen to be new to Reddit (at least, the account you are commenting from).  Why would the opinions of new people matter when what is needed is experience from those who&#39;ve been here long enough to see the trends, understand how to spot vote manipulation, able to discern within a post or two if you are conversing with a shill, troll, or an actual person who simply has a different opinion, and most importantly, on Reddit long enough to understand the evolution of moderation.</p>

<p>You tell me, how can someone new to Reddit be reasonably expected to comment on the aforementioned?  </p>

<p>Ok, lets say they are metaphors. Does that make the comment any less vague?</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome. Thanks for ignoring the bulk of that point. </p>

<p>Being new to reddit has little bearing on your ability to form an opinion or analyze reddit. It is just likely to be different than the opinion of somebody thats been around longer. OP didn&#39;t ask for a veteran&#39;s opinion. Many of the skills (for lack of a better term) you mention can be developed elsewhere and aren&#39;t exclusive to reddit. And my favorite part, you tell me how one can be reasonably expected to reliably determine how long someone has visited reddit based on the life of an account that can be made without verification or email?</p>

<p>I just couldn&#39;t find them at all. Not under the original category in New, not in Rising, not in Hot, not in Controversial. Just pffft.</p>

<p>Pffft. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m thinking Reddit has an algorithm that just sort of zaps things into NoMan&#39;sLand, never to be seen again. Not deleted, just MIA.</p>

<p>Like Chile and Argentina of the 1980&#39;s, some things around here just get &#39;disappeared&#39;.</p>
