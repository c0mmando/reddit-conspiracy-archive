       I've participated in several fairly innocuous threads today. Suddenly replies and threadvotes seemed to freeze. Thinking it odd, I went to look for the threads but couldn't find them in their reddit headings?
      </p>
      <p>
       So then I browsed
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/moderation">
        /r/moderation
       </a>
       log, and
       <a href="/r/FrontpageWatch">
        /r/FrontpageWatch
       </a>
       . I never did find the threads I was looking for --but the vast quantity of redacted/removed/moderated/and disappeared threads I DID find, just from the last 24 hours, was huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gobsmacked at how much conversation gets taken down and disappeared around here, it is quite shocking. And plenty of stuff with thousands of upvotes --on seemingly humdrum topics -- yanked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And where do the threads go that haven't been removed, but yet are current and cannot be found? I'm very perplexed by the way Reddit operates. I don't get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm completely confounded by the 'system' here.

       Not exactly. Each subreddit is what its moderators choose to make it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's a subreddit for science, a subreddit for music, and probably a subreddit for your nearest city.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/science">

       and
       <a href="/r/music">
        /r/music
       </a>
       are not endorsed by the company behind reddit. The people in control of those subreddit names can and do do whatever they want with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like the way a subreddit is run, what do the reddit admins suggest you do? Create your own subreddit. Unfortunately, there a few difficulties with that. For one, building a community is hard; it requires a lot of work, some genius and some luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, good luck finding an appealing subreddit name. If you think
       <a href="/r/Topeka">
        /r/Topeka
       </a>
       is badly run and want to create a replacement, how are people going to find it? What if
       <a href="/r/TopekaKS">
        /r/TopekaKS
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/TopekaKansas">
        /r/TopekaKansas

       have already been taken?

       Without a doubt there are examples of successful subreddits created to replace other subreddits. But it is also true that subreddits with straightforward names like
       <a href="/r/writing">
        /r/writing
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/science">

       will have a steady influx of new redditors no matter how good or bad their moderation is.

That could be either reconciliation with the so-called "mainstream," or radicalization, depending.  Welcome to the splinternet.

       Disappointing response. You put forth evidence, commenter offered a fairly accurate assessment, and you ridicule the commenter for not adhering to an ideal standard of dialogue. It's as though you allowed sanctimony to completely obfuscate the commenter's message. It may seem too purple to refer to reddit as a
       <em>
        mind prison
       </em>
       , but the reality isn't far off.

       A simple question was answered by some canibalized Matrix hyperbole. A simple answer was explicitly asked for. I'd say his response to the answer was completely appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the Matrix as much as the next guy. It really was a groundbreaking film in many visual aspects and had a reletively original story. However, using it as a lexicon for serious conversation because it can make you sound mysterious and foreboding (and vague and indirect) is unhelpful.

       First guy referenced Star Trek, now you're referencing The Matrix. How about just addressing the comment based on its own merits. Address the content instead of introducing pop culture, black leather coats, or any other pigeonhole tactics that happen to slip into your stream of consciousness. This banter right here is literally the
       <em>
        splinternet
       </em>
       that op was referring to. This thread hasn't been about elucidation, illumination, or any attempt at truth, just undisciplined , fragmented minds being too distracted by red herrings to progress dialogue. As of this moment, literally ever response to the above comment has made
       <strong>
        zero
       </strong>
       effort to actually engage in thoughtful human exchange. You think OP was bizarre, I think circumnavigating the topic at hand and focussing on popular media is downright alien. You're all so hung up on appraising the first comment, that it's surreal.

       He recognized "mumbo jumbo" and because he was unfamiliar with the Matrix (from which benjamindees' comment was derived) attributed it to something else he considers mumbo jumbo.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then admonished him for being unsatisfied with benjamindees' comment. In reality, OP had every right to be unsatisfied with benjamindees' commnent because OP
       <em>
        explicitly
       </em>
       requested a clear-cut and layman's response to his question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I then explained to you the benjamindees' comment was indeed mumbo jumbo, pointed out where the quote he scavanged came from and why doing so is unhelpful to discussion. Later, I answered OP's question as best I was able in as simple terms as possible.

      <p>
       That is not how I define mumbo jumbo. The original response was vague and obtuse mumbo jumbo. I merely recognized it as being derived from a film. Why are you so fixated on the fact that I mentioned a film? The concept of an imprisoned mind isn't new and nobody is arguing that, though I do disagree with the abstract concept the original responder put forth. I think you'll find that despite the most monumental efforts of hidden powers on reddit, your mind may wander where it pleases.

      <p>
       The vast majority of post burials
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be attributed to the nature of the website. People upvote somthing and it stays, downvote and it disappears. Interestingly, thematic content that is more consistantly downvoted into oblivion probably says more about the theme itself than any people that are intentionally seeking to remove it. This is because the vast majority of users are just normal people and themes that are consistantly snuffed out likely just get identified as bullshit by the average user. This isn't to say that people don't try to manipulate things here. It is a popular social media site after all. But the number of average users greatly dwarfs the people actively seeking an agenda of censorship.

       Actually, OP posed a question and explicitly requested unambiguity. The response in question was decidedly not so. The response was rife with unnecessary vagaries, analogies, and mystery. OP was right to ignore the response as the responder ignored the request.

       By your own account, benjamindee's comment is
       <em>
        mumbo jumbo
       </em>
       because it's a quote scavenged from The Matrix and unhelpful. Not cool to make it seem like I'm unduly focusing on The Matrix when it was your central argument for dismissing something as
       <em>

      <p>
       No. I never claimed the reason it was mumbo jumbo was because it was derived from a film. I claimed that it was vague, indirect, and obtuse. I also noted that it was derived from a film, but my declaration of ambiguity is unrelated to my familiarity with a film. The response was in direct opposition to OP's request for clarity. It was also derived from a film. Don't mix these two thoughts or make one a classification of the other.

       I didn't base my stance the the response was mumbo jumbo on the fact that it was derived from a film. I pointed out that the abstract nature of the response was an issue, and the even the quote it was derived from was abstract and mysterious; qualities the responder was obviously trying to take on. Had OP not specified a request for layman's terms, the nature of that response would not be an issue (though I may have argued the idea itself). The film really had nothing to do with any of my claims, save for the claim about the responder intending to sound mysterious.

       Thats ok, man. I was in your corner. Your response to benjamindees was totally appropriate. And laughattheleader's critisism of your response was inappropriate and unfounded.

      <p>
       You explicitly asked for a simple response, and though you are unfamiliar with the movie you recognized the comment as gibberish. Because I am familiar with the movie, I recognized the gibberish as a rebuilt and repurposed quote from the movie. Nothing more.

       In an attempt to shed some light on your initial question; rapid voting can shuffle posts around, people can upvote really mundane things (and thats ok) and people can downvote things they aren't interested in (despite the quality of the post). Also, mods are (usually) just more people and they can and do remove posts and comments that break rules, and sometimes they remove posts and comments that don't break rules (they are human, and humans aren't always rational). Reddit is also kinda wonky in that stuff can seem to vanish from existance. Whether this is intentional or not is something I can't answer, as is the question of who and why if it is indeed intentional.

       The response was hyperbole at best and poor attempt at sounding cool at worst. OP explicitly asked for a simple response. Chopping up one of the more abstract Morpheus quotes and trying to tailor it to the question is not a simple answer.

Why would the opinions of new people matter when what is needed is experience from those who've been here long enough to see the trends, understand how to spot vote manipulation, able to discern within a post or two if you are conversing with a shill, troll, or an actual person who simply has a different opinion, and most importantly, on Reddit long enough to understand the evolution of moderation.

       Being new to reddit has little bearing on your ability to form an opinion or analyze reddit. It is just likely to be different than the opinion of somebody thats been around longer. OP didn't ask for a veteran's opinion. Many of the skills (for lack of a better term) you mention can be developed elsewhere and aren't exclusive to reddit. And my favorite part, you tell me how one can be reasonably expected to reliably determine how long someone has visited reddit based on the life of an account that can be made without verification or email?

       And I suppose that depends. Are you going to add them all together, or do you just want me to give you my most influential puppets and you can take the average?

       I couldn't find them in deleted threads so I don't think the threads were deleted? Yet posts and votes just stopped and many pages of looking did not find these errant threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just couldn't find them at all. Not under the original category in New, not in Rising, not in Hot, not in Controversial. Just pffft.

       Pffft.

       So I'm thinking Reddit has an algorithm that just sort of zaps things into NoMan'sLand, never to be seen again. Not deleted, just MIA.

       You didn't really answer the question. What were the topics discussed?

       I ask, so we can analyze why they "disappeared". Corporate interests? Off topic to sub? Spiritual in nature? etc.
