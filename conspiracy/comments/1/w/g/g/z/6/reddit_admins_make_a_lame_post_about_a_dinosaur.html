    <div class="md"><p>Of course, believing in conspiracies is a slippery slope because it can lead a small minority of believers to go off the deep end.</p>

<p>But they certainly do not represent the standard person who believes there is more to life that the &quot;official story&quot; or what the MSM says is true.</p>

<p>I can understand how that could be confusing to so many people, like you. Its pretty lame to use that reasoning. It would be like pointing out Mexicans who run drugs across the border and saying &quot;Every Mexican who comes across the border is bringing drugs!&quot; </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed. But the &quot;majority of people here&quot; is a misnomer when dealing with this subreddit. If you had bothered to read or understand what I posted above:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true. Its also interesting to think that the entire concept of the conspiratard movement was very likely started by someone in the intelligence community. And that is not a stretch at all. Any organization with a brain, or that understood even the basics of human nature and human psychology, would have created a plan to rope &quot;Joe Six-pack&quot; into doing some of the dirty work for them.</p>

<p>Things like this have been going on for centuries. These are the same tactics that lead police into protests dressed up as average citizens, to try to influence those around them with a violent streak into acting that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the people in conspiratard are some of the most narcissistic fuckwads on this website, you can go over there and see almost ALL of them demonstrate the exact psychological traits they pin on the people they are chasing around the internet cyberstalking and harassing(which itself is pathological and beyond childish - but those are the traits of the narcissist - anything to feel above others and pad/massage their idealized opinions of themselves, so they pick the social grouping that their betters[anyone in visible positions of power or social authority, media talkshow hosts/&quot;authorities&quot; - because the only thing these people understand is social perception and the very shallow level of personal feelings/ego] point to as being ridiculous to make a little cyber-club about being smarter than/better than and they spent their time on it without realizing that in attempting to belittle and disparage others they are truly only belittling themselves and turning themselves into exactly the kind of retards they are pretending they are above or mocking).</p>

<p>people with low self-esteem look for others to persecute/be above, conspiracy theorists are questioning the stories about major historical developments/society-impacting events given to them by what are largely the most crooked/criminal people in history - wealthy/powerful old white men - &quot;conspiratard&quot; subscribers and debunkers are defending the integrity of the powerful old white men robbing them and sending their children to war and making themselves feel intelligent by making it so that they persecute/belittle the <em>questioners</em> without even attempting to ADDRESS the questions being asked(because it&#39;s so much better to mock them and avoid ever having to consider it beyond self-validating debunkable debunking) - really what they are defending is their own idea of themselves and their feeling of security and empowerment as those things are attached to their social grouping or culture at large. In other words, they don&#39;t want to feel like they&#39;re being suckered, and they want to think whatever thoughts will benefit their views of themselves and feelings about themselves most, rather than what is most true.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a joke and I&#39;m not over-analyzing, there are a lot of genuinely stupid, sick, and insane people on the interne. There are a lot of very immature narcissists in the world, and our culture specifically seems to be BREEDING them. As long as you are completely focused on yourself and your own shallow social setting and trying to be cool/look cool/be well liked by your peers/have a high view of yourself - you will NEVER think thoughts that you have been convinced are weird or crazy(<strong>like &quot;gee maybe we shouldn&#39;t send our children to their deaths in wars based on admitted lies or we are retarded fucking ignorant scumbags ruining people&#39;s lives &quot;</strong>) - because &quot;that&#39;s antisocial or insane&quot;(note that being/endorsing being a paid killer is not considered antisocial or insane), because anything that could get you personally ostracized has to be thrown away mentally without consideration - or - for the smarter variant of conspiratard personalities - they are less shallow but still personally-oriented/egotistical fake intellectuals who view with malice and disgust anything that could call into question their feelings of intellectual security/superiority.</p>

<p>these people are a complete perversion of all the qualities they pretend they stand for, and anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together would avoid ever being a part of that particular online grouping - but hey, everyone looks for ways to pad their own worldviews - everything ACTUALLY insane is sane to them, everything ACTUALLY retarded are perfectly intelligent ways of being to them, and anyone pointing out that things aren&#39;t always as they seem is just a nutjob who should probably be reported to some kind of authority for re-education</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh...I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way. I just casually use reddit and have mostly seen it as a social media place to dick around on. However, it would make a lot of sense for it to be a media front. I mean, we&#39;ve had the POTUS do an AMA, numerous celebrities do AMAs (and many of them doing so to push their latest item or interest), several well-known companies sponsoring product give-aways here and even perks for having reddit gold that are tied to spending extra cash on things. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll still be using reddit as I have before, but it certainly puts a more critical eye on how I&#39;ll be viewing the content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are naturally going to jump on the bandwagon and say &quot;Lighten up, they were just trying to be funny. Not everything is a conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>The reality is that every corporate controlled entity has an &quot;image&quot; that is discussed and invented amongst creative directors hired for that very purpose. When reddit was finally noticed by someone with money, Conde Nast, they got bought out and some genius (not being sarcastic), seriously though, some genius decided that it made more sense to keep the original &quot;brand image&quot; of what reddit.com started as. So now they cultivate that image because that is the image that reddit has always had, or at least, appeared to have.</p>

<p>The difference is that the popular brand image went from being an actual side-effect of a hard-working team of friends, into a corporate controlled copy meant to keep the same flow of new users for as long as possible, and thanks to the Eternal September concept, it could be a great strategy to continue cultivating that original brand image since reddit survives, like facebook, on constant waves of new people, who each feel great about the idea that they are on a &quot;cool, little, secret corner of the internet where everyone is a &#39;neckbeard&#39; or gamer, we all love pokemon and jennifer lawrence, etc...&quot;.</p>

<p>Reddit now appeals to the lowest common denominator: Tween girls who think being &quot;random&quot; is cool. And this is coming as someone who started go on reddit when it&#39;s common denominator was professionals between 23-32 years old who work in a popular industry, as I was 31 and a digital designer at the time.  </p>

<p>Conde Nast now had a hot website, so they kicked it over to their parent company, Advance Publications.</p>

<p>Around 2011,a lot of drastic changes started to hit reddit, destroying the very fabric of the free speech and call to actions that defined reddit as a place for internet activism, quality discussions, and original content.</p>

<p>As it became very obvious that some major changes were being made to reddit, many people left while an entire new demographic were just starting to discover the website.</p>

<p>As part of a much bigger plan regarding changing and re-branding the site, someone had the brilliant idea of using the classic corporate strategy of releasing the company in name, yet owning it in shares. </p>

<p>So now they could then add to their media packet that reddit was &quot;independently owned&quot; reinforcing the original re-branding idea that the site should portray to their users that they were still a bunch of &quot;cool kids sitting around running a site&quot;.</p>

<p>Instead of the truth, which is that their largest shareholder is a company that used to own them and now has the right to vote on the directors nominated by the board, propose shareholder resolutions, and the right to declared dividends.</p>

<p>Fair enough. You actually just skip to the conviction in the world&#39;s most infantile trial, so no investigation called for. My bad on reading comprehension.</p>

<p>Easily digestible content always wins, regardless of quality. You want a reddit admin conspiracy, now <em>that</em> would be an interesting start.</p>

<p>I am genuinely bummed about the vote brigading though. That&#39;s never right, and even though I agree that this post was dumb, I don&#39;t think I even downvoted it - let alone getting a pack of friends to collectively vote shit on it. On a <em>having a life</em> scale, that manages to rank even lower than having a prolonged argument in such a post&#39;s comments (I may not be high on this scale, but I will defend the meager honor of my position).</p>

<p>Funny, that&#39;s actually my MO for stuff I agree with in this subreddit. &quot;Yup, sounds legit.&quot; And then I maybe upvote, maybe not, and just keep scrolling down the homepage. I don&#39;t visit the comments very often - usually just when the headline makes me think &quot;oh you gotta be kiddin&#39; me.&quot;</p>

<p>The official story of 9/11 is certainly an extraordinary claim, or more accurately a <em>bunch</em> of extraordinary claims, few of which have even ordinary evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And now you&#39;ve made an assumption about me without knowing anything based on a couple sentences I typed about basic logic.</p>

<p>Yes, the official story about 9/11 is a series of extraordinary claims that requires extreme incompetence and shows a lack of evidence. That&#39;s what makes me doubt it. </p>

<p>Similarly, reading a nonsensical blog post that pokes fun at the SOTU and turning it into a grand conspiracy because reddit is actually controlled by the media to enslave everyone is also a series of extraordinary claims with no evidence presented. Enter the doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is <em>pretty</em> freaking strange, but that is far as I will go for now. As far as I am concerned, reddit.com started out without having too much ego. They <em>were</em> just a group of cool people trying to start something. And then things spiraled out of control and reddit.com basically becomes the next most addictive things outside of video games and facebook. </p>

<p>But thanks to this concept that I recently learned about, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal September</a>, I feel the way reddit is designed makes it prone to this weakness because everyone came onto reddit knowing nothing about its customs and lingo but then we learned from other people who were here before us.</p>

<p>Very slight incremental adjustments are made and the next wave of users now see that as normal and then they teach the next user generation etc... </p>

<p>Its all very frustrating to anyone paying attention to how downhill this site has gone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh?  I mean, reddit is a business, so money is involved.  But its revenues are, by all accounts, very low as far as businesses are concerned.  A piece in Forbes says, from 2012:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2012/10/31/what-is-reddit-worth/2/">Value Reddit strictly on the basis of its skimpy current revenue and its inability so far to turn a profit, and the site probably falls short of even $50 million.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last I heard reddit was only pulling in about 7 million a year and it was still in the red (2013).</p>

<p>As far as I know reddit still isn&#39;t in the black.  You originally said massive sites like this don&#39;t have any problem making money in your response <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wggz6/reddit_admins_make_a_lame_post_about_a_dinosaur/cf1wg9p">here</a> and I think I have soundly proven that <a href="/u/Dirtybrd">/u/Dirtybrd</a> was correct when he said that massive sites like this (i.e. text based, forum-style) have problems making profit.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, man, I don&#39;t really want to teach a class in business administration, but there are ways to generate revenue.  Reddit&#39;s market value is pretty high, so banks might lend to the site, especially if their business plan going forward looks promising.  They can also sell shares to private investors, since reddit isn&#39;t publicly traded.  Businesses of just a few million a year can get lines of credit extend to them pretty easily too, which I imagine is where the bulk of their break-even money comes from.  Among other things.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t think reddit is too far into the red.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;re hemmorrhaging money.  But Wong has been pretty open about it <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ihwy8/ratheism_and_rpolitics_removed_from_default/cb4pk6g">here</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/howredditworks/comments/1oyhjw/reddit_gold_how_does_the_you_have_helped_pay_for/">here</a>.  You originally said</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wggz6/reddit_admins_make_a_lame_post_about_a_dinosaur/cf20nou">are you fucking serious? if it wasn&#39;t making someone, somewhere a fuckton of cash, it wouldn&#39;t exist.</a></p>

<p>that&#39;s how capitalism works, remember?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think I&#39;ve soundly shown that profit isn&#39;t high and probably non-existent.  There is no &quot;fuckton of cash&quot; being made by anyone.  Certainly no giant media corporation controlling everything.  Sounds like they&#39;re running pretty shallow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. I&#39;m going to make this as simple as possible. There is no organization out there that gives out money to popular sites. Reddit makes money on advertising.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but all that is mostly outsourced and not directly within Reddit.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a matter of money its a matter of PR and people&#39;s ignorance of appearance vs, fact.  </p>

<p>The appearance is a carefully managed avatar of young techie kids who care about &quot;issues&quot; and especially care for free speech.  If they have a flaw, teehee, it&#39;s that they aren&#39;t serious <em>enough.</em>  </p>

<p>The reality is that this is a highly trafficked and valuable venue for PR teams, marketers, politicians, and corporations, who scrub it of damaging content and promote themselves through targetted campaigns, all through the guise of human to human contact.  Paid shills, advetisements, astroturf, undermining rebellious ideas, etc.  It&#39;s slick, it&#39;s &quot;friendly&quot; and it&#39;s borderline brainwashing.  </p>

<p>Within the context of teh wider society, especially as reddit is still seen by young people as &quot;alternative&quot; &quot;organic&quot; media, it&#39;s especially good brainwashing, which makes education all the more important.  </p>

<p>Consume it if you want.  I mean, I smoked for 6 years.  Far from me to say no one can consume anything harmful.  But if it causes cancer, you should have the facts before you inhale.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your statement was declarative, dummy. There was no &quot;I think.&quot; It was conjecture disguised as fact. And your opinion is still fucking dumb. </p>

<p>It&#39;s as dumb as saying, &quot;Hey everyone - look at Reddit&#39;s PR department being goofy! There&#39;s a conspiracy to make people think that Reddit is an independent site run by teenagers!&quot;</p>

<p>Anybody with half a brain can figure out what Reddit is really about. <a href="/r/hailcorporate">/r/hailcorporate</a> exists. </p>

<p>However, once in a blue moon, people do things like this for shits and giggles. For the lulz. Not as a targeted conspiracy to sway already complacent content-consumers to consume more and feel good about it. Why the fuck on Earth would the admins need to pander to Reddit&#39;s userbase when every user-targeted, user-upvoted advertisement does it already? Isn&#39;t it enough that people get addicted to using Reddit and act like it&#39;s a super-secret club nobody knows about?</p>

<p>So yeah, this was as pointless of a response as your post was, but I just wanted to sincerely say:</p>

<p>tl;dr: fuck you. Post shit that actually matters, not bullshit about how some mod making stickies about narwhals or whatever is a targeted ruse to hurt people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes because it was explained to us how it works in our training in case customers ask about it or try to return merchandise. What paragraph are you asking about? Starbucks does not do franchise. So when you see those stores it is because of a special agreement, a &quot;corporate franchise&quot; if you will. This allows Target, or an Airport or whatever to have a &quot;Starbucks&quot; branded coffee shop. The employees of these shops do not work for starbucks, they get no benefits or discounts and are under the polices of the store not of starbucks. They do not have partnet numbers nor are they trained the same way. </p>

<p>It is not a true franchise. It is a licensed store. I know what I am talking about you don&#39;t. Those stores are not controlled by Starbucks. Just like some Verizon stores are &quot;Authorized Retailers&quot; and not actual Verizons. Its really not that complicated dude</p>
