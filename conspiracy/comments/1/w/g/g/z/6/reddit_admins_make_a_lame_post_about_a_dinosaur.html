       It is definitely pretty scary, its amazing how they don't even perceive themselves as being over-defensive.

       But I guess cognitive-dissonance is now just another part of their lives. So they have to defend it any time they see a threat.

       Of course, believing in conspiracies is a slippery slope because it can lead a small minority of believers to go off the deep end.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they certainly do not represent the standard person who believes there is more to life that the "official story" or what the MSM says is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand how that could be confusing to so many people, like you. Its pretty lame to use that reasoning. It would be like pointing out Mexicans who run drugs across the border and saying "Every Mexican who comes across the border is bringing drugs!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't know if you have noticed. But the "majority of people here" is a misnomer when dealing with this subreddit. If you had bothered to read or understand what I posted above:

       Then you would see that many of the people here have nothing better to do than try to ridicule the people trying to ask questions and have adult conversations.

       So true. Its also interesting to think that the entire concept of the conspiratard movement was very likely started by someone in the intelligence community. And that is not a stretch at all. Any organization with a brain, or that understood even the basics of human nature and human psychology, would have created a plan to rope "Joe Six-pack" into doing some of the dirty work for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like this have been going on for centuries. These are the same tactics that lead police into protests dressed up as average citizens, to try to influence those around them with a violent streak into acting that way.

       the people in conspiratard are some of the most narcissistic fuckwads on this website, you can go over there and see almost ALL of them demonstrate the exact psychological traits they pin on the people they are chasing around the internet cyberstalking and harassing(which itself is pathological and beyond childish - but those are the traits of the narcissist - anything to feel above others and pad/massage their idealized opinions of themselves, so they pick the social grouping that their betters[anyone in visible positions of power or social authority, media talkshow hosts/"authorities" - because the only thing these people understand is social perception and the very shallow level of personal feelings/ego] point to as being ridiculous to make a little cyber-club about being smarter than/better than and they spent their time on it without realizing that in attempting to belittle and disparage others they are truly only belittling themselves and turning themselves into exactly the kind of retards they are pretending they are above or mocking).
      </p>
      <p>
       people with low self-esteem look for others to persecute/be above, conspiracy theorists are questioning the stories about major historical developments/society-impacting events given to them by what are largely the most crooked/criminal people in history - wealthy/powerful old white men - "conspiratard" subscribers and debunkers are defending the integrity of the powerful old white men robbing them and sending their children to war and making themselves feel intelligent by making it so that they persecute/belittle the
       <em>
        questioners
       </em>
       without even attempting to ADDRESS the questions being asked(because it's so much better to mock them and avoid ever having to consider it beyond self-validating debunkable debunking) - really what they are defending is their own idea of themselves and their feeling of security and empowerment as those things are attached to their social grouping or culture at large. In other words, they don't want to feel like they're being suckered, and they want to think whatever thoughts will benefit their views of themselves and feelings about themselves most, rather than what is most true.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a joke and I'm not over-analyzing, there are a lot of genuinely stupid, sick, and insane people on the interne. There are a lot of very immature narcissists in the world, and our culture specifically seems to be BREEDING them. As long as you are completely focused on yourself and your own shallow social setting and trying to be cool/look cool/be well liked by your peers/have a high view of yourself - you will NEVER think thoughts that you have been convinced are weird or crazy(
       <strong>
        like "gee maybe we shouldn't send our children to their deaths in wars based on admitted lies or we are retarded fucking ignorant scumbags ruining people's lives "
       </strong>
       ) - because "that's antisocial or insane"(note that being/endorsing being a paid killer is not considered antisocial or insane), because anything that could get you personally ostracized has to be thrown away mentally without consideration - or - for the smarter variant of conspiratard personalities - they are less shallow but still personally-oriented/egotistical fake intellectuals who view with malice and disgust anything that could call into question their feelings of intellectual security/superiority.
      </p>
      <p>
       these people are a complete perversion of all the qualities they pretend they stand for, and anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together would avoid ever being a part of that particular online grouping - but hey, everyone looks for ways to pad their own worldviews - everything ACTUALLY insane is sane to them, everything ACTUALLY retarded are perfectly intelligent ways of being to them, and anyone pointing out that things aren't always as they seem is just a nutjob who should probably be reported to some kind of authority for re-education

       I really like the line and I did not know what else to say. Anyways, downvotes mean little to me these days.

       I think the what's actually being expressed is that people like you just call people names and that's it. People aren't trying to censor other's, just get their reasons behind an opinion. As in "why do you think this point COULDN'T have any other mission behind it besides being cute or funny?" and getting an actual answer, as opposed to just calling people nuts.

       Join the discussion. Calling people nuts doesn't do anything for anyone.

       Huh...I hadn't thought of it that way. I just casually use reddit and have mostly seen it as a social media place to dick around on. However, it would make a lot of sense for it to be a media front. I mean, we've had the POTUS do an AMA, numerous celebrities do AMAs (and many of them doing so to push their latest item or interest), several well-known companies sponsoring product give-aways here and even perks for having reddit gold that are tied to spending extra cash on things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll still be using reddit as I have before, but it certainly puts a more critical eye on how I'll be viewing the content.

       People are naturally going to jump on the bandwagon and say "Lighten up, they were just trying to be funny. Not everything is a conspiracy."
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that every corporate controlled entity has an "image" that is discussed and invented amongst creative directors hired for that very purpose. When reddit was finally noticed by someone with money, Conde Nast, they got bought out and some genius (not being sarcastic), seriously though, some genius decided that it made more sense to keep the original "brand image" of what reddit.com started as. So now they cultivate that image because that is the image that reddit has always had, or at least, appeared to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is that the popular brand image went from being an actual side-effect of a hard-working team of friends, into a corporate controlled copy meant to keep the same flow of new users for as long as possible, and thanks to the Eternal September concept, it could be a great strategy to continue cultivating that original brand image since reddit survives, like facebook, on constant waves of new people, who each feel great about the idea that they are on a "cool, little, secret corner of the internet where everyone is a 'neckbeard' or gamer, we all love pokemon and jennifer lawrence, etc...".
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit now appeals to the lowest common denominator: Tween girls who think being "random" is cool. And this is coming as someone who started go on reddit when it's common denominator was professionals between 23-32 years old who work in a popular industry, as I was 31 and a digital designer at the time.

       Work in marketing, can confirm. Branding isn't selling in the traditional sense, it's the creation of a certain image. It's making your money-making machine look like it has a soul.

       That may be true for the big subs, but it isn't for the smaller subreddits. It's not even true for some of the big ones. How many NSA/Snowden posts have been removed from the front page? There really isn't that much censorship on the front page, despite all the hysterics posted here on this sub.

Looking at his history it's clear this is the account he uses to troll this sub and since he had +5 despite his clear mangling of your quote I'm going to say there is some vote brigading going on here.

        Then in 2012, reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. The best characterization might be to say that reddit is a “part-sibling-once-removed” of Condé Nast.

       Reddit was owned by Conde Nast, who bought it out once they saw the potential behind the site, then they began changing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conde Nast now had a hot website, so they kicked it over to their parent company, Advance Publications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around 2011,a lot of drastic changes started to hit reddit, destroying the very fabric of the free speech and call to actions that defined reddit as a place for internet activism, quality discussions, and original content.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it became very obvious that some major changes were being made to reddit, many people left while an entire new demographic were just starting to discover the website.
      </p>
      <p>
       As part of a much bigger plan regarding changing and re-branding the site, someone had the brilliant idea of using the classic corporate strategy of releasing the company in name, yet owning it in shares.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now they could then add to their media packet that reddit was "independently owned" reinforcing the original re-branding idea that the site should portray to their users that they were still a bunch of "cool kids sitting around running a site".
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of the truth, which is that their largest shareholder is a company that used to own them and now has the right to vote on the directors nominated by the board, propose shareholder resolutions, and the right to declared dividends.

       Reddit is a lot more than just a news portal.  There are several non-controversial community subreddits that are very useful to me which have no internal politics or fighting.  For example

       Disagreements and arguments are fine with me - especially when languages
       <strong>
        do
       </strong>
       have their pros and cons. There's not a lot of infighting amongst contributors or moderators though, unlike many subs.

       It's a genuine post of an alternate perception of message, certainly created more better discussion than the original thread. I don't see how it's 'retarded'. That would acquire something along the base of your post which does not broaden any perspective beyond an actual retard.

       The original post was stupid and pointless. Interpreting it as a malicious form of brainwashing, is even moreso.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are real conspiracies like HSBC's money laundering BS. "Reddit makes a dumb blog post about dinosaurs" does not merit investigation, much less a fanciful extrapolation about the capitalistic evils of Conde Nast. I'm sure if you want to hang them, they're a big enough company to have actual rope, you don't have to just grab for the nearest knotted strand of toilet paper.

       Fair enough. You actually just skip to the conviction in the world's most infantile trial, so no investigation called for. My bad on reading comprehension.

       Easily digestible content always wins, regardless of quality. You want a reddit admin conspiracy, now

       I am genuinely bummed about the vote brigading though. That's never right, and even though I agree that this post was dumb, I don't think I even downvoted it - let alone getting a pack of friends to collectively vote shit on it. On a
       <em>
        having a life
       </em>
       scale, that manages to rank even lower than having a prolonged argument in such a post's comments (I may not be high on this scale, but I will defend the meager honor of my position).

       Funny, that's actually my MO for stuff I agree with in this subreddit. "Yup, sounds legit." And then I maybe upvote, maybe not, and just keep scrolling down the homepage. I don't visit the comments very often - usually just when the headline makes me think "oh you gotta be kiddin' me."

       I'd wager you allow the official narrative to guide your definition of 'extraordinary.'

      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the official story about 9/11 is a series of extraordinary claims that requires extreme incompetence and shows a lack of evidence. That's what makes me doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, reading a nonsensical blog post that pokes fun at the SOTU and turning it into a grand conspiracy because reddit is actually controlled by the media to enslave everyone is also a series of extraordinary claims with no evidence presented. Enter the doubt.

       It is
       <em>
        pretty
       </em>
       freaking strange, but that is far as I will go for now. As far as I am concerned, reddit.com started out without having too much ego. They
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       just a group of cool people trying to start something. And then things spiraled out of control and reddit.com basically becomes the next most addictive things outside of video games and facebook.

      <p>
       But thanks to this concept that I recently learned about,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">
        Eternal September
       </a>
       , I feel the way reddit is designed makes it prone to this weakness because everyone came onto reddit knowing nothing about its customs and lingo but then we learned from other people who were here before us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very slight incremental adjustments are made and the next wave of users now see that as normal and then they teach the next user generation etc...

       because the flip side of "eternal sepetember" is the "old users complaining about the new" It has a name, but basically, "the new users are ruining the site" is just the inverse of eternal september, It's kind of a couple steps in the ladder after you're part of the eternal september, you become the grizzled veteran.

       I doubt that's true at all, actually. Massive sites like this have always had a problem making a profit. Why do you think Youtube is covered head to tails in ads? Why do you think 4chan has a paid feature? Facebook had to go public before it became massively profitable.

       That's because there's no easy way to monetize Reddit. With a site like 4chan, Moot had the genius idea of crippling its functionality by adding the captcha then charging to use the site as it was pre-captcha.

       Yeah that value isn't about the profits that reddit makes.  Like I said, I don't think reddit has ever posted a profit.  Their market value is derived from the number of people that visit this site and its
       <em>
        potential
       </em>
       .  Not the revenues it brings in.

       Huh?  I mean, reddit is a business, so money is involved.  But its revenues are, by all accounts, very low as far as businesses are concerned.  A piece in Forbes says, from 2012:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2012/10/31/what-is-reddit-worth/2/">
         Value Reddit strictly on the basis of its skimpy current revenue and its inability so far to turn a profit, and the site probably falls short of even $50 million.
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Last I heard reddit was only pulling in about 7 million a year and it was still in the red (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I know reddit still isn't in the black.  You originally said massive sites like this don't have any problem making money in your response
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wggz6/reddit_admins_make_a_lame_post_about_a_dinosaur/cf1wg9p">
        here
       </a>
       and I think I have soundly proven that
       <a href="/u/Dirtybrd">
        /u/Dirtybrd
       </a>
       was correct when he said that massive sites like this (i.e. text based, forum-style) have problems making profit.  It's at least true in the case of reddit.

       Well, man, I don't really want to teach a class in business administration, but there are ways to generate revenue.  Reddit's market value is pretty high, so banks might lend to the site, especially if their business plan going forward looks promising.  They can also sell shares to private investors, since reddit isn't publicly traded.  Businesses of just a few million a year can get lines of credit extend to them pretty easily too, which I imagine is where the bulk of their break-even money comes from.  Among other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I don't think reddit is too far into the red.  I don't think they're hemmorrhaging money.  But Wong has been pretty open about it

       And I think I've soundly shown that profit isn't high and probably non-existent.  There is no "fuckton of cash" being made by anyone.  Certainly no giant media corporation controlling everything.  Sounds like they're running pretty shallow.

       Okay. I'm going to make this as simple as possible. There is no organization out there that gives out money to popular sites. Reddit makes money on advertising. There are no more than two ads per page. The average Redditor knows about and uses AdBlock. AdBlock = No ads= no $$.

       Now you've made me wonder. If reddit doesn't use advertising to make money, they must make some by censoring certain content and public opinion/vote manipulation for corporate or political etc agendas.

       Yeah but all that is mostly outsourced and not directly within Reddit. That's the easy way to manipulate reddit (from the outside), I'm thinking there's more to it
       <em>
        within reddit
       </em>
       . Are we forgetting Reddit is just another website that can easily be redesigned and constructed to the developers accord. Making us believe in the fairness of votes for validity.

       Maybe a lot of people just don't agree with fringe politics. Isn't that part of the point - that you are privy to knowledge the masses cannot see? So what's the issue here and why do you pretend it's some kind of clandestine thing?

       To avoid being shilled or having dis-info thrown into my lap I subscribe exclusively to sub-reddits relevent to my interests. Most of it's just boards for underground artists and games and stuff. I don't subscribe to any default reddits because they're lolsorandum.

       I disagree with this post but appreciate the direction. Yes, corporations have very specific angles and images they want to maintain but if you actually knew how reddit was structured from a corporate perspective you would change your attitude regarding this post. It was a joke on a site that hosts a lot of jokes and has admins that generally and genuinely enjoy to have fun with their audience.

       It's not a matter of money its a matter of PR and people's ignorance of appearance vs, fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The appearance is a carefully managed avatar of young techie kids who care about "issues" and especially care for free speech.  If they have a flaw, teehee, it's that they aren't serious
       <em>
        enough.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that this is a highly trafficked and valuable venue for PR teams, marketers, politicians, and corporations, who scrub it of damaging content and promote themselves through targetted campaigns, all through the guise of human to human contact.  Paid shills, advetisements, astroturf, undermining rebellious ideas, etc.  It's slick, it's "friendly" and it's borderline brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the context of teh wider society, especially as reddit is still seen by young people as "alternative" "organic" media, it's especially good brainwashing, which makes education all the more important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consume it if you want.  I mean, I smoked for 6 years.  Far from me to say no one can consume anything harmful.  But if it causes cancer, you should have the facts before you inhale.  That's what I'm saying.

       I dont get this. If you honestly believe this then why are you here? You visiting this site and posting stuff like this, which in turns inspires like minded people to visit as well, does nothing but increase reddit's overall power and influence. You seem to be a pretty active user with posts across many subs. Why do you denounce something then not hesitate to take part in it?. Seems hypocritical to me. If you honestly believe this then stand by it.

       Anything that grows big and starts having influence to a large number of people will eventually get under control buy large enterprises/governments. For example, it is scary how powerful Google has become, buying companies related to bio engineering, robotics, getting involved in weapons industry etc.

       lads, just pointing out the obvious... Why use reddit if its so shit? its not some evil empire man, its just an enjoyable forum site. There's no need to over analyse every aspect of what goes on here, yeah, its a huge site designed to make profit. Who cares? Does it effect your experience here? if it does, go somewhere else, vote with your feet etc...

       You cannot run servers that handle the amount of traffic these things handle without making some money. The very idea that reddit is a small group of hipsters and what not is utter nonsense. they collect and show IP addresses, often there are queries of highly personal nature, there is a requirement to provide further identification in order to post with more frequency etc etc etc. Reddit is in no way what it seems in my opinion.

       Your statement was declarative, dummy. There was no "I think." It was conjecture disguised as fact. And your opinion is still fucking dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as dumb as saying, "Hey everyone - look at Reddit's PR department being goofy! There's a conspiracy to make people think that Reddit is an independent site run by teenagers!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody with half a brain can figure out what Reddit is really about.
       <a href="/r/hailcorporate">
        /r/hailcorporate
       </a>
       exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, once in a blue moon, people do things like this for shits and giggles. For the lulz. Not as a targeted conspiracy to sway already complacent content-consumers to consume more and feel good about it. Why the fuck on Earth would the admins need to pander to Reddit's userbase when every user-targeted, user-upvoted advertisement does it already? Isn't it enough that people get addicted to using Reddit and act like it's a super-secret club nobody knows about?
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, this was as pointless of a response as your post was, but I just wanted to sincerely say:
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: fuck you. Post shit that actually matters, not bullshit about how some mod making stickies about narwhals or whatever is a targeted ruse to hurt people.

       No it fuckig doesn't. Reddit Admins have a lot of control. The CEO of Conde Nast can't just send a letter to the admins and say "censor GMOs" thats not how it works. You do know there is such a thing as being semi autonomous right?

       um I don't.. i know how how Affiliates differ from subsidies.. You know those Starbucks at the Airport or in Target? Guess what? Those aren't fucking starbucks. Starbucks doesn't have control over SHIT that goes on there. Its the same idea. Just different. They are getting paid to use the logo its like a form of advertising for Fox. They are not OWNED by fox.

       Nope I have just worked for Starbucks :) So I know how it works. Those are not Starbucks and Starbucks has NOTHING to do with them. Target has to buy the supplies from Starbucks and Starbucks allows them to use their logo but the people get paid by Target and work for Target and such. They don't even get discounts at Starbucks. Do you wanna know the term for those stores? It doesn't sound like you care about the facts though.

       So making a couple coffees behind the counter has allowed you a glimpse into the corporate workings of Starbucks... sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that any Starbucks in the US is somehow free of the corporation Starbucks, then you have completely misinterpreted the way retail works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, show me the paragraph where it says that certain Starbucks are somehow free from the control of the Starbucks corporation.

       Yes because it was explained to us how it works in our training in case customers ask about it or try to return merchandise. What paragraph are you asking about? Starbucks does not do franchise. So when you see those stores it is because of a special agreement, a "corporate franchise" if you will. This allows Target, or an Airport or whatever to have a "Starbucks" branded coffee shop. The employees of these shops do not work for starbucks, they get no benefits or discounts and are under the polices of the store not of starbucks. They do not have partnet numbers nor are they trained the same way.

        In North America, most of the Starbucks stores are company-operated. However, the company sometimes enters into
        <strong>
         licensing arrangements with companies
        </strong>

       It is not a true franchise. It is a licensed store. I know what I am talking about you don't. Those stores are not controlled by Starbucks. Just like some Verizon stores are "Authorized Retailers" and not actual Verizons. Its really not that complicated dude

       They would if news corp came to them and said "you're doing this now or we're shutting you down".  That's the power of ownership.  Just because they may

        choose

       And anyways, are you so naive that you believe people don't live and participate in contradictions as part of living in everyday society? Are you really trying to cherry-pick one and use that as a reason to disregard other people's observations.

       A disagreement would be fine but this is name calling, name calling is even lower than ad hominem attacks on Graham's hierarchy of disagreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Name calling adds nothing to the discussion.

       I'd wager you allow the official narrative to guide your definition of 'extraordinary.'
      </p>
      <p>
       The official story of 9/11 is certainly an extraordinary claim, or more accurately a
       <em>
        bunch
       </em>
       of extraordinary claims, few of which have even ordinary evidence.
