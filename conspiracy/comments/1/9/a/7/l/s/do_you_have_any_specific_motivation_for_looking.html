    <div class="md"><p>This. Trying to lift the veil and avoid falling into the easy mob mentality. I guess this is easier if you&#39;re older and have seen your share of lies spouted off by authority figures and media that later were debunked. </p>

<p>Let alone independent sources, just comparing the reaction to a very same event by different media organs is an easy way to start questioning and guessing there&#39;s something rotten in Denmark and Tulsa. </p>

<p>Also, seeing loved ones suffer due to misguided wars started on the flimsiest of events helps.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s a big danger on this: doubting everything is a path as perilous as believing everything. Sometimes the chemtrail is just a cigar. Sometimes the nefarious global plan is just a stupid, crooked individual with a badge or rubber stamp trying to exercise a bit of power or pulling a fast one.</p>

<p>The big danger is becoming paranoid and becoming a deer on the headlights as one tries to check the numerology and interpret the JPG artifacts on every single picture. Now THAT is something the factions vying for power do like, a stunned population incapable of action and untrusting of each other.</p>

<p>wow! i was just thinking about this the other day. but what i&#39;d like to figure out is if we can retroactively find the whistleblowers that were trying to tell us back when it was going down and analyze their inspiration and process. what kind of person knows before everyone else about the conspiracy and what can they do about it?</p>

<p>your other comments about balancing out the paranoia are very smart. thanks!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a &#39;show you mine so me yours&#39; posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your &#39;favourite weapon&#39; and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite &#39;technique of operation.&#39; From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.&quot;</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think i understand this completely. why bullshit is accepted? which side is calling what bullshit here? sorry. could you explain?</p>

<p>also, is your interest in psychology and propaganda techniques tied to your interest in conspiracies? do you feel that the people behind conspiracies exploit human nature and our psychology through propaganda techniques? i&#39;d really like to hear more about this. those are also interests of mine.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an example of what I mean by bullshit...</p>

<p>Every election cycle people are promised the world and those promises are never delivered, even after a person has shown to do the opposite of what they said they would do, they will vote for that person again.</p>

<p>We are constantly bombarded with psychological techniques and propaganda via the media which effects society as a whole. I&#39;ll give you some examples.</p>

<p>Asserting authority</p>

<p>&#39;Experts are often brought onto news channels that have an opinion. Because they are experts and people don&#39;t often understand the topic, they just believe it is correct because they are experts. Their opinion is often coming from a side of which is being defended.</p>

<p>Vilifying and guilt by association </p>

<p>Demonising people is very effective and consensus by a panel of people will become accepted by the less informed because the group agrees. Also, people do not want to be associated with someone that has been given a bad label in fear of being labeled badly themselves.</p>

<p>Playing down solutions and quickly changing topics </p>

<p>Often if a guest is going too far into solutions the host will cut in and remove the topic and go in a different direction making an excuse to do so.</p>

<p>Ad Hominem</p>

<p>See Piers Morgan for a very unsubtle case of Ad Hominem. That&#39;s also ties in with guilt by association if the person watching doesn&#39;t understand what Ad Hominem.</p>

<p>Repetitiveness </p>

<p>Keep saying things over and over until it is accepted. Goebells said that if you tell a lie often enough it becomes the truth. Next time you see a politician that gets asked a question which they won&#39;t answer, they will repeat themselves again and again without answering the question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>cool! if you feel like responding whenever later, just wondering if you could go into your personal definition of a conspiracy? because it sounds like your examples are mostly political and in particular corruption and lying. what kind of intentions must there be before it&#39;s a conspiracy? plenty of people lie and plenty of people do dirty things to get ahead. is it about scale or about perpetuating a lie? a particular lie?</p>

<p>thanks for your input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The premise of the lie is that politicians are acting in your best interest and they are the ones that take the heat for all backlash which is inevitable right after they fuck you over. Because they are not the power structure, this can continue for an indefinite amount of time as long as people are thrown a bone every now again which is mostly side issues or less important issues. When was the last time the military budget was cut or when did Obama talk about giving your rights back? You get gay marriage and equality and that bolsters the idea he is &#39;for the people&#39;.</p>

<p>To understand the conspiracy, you need to understand the mentality of those who are involved with it. Elitism looks down on common people as nothing more than contributors to their endeavours via tax collection and the ultimate goal is to wipe out most of humanity so they can live as gods on this planet with a small workforce. It is not possible to defeat humanity by fighting with weapons because it will be opposed as every other ruler has been. Nobody is going to wipe out humanity with nuclear weapons either if you ever think it would be so easy to do that. It would be left inhospitable. It may sound crazy but Eugenics is very real and pushed in many different ways. Africa is still starving but there is plenty of money to go round.</p>

<p>The conspiracies goal is to assume the position of total power which will be followed by a culling of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t see how you can become anymore depressed  about so called  &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; compared to things like world war etc (which often involve conspiracies).  Care because going &quot;I don&#39;t want to live in this world anymore!&quot; is just self-abnegating bravado.  Lots of crimes are speculated about too of course so there is also self interest involved.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think i was trying to say that your original comment sounded like lying/fraud/conspiracy/etc are things that happen over and over in history and always will because they are all a part of a collective issue that is much larger than us. in that light, what can we even do about it if we &quot;know&quot; about it? what advancements have been made in history (and presently) that make it harder for people to use conspiracy to their advantage? this is just to create conversation...i&#39;m not saying anyone or anything is right/wrong/good/bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That just seems like wondering about why people should care about crime as it will likely continue. And it will continue as an arms race against everyone involved in it and touched by it.  I couldn&#39;t name all of the things that make conspiracy harder and easier though as that would be all means of human interaction.  My own interactions with people included.    </p>
