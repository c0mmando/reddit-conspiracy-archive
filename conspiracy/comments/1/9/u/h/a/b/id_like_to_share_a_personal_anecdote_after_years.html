        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is one story which stands out to me more than anything else. And that would be the testimony of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Barack-Obama-Larry-Sinclair-Cocaine/dp/0578013878">Larry Sinclair</a> who wrote a book on the entire incident. This is an extremely deep rabbit hole situation and if you are new to conspiracies, please hold your restraint or just don&#39;t bother reading.</p>

<p>I am not passing judgement either way. But I have spent time studying this particular topic since mid-2010. I would like to present the story as I understand it so that others who are interested may dig further. </p>

<p>Larry Sinclair is an openly gay male. He was also convicted for drug use and fraud, and he openly admits this in his book. You can find many interviews with Larry discussing his criminal past. But if anything, I feel this only makes the story more likely that he would end up in this exact situation. So, Larry Sinclair claims to have run into Obama while traveling Chicago in November 1999. Long story short, he claims they both ingested cocaine/crack-cocaine and also had a few sexual interactions. At this time he did not know who Obama was. When asked, Obama replied he worked as a public official.</p>

<p>Years pass and now this guy Obama is running for president. Larry Sinclair contacted the Obama Campaign and David Axelrod in 2007. He wanted Obama to update his drug use records to include crack-cocaine as recent as 1999. Larry was looking for phone records to prove that he and Obama were in contact during November 1999. No response from the WH.</p>

<p>In 2008 he filmed a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lrf8DbrJH0">YouTube conference</a> to share these facts with the public. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QK0eGp3N6A">Here is the full version</a>. He contacted CitiGroup looking to release his credit card records as public information. Never panned out. </p>

<p>Larry was given a polygraph test during February 2008 to determine if this story is fabricated. The person who managed this test was Dan Parisi and it was &quot;verified&quot; by Edward I. Gelb. If you google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Edward+I+Gelb">Edward I. Gelb</a> you will find multiple results explaining <a href="http://antipolygraph.org/articles/article-036.shtml">he was using a phony PHD</a> has been convicted of this. It is fact. And clearly he was a plant in the operation. The computer read that Larry&#39;s results were clean - this is not what was reported to the media.</p>

<p>Another funny tidbit about the polygraph is the oversight by Robert Braddock Jr. who was around during the Obama 2007 campaign. Most recently during the 2012 campaign he was an aide to Chris Donovan and was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/13/robert-braddock-chris-donovan-aide-conspiracy-charges_n_1672084.html">found guilty &amp; indicted on conspiracy charges</a>. </p>

<p>Moving on, around the same time as Larry begins contacting the White House he starts receiving phone calls from a man identifying himself as Donald Young. This is probably between Oct-Dec 2007. You can hear more in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTDZyMzNuyw">this brief interview</a> although the audio is difficult to hear.</p>

<p>Donald Young was expressing his concern for Larry&#39;s safety. He somehow knew about all of this controversy surrounding Obama&#39;s drug use/homosexual affairs, and felt the need to warn him. Well it turns out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FrAmzvhGGY">Donald Young was murdered in December 2007</a>. He was found shot dead in his apartment, multiple gunshot wounds, door was closed and no sign of forced entry.</p>

<p>The YouTube video is from NBC news. There are no online articles from mainstream &quot;reputable&quot; sources but there are plenty of bloggers who have written about this connection. </p>

<p>Even Donald Young&#39;s own mother <a href="http://cofcc.org/2012/08/mother-believes-son-was-killed-to-protect-obamas-homosexuality/">believes her son was killed to protect Obamaâ€™s homosexuality</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://rense.com/general82/cdet.htm">Death certificate of Donald Young</a>.</p>

<p>I recommend interested free thinkers <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+young+mother+obama">do a Google search</a> and research this yourself. I am honestly not expecting to sway any opinions of Obama fans because people who still support him at this point are similar to victims of Stockholm syndrome.</p>

<p>If there are questions I will do my best to keep up with answers. But again, I am not trying to play detective for grown adults on Reddit who know how to use Google. Please go out and do your own research, and come to your own conclusions. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because the source is an (ex?) hard drug user (crack cocaine, anyone?).</p>

<p>Think back 8 years. Think to a party or gathering you were at or any social atmosphere. Think of someone that was there that you had never met prior and haven&#39;t met again since. How well do you remember what they look like? Now add crack cocaine to the mix.</p>

<p>And then the death of Donald Young. A man that lived in the ghetto of Chicago. We honestly think that someone being shot in the ghetto of Chicago, known to have some of the worst gun violence statistics in the country, is suspicious? Seriously?</p>

<p>And that bit about Young&#39;s mother believing he was killed because of gay-Obama? That was published in The Globe. The Globe. <strong><em>THE GLOBE</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good questions thank you for the follow-up. I don&#39;t think there is proof that the first test was all positives - but there is a libel case which was dismissed after the judge could not find evidence of Sinclair lying. Again, no MSM sources come up when searching, but here is the paragraph in brief:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in his Feb. 28 opinion dismissing the case that the plaintiffs, Daniel Parisi and his Internet porn site Whitehouse.com Inc., failed to show Sinclair had published any knowingly false statements. The judge concluded Sinclair had taken appropriate steps to verify information before publishing it.</p>

<p>The 2nd question is also good, and I don&#39;t totally have a solid answer.. honestly, I think they do want Sinclair dead. He just happens to be an author and fairly well known among his neighborhood. </p>

<p>But Donald was a pastor at the same church Obama attended, Trinity Church, in Chicago. So they were definitely known to have been at least friends or acquaintances. The idea that Donald may have known too much by the 2008 campaign is not unfounded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of what I think about your theory, I am glad to see someone willing to debate their theory. Most people on this subreddit respond to this kind of thing with: &#39;WHAT! YOU&#39;RE USING LOGIC AND ASKING FOR FACTS! YOU MUST BE A EVIL SECRET ILLUMINATI STONE MASON CIA AGENT!&#39;</p>

<p>However the libel case just shows that he didn&#39;t knowingly say anything wrong. In America it&#39;s very hard to prove libel, something many news agencies use to their advantage (example: Fox news). Polygraph tests are very rarely considered to be legally binding, as the science behind such tests isn&#39;t anywhere near as accurate as it needs to be. It does suggest however that there wasn&#39;t any obvious signs of lying.</p>

<p>As for the second question, while it&#39;s possible, it just seems so.... random. Surely during Obama&#39;s &#39;partying gay orgy drug filled days&#39; there&#39;s be plenty of people who&#39;d remember, and killing the guy who wasn&#39;t interested in spilling the beans just feels so... random. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me clarify real quick that this is not <em>my</em> theory. It is Larry&#39;s theory and the consensus he has come to, which I have been researching myself. I happen to agree more often than not, and either way this situation has stuck out to me since I first heard. But all I did was put together sources and throw it here to gauge feedback, and yep full of shills.</p>

<p>anyways the polygraph would be simple enough if Larry was willing to take another one. I&#39;m not in contact with him but I know he does interviews a lot. There are tons on YouTube and listening to how he speaks, his character, it doesn&#39;t seem like he would be against it. But I think the bigger connection should be that Obama may have been trying to hide the homosexual encounters before his presidency because he was afraid this would erupt into a scandal.</p>

<p>The belief is that Donald Young and Obama were in a homosexual relationship for a long time. This would have continued into 2006-2007 and he was married with children. Larry thinks Young wanted this information to come out, one way or another, so he was silenced. Larry already had a bad name so it wasn&#39;t difficult for the gov&#39;t to smear it and (possibly) rig a polygraph test. </p>

<p>Sadly I don&#39;t think this will be solved but the truth is that Donald Young is mysteriously dead. So if anything I just hope more people will look into it.</p>

<p>Since 2010! You have got to be kidding me. Why? Who cares who is or is not gay. I&#39;ll forget the fact that you&#39;ve come up absolutely nothing in just under two years of &quot;studying&quot; for now. Why bother looking to this at all?</p>

<p>How much time have you spent on this? 100 hours, 1000? If you spent only 30min a day you would still have put in over 350 hours. Think about how much better than time could have been spent. Instead saying &quot;I should pour countless hours into reading The Globe and random blog coverage the Obama is actually a gay man cover-up.&quot;</p>

<p>You could have said &quot;I should learn the piano&quot; or &quot;I should learn to play the banjo&quot; and instead posting this ridiculousness you could have posted a video of you playing foggy mountain breakdown to r/music. That would have been way better.</p>

<p>I have to believe that you&#39;re just exaggerating how much time you have actually spent on this. I just have a really hard to believing that the idea &quot;I should check out this Obama is actually gay cover-up&quot; would ever win out against any idea.</p>

<p>If you actually did spend this time, then I submit that next time your brain says &quot;dude, look into that Obama is gay thing again&quot; I want you to slap yourself, hard, right across the face. Then remind yourself that&#39;s a stupid idea and instead play the banjo, read a book, take a walk or basically do anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>k several logical questions.</p>

<p>WHy would obama send people who were actively protecting him to jail? If he can murder someone he can give a guy a phd I suspect. Obviously gangbangers murder people and can&#39;t give someone a phd, but obama is intricately connected with prestigious schools.</p>

<p>Why was larry trying to get obama to update his drug usage before trying to find evidence? That is a stupid move for larry. </p>

<p>The polygraph story sounds like a smear campaign. Donald young sounds like he was murdered for not paying his drug dealer.</p>

<p>There seems to be no evidence and a lot of conjecture.Dan parisi comes up as a guy associated with whitehouse.com, a porn site. None of this makes any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s definitely an element among us that simultaneously cultivates scandals and threatens exposure of them to use as political leverage.  If you look carefully you can see it in both political parties and among all important institutions.  For example look at the Karl Rove log-cabin contingent around Bush Jr, or the J Edgar Hoover - Clyde Tolson relationship at the FBI, or the Kay Griggs allegations about a sinister rainbow coalition in the US military, or some of the odd characters involved in the Kennedy assassination, or the problems of the Catholic church, or the Lawrence King Boy&#39;s Town scandal.  Everywhere you look there it is.  Follow aangirfan.blogspot.com for the latest news on this subject.  What if gays aren&#39;t all rainbows, unicorns, peace and love?  What if the political left in the USA isn&#39;t really liberal?  What if alt culture is actually the status quo?  What if reality is more complicated then TV sitcoms led us to believe?</p>
