        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, know I&#39;ll probably get bashed for posting a conspiracy about another date, but I can not help but to be interested in dates and numbers, especially those with so called Illuminati ties such as 13 and 33. I would like to start a thread linking as many ties to 3-22-13 date as possible. Yes 3-22 comes around year after year but because the year is 20“13” and because of conspiracies like The Dark Knight Rises. I feel it is reasonable to take a closer look. </p>

<p>Here is a link about Illuminati numbers and dates for those that may not be familiar. 
<a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/13_33_freemason_sig.htm">Illuminati Numbers &amp; Dates</a></p>

<p><strong>This is what I have found so far:</strong></p>

<p>322 - Skull and Bones</p>

<p>3-22-1980 - Georgia Guidestones erected</p>

<p>3-22-2013 - 33 years since Georgia Guidestones erected.</p>

<p>3-22-13 - Exactly 13 weeks from the procession of the equinoxes (Dec. 21, 2012). Procession of the equinoxes in The Apotheosis of Washington in the U.S. Capitol building represented by the 72 spheres (72 names of God?) making 360 degrees around the mural. Mural contains 13 maidens with 13 stars over there heads representing the 13 colonies.
<a href="http://apotheosisofwashington.com">Apotheosis of Washington</a></p>

<p>The Dark Knight Rises (Aurora and Sandy Hook references) also shows the numbers “322” in the football stadium.</p>

<p>Superbowl XLVII (47) Feb 3, 2013 - Power outage at 13:22, 47 days after Feb 3, 2013 = 3-22-2013</p>

<p>3-22-13 - Olympus Has Fallen to be released in theaters. 
    <a href="http://olympusmovie.com">Olympus Has Fallen</a></p>

<p>3-22-13 - 1260 days since Obama received Nobel Peace Prize on Oct 9, 2009. (Bible prophecy)
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg4vc_r0d90">Obama 1260</a></p>

<p><strong>Interesting things that have or will occur around this date:</strong></p>

<p>Pope Benedict XVI resigned bringing forth the prophesy of St. Malachy
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Popes">Malachy Prophecy</a></p>

<p>Obamacare Verichip to be implemented on 3-23-13 (cannot confirm)</p>

What matters not is if we believe in the numbers meaning anything. What matters so is that those societies repeat the numbers. We are looking for the reasons why.</p>

<p>If you are interested <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L777RhL_Fz4">here is a video</a> called &#39;Secrets in Plain Sight 1-23(Full video)&#39; which goes through the history of symbols and numbers used by certain societies and discusses sacred geometry. It is about 3 hours and 45 minutes long...so watch it in segments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t too off topic.
But to answer this hypothetical situation we&#39;re all talking about... One should take a look at the game Mage The Ascension. 
I say this because it offers a &quot;logical&quot; rebuttal to that statement,</p>

<p>&quot;if the occult is real and they can predict the future, then past/present/future events are predetermined and your life is rendered meaningless as you are not and never were in control.&quot;</p>

<p>It does this by suggesting that all forms of will, no matter how insignificant have influence over the world they live in. For &quot;mages&quot; their practice of will working is based around a paradigm of magick. For purposes of this conversation if magick were real than our individual will manipulates our own life. It is when people lack willpower that they succumb to being puppets of someone&#39;s preordained illuminate future.</p>

<p>I hope this doesn&#39;t sound like too crazy of a rant.
I&#39;m just trying to offer you a light of plausibility...even for the sake of entertainment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, every variation of the phrasing is there for a reason - and the reason usually has to do with distinguishing between one aspect of the name of God from another. If you were to look up a particular appearance of the name of God (whether it was Jehovah, LORD God, Lord, God, Almighty, etc) you would see that there are meaningful reasons for the different English titles.</p>

<p>You can look these up (even without actually knowing Hebrew) in a reference work such as Strong&#39;s Concordance, or simply read some commentaries on the subject. There are many resources to learn about this, and its a subject that has been written about extensively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because the original texts used a name instead of just &quot;God&quot;. The name was later censored out because someone decided it was blasphemy to utter the name of God. This is why you get weird phrases like &quot;The Lord God&quot; where it should be &quot;The Lord &lt;Name&gt;&quot; which makes much more sense logically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;important&quot; part of the verse in this context is &quot;the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil&quot;. It relates to the promise of the serpent in Genesis 3:5 that Eve and Adam &quot;shall be as gods, knowing good and evil&quot;.</p>

<p>To this day, the promise of various religions, the new age movement, and many forms of spirituality (non-Christian, of course) is to <em>become a god</em>, to discover the god within you, or even to gain eternal life via technology (as in various &quot;transhumanist&quot; ideas).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go back to the very name <strong>Illuminati</strong>. It refers to being illuminated or enlightened. The belief is that Lucifer, of course, gives the light - no the creator of the universe. They believe that the light is appropriated from God, by the &quot;god of this world&quot;, and given to mankind in an act of rebellious benevolence toward man.</p>

OP is predicting anything to happen though...from what understand is just stating that it&#39;s rather odd to see all these 33s and 322s, and such. And the way in which they correlate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes no sense, though. You&#39;re claiming that all Americans will be required to be implanted with an RFID chip by (or even starting that day). First off, the act creating the TSA passed two months later, so people were actually very supportive of its creation at the time. Secondly, the TSA patrols airports, which are far easier to do that what you claim Obamacare will do.</p>

<p>Hell, we can&#39;t even get same people to take life-saving vaccines, let alone do something like microchip tagging.</p>

<p>Same stuff as the 11:11 phenomenon.

<p>you literately have no evidence to support your claim. you have had multiple opportunities to present it to us and you have chosen not to. so you either have no evidence at all, or your evidence is entirely subjective to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no. you do not have any evidence to make this a theory. a theory is something which is observable, testable, and replicable by everyone. i will refer to no such link. listen to yourself. you sound like a christian telling an atheist to <em>read the bible harder.</em></p>

<p>im not looking for proof of these theories because, even if it were true, it would still have no real world effect on reality. im merely waiting for you people to back up your claims with legitimate sources. and im waitng for you people to stop using the word &quot;they&quot; and start naming names. </p>

<p>i find it shocking that any of you would have the audacity to claim you know something about people you cant even be sure exist. its comical, tbh. if you can explain to me the difference between these claims and religious claims, ill drop it and leave this sub forever.</p>

<p>this doesnt make any sense. if it doesnt matter what you believe about numbers, then the other half of that sentence is rendered null because you literately have no tangible evidence to support your claim. its a faith-based claim, and nothing more. dont act as if its a fact simply because youre in this sub. it does not differ from religious claims <em>in any way</em>. its fucking insane that you people think particular numbers have some sort of mystical properties as if mathematics is some sort of witchcraft or voodoo. if you have ANY evidence at all, then fucking present it. what op posted is not evidence of anything except his paranoid delusions that catastrophic events can be expected to occur on any date consisting primarily of 1&#39;s 2&#39;s and 3&#39;s. this stands to be literately the most retarded thing ive ever debated in this sub.</p>

<p><strong><em>total bullshit.</em></strong> in what manner do numbers predict the future? im dying to know, but none of you can tell me. all you can do is call upon tragedies or suspisious activity that occurs on dates consisting of these particular numbers. there is nothing spiritual or mystical about mathematics. that idea holds no foundation in reality what-so-ever. it is wishful thinking, at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>um, no. if anyone makes a prediction into the future, there is always a 0-99.999% chance of certainty of that prediction occurring.  maybe you think predictions are made by others with 100% certainty, but they rarely are, they are all assessments based on probability of occurance. you make a prediction based on how certain you are, and because you can never be 100% certain does not mean you can never predict the future correctly, it only means you never can with 100% certainty. </p>

<p>So no, predicting the future does not mean you know exactly how something is going to happen.  it means you have assessed your known possibilities, and chosen one with a certain percentage of probability.  This is how i know i will go to sleep tonight and wake up tomorrow. the odds favor it, and i have enough understanding of my own behavior to know the odds are slim to none i wont get to the point of going to sleep and waking up. </p>

<p>thats actually the exact opposite of what ive been saying this whole time. there is a significant difference between having a 3rd eye on future events and making an educated guess as to what <em>might</em> happen.</p>

<p>they never are.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>sure, but its not seeing into the future. its making an <em>assessment.</em></p>

<p>if you are not 100% sure of the future, then you are not seeing into the future. you would simply be making an educated guess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the odds favor it</p>

<p>sure, but there is still a chance. which makes your statement an educated guess and not foreknowledge of the future.</p>

<p>thanks captain obvious, but both are predictions if my educated guess is correct.  get over it. one can test an educated guess to be right or wrong and if its right, it falls under the definition of a prediction. voila.</p>

<p>you keep making the leap that i seem to think predicting is &quot;seeing into the future&quot; or something like that.  you might want to understand what a prediction is first, because thats not it. &quot;foreknowledge of the future&quot; would be premonition, or precognition, not prediction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>first of all</em> you literately have zero tangible objective evidence for the existence of an <em>illuminati.</em> so for you to make ANY assertions as fact regarding this topic is entirely unfounded. for all you know, the people you refer to as illuminati are merely individuals that share common goals but arent necessarily affiliated with each other or any religion. what we see may very well be simply the product of greed, and nothing more. i mean, do the <em>illuminati</em> even realize theyre the <em>illuminati</em>? all this shit about illuminati rituals and religious beliefs is nonsense and really has no correlation with reality at all. i challenge you to spot the different between the <em>illuminati religion</em> and any other religion. i garauntee there is not and never will be a <em>religious ritual</em> that can exert any kind of real world mystical effect. it is nonsense; purely superstition. </p>

<p>russels teapot. flying spaghetti monster. <em>case closed.</em></p>

<p>if something cannot be demonstrated to be true, then it is a leap of faith and a logical fallacy for you to assume it is true.</p>

<p>you seem like an idiot. be smarter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>views that have deeply and directly lead to what they do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is complete nonsense. you dont even know if these people <em>actually</em> exist, let alone what their religious views are. this exchange of ours is borderlining comical. you cant name names. you cant name a religion. you are talking out of your ass.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>yes i fucking can! so what if these people claim to have worshipped <em>satan?</em> it doesnt change a thing. they could be worshipping juju the mountain king, it simply doesnt matter what a person believes. there is no such thing as magic. </p>

<p><em>there is no such thing as magic.</em></p>

<p>am i in <a href="/r/debatereligion">/r/debatereligion</a>? what the fuck is wrong with you people? </p>

<p><strong><em>SATAN WORSHIPERS, OH MY!</em></strong> <em>hide your kids, hide your wife!</em></p>

<p>so what if a person worships an evil figure. its no skin off my back. go ahead. anyone who worships satan, place a curse on my ass. make a god damned voodoo doll of me, i dont care. do whatever you can to prove me wrong, i fucking challenge you. i DARE anyone. this is so incredibly insane. </p>

<p>what impact does worshiping satan have on reality that any other religion does not? can any of you tell me?</p>

<p>there is a significant difference between having a 3rd eye on future events and making an educated guess as to what might happen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>thanks captain obvious, but both are predictions if my educated guess is correct.  get over it. one can test an educated guess to be right or wrong and if its right, it falls under the definition of a prediction. voila.</p>

<p>you keep making the leap that i seem to think predicting is &quot;seeing into the future&quot; or something like that.  you might want to understand what a prediction is first, because thats not it. &quot;foreknowledge of the future&quot; would be premonition, or precognition, not prediction.</p>
