       I work for a contracting company that does work for a multinational laser production company.  They produce a laser for the US govt, so powerful it can easily cut a tank in half..  ..from space.  If someone can find some verifying info, that would be great.  But I talk with researchers daily who confirm this.  And as you probably already imagine, it's up there already.  "Prepare to be assimilated."

       a fackin scientist, guy.  I am however enjoying the technical conversation and feasibility aspect of weaponized satellites. 
There are rooms and areas at the facility which have high levels of security, with a short list of scientists who may enter.  I hear, large contributions from our govt funds much of these R&amp;D areas.  I really wish I knew more/could share more.

       I stroll through clean rooms surrounded by hundreds of suited up little workers(clean suits, masks, nets, booties, ect) and I can't help but occasionally sing

       Don't get it confused.  We are primitive nothings compared to any off world civilization that has mastered interstellar flight.  If Earth humans are stupid enough to "unleash all they've got against something...not of this earth", that "something not of this earth" will likely be so much more advanced than we that they will incinerate us in short order if they were so inclined.

       they might be so advanced that they think they're invincible. or they may have evolved away from violence, as surely any advanced civilization must. force fields could be a problem for many of our toys but fortunately the US armed forces are sick enough to have something to kill you in a 100 different ways, sound/light/poison/chem/bio/dna/microwave/nuke/neutron/emp/robots/drones... ok i'm out.

       No.  They'll be so advanced that they'll understand that 1) as part of The All which created and indeed
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the universe itself, they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed invincible - as are you, as am I, as are we all.  However, 2) they will also understand that as individual, physical manifestations of The All, they
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       invincible.  Non the less, I also wouldn't doubt that they will still have sufficiently advanced technology for them to
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       "invincible" to our puny minds - even though they themselves will in all likelihood understand very much that they are not, and would not take their ephemerality for granted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to the average lifespan of a Mayfly, human beings live for eons.  Even with that, however, human beings aren't stupid enough to think that we are (physically) invincible.

      <p>
       Yes sir.  This is very possibly more like it.  After all, just think about humanity.  In order for the human species to live for billions of years, it will have to master coexistence - something we haven't been very good at yet.  We won't be able to live for very long as a species without developing greatly in the way of peace and effective communication, etc.  It would seem that any advanced civilization that is sufficiently old likely GOT that old by mastering cooperation and peaceful living.

       while i don't believe in space laz0rs (the amount of energy required to power something like that would require a huge solar panel array or nuclear reactor that any amateur astronomer looking through a potato could easiliy see), i used to work for a defense contractor and definitely got to see some cool technologies that are 'on the cusp'
      </p>
      <p>
       i wouldn't be surprised if the NSA and/or some of the other alphabet agencies have quantum computers. which means they are able to crunch a lot data they collect through ECHELON (and possibly even crack 'secure' encryption standards)

       "wouldn't be surprised?" It's not really even a secret anymore. The NSA ordered a 512-qubit computer for their Utah Data Centre and there are big things coming from the Burnaby, BC based company on the forefront of quantum computing research, D-Wave.

       Is it possible that the energy produced by the HAARP satellite can be directed and create the energy needed to power a device like this? I thought the array can direct gigawatts of power into the ionosphere. Is it possible to redirect that power to be received by an armed device/satellite or am I just thinking like a deductive fanatic?

       I think that is one of the X37B's primary roles. A lot more cost effective to have one or two laser armed airframes that can launch from Kennedy or Vandenburg on a few hours notice instead of the dozens of satellites needed for constant or near constant coverage over problem areas. What is the current most powerful mobile laser type known at the moment?

       Completely true.  I've been working here for over 6 years, and in that time, laser modules have shrank and become much more efficient/powerful.  At an alarming rate as well.  For example; A clean room will be needed, designed, engineered, and built, but by the time of completion, the process and needs of researchers will have changed completely.  Constant advancements and breakthroughs... It seems like a great career path for some up-and-coming geniuses.

       I'm a former USMC 'escort' who worked at Aberdeen Proving Grounds. Saw all kinds of DEWRAD stuff scareier than lasers. I'm no engineer nowadays but I am a scientist...and lasers are one of the less worrisome development thrusts the government was engaged in.

       there was a paper a while back about making lasers up to 1,000x more intense than those using a similar power input.  This is probably just a most obvious application of that.

A laser platform would likely depend on the same things your average surveillance satellite does, namely ideal 'windows' for attacking. Perfect timing, atmospheric conditions, and target placement, in order to properly aim the beam. Before the tank or whatever is cut in half and exploding, the satellite has moved too far away to keep the beam on-target, due to it's own speed/inertia as it orbits the Earth. Lasers can be countered pretty easily by reflective materials, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just can't see it being practical from space yet. The target moves 5 feet and there goes your kill until the satellite can try for another pass on the next orbit or two.

       Deployed on planes, sure, but we're a long ways away from having our orbital Death Ray.

       I think that smart bullets are the way to go. They'll pass through walls, and detonate when within lethal range of the target. It's a proven techology too.

       Quite a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Per my understanding, beam dispersion gets wider in proportion to the distance involved and is compounded by atmospheric elements such as water vapor and whatnot. Meaning that cutting a tank in half from space is really not that easy to do. Power requirements rise in proportion to the targets distance as well, in order to compensate for beam dispersion.
      </p>
      <p>
       An orbital or atmospheric target such as a satellite or ICBM would require much less power to disrupt or destroy than a ground-based target.

       I think I remember something like that on the Air Force's ABL project. Not cutting a channel as much as using an array of laser sensors to compensate for atmospheric distortion.
Range of that particular system was "In the hundreds of kilometers". Coming from above the atmosphere in orbit- lets say 350-450 miles, you only have 11 miles of troposphere, which accounts for 80% of the atmosphere's mass and 99% of its water vapor.

       It's true, can really give you a source, my father worked for the Russian government and did exactly this. He worked with lasers, but he specialized more on testing to see how shooting a laser at a random substance had any kind of reaction or effect. His work was highly top secret, and we were lucky to actually be able to leave, but going back to the laser thing.....he saw lasers that they were planning to send to space. He used them for testing, and so he is an eye witness. Sorry it isn't that credible but as one redditer

       Whilst no doubt there are lasers out there that can theoretically cut tanks in half, the amount of power you'd need doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that the thing would be huge, would only be able to hit it's target a small portion of the day, and be highly unlikely to hit anything due to the fact that the earth and everything attached to it is spinning... honestly this entire idea makes me giggle.

       Nope, I just have common sense and can research shit. Although I suppose "doesn't exist within human control' is a little closer (Obviously the amount of energy needed does exist).

       Yea, that is 500 Terrawatts, or several thousand times the amount of power the entire united state uses in a year. Every second. There's a reason it's only fired for petaseconds at a time.
      </p>

       Either this secret government of evil has managed to find a power source that makes the laws of physics its bitch, or this laser doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       And having said that, if this is true, while I have to give "evil &amp; co" points for 'style' (Who doesn't like big lasers) surely they wouldn't need a laser in the first place. Heck they could just take this amazing power source, sell it to the rest of the world, and become the biggest economic superpower that controls everyone electricity, a weapon that would be far more deadly than a super laser.

       Please be aware that the laser you are describing fires for 1/10,000 of a second. The total amount of energy emitted in that time period is 50GJ, which according to Wolfram Alpha, is equivalent to the yearly energy usage of a commercial dryer:

       There are several reasons a laser like that fires such a short pulse, not least of which is heat dissipation. However, since power is energy/time, you can increase the power output by lowering the time value. Thats why pulsed lasers have such high power outputs.

       A laser like that COULD cut a tank in half from outside space, however the energy requirements to turn it on for long enough makes it impossible to work on as a weapon.

       I know quite a few people in military and anything that is on the internet or in public view is old and outdated, which is confirmed more than enough. So, your wikipedia means shit when it comes to what they have that we can't see. Very rarely do we get a glimpse of technology that has been conceived in the past year or so by them.

       However with all this secret technology the laws of physics still need to abided by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning if you want a laser that outputs 500 tw, you need to find a way to add 500 tw to the machine. (well... more than that, due to the second law of thermodynamics.)
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, if the 'secret government of evil' has managed to make something that disregards the laws of physics, I can think of a million better ways to use it than a giant space laser.

       Again we can only perceive what we know and what we have been taught. A power source has most likely been made that is about the size of a basketball and can power a city but technology like that wouldn't bring any money so...yeah. again its all the speculation you can have but there's no telling what research they have had in the past 20 years that we havent even heard about. Laws of physics abiding of course but who knows. Maybe some day the civilians will be let in on the machines that will keep the world hostage.

       Throwing the math out there, at each power plant having a output of 1500 MW (about 300 MW higher than most power plants) you'd need 333333 of these strapped together to fire the laser listed above.

       GPS works by using a network of around 13 satellites that all broadcast their current position (In laymans terms). Your GPS picks up these different signals and works out your position based on the power of each individual signal. The idea that GPS works by tracking you individually like a laser would need to is laughable.

       there's no way to counter atmospheric particulate effect on beam collimation. there will always be degradation, but laser output has been growing tremendously as the size of the package decreases.

       I know quite a few people in military and anything that is on the internet or in public view is old and outdated, which is confirmed more than enough. So, your wikipedia means shit when it comes to what they have that we can't see. Very rarely do we get a glimpse of technology that has been conceived in the past year or so by them.

       I think that smart bullets are the way to go. They'll pass through walls, and detonate when within lethal range of the target. It's a proven techology too.
