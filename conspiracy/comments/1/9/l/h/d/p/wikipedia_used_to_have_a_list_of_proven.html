<p>what reason is there to delete the list if you&#39;re really trying to be the most extensive encyclopedia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not their goal, actually, and it infuriates me to no end. Wikipedia regularly deletes extremely useful and/or informative articles because they don&#39;t meet their standards of notability or if they&#39;re not &quot;encyclopedic&quot; enough. This latter standard is likely what caused the article to be deleted. Yes, they are judging articles based on whether or not they would included in a real, paper encyclopedia.  No, they don&#39;t realize why that&#39;s an insane requirement to have for a website whose capacity absolutely dwarfs that of a set of books.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is a horribly run place. Please don&#39;t get upset about their decisions. Few of them make any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The major argument seems to have been that the list was biased toward a certain perspective, and biased against post WW2 America. Both of which are pretty weak arguments to delete, seems a rewrite and perhaps splitting it into multiple pages could have solved every one of those issues. Deleting it for those reasons is at the very least lazy, and at worst could easily be seen as a deliberate attempt to keep dissenting information out of the official record.</p>

<p>And that is <em>EXACTLY</em> why those choices are NOT included in the historical record.  TPTB <em>don&#39;t</em> actually want the people to be aware and learn from the past anomalies and crimes that occurred which led to the control they&#39;ve ultimately taken.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is controlled by those same forces that ultimately wish to skew the public narrative AWAY from universal independence, power, and liberty.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t WANT you and me and us aware.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why while you may want to look back at those poor choices so as not to repeat them, TPTB <em>want</em> you to repeat them - over and over again - so that they can remain in power at our expense and keep you/me/us enslaved.</p>

<p>Sounds harsh, but it definitely seems unfortunately true.</p>

<p>...so what they&#39;re doing is not gross at all actually.  It&#39;s calculated in an extremely intelligent though malicious and nefarious manner.</p>
