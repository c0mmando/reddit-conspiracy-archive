      </p>
      <p>
       It's a damn shame that we as a people are doing really nothing about his having been incarcerated as he has been.  The fact of the matter is that he has helped more than most in
       <em>
        quantitatively
       </em>
       exposing the corruption and lies of TPTB in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it looks like prosecutors are trying to sentence him to death as a result.

       Yeah.  Unfortunately that sounds about it.  In one sense, I am besides-myself incensed at this complete travesty of justice and at the extent to which we as a public aren't doing shit about it.  We're just taking it up the ass like good sheep and trudging about our miserable lives like any other day.
      </p>
      <p>
       In another sense, I realize that that miserable public is
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       , as I feel I'm no different than anyone else - and if we're not doing anything, it's also because
       <em>
        I'm
       </em>
       not doing anything either, so I'm just as much of a stupid sheep as the next person.

       Pollard is a Sayanim.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a Sayanim?  Well, the main hub of Wikipedia - the English language version that is accessed by most and happens to be run by Zionists - scratched the entry "Sayanim" from its files.  The reason for this gets made apparent when you find out just what exactly a Sayanim is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, I found "Sayanim" on
       <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayanim">
        a French version of Wikipedia
       </a>
       , and then simply passed the text through Google translate to get
       <a href="http://postimage.org/image/6r24dj311/full/">
        this
       </a>
       .

       Pollard is a Sayanim living in a Zionist-controlled country.  Of course he's going to get released.  The one person who's threatened to really expose their biggest false flag attack to date, however?  They're going to make sure he gets executed.

       Of course, they are going to kill him. He made them look bad. We are living in Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia. The only differences are that they have modern technology to rule over us with, and better knowledge of what works and how to apply it. We are fucked.

       And modern law, represented by his defense attorney, is what has gotten him out of the torture periods at the beginning of his prison stay, and hopefully  will ensure that he won't be executed. It's the State and it's prosecutors that are against him; while admittedly a mockery of actual civilian justice, it's still better than being buried up to your head and stoned to death, which is what the legal system representing a third of the world would do (Sharia, and honestly I'm just guessing that punishment though that sounds in line). Hopefully, he will have some semblance of a day in court. The more hubub is created about it, the better chance he will have. Don't discount the fact our legal system grants an attorney to the accused, and presumes his innocence before guilt, it matters. Easy to be cynical, and his situation is unique, but I'm sure his attorney is doing his job: zealously advocating for his client.

       Modern law should have prevented him from even being
       <em>
        in there

       to begin with.  And I'm not sure if you know this or not, but Bradley Manning WASN'T "gotten out of the torture periods at the beginning of his prison stay".
      </p>
      <p>
       His defense team may have
       <em>
        shortened
       </em>
       that time, but don't imply that he was not living and existing under legitimately torturous conditions for an
       <em>
        extended
       </em>
       period of time before any defense team got him out.

      <p>
       I don't think that's actually a good example and analogy because stoning to death those entities responsible for corrupting this country I for one wouldn't say is all that bad a thing.  I country that would advocate that I could get 100% behind.

       It matters in theory.  In practice? the state has all the most powerful lawyers they can get, and Manning's odds are

        what you previously stated

       <em>
        definitely

      <p>
       I am old and tired too.  There are many ways to fight, however, and one need not be able to sprint like a deer or fight like a lion to be worthy of forwarding the resistance.  I don't pretend to be doing a lot, but heck, even our writing in this very website here and at least sowing the juices of our discontent is a method that prevents the setting in of an apathy that leads to
       <em>
        total
       </em>
       inaction.  What we're doing here is a form of fighting just by spreading ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, it is
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       in your being old that you have a marked advantage over the young and impressionable masses that are often drafted into military service or go willingly on their own.  As George Bernard Shaw said, "Youth is wasted on the young."  It is the wisdom of age that has the best ability to
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       how and when to fight - even if it may be somewhat lacking in the physical ability to execute the act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those physical limitations are okay, however, for in the end of the day, the best fighters aren't so much the ones that fight hard as much as it is the ones that fight
       <em>
        smart
       </em>
       .

       If we stand up, they will beat us down. The only way out would be a situation where the police and the military did not follow orders. They are trained to follow orders. It would take a major jump to make it happen.

       Yes sir it is indeed.  We're lazy and spoiled, but we've been indoctrinated and

       1) Not if we

       Oh well yeah.  Certainly.  When you said "If we stand up", I was assuming some of that "we" would be at least
       <em>
        part
       </em>
       of the police and military.  As I've said before, I think once the police and members of the armed forces realize that it will be their own mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives that they will be having to incarcerate and put in camps, they might simply not do it.

       But most all of them are raising and have been raised by people they love who they
       <em>
        don't

       want to hurt or injure.  If things got to
       <em>
        that

       level of resistance and opposition where the people they'd have to fight would be their own family, I think that even the most brainwashed, indoctrinated police person and soldier would think twice.

       One thing that they have been doing is to bring in troops/guardsmen from outside the area, so that they do not emphasize with or even understand the locals. They bring Southerners to the North and visa-versa, country boys to the city etc. It heightens the gap between the police/military and the people. It makes it easier to use violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to be negative, but I do want to be realistic/rational. When it comes down to it, the police/military will always side with their own. That is their mindset and their training and their paycheck. I do not hold out great hope for the future...

       It's easy, man.  It happens because we as a fucking populace are SCARED.  We don't want to revolt.

We're scared of having to fight for our freedoms even as those freedoms are being taken away chunk by fucking chunk by an elite that is just laughing at us all the way and strangling us with legal minutia and red tape that we should be able to just BREAK THROUGH, but that we don't because we're barely more than scared little sheep.

It wasn't like I tried too hard or at all to go out and look for him, but I'll say this:  If not for Reddit, I might not have known a single thing about what was going on, as I don't read the news papers, I don't watch television, and there seemed to be literally

       Awesome.  Godspeed, sir.  Make sure and get ready and realize, however, that a lot of the asshole cops didn't
       <em>
        start off
       </em>
       that way.  Some of them started off as very good people with great morals and aspirations...but the
       <em>
        job
       </em>
       and what it involves often saps the life and human decency out of you.  As such, it's not so much the individual cops that are just assholes all the time as much as it is the
       <em>
        industry
       </em>
       of law enforcement in general that kills the spirit and causes many to
       <em>
        turn
       </em>
       into jaded assholes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never been a cop, but I used to be a bouncer in Hollywood nightclubs for a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       long time (around a decade) and let me tell you, the things that I saw, went through, and had to do - and the types of people that I regularly had to deal with - really bred a level of deep, deep antagonism in me while I was in that environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people that saw me there while I was at work would
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       have known that I'm actually a
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       nice guy because even
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       environment is generally so filled with unlawfulness that you as a bouncer have to constantly be on point, very guarded, and ready for the worst in people (which happened regularly enough)...and that was just a frickin' Hollywood nightclub.  Being a police officer I'm sure is
       <em>
        maaaany
       </em>
       times worse and more intense.

       I totally agree. And I've already thought about all of that. I realize that there's going to be times (many) that I'm going to have to do some shit I don't like to do and I wouldn't normally do. The bouncer thing is a great example as a good friend of mine who is seriously the nicest person I've ever met in my entire life was a bouncer too, and sometimes he had to be a douche. But I have a way of getting to people and I'm very strong willed when it comes to helping others.

       yeah there's no way he can be let out alive now. he'd be interviewed on every major network, they couldn't avoid him speaking out. best to kill him as quietly as possible. has he even been allowed to make any public statements?

       I know I might just be blowing hot air when I say this, as I don't envision myself being any sort of "one man army" or anything, but God dammit this is STRAIGHT UP FUCKING CORRUPTION of the worst, most obvious kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember I used to be intensely aware of corruption and enslavement when I was a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       , very young child.  I don't know where exactly this awareness came from - past life experience, perhaps? I don't know - but I know that I used to think that if I was
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       shown any type of OBVIOUS corruption and enslavement like
       <em>
        in front of my very face
       </em>
       , I would simply fight, fight, and fight against it and wouldn't have a worry about what would happen to me.  Come hell or high water.  The possibility of being murdered was very little deterrent, as I absolutely felt that right is simply RIGHT, and if I ever saw in front of my face
       <em>
        obvious corruption
       </em>
       killing, enslaving, and imprisoning people, I would fight 100% against that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here I fucking am seeing this shit right in front of my face, and the best I can do is type angry, flatulent, impotent words on a computer screen in a fucking anonymous website with a fucking teletubby-looking alien as a mascot.

       Bradley Manning is one martyr that does not have to be, but who, unfortunately, might very well still end up being as we just sit there and either watch without saying anything or, more likely, simply try to ignore what's happening (as we have been) and pretend it's not there and hope it just goes away.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's part of the reason why this story really isn't bigger than it is.  It's because so many of us are fucking SCARED of what directly addressing what's happening to him really means in terms of what exactly is going on in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's a way for most people to really stop and take a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       look at what's happening to Bradley Manning without having to come face to fucking face with the fact that
       <em>
        there is a man that is likely going to be killed by the state because he stood up and tried to expose the evil that that state did to us and is STILL doing to us as we speak.

       Yeah that definetly hits the nail on the head. I really think that sums up not just the manning case but the whole 'god forbid anyone ever has logical, meaningful discussions' stigma in this country. 
You have to admit theres a problem to go searching for a solution, and feel the pain of the problem whilst searching. Deny/hide from problem=no searching therefore no pain...its the easy way out, and easy is in style

       No.  That's a popular misconception.  I see what you're saying, but that's actually not right because we always,
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       have to pay the piper sooner or later.  Waiting and denying and being irresponsible and not facing the facts does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       actually cause no pain.  It simply prolongs the problems that DO have to inevitably be faced and, thereby, makes it worse when we have no choice but to really deal with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get ready for a horrible analogy here, but it applies, so here goes:
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel you have to go to the restroom to do number two, then it
       <em>
        behooves
       </em>
       you to make that happen as absolutely soon as you possibly can.  Waiting and putting it off or pretending it's not there is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       going to make it go away.  Matter of fact, if you wait too long, you will get constipated and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       you'll have much worse and more complicated problems to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that are playing the denial game are just letting the turd that is TPTB's manipulation build up more and more.  This entire country's already got hemorrhoids from it, and pretty soon our entire intestinal system is going to tear apart because we're not going to the restroom and shitting these fuckers out like we need to.

       That, unfortunately, seems like that's exactly what might happen.  It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       enough to make you throw up your hands and just say "fuck it" and let TPTB fuck us all to pieces.  Sometimes I think to myself that I really want TPTB to really take over and enslave everyone here by force and institute an aggressive fascist government that takes entire groups of people and executes them...

        JUST
       </em>
       so I can be the one prisoner in the gulag that tells all the other sheep "See!?  I

       you this was exactly what was going to happen, you stupid motherfuckers!  Ha!" lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       That wouldn't be all that worthy of a last laugh to get, however, so I think it's better to still at least
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to spread the word and actually
       <em>
        do

       something about what's going on.

       Pollard is a Sayanim.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a Sayanim?  Well, the main hub of Wikipedia - the English language version that is accessed by most and happens to be run by Zionists - scratched the entry "Sayanim" from its files.  The reason for this gets made apparent when you find out just what exactly a Sayanim is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, I found "Sayanim" on
       <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayanim">
        a French version of Wikipedia
       </a>
       , and then simply passed the text through Google translate to get
       <a href="http://postimage.org/image/6r24dj311/full/">

       Pollard is a Sayanim living in a Zionist-controlled country.  Of course he's going to get released.  The one person who's threatened to really expose their biggest false flag attack to date, however?  They're going to make sure he gets executed.
