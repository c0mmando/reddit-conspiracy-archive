Over the course of the last few weeks though every time I make the effort to check it out and comment on stuff I get this rage that builds up inside me. </p>

<p>This rage I speak of comes from this overwhelming aura of ignorance and propaganda. Everything is &quot;no no (insert <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2418223/posts">crappy news station</a>) is the best, they&#39;re clearly unbiased&quot;, &quot; Figures you would say that you&#39;re just a (insert political <a href="http://phrontistery.info/isms.html">ism</a>)&quot;. or discussion about how Obama inherited this mess and can&#39;t do any wrong. </p>

<p>Any talk about Obama gets down voted, real issues get ignored, and people over there are just generally rude. I&#39;m sorry for the rant but it irks me to see so many people still fooled by the left-right name calling paradigm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If r/politics was rational, there would be no need for r/conspiracy. I think you are voicing a frustration that many of us feel. This faceless social media interaction is not helping our movement like it should be... it feels controlled. </p>

<p>I think our biggest mistake (collectively) is assuming that the world is a fair place and social platforms are not manipulated. The control is everywhere and misinformation is everywhere.</p>

<p>Thanks for being pissed off though - it is always good to hear that I&#39;m not alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atheism is the saddest type of religion. absolutely nothing to look up too. With the incredibly unfathomable creation of every little thing, how can you not believe in &quot;something&quot;. I mean a first principle. A thought. and then BIG BANG. Creation at its most beautiful moment! I don&#39;t really believe in religion either, but I think that some things cannot, and will not, ever be explained by science alone. Both religion (or spiritual [My preference) and science both mutual explore to seek the truth. they just have different methods of doing so! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think by spirituality you mean philosophy. Philosophy is in its nature full of bias. While I understand your idea: that it may be naive to think that science will solve all the great mysteries of the universe...it may be even more naive to believe that it will not. Scientific rigor is young and has truth as its goal...unlike spirituality which will just makes you feel warm and fuzzy and is self-limiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is spirituality self limiting?  Gandhi had a lot of faith and it gave him the strength to take on the British Government. MLK Jr. Was given that strength in America. In fact many have a great deal of unwavering strength and courage when they believe they are on the same side as the will of God. Whether God is real or just an untapped magnificent wellspring of potential caused by the placebo effect, spirituality has been the opposite of self limiting for billions.</p>

<p>If by self limiting, you&#39;re referring to the paradigm one must box oneself into to subscribe to a specific religious dogma, I tend to agree. </p>

<p>If by self limiting, you&#39;re referring to giving up various modes of distraction such as cigarette smoking, compulsive gambling and unbridled selfishness manifested in myriad ways, then I disagree, as every vice that is given up in the search for Truth is but a chain of bondage broken. When one quits smoking, they&#39;re given freedom from the slavery to nicotine as their master. The same could be applied to many &quot;vices&quot; one feels compulsively compelled to do. </p>

<p>When one gives up the limiting beliefs of reliance on external transitory sensations for comfort and journeys inward all kinds of self empowerment can unfold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sucks. There really is no place for real talk anymore.  People would nuch rather reada story from a source instead of looking at the source of the facts youself.</p>

<p>My favourite is the atheist circlejerks.  Im not religeous but thats always their first attack, liken our veiws to faith.
Its not ok for the bible to prove itself right, yet somehow the FDA being run by someone who has a large stake in monsanto is different??</p>

<p>I took the atheist sub off my main page first thing when I got here. I understand where they&#39;re coming from, I get it, but the endless snarky comments and pictures of face book arguments are annoying to me.</p>

<p>I wanted Reddit to be more I guess and I&#39;m kinda disappointed. It seems like you only have a few pockets of real discussion tucked away in various sub reddits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, reddit already is more.  It is capable of what we want.</p>

<p>The problem is human ego, most people have an aversion to anything that goes against their opinions or what they &quot;knew first&quot;
A lack of any effort is very present in MOST of us as well.  Why figure out whats going on when you can just be TOLD right?</p>

<p>I find the best way to wake someone up is slowley.  Subtley show hem where their veiws are flawed without attacking their ego.  It doesn&#39;t take any longer then yelling at them for months.  Make your own groups to discuss things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s two problems I see with that.</p>

<p>The one I think you&#39;re more likely to agree with is that &quot;the left&quot; doesn&#39;t generally have any more trust in the FDA, and especially not Monsanto, than &quot;the right&quot;. You&#39;ll see Monsanto frequently criticised in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and indeed, everywhere on Reddit.</p>

<p>The second, which I think you&#39;re less likely to agree with, is that the FDA hiring <em>one guy</em>, even to a high up position from Monsanto does not mean Monsanto are running the whole administration by any means. You don&#39;t even know if he&#39;s loyal to Monsanto. You might even argue who better for the job than an inside man who knows the tricks of the trade. In fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_R._Taylor#USDA">according to Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anti-biotechnology activist Jeremy Rifkin made charges in February, 1994 that Taylor had a conflict of interest with respect to the approval of rBST.[13] The FDA replied with a memo indicating that Taylor had recused himself from all but the final stages of the review.[13] The Washington Post reported that: &quot;On March 15, FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler sent Rifkin a four-page letter stating that &#39;none of the activities of Mr. Taylor cited in your petition were in violation of any applicable law or regulation, or were otherwise inappropriate... . I believe that Mr. Taylor&#39;s behavior adhered to all applicable ethical standards.&#39; Kessler said that Taylor had not been &#39;intimately&#39; involved in Monsanto&#39;s efforts to obtain approval, as Rifkin charged, and that he was involved in the FDA&#39;s bST policy only in the final stages of review. Kessler attached a nine-page memo by FDA ethics official Jack M. Kress supporting that position. Upon arriving at the FDA in the summer of 1991, Taylor recused himself for one year from taking part in any agency action dealing directly with Monsanto or any other King and Spalding clients.&quot;[13] It also reported that &quot;Some longtime agency critics found the charges against Taylor misplaced. Sidney Wolfe, a physician who heads the Public Citizen Health Research Group here, has filed complaints with the FDA about revolving-door ethics issues concerning other officials. But he said yesterday that &#39;It&#39;s barking up a silly kind of tree to be going up against Mike Taylor.&#39; Wolfe said that &#39;as far as we&#39;re concerned, he&#39;s done a perfectly good job.&#39; Wolfe compared Rifkin&#39;s charges to saying that anyone who worked for a drug company and began working for the FDA should not be allowed to say anything about drugs in general -- a stance that Wolfe characterized as &#39;preposterous.&#39;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 1996 and 2000, after briefly returning to King &amp; Spalding, he then returned to Monsanto to become Vice President for Public Policy.[14]
In 1999, a lawsuit (Alliance For Bio-Integrity v. Shalala[15][16]) and GAO report revealed considerable disagreement within the FDA concerning decisions about biotechnology products made during Taylor&#39;s tenure there. The lawsuit and report also revealed that Mr. Taylor had recused himself from matters related to Monsanto’s BGH and had “never sought to influence the thrust or content” of the agency’s policies on Monsanto’s products.</p>

I was trying to attach it to the issue of politicians going into office, pushing for laws that help a certain company, then they are hired at said company, usually with a high paying position.</p>

<p>Monsanto and the FDA do the same thing.  When an outside source finds issues with GMO&#39;s everybody runs scurry to see what the FDA says about it.  What is the point of regulations?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it was totally different, especially prior to the mass Digg migration (Back when it was all Bacon &amp; Narwhals). You may have a dissenting view, but there were more debates than what you see today. Before it was a totally different site that allowed you to post anything you wanted and the subs weren&#39;t that big of a deal because everyone basicly used r/reddit.com.  After Digg moved over here, it started to changed quite a bit, it became more main stream and subreddits became a lot larger and more structured.  Then the moderation started and they killed r/reddit.com and that&#39;s when it was completed changed to what you see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/19b7zs/us_rep_keith_ellison_dmn_to_hannity_youre_a_shill/c8mjtpw">today</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure every major news station has a bias of some degree due to advertisers and special interests invested in the company. I myself don&#39;t watch much TV especially the evening &quot;news&quot;. News to me is people or organizations actually investigating issues, I don&#39;t want them to tell me something I want them to show me.</p>

<p>I get my news by looking at all frequencies of the spectrum, from mainstream articles to college/government studies to the craziest crackpot conspiracy sites. The trick is to take everything with a grain of salt and follow up with your own research into the situation, only then can you make an informed decision instead of being spoon fed stories which may or may not be entirely accurate.</p>

<p>I put more faith in joe blow blogger if he can link me to the government document or university study as opposed to the mainstream outlet that might only tell you something is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;ve realized the internet and the real world are the same. False political dichotomies force people to bicker and argue over issues, passing the buck as it were. All news networks are reporting the same thing they have been handed and told to repeat. Most of it has already been run through the MSM machine, stories tweaked for their political flavor based off the networks viewers. We squabble and fight over petty issues without stopping to think, &quot;why are we arguing, and why isn&#39;t anything getting done?&quot;</p>

<p>People that try to get things done then get labeled. Dirty hippies of Occupy, Outraged octogenarians of the Tea Party, all of these organizations that may have had the purest of intentions at the start, have been corrupted, co-opted, and spun. It&#39;s sad how egotistical everyone can be. We need to realize the fundamentals as a Global species. We have 1 home. We are all biologically the same. What one side of the planet does, does have repercussions on the other side of the world. When we (the U.S.) become involved in the happenings of countries around the world, we are not always welcomed with open arms. This action of course is only one link in a giant chain. The further back on the chain you go, the more you realize that we have been lied too. What kind of world exists when the mass populous is believing in lies, and hardly questions anything? What happens to that world when the lies unravel? The numbers aren&#39;t in favor of those upholding the lies, and their power only exists in how far those under the lie will obey. </p>

<p>For their entire lives they lived in this cave and were forced to watch hand puppets believing that was life. One guy escapes the cave, sees the earth. Trees, mountains, rivers, sky. Goes back inside to tell the other guys but they won&#39;t listen, deny, and sit in their cave. </p>

OK, this comes as someone who reads <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> much more often than most who comment on this thread compared to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which I do read occasionally. So, why read this sub-reddit? It is because at times, it has interesting takes on world events (such as the events in Syria, Libya etc)  and about the power structure of a democracy where the rich and powerful lobby for their demands. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> talks about that too, much more openly than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> at times where I barely see a mention of the Tea Party astroturf movement funding by the super rich Koch brothers.<br/>
 The excessive fear for gun safety measures, even somethings as simple as background checks or magazine sizes, strikes me as odd.    Don&#39;t get me wrong, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>  might be pro-Obama, but that&#39;s because most of reddit users are much more liberal than he is. What pro-Romney or Republican party story are you expecting?<br/>
This was the same sub-reddit where I remember reading about polls unskewed (how the polls were in Obama&#39;s tank despite the evidence after the election showing a 2 point Romney bias at the least)<br/>
To conclude, about half the stories here about real drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan, surveillance and crackdowns, discussion about the Banking system and reforms are good and informative. However, the overindulgence in stuff like a New World Order, the Rothschild&#39;s, Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove etc miss the reality of the problems today. These groups are strong but in no way controlling everything. There are no Chinese, Indians or Russians in these groups. They are closest in Military muscle. In terms of economic strength in the future, China and eventually India will be leading (due to massive populations) alongside powers today.      </p>

<p>Consider what I&#39;ve written and tell me where I&#39;m wrong.     </p>

<p>EDIT 1: You proved my point, just another &quot;Holier than Thou&quot; thread. Where is your reasoning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this comment hard to understand for some reason. you&#39;re kinda all over the place so I&#39;m not sure what you want to be proved wrong about.</p>

<p>To say that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> talks about anything more &quot;openly&quot; than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems like a stretch.</p>

<p>As for <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=astroturfing&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">astroturfing</a> it&#39;s surely been discussed here but it&#39;s just accepted as part of the problem. Whereas in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> you&#39;re still trying to convince half the people it even exists, the other half can&#39;t figure out if it&#39;s George Bush&#39;s fault.</p>

<p>You say &quot;The excessive fear for gun safety measures, even somethings as simple as background checks or magazine sizes, strikes me as odd&quot; . Are you under the thought process that it&#39;s the guns fault for killing people and reduced magazine sizes or gun bans will stop indiscriminate killings? Are you against the legal private sale of guns? or do you believe background checks at gun shows don&#39;t happen (newsflash they happen all the time) Your lack of concern for the constitution and the 2nd amendment rights of the people is what strikes me as odd.</p>

<p>You said &quot;What pro-Romney or Republican party story are you expecting?&quot;. This is where you have me all wrong, what makes you think I care about a piece of trash like Romney or about an outdated political label like &quot;Republican&quot;. Your <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is showing and we can all see it.</p>

<p>So you think the governments of Russia, China and India have nothing to do with the so called New World Order. If the NWO exists in whatever form you better believe that these countries are a part of it.  You said it yourself these countries will be future powers for more reasons than just their population( see also land mass, mineral resources, and military capability).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know I get that dirty feeling I just got trolled but oh well.</p>

<p>EDIT: I knew it, I&#39;ve been trolled. At first I wasn&#39;t sure but after further investigation it&#39;s confirmed. The terrible grammar, sentence structure and lack of sources / links for anything sealed the deal. Move along people nothing more to see here, especially from <a href="/u/peacefulatheist">/u/peacefulatheist</a>.</p>

No nation could have recovered with the above in 4 years, I&#39;ve read the literature and history and financial crises of this scale in a large nation like the US is a long, long road.      </p>

<p>Citizens United ruling was delivered by a conservative leaning Supreme court and has opened the floodgates to money controlling. of course the democrats will now use that to balance it with the money being flooded on the far-right.     </p>

<p>Enough studies have shown how straw purchases at gun shows and trafficking across state lines have caused a majority of the shootings in Chicago and New York. These are &quot;illegally&quot; brought in to the city. So Yes, there needs to be better enforcement and eliminate the gun show loopholes. Don&#39;t be holding on to your gun so dearly. Most people on this planet get along fine, if not great, without guns. Guns have no purpose other than to kill, you can keep on arguing self defense against a crime, but show me one statistic in which someone needed an assault rifle or anything comparable with 20+ bullets in a magazine to defend oneself. It is pointless, a handgun or shotgun would serve you as well. The US has the most guns in the world. There are more guns than people here, that&#39;s troubling.<br/>
My <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>  is showing? I don&#39;t know what that means, but I am asking you what stories would you rather be on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> front page now which wasn&#39;t there before. NDAA, Surveillance, social injustice, economy have been covered. Agreed, there is an inherent liberal bias, due to demographics, but so what? What&#39;s the argument here?<br/>
Have you ever been to India or Russia? There are large areas where the government can barely control the happenings of basic affairs. As an Indian myself, I&#39;ve seen how its practically impossible to manage the needs of 1.2 Billion people. China manages it with a strong authoritarian and totalitarian grip, but in the villages of China, (I&#39;ve been to the rural areas of china) they always have troubles managing affairs.<br/>
Noting the above, a NWO (which I would personally love if it entailed free speech, freedom of and from religion, social justice and equality) is not possible, on a practical and economical scale. Unless you believe the so called NWO wants to kill 90% of Earth&#39;s population which will mean nearly all of India and China. Something like that cannot happen on Earth it&#39;s a no-brainer when you see the world in total and not just America and its troubles projected on a global scale.     </p>

<p>What i want to say is that this sub-reddit deals with irrational nonsense along with sensible questioning. Whereas <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>  deals with relatively liberal but nearly always evidence based arguments based on research and studies. You have pictures of Obama and Hitler together as if he is a Nazi. It&#39;s gross, repugnant and ignorant. The Nazis expanded gun procurement, not restrict them. False and dubious connections of events are made here, most of it when it comes to drones, guns, secret cabals and government. People are the government,you as a citizen can improve it.</p>

The list goes on and on and on. To say Obama is any better or different than G.B is ludicrous. His VP Biden is the one who wrote up the PATROIT act for god sakes.</p>

<p>You said &quot;Enough studies have shown how straw purchases at gun shows and trafficking across state lines have caused a majority of the shootings in Chicago and New York. These are &quot;illegally&quot; brought in to the city.&quot; Link these studies please, you can&#39;t make claims like this with out sourcing the info. The only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal">illegal gun running I know about was taking place under the Obama administration</a>.</p>

<p>Yes your <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are showing, meaning, the way you present your views exactly proves my point in my original comment.</p>

<p>A NWO doesn&#39;t need to control the entire population of a country like china or India. As long as they control the officials in power to keep the people impoverished and in survival mode they have nothing to worry about. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to argue, I&#39;m only here to have a civil discussion but if you&#39;re going to come in here and make claims about this and that please link to sources of said studies or statistics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was he supposed to end the war in Iraq and Afghanistan overnight and not atleast get something done right to justifiably let the invaded nation recover? I don&#39;t think you&#39;re looking at a war realistically. He did finish OBL and has destroyed the influence of Bin Laden&#39;s Al-Qaeda, now its the AQIM and other such organizations in Northern Africa unfortunately. Drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen have caused much fewer deaths (American and civilian) and arguably better results against terrorism than GWB did in Iraq and Afghanistan. There&#39;s no running from that.<br/>
He signed an order to close Guantanamo and transport the prisoners to Thompsons Prison in Illinois. Congress shut him down. Have a problem with this? Ask your congressional representative. Obama still wants to close Guantanamo bay, has he said otherwise? The Executive is not a king, this is a democracy and such hurdles happen.  I understand your argument about whistleblowers, that is a mistake of this administration. However, Manning broke the law, he was serving the nation in the army. He shouldn&#39;t get a death sentence or something. Nor do I think he should get life imprisonment. But there is no denying he broke the law and didn&#39;t do the duty he swore to do. Sorry.<br/>
Give up the NWO talk, it&#39;s fantasy. People are improving and doing great in parts of India with real governance and good regulatory checks and balances. I can only hope Indian politicians that are corrupt change their ways in the tougher areas.<br/>
Anyone who disagrees with you doesn&#39;t have their <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> showing. I have held these ideas and beliefs about Government, Terrorism, Social, Domestic and Foreign before I even knew what reddit was. It&#39;s a very childish and amateur argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, see what I like about the subreddit is that everyone here is bit open minded.I hope that none of us on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are under any delusion that this administration or any other coming out of our current system is in any way working on behalf of this nation and it&#39;s people. If you believe that, sorry that you are under this delusion. The truth is Obama is not a great leader and Hitler was not great either, if someone wants to put up poster of them together, we don&#39;t give a shit. You may have your opinion about the NWO, many do, so it is great that you can add your thoughts here. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is about being able to discuss subjects like 911 that people find taboo on the main reddits. For example, what is the real reason Pakistanis are refusing vaccines, and the truth about what Drones technology was doing long before mainstream got the okay to speak about it. There is a lot of information here which is  hidden from the mainstream venues of information. Of course, there is seemingly crazy shit out here too, but hey, who knows one day they may come true too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well 9/11 was done by the al Qaeda. Whether it was complicity of the Bush administration or simply in effectiveness is debatable. I lean towards it having been a terrible blunder not to look into the hijacking plane and bin laden determined to attack memos by the administration.<br/>
Vaccine deniers are the insane ones. Do you know when a rumor that the MMR vaccine causes autism spread in the UK, a few gullible didn&#39;t let their kids take these shots. It resulted in the first first cases of these diseases reappearing on a large scale in years ( diseases being mumps, measles and rubella ) The British Medical Journal debunked it : <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347">http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347</a><br/>
Fact is, it&#39;s good to be open minded, don&#39;t let your brains fall through the sides when it comes to vaccine deniers. Where is small pox? For all the lies about Bill Gates and vaccines, do you know it&#39;s through his work and private charities that polio is eradicated in India, where it was prevalent. It&#39;s truly sad that one of the only places it exists is Pakistan. Do you know why? Religious extremism and intolerance to western science.<br/>
I might be an atheist but I&#39;ve read every major religious book written and can tell you that no where in Quran is there an opposition to science, it&#39;s in extreme thought. There&#39;s no conspiracy here, only ignorance.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not gonna debate 911 with you, so nevermind that. The polio vaccination has a long painful documented history of being tainted by controversy and deception. The vaccine that was being used in Pakistan was a new version that was not  being used before, it also was plagued by  controversy by the WHO using some unconventional waysto delivery of the vaccination, such as bypassing local government and hiring street thugs to give these unauthorized vaccination. Imagine, some nonmedical, nongovernmental person came to vaccinate your kids? It also did not help that the CIA was running fake vaccination ring to infiltrate And find Osama</p>

Read the book &quot;500 days secrets and lies in the terror wars&quot; by Kurt Eichenwald for what happened the days before and the year and a half after 9/11 and the way they drafted policies in the wake of the incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s being documented because that&#39;s what people seemingly care about, hence upvoted. You can ignore those stories and move on, it&#39;s not really crowding the page. It happened during the election and the statements were highly foolish. Now, if those statements are made today and the person making them is in power to alter laws for such people, should he/she not be called out?<br/>
Obama as a savvy W. Bush? Did he try and privatize Social Security? Bush had no Healthcare bill. Obama has started now wars and is about to end Afghanistan, the US&#39;s longest war. Yes, the Orwellian drone wars of the future may say it was Obama&#39;s administration who heightened its use after Bush&#39;s reduced use. if proper laws and checks and balances are established, this could be a long-term and over time perfected and relative safe tool against non-state actors. It&#39;s not perfect at all. Bush and Obama are similar surprisingly on Immigration reform. Obama has actively pushed for social equality for people, regardless of sexual orientation and signed DADT. Obama has actually talked about Surveillance and wiretapping and says the laws need to be strengthened additionally including his authority in the drone program for the future. He might not be the polar opposite of bush, but he&#39;s not a differently colored Bush. He came in as President in an extremely tough time, domestically and internationally, let his term end. Then we can discuss precisely how much he was like Bush, or not.</p>
