        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I was going University years ago, I remember reading something about how in ancient Greece,  the society was heavily dependent on slave system synonymous with Democracy. In America now, the Republic has become that system of Democracy  seemingly the slavery of the American people. </p>

<p>Now, listen before you all get upset. The Aristocrats of America have designed a system which gives wealth and power to the few in their circles, and they have convinced you that you live in a &quot;Democracy&quot;, but you never did. This so called Democracy is actually &quot;Aristocracy&quot;. The creation of the Federal Reserve Bank was the initiation of the American Aristocratic régime. So by creating the Federal reserve system, the IRS steals money people earned from their labour and essentially gives to Rich Bankers. They designed the whole system to steal from you, and the scheme is only about 100 years old. America is being Scammed by a scheme 100 years old,  Why are we afraid of these thugs are our grandfathers never heard of before? </p>

<p>The Aristocratic slave machine runs on gas, the gas of American labour, that is  income taxation. This taxation is unconstitutional  because none of it goes back the American people or their country&#39;s infrastructure. It is a scam. If Americans realize this, then the machine cannot turn.</p>

<p>America was never meant to be a Democracy,  because Democracy, unfortunately,  is often a regime for slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Communism prevails over the whole world! Cuba is the ONLY country which is not dominated by a bunch of millionaires. In Cuba nobody goes hungry and nobody is left out in the street to die. That&#39;s the kind of world I want to live in; one where human compassion is valued more than corporate profits. Until capitalism is abolished, there will always be an aristocracy; the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few is inevitable in a system that is based in competition and scarcity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will end when we have a media that will tell the people when to be pissed off and actually do something about it.  </p>

<p>But the aristocracy owns the media (only about 6 corporations).  They have an iron grip on American public opinion and it isn&#39;t about to change without some paradigm shifting event. If it weren&#39;t for the internet, most of us wouldn&#39;t even be aware of how supremely shafted we really are. And that was just the way they have always wanted it - an ignorant public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>&quot;But the aristocracy owns the media&quot;</em></p>

<p>Yes, and the asistocracy of America are Jews. Until people are willing to face reality and say this, nothing it going to change. You can&#39;t fix a problem if you won&#39;t acknowledge the source of the problem. Why do people think we are spinning our wheels on this? It&#39;s because they won&#39;t face the facts -- wealthy Zionist Jews have taken over control of the United States. They are the American aristocracy, and have arranged the system to benefit them at the expense of everybody else.</p>
