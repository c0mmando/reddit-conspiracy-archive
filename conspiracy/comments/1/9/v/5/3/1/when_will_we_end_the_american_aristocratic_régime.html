       When I was going University years ago, I remember reading something about how in ancient Greece,  the society was heavily dependent on slave system synonymous with Democracy. In America now, the Republic has become that system of Democracy  seemingly the slavery of the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, listen before you all get upset. The Aristocrats of America have designed a system which gives wealth and power to the few in their circles, and they have convinced you that you live in a "Democracy", but you never did. This so called Democracy is actually "Aristocracy". The creation of the Federal Reserve Bank was the initiation of the American Aristocratic régime. So by creating the Federal reserve system, the IRS steals money people earned from their labour and essentially gives to Rich Bankers. They designed the whole system to steal from you, and the scheme is only about 100 years old. America is being Scammed by a scheme 100 years old,  Why are we afraid of these thugs are our grandfathers never heard of before?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Aristocratic slave machine runs on gas, the gas of American labour, that is  income taxation. This taxation is unconstitutional  because none of it goes back the American people or their country's infrastructure. It is a scam. If Americans realize this, then the machine cannot turn.
      </p>
      <p>
       America was never meant to be a Democracy,  because Democracy, unfortunately,  is often a regime for slavery.

       We're playing the game that they tell us to play.

       So long as they dictate the rules of their game they will always win.

       When Communism prevails over the whole world! Cuba is the ONLY country which is not dominated by a bunch of millionaires. In Cuba nobody goes hungry and nobody is left out in the street to die. That's the kind of world I want to live in; one where human compassion is valued more than corporate profits. Until capitalism is abolished, there will always be an aristocracy; the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few is inevitable in a system that is based in competition and scarcity.

       is it wrong of me to find it amusing? i mean, all this is pretty out there. if the majority doesn't want to look past themselves then so be it. but when they do i figure that there will be a revolution/revolt/riot maybe in about... say 50 years or so? give or take a few years.

       It will end when we have a media that will tell the people when to be pissed off and actually do something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the aristocracy owns the media (only about 6 corporations).  They have an iron grip on American public opinion and it isn't about to change without some paradigm shifting event. If it weren't for the internet, most of us wouldn't even be aware of how supremely shafted we really are. And that was just the way they have always wanted it - an ignorant public.

       I always find it amusing how easy it is to lie to some one and then how hard it is to tell some one that they were lied to,
      </p>
      <p>
       even with the internet it seems people are to lazy and uncaring to notice about whats happening in the world around them, its not like George Orwells type of future but more of a resemblance of Aldous Huxley conception of what society would develop into.

       Similar to Mitt Romney cutting off funds to his staff after losing the election, the media will be cut from the power teet, once the government discovers that the media isn't the vehicle for their agenda anymore. Enough people will begin to distrust the goverment and it's affiliates, and in a panic, the media will warn the general public once it is too late...

       Yes, and the asistocracy of America are Jews. Until people are willing to face reality and say this, nothing it going to change. You can't fix a problem if you won't acknowledge the source of the problem. Why do people think we are spinning our wheels on this? It's because they won't face the facts -- wealthy Zionist Jews have taken over control of the United States. They are the American aristocracy, and have arranged the system to benefit them at the expense of everybody else.

       I'm curious as to what you think the country was supposed to be if not a democracy? Because it was a mildly representational republic that served the interests of the aristocracy in origin.

       Just because you stop playing Monopoly doesn't mean you can't play Chess.

      <p>
       We're playing the game that they tell us to play.
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as they dictate the rules of their game they will always win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution: play a different game -
       <em>
        and don't invite them to be the rule-maker
