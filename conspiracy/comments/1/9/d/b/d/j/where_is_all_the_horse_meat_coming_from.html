<p>A legitimate concern that the meat you are paying for is actually from a different source. If we have no idea where it came from and can&#39;t tell what kind of meat it is, then we have no idea if it is really clean and safe. Eating horse is fine, but eating contaminated meat is bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agenda 21 is so complex dude.  If you&#39;re big into the &quot;Green&quot; movement then it all sounds great no matter what, I&#39;m sure.  People being taxed heavily for living in a &quot;first world&quot; nation to pay for third world improvements?  That is what the communists would call redistribution of wealth.  It&#39;s already happening too, Obama is putting hundreds of billions of our money into developing third world nations under the guise of &quot;national security&quot; which is just a guise for the Agenda 21 initiatives.  Anything they do to further the Agenda 21 initiatives they will not say that it <em>is</em> Agenda 21.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting quote from the 90s:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Participating in a UN advocated planning process would very likely bring out many of the conspiracy- fixated groups and individuals in our society… This segment of our society who fear ‘one-world government’ and a UN invasion of the United States through which our individual freedom would be stripped away would actively work to defeat any elected official who joined ‘the conspiracy’ by undertaking LA21. So we call our process something else, such as comprehensive planning, growth management or smart growth.”</p>

<p>----- J. Gary Lawrence, advisor to President Clinton’s Council on Sustainable Development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over at <a href="/r/UNAgenda21">/r/UNAgenda21</a> we have documents on the sidebar and related sites.  Remember that the UN is a private, unelected, unaccountable, undemocratic organization, it was started with every intention of being a technocratic world governing group.  A world run by scientists and &quot;experts&quot; is a terrifying thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That book is propaganda.  Ted Turner even gave it his &quot;Turner Tomorrow Fellowship Award.&quot; Hell it was published BY Turner books, came out in 1992, same year as Agenda 21 was announced.  Turner being a billionaire advocate of Agenda 21.  They are going to impose these harsh population standards on us, but they won&#39;t impose them on themselves.  Turner has 5 kids, all who have many kids as well.  Not really practicing what he preaches.  They want the population low so that it is easily controllable.  A nice small slave number is ideal in their world view.  I&#39;m telling you, once you understand propaganda it&#39;s easy to spot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is news to me. I looked around and saw reported jumps from 7&#39;s and 6&#39;s down to just 2.6 or lower in some places. I wouldn&#39;t really doubt it with the endless genocide. I guess agenda 21 is a little further along than I thought. We really need to get to work. Still, once we&#39;ve routed out the necessary corruption we need to maintain a population growth rate that gives all life room to thrive.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>because meat is &quot;unsustainable&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Explain in detail and with credible sources that this is not the case. Aside from global warming (which I&#39;m not so sure about), it&#39;s simply a fact that the extreme levels of meat consumption in the west are extremely unsustainable. The vast amount of the rain forest cut down each year is being used to grow soy beans (fed to animals) or to make room for cattle. A <em>vast</em> amount of our global argicultural space is being used to grow food for animals instead of growing food for humans - thus contributing to the big food problems we already have in the third world. And as the so called &quot;developing countries&quot; (especially China and India) grow, even more people want to eat meat (because they can afford it now) which will make this process get out of hand even faster.</p>

<p>Only 50 years ago, eating meat was a luxury and most average families in the west had  meat about twice a week, if not less often. Nowadays, many people eat meat three times a day. It&#39;s not outrageous at all to call for being a bit more moderate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me make some points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inflation is driving up food prices</li>
<li>Slaughter houses are becoming black boxes</li>
<li>Meat prices are driven by demand</li>
<li>There is literally no demand for horse meat, but a bountiful supply</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting to make sense? Pretty simple case of corruption for money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude what are you talking about?  Just because horsemeat is being found in food doesnt mean theres some secret horse raising factory lol</p>

<p>Horses are born when a mommy horse and daddy horse love each other very much, then a stork flies in a baby horse.</p>

<p>There isnt a larger demand for horses because of this scandal.  Its just some lowlife business owners trying to save a buck by using horsemeat as filler and passing it off as beef.  You can buy horses at any livestock auction for like fifty bucks.  Much cheaper than cows.</p>
