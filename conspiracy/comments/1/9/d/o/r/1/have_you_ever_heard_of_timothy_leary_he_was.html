        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Leary was sentenced for 20 years possession of marijuana and later Reagan considered Leary (who is a Doctor and also served in the army) as the most dangerous man in america. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve done some research on his life but I can&#39;t help but think this is a true conspiracy and this man tangled with &quot;the man&quot; </p>

<p>Also Leary was good friends with John Lennon and apparently the song &quot;come together&quot; was made for his campaign when he attempted to run for governor. </p>

<p>Has this come up before on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? Does anyone have some knowledge about this? </p>

<p>Leary was also on the forefront of using LSD to open the mind and did much research at Harvard University. <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/psydead.htm">Source by him</a></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Richard Nixon called him the most dangerous man in America</p>
</blockquote>

<p>why ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he went to prison for arrests prior to his candidacy announcement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;On December 26, 1968, Leary was arrested again, in Laguna Beach, California, this time for the possession of two marijuana &quot;roaches&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On January 21, 1970, Leary received a 10-year sentence for his 1968 offense, with a further 10 added later while in custody for a prior arrest in 1965, for a total of 20 years to be served consecutively.&quot;</p>

<p>so yea, he served 20 years for weed possession.  ooooohhh super dangerous!! ;) ;)</p>
