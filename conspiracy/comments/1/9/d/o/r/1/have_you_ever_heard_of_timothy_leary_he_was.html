       Leary was sentenced for 20 years possession of marijuana and later Reagan considered Leary (who is a Doctor and also served in the army) as the most dangerous man in america.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've done some research on his life but I can't help but think this is a true conspiracy and this man tangled with "the man"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Leary was good friends with John Lennon and apparently the song "come together" was made for his campaign when he attempted to run for governor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has this come up before on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? Does anyone have some knowledge about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Leary was also on the forefront of using LSD to open the mind and did much research at Harvard University.

       That's funny, I thought Nixon had called Daniel Ellsberg "the most dangerous man in America", but it was Kissinger.  Funny how they used the same buzz term for these two.

       Sounds a lot like how Tupac was the victim of a hit shortly after he started talking very openly about participating in the upcoming Presidential debates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine? Tupac's perspective splashed against the whatewash of Clinton and Dole? TPTW would have lost control of that situation very, very quickly.

        assigned
