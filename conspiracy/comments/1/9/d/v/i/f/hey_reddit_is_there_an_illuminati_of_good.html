    <div class="md"><p>I really identify with a lot of the philosophies of the Pleiadiens, but am having a hard time investing much belief into all of the people saying that they are &quot;spoken through&quot; and &quot;channeling&quot;. Everything else rings true to my instincts, and I have been trying hard to really accept the true reality of this plane. </p>

<p>I suppose, if anything, this is the closest we can get to an Illuminati of good.</p>

They receive and deliver information to all people. We all others can also receive the same cosmic information, but fully functional third eye is needed. Meditation and filling you body with cosmic energy will finaly open the third eye.

    <div class="md"><p>Faith is important, but it is not the end all answer. There are many children of every God who act in evil and selfishness, and fully believe every single precept and teaching of their faith. Faith is an instrument that was given to only humans among all creatures on this planet, and that makes it very special, but it will <em>not</em> solve the very real problems we are facing in this dimension/plane at this time. Faith can help us to realize the much larger struggle we are a part of, but I highly doubt it will provide the answers to us. I belive that any faith claiming to have received the &quot;answers&quot; is being represented by false prophets, seeking to twist the faith of humanity into power for themselves.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is an &quot;Illuminati of Good&quot; yet. Maybe we should start one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think so? Well I think there are people who have selfish goals of greed and power that have no remorse or empathy and I believe there are people who live altruistic self sacrificial lives. Most of us come down in the middle and are just battling. But just as there are athletes who focus their lives to become the best they can be physically, I believe there are people who do the same with good and evil.
