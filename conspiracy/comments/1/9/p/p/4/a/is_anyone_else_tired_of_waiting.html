       I know this might seem sick to think, but I'm tired of waiting for progress in the world, even if it means my death due to a revolution. At least we wouldn't be stuck here just listening about the corruption within local and federal levels of government. How they just continue to get more ammunition and power, while we get less of our rights by the day. Anyone with half a brain can see what's going on. Obviously something is about to happen in America, they're not even hiding it anymore. I'm just tired of living in suspense, prepared for the day that it all falls down.

       The way I see it: the longer we have, the more time we have to wake people up and actually win. All we need to stop this is 10% of the population to be awake. There are endless amounts of knowledge (conspiracy and non conspiracy related) to be acquired that can help you to grow yourself and be more effective at unplugging people. And even if we totally fail, enjoy the ride, it's the only one you get.

       in regards to' enjoy the ride' I just meant life in general; you seem so eager to find out the next step (whether we will become slaves or whether we will win) and I'm just saying enjoy the ride (life) regardless of what happens because it's the only one you get. In regards to a revolution, I defer you to

       Reading this post made and the ensuing comments me think of something, what if we made a subreddit that was for getting in touch with people in your local area in case shtf, that way if it did, you could have a group to stay together. What ever is coming, I wouldnt want to be alone for. And im not talking about the prepper subreddit.

       At least for a certain time yes, maybe. It just goes to prove my point to get in touch now and make a plan that way if anything happens people can go according to said plan and meet up at designated spots etc...  I mean thats all im trying to say.

       I'm simply saying that you might think it's a good idea, but you have no idea who you're inviting to your community when you're inviting strangers from the internet, Reddit especially.

       For starters, what would be a good name for the subreddit? Would reddit be a good site for such a group? You can still remain anonymous while at the same time sharing bits of information. If we gained enough members, posting personal information on the internet wouldn't even be an issue.

       Aye. You are right. This country has been just below the boliling point for so long now, it's exhausting living life waiting for the next thing to happen. That's why you prep. You prep for whatever you think that next thing will be. Stock food, weapons if you can. Sharpen your mind. That is all you really can do till it pops.

       Haha dude, i'm glad i'm not the only one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly wake up some days and think i'm just dreaming this whole thing. It doesn't seem real. Like i
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       it's going to happen, but my brain just can't get around the fact that i'm currently sat in an apartment overlooking Sydney, and everything is fine. I sometimes think it's me, because i actually
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       it to happen, then maybe i'm deluding myself into thinking it
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen. Then i realise that this shit is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i'm not naive enough to think that this thing, whatever it may present itself as, will stay within the boundaries of the US when it happens. I'm in Australia at the moment, but home is the UK. When i get back, i'll certainly be more active in preparing for whatever may come. 'Cept nuclear war. Fuck survival if that shit goes down, i think i'll just punch out if that happens.

       "Something is about to happen in America..." I'm sure you have all been saying this for years and will continue to say it until nothing happens. The worst that will happen is that the economy will collapse because of inflation and the government continuously printing money. At which point a debt free currency will be put in place to replace the old system. Money isn't real, it is just debt. Come to grips with that fact and you'll live a lot easier. Hell maybe you'll be optimistic about something for once.

       But things have NEVER been this shady. Even my conservative family is beginning to see what I'm saying.  I don't necessarily think it's supernatural or aliens or whatever some people say.  It's just a few pathetically rich dudes getting their kicks before shit hits the fan (Rothschild family).  It's going to sooner or later, and you're right I've been saying it for years.  And I promise you that I won't be wrong.

       It's a lot of cost benefit.  The majority of people know that fucked up shit is happening.  They know (by now) that a lot of wrong things are going down behind closed doors.  They know that the government and corporations and banks are taking things for themselves while leaving the population out in the cold (so to speak).
      </p>
      <p>
       But all those people can still make their fake money, buy the objects that distract them from and reinforce the illusion.  So its cost benefit.  They are largely okay with the gradual taking away of freedoms, because they figure "well if I don't do anything wrong, why should drones and cameras and facial recognition scare me?"  They don't look at the principle of things.  The cost of a revolution to those people, is losing all their savings (if they have any left), their family, their friends, their home, their "security," and most of all their life.  It's a scary thought for people who are ritualists that have a 9-5 job and make a steady income and can come home to their family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its a waiting game for something blatantly outrageous to happen.  So outrageous that every person living in the illusion gets mad and says "yeah, nah, we're not having this anymore."  It's scary to think that it has to be a reaction to something, not people getting together now and saying "before it gets worse, we're going to stop it."

       There are two groups who have the capability to cause change. People and Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its in the government's best interest to keep things progressing as normal. Almost everything is going their way as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that leaves the people. Finally to my point: The population in the US is too docile and content to start any armed revolt. Wait a generation or two. Or more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system will topple eventually, I wouldn't spend my days waiting for it to happen. There just isn't the momentum for it at the moment. Remember Occupy Wall Street? me neither.

       You forgot the third group - The Elites, who own and control the government and the people.  This nation has been privatized by a wealthy elite - we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of feudalism (really it's just the same old feudalism, with new names and institutions to hide behind, with the very clever and effective technique of promoting the illusion of freedom and democracy, and thereby keeping the serfs docile.)

       The elites are for all intents and purposes equal to governement. In the majority of cases they are governement. Yeah, there are extremely wealthy and influential people who aren't technically politicians, but they both derive power and money from the masses. They are playing for the same team so I didn't feel it was necessary to differentiate between the two.
But yeah I agree that the system seems to be heading towards a corporatocracy. It is my opinion that we can prevent it, even without some sort of socio-economic paradigm shift.

       I hope you're right, but I can't see it "without some sort of socio-economic paradigm shift".  Wealth is the only power they have and need, and that wealth is entirely dependent upon the exploitation and dependence of the people who actually "do" the work of civilization.  The only way I can see to effectively wrestle that power away is to completely stop participating in those systems of exploitation.

       I don't think an armed rebellion will happen, nor do i think it is sensible. As you say, the population are just way too docile. However, economic collapse, paired with the threat of peak oil, is inevitable and fairly imminent (within our generation, most certainly). My worry is not about fighting the government, but fighting to survive. And if there is another world war, then fighting to stay the fuck away from it.

       I'm not sure if you know, but when people refer to an impending collapse, most people use the word "global" before it. This situation is much bigger than just your country or mine, it's the whole planet.

       like you keep trying to proclaim. But OWS did more than just sit around in a park and yell into megaphones, unless of course, like my previous point, you're being hyperbolic.

       Yes, I realize you specified big picture. And in the "big picture" they have done more than "zero" by a large amount.

      <p>
       I'm not proving your point by any means, you said that no one remembers OWS, you said that it has done nothing in the big picture (you literally used the word zero) when in reality, OWS led to quite a bit in terms of the global conversation.

       Sorry but when you use the term "big picture" and then when I try to argue against that, you reply talking about just Americans, you're clearly not talking about the big picture.

       You clearly missed the point I was trying to make. Let me retry: The post said something was going to happen in the US. I replied and disagreed to that. In the big picture, OWS has done nothing. It isn't going to precipitate any revolution. Whatever momentum it had was lost. Any good that came out of OWS was immediate and temporary. The Big Picture remains the same. Money is deep in politics, income equality is growing, etc. 
Since you disagreed with me when I said it did nothing, why don't you tell me how it did affect anything on a relevant scale?

       I didn't miss the point you tried to make, I guess I skimmed the OP mentioning that the only place in the world where bad things are happening is the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just read these things as though people are referring to a global collapse, not just in their country, since you know, we're not all American.

       I digress, I hadn't realized that this entire post was only about an impending collapse in one country, not across the rest of the planet.

       To be fair, I don't even think OP knew what he was referring too. It was a pretty vague question, and I was pointing out that if the population was discontent enough, something more would have happened than OWS, as it wasn't a game changer in the least.
I don't think anyone will compare Tahrir Square or Tiananmen Square with OWS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see why you think I'm underestimating OWS, it wasn't my intention to belittle it. I was just stating my opinion.

       Well I agree with most of your opinion, just not that it did nothing at all. Even if it only got people talking, it still did something -- and it did much more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       OWS was more than just college kids sitting around in parks, people just forget that the massive protests in Europe
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       OWS, just, not in such a lazy way.

       I'm definitely not just sitting around twiddling my thumbs. I'm in school, but in my book bag I always, always have the following:
Lighter fluid,
Rope,
Electric crank generator,
Knife,
Nalgene full of water,
Spec Ops Survival Guide,
Small Mag Light,
1 year worth of water treatment tabs,
Magnesium fire starter,
First aid kit,
Rhotos:),
and a Zippo.
I'm definitely more prepared than most, but it does roast in the back of my mind. I don't just sit here all day and bitch about it, but I think about the reality of things quite often. It's just getting old.

       All free energy devices are good in my opinion :) It depends on your comfort level and power needs. Here is a simple device which self charges batteries.

       I'm documenting the Don Smith device here if you wish to replicate.

       To begin with, you can build the crystal radio and use that to light a 12 volt automotive lamp or anything in the 12 Watt range. I think this is one of the more completely documented free energy devices and would recommend it to anyone for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand that free energy comes from simply switching a coil on and off and collecting the BEMF. This is a 200 year old secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among others, there are ways to amplify the power in a circuit using resonant cavities to make more powerful devices. Read Tesla and you'll begin to understand.

       Expand on this and you get a Don Smith suitcase device. I'm working on the second part of the circuit to extract useful energy from EM waves from Don's device. It has to do with setting up a standing wave on the miller loop antenna (inductor).  Just like Tesla said; set up receivers on the nodes/antinodes (Tesla called this antipods) of a standing wave !!! Tesla called it stationary wave and described its workings in his British patent 14579 and US patents 723188 and 725605.

       I previously posted my doubts on the OPPT movement, but I really think moving in that direction is a way to stop "waiting" in a constructive, positive manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of my niggling doubts have been answered, and because I have no debts or obligations to the old system, any concern around the Courtesy Notice structure (or hopes that the CVAC systems are true) are of little regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP, if you want to approach this all in a very spiritually positive way, I highly recommend checking into OPPT.

       We need to prepare yes, as individuals, but mainly we need to be able to assemble quickly into a group. if we try to all make it on our own, we may be doomed from the start.

       I honestly think it's too late. Yes, you can prep for yourself but unless everyone is able to get mobilized, with recognition of cause and intent by the rest of the world, then we're just doomed.

       what if bad things were supposed to already have happened? what if it's taking so long for the powers that be to enact their plan because they are continually being blocked and delayed behind the scenes?

       I mean it seems to me that Israel and Netanyahu have been pushing the U.S. for a war with Iran for a very long time now, to the point of hearing that Iran is only "months away" from nuclear weapon capability has become a tired cliche. A war with Iran would likely be a catalyst for World War 3, which I feel is the key step of a global domination agenda.

       I agree. And not to be dick, but prepping?? commmonnn... Dude. Be real. If shit goes down like it's looking and like the way the world is preparing, then any amount of prepper gear won't save you. Unless, you are able to get away from the majority of the population and have all your prep gear in a remote location that is very low key. But you still have to be able to get to that remote location and be able to live off the land. (I live in so cal, which explains my perception)

       Like, if you don't get out of the city, you're fucked. You will die by the hands of a stranger or in a gun battle over nonsense. Or starvation or bullshit like trying to keep the "family" together. Balls, my parents and family make fun of me for this shit, so i'd just like to stick up my middle finger, grab my buds and drive off before it hits easter. Leave them to the city. Good luck everybody. If we are still kicking the can by the end of the summer, i'll be shocked

       Being prepared is never a bad idea. Whether or not your specific preparations would help in certain situations is indeterminable until the event happens. The media tries to spin the people who are prepared as crazy, but what happened during Katrina and Sandy? Did the government come riding in on white horses to save everybody? They pretty much left people to fend for themselves. Despite the massive budget and thousands of workers, FEMA was never about protecting you, this should be obvious at this point...you are on your own.

       Prepping isn't merely about hoarding supplies - it's more about developing skill sets and networks.  Getting out of the city is a wise decision, but if you think you're going to just be able to go squat in some rural land owner's property, "you're going to have a bad time".

       Yea, but I don't think people are realistically envisioning what will occur. If you live where I live, you would understand. There's over 500,000 in a small city where I live. The whole county has over 3 million people in it. Just one of those 3 million people could just kill me for my car or shirt or water or anything. You all really underestimate this shit, eh?

       This isn't going to happen over night - no matter what anyone tells you.  There will be a gradual escalation.  It's up to you to determine when you think it's reasonable to gtfo of the city.  In the interim, it would be prudent for you to research a viable location with less population density and perhaps connect/network with some people who already inhabit that area.  I myself live in a small city (very small), but I am intimately familiar with the rural areas well outside that city, and I also have developed relationships with people who inhabit those areas - so I'm not a stranger.  People who live in the country are very wary and suspicious of "strangers" - that suspicion will turn to outright aggression once a mass urban exodus is under way.  Better to work on that before hand.  Go camping.  Meet people.  Make friends.

       times have been worse? Maybe in like crappy countries, but i'm talking about the super power of the world or what used to be. You really don't see it? 
Sure, great depression. blah blah. But honestly, 25% of americans are on food stamps. This "recession" is just like the great depression, except you can't see the food lines or the real unemployment. It seems like america is already setting into the depression. 40% of all the wealth belongs to the 1% while this is going on. Andd, china no longer buys oil with the dollar (We have yet to feel blow back from this. Just wait til all the dollars return home). Not only that, but the QE program is being shut off, while the sequester is being introduced. Not to mention, produce and other groceries have already gone up 7% this  year and the drought impact is going to become apparent round this summer when our food reserves dry up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now...you really think it'll last much longer? Or do I need to keep talking and throw over a dozen links your way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cause, I see what you're saying. I was used to go around and say the same. But the facts are, everything is culminating. If you don't see it, you haven't looked into world news enough and all the global factors. These are just domestic. Think about the biggest world economy, the EU. I don't see the euro lasting any longer than the dollar, which could spell trouble for the world if food is short and the two biggest finical systems default on their currency. Anddd what do we do when money is tight and our currency is being rejected by the world?? You know baby, we start a war. Meaning, we should look for a false flag to occur almost simultaneously with the default of the dollar/euro. WWIII, is close.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, shit won't hit the fan in an epic way like a sudden collapse. But rather a through a world war due to failing currencies that were tied to oil in order to manipulate the globe into slaves for the corporate elite. Now, those that were tricked (China, Russia, Iran, NK) are pissed and want america out of the picture because US fraudulent assholes stole the world's wealth. Pretty sick world we live in.

       You don't have to wait long. I have a gut feeling that next summer, when Usa and Israel invades Iran, Russia gets super mad and shit hits the fan BIG time in every country involved in that.

        I can see why you think I'm underestimating OWS, it wasn't my intention to belittle it. I was just stating my opinion.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well I agree with most of your opinion, just not that it did nothing at all. Even if it only got people talking, it still did something -- and it did much more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       OWS was more than just college kids sitting around in parks, people just forget that the massive protests in Europe
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       OWS, just, not in such a lazy way.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I don't think anyone will compare Tahrir Square or Tiananmen Square with OWS.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nope, but I don't think that was the goal of OWS.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and I was pointing out that if the population was discontent enough, something more would have happened than OWS
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yep, but there's no reason for most of the population to be discontent
       <em>
        yet.
