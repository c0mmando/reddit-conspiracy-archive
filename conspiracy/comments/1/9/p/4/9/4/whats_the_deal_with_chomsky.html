He talks about secret wars, of genocides, of collusion between &#39;democratic&#39; governments and fascist ones, of corporate engineering and undermining of democracy, of PR and propaganda...</p>

<p>So, why hasn&#39;t he been discredited? Why does he get a lot of mainstream media attention?</p>

<p>A lot of his stuff isn&#39;t brilliant work, but it&#39;s a good starting point. But something doesn&#39;t sit right in how he seems to be well accepted by institutions, mass media, and politics which makes me wonder what he is saying that is acceptable to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the stuff in that piece seems pretty loaded, and kind of indignant about the fact that he won&#39;t acknowledge anything fishy about 9/11. I think some of his opinions don&#39;t get spoken aloud because it would probably be political suicide for him to say he thinks there&#39;s more to it than we have been told. </p>

<p>I have to say I kind of agree with the notion that focusing on it alone would be the death of the left movement - there&#39;s a whole bunch of fucked up stuff that the military, corporations and governments are going right now. Even if it was an inside job and the truth came out, it wouldn&#39;t really do that much in the grand scheme of things - look at Watergate. It was a scandal for a while, then it was business as usual. Granted the inside job would be more of a scandal, but all it takes is for Obama to get elected and that somehow seems to appease most of the lefties of itself, so I don&#39;t think that much would actually change in the big picture even if the truth came out. </p>

<p>What would happen if the truth about JFK came out today? What do you think people would do? There&#39;s a good chance they will go &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be damned!&quot; then blink their eyes a few times and keep reading their newspapers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those two comments are not intrinsically contradictory. Pulling random tidbits out of what chomsky is trying to say in hopes that it will make sense is like cupping seawater in the palm of your hand and asking why there aren&#39;t any whales in it.</p>

<p>I have no idea where this quote is from but I&#39;m sure it made sense in the context of one of his never-ending monologues. For example, true corporate tyranny is historically very short-lived. People rise to overthrow systems if the majority view them as being corrupt or oppressive. Such a framework wouldn&#39;t be terribly lucrative or enduring. Maybe he was trying to say that corporations couldn&#39;t survive in their present form without the buffers of government. There&#39;s tons of different ways to interpret those statements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not necessarily a flip-flop. </p>

<p>In the first sentence he&#39;s clearly speaking of a hypothetical situation where we imagine removing the state from society as it is now. Result: The remaining power structures are the corporations. It&#39;s a rebuttal of the Ron Paul idea, that if we get rid of the government, all is good. Yeah, well, no. You just get corporate fascism, which isn&#39;t really far from what we have now anyway, just different uniforms. It doesn&#39;t follow that because the state is the current instrument of oppression, then removing it will make us free. The owners are just gonna get out a different tool.</p>

<p>In the second, he&#39;s saying that corporations cannot exist without the nanny state. What&#39;s implicit here, I think, is that he&#39;s talking about the fact that corporations <em>as they exist today</em>, are dependent upon the nanny state and exist in a form of symbiotic relationship. His statement is actually correct: &quot;corporations cannot exist as they do today without the nanny state&quot;. It&#39;s very much true. All the blood and gore stuff has been mostly outsourced from the corporations to the state, which is mostly under corporate control. His statement doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that if you remove the state, you remove the coporations.</p>

<p>But yeah, semantically and out of context, the two statements seem to be contradictory.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not pro-big government.

<p>However, no. Removing the state will not magically  bring about a just and equal society. Jesus fucking christ. This is not rocket science. If you remove one bully, guess what? The 2nd biggest bully in line tends to come rough you up.</p>

<p>Edit: This is not to say you&#39;re wrong, that the state doesn&#39;t opress, or that it isn&#39;t a problem, it is. But hell, there are other problem as well. The private concentrations of power are much more dangerous than the state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Chomsky&#39;s focus on institutional structures, class and developments has often led him to downplay the role of individuals and conspiracies as unimportant side issues. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, do you feel also ... I mean, I know that you have advanced these arguments and a number of other people have also advanced these arguments -- they are there to be found by anyone who wants to seek them out.... But at the same time, I think there&#39;s a great effort in the mainstream media to write these arguments off as conspiracy theory.</p>

<p><strong>CHOMSKY:</strong> That&#39;s one of the devices by which power defends itself -- by calling any critical analysis of institutions a conspiracy theory. If you call it by that name, then somehow you don&#39;t have to pay attention to it. Edward Herman and I, in our recent book, Manufacturing Consent, go into this ploy. What we discuss in that book is simply the institutional factors that essentially set parameters for reporting and interpretation in the ideological institutions. Now, to call that a conspiracy theory is a little bit like saying that, when General Motors tries to increase its market share, it&#39;s engaged in a conspiracy. It&#39;s not. I mean, part of the structure of corporate capitalism is that the players in the game try to increase profits and market shares; in fact, if they didn&#39;t, they would no longer be players in the game. Any economist knows this. And it&#39;s not conspiracy theory to point that out; it&#39;s just taken for granted. If someone were to say, &quot;Oh, no, that&#39;s a conspiracy,&quot; people would laugh. Well, exactly the same is true when you discuss the more complex array of institutional factors that determine such things as what happens in the media. <em>It&#39;s precisely the opposite of conspiracy theory. In fact, as you mentioned before, I generally tend to downplay the role of individuals -- they&#39;re replaceable pieces. So, it&#39;s exactly the opposite of conspiracy theory. It&#39;s normal institutional analysis -- the kind of analysis you do automatically when you&#39;re trying to understand how the world works. And to call it conspiracy theory is simply part of the effort to prevent an understanding of how the world works.</em></p>

<p>I think Chomsky goes beyond his focus on structuralism and has acted from time to time as a gatekeeper.</p>

<p>Here is an article which describes how the influential intellectual Chomsky has distorted the historical record of JFK in order to make the point that JFK&#39;s murder was just the death of another <em>Cold Warrior</em> and of little consequence.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ctka.net/reviews/Chomsky_Sickness_DiEugenio.html">Noam Chomsky’s Sickness unto Death</a></p>

<p>Here is a rather famous clip [8:00] in which Noam Chomsky condescendingly spoke about 9/11 and the death of JFK. The clip was recorded at the Budapester Kossuth Klub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean even if it [US GOVERNMENT COMPLICITY IN THE 9/11 ATTACKS] were true, which is extremely unlikely, who cares? I mean it doesn&#39;t have any significance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was a cataclysmic deep event. Like other deep events (Oklahoma City bombing, WTC 1993 bombing, JFK-assassination) it has been used by elements of the deep state to justify the expansion of the National Security State.</p>

<p>More than any other deep event, 9/11 has shaken the conscience of the American public. After 9/11 mindless jingoism and patriotism were unhindered by caution and restraint. The people accepted and even supported the obscene increase in military spending. The people were willing to sacrifice personal freedoms for their <em>perceived savety.</em> </p>

<p>I believe the government cannot admit these lies and betrayal. The media cannot admit that they have helped to cover up this terrible crime. Such an admission would not only shatter all trust in the institutions, it would also change the direction in which the country is heading.</p>

<p>Not really sure how I became aware of him, but I&#39;ve read a few of his books and watched countless hour+ talks on youtube. He started off as a professor of linguistics at MIT and seems to have become a general &quot;intellectual,&quot; amassing a large amount of knowledge on many different subjects. When I was younger I found his ideas a bit hard to follow and he just came off as another boring talking head that could seemingly mumble for days about anything. As I grew a bit older he suddenly started making a lot more sense, and his views greatly complimented my own conclusions and growing understanding of the world.</p>

<p>He openly criticises US and Israeli foreign policy, the unchallenged power and globalization of private (corporate) tyrannies, the state of education in the US, and the careful manipulation of public opinion and perception (specially with respect to creating public consent to wage illicit and morally abhorrent wars.) Those are some of the big ones.</p>

<p>I can understand the notion of the dialectic and how it forms false dichotomies by which people live their lives and measure what is true, but I&#39;m not exactly sure what you mean...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just mean that saying he is Anti-Zionism is meaningless.  Zionist / Anti-Zionism come as a package.   Which is fine if you are a Zionist but if that packaging is all you have and you are not it might feel ghost like.</p>

<p>After all it is Israel which is Zion not the U.S. and etc.  </p>

<p>So, why hasn&#39;t he been discredited? Why does he get a lot of mainstream media attention?</p>

<p>Give me an example of what he thinks.  Apart from that teachers and  education are great and Semitic Anti-Semitic Israel is <em>really</em> US (Anti-Semitic) Israel (Semitic).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He thinks that the PR engine runs propaganda campaigns to get people elected, and to avoid dealing with political fallouts from things like the Gulf of Tonkin incident.</p>

<p>He often refers to US imperialism in the Americas - the contra movement etc., the overthrowing of democratically elected governments and the installation of compliant puppet governments which are usually dictatorships of one sort or another, he talks a lot about how the real terrorists are the US and that terrorism laws and policies are hypocritical... there&#39;s a bunch of stuff.</p>

<p>His work is accessible, but having been through higher education I find that he spoonfeeds ideas and uses very simple wording to a fault - it can be hard to figure out exactly what he is saying because it seems oversimplified in some ways.</p>

<p>The remaining power structures are the corporations. It&#39;s a rebuttal of the Ron Paul idea, that if we get rid of the government, all is good. Yeah, well, no. You just get corporate fascism, which isn&#39;t really far from what we have now anyway</p>

<p>Lies, you have been led by a false shepard.</p>

<p>REMOVE THE STATE AND YOUR REMOVE THE CORPORATION BECAUSE THE CORPORATION EXISTS ONLY THROUGH THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE STATE ENFORCED LIMITED LIABILITY, THE STATE CHARTERS IN ORDER TO CREATE A REVENUE PRODUCING UNFLESH BEAST THAT IT CAN TAX</p>

<p>HOW CAN YOU HAVE CORPORATE FASCISM WHEN YOU HAVE NO STATE?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I was conceding a point to discuss the bigger issue - I&#39;m not out to whiteknight Chomsky or to start a fight, I&#39;m more looking to see what people think about the whole thing.</p>

<p>In fact, my opinions line up with his on this one. I always struggle with the right-wing no gub&#39;mint crowd because they never seem to set their sights high enough to notice the true power brokers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just arguing that a corporation from another state could quite easily implement a dictatorship in a post-government state(or lack of state.)</p>

<p>Then it wouldn&#39;t be a corporation, but a would-be state. And yes, very little difference between a state and a corporation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The abolition of one government does not abolish all corporations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the abolishment of all states abolishes all corporations. The threat of the State on the stateless is not somehow an argument against statelessness that I will accept as truth.</p>
