       He's a strong critic of a whole lot of US policy, and right-wing policy in general. He talks about secret wars, of genocides, of collusion between 'democratic' governments and fascist ones, of corporate engineering and undermining of democracy, of PR and propaganda...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why hasn't he been discredited? Why does he get a lot of mainstream media attention?
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of his stuff isn't brilliant work, but it's a good starting point. But something doesn't sit right in how he seems to be well accepted by institutions, mass media, and politics which makes me wonder what he is saying that is acceptable to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going on with him? Any ideas?

       Some of the stuff in that piece seems pretty loaded, and kind of indignant about the fact that he won't acknowledge anything fishy about 9/11. I think some of his opinions don't get spoken aloud because it would probably be political suicide for him to say he thinks there's more to it than we have been told.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say I kind of agree with the notion that focusing on it alone would be the death of the left movement - there's a whole bunch of fucked up stuff that the military, corporations and governments are going right now. Even if it was an inside job and the truth came out, it wouldn't really do that much in the grand scheme of things - look at Watergate. It was a scandal for a while, then it was business as usual. Granted the inside job would be more of a scandal, but all it takes is for Obama to get elected and that somehow seems to appease most of the lefties of itself, so I don't think that much would actually change in the big picture even if the truth came out.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would happen if the truth about JFK came out today? What do you think people would do? There's a good chance they will go "Well, I'll be damned!" then blink their eyes a few times and keep reading their newspapers.

       Those two comments are not intrinsically contradictory. Pulling random tidbits out of what chomsky is trying to say in hopes that it will make sense is like cupping seawater in the palm of your hand and asking why there aren't any whales in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea where this quote is from but I'm sure it made sense in the context of one of his never-ending monologues. For example, true corporate tyranny is historically very short-lived. People rise to overthrow systems if the majority view them as being corrupt or oppressive. Such a framework wouldn't be terribly lucrative or enduring. Maybe he was trying to say that corporations couldn't survive in their present form without the buffers of government. There's tons of different ways to interpret those statements.

       It's not necessarily a flip-flop.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first sentence he's clearly speaking of a hypothetical situation where we imagine removing the state from society as it is now. Result: The remaining power structures are the corporations. It's a rebuttal of the Ron Paul idea, that if we get rid of the government, all is good. Yeah, well, no. You just get corporate fascism, which isn't really far from what we have now anyway, just different uniforms. It doesn't follow that because the state is the current instrument of oppression, then removing it will make us free. The owners are just gonna get out a different tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the second, he's saying that corporations cannot exist without the nanny state. What's implicit here, I think, is that he's talking about the fact that corporations
       <em>
        as they exist today
       </em>
       , are dependent upon the nanny state and exist in a form of symbiotic relationship. His statement is actually correct: "corporations cannot exist as they do today without the nanny state". It's very much true. All the blood and gore stuff has been mostly outsourced from the corporations to the state, which is mostly under corporate control. His statement doesn't necessarily mean that if you remove the state, you remove the coporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, semantically and out of context, the two statements seem to be contradictory.

       I agree. I was conceding a point to discuss the bigger issue - I'm not out to whiteknight Chomsky or to start a fight, I'm more looking to see what people think about the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, my opinions line up with his on this one. I always struggle with the right-wing no gub'mint crowd because they never seem to set their sights high enough to notice the true power brokers.

       But a corporation does not need to be recognized as a corporation in every place it operates in, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Couldn't a corporation, say, Blackwater, decide that there was a country with no real government, say Somalia for arguments sake, and 'install' a new puppet leader quite easily? They wouldn't need to do much more than they already do...

I'm anti government, and anti state but surely dismantling something which has a degree of accountability and participation with citizens is not the best way to go about things when there are larger and more powerful organizations at play which use the facade of democracy to push their own fascist agendas?

       I totally agree with Mussolini's definition of corporatism.

       I was just arguing that a corporation from another state could quite easily implement a dictatorship in a post-government state(or lack of state.)

       While corporations exist, liberty will always be threatened. The abolition of one government does not abolish all corporations.

       I'm not saying Ron Paul is generally wrong or has bad ideas. I rather like his ideas, though some of them seem to be hrad to implement.

       However, no. Removing the state will not magically  bring about a just and equal society. Jesus fucking christ. This is not rocket science. If you remove one bully, guess what? The 2nd biggest bully in line tends to come rough you up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: This is not to say you're wrong, that the state doesn't opress, or that it isn't a problem, it is. But hell, there are other problem as well. The private concentrations of power are much more dangerous than the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       And sure, we can play "I'm an imbicil and you're right with your CAPS and all", but honestly, yeah, no. This isn't something I just thought up. My opinions are based on thorough analysis of available data. Can you say the same about yours?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course "state" is just a word for authorative power structure with guns. Jesus. If I'm an intellectual toddler, you're barely a fetus.

       You know, being a well respected linguist I feel that he would be too intelligent to be confused himself. He is often criticized for being too simple in his writings and speaking, but he defends this by saying that he does it to make his views accessible to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect that position, but I feel that he doesn't quite get to the core of what is happening or really follow through to bring it all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it could be that he's a great pressure-release valve, a way of giving the left some catharsis without ever requiring their active attention or participation - but then a lot of the awareness raising attempts could be criticized in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see what agenda of his it would serve to confuse people. I don't think he has any shady links to anyone - not that this would mean anything (this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I believe Chomsky's focus on institutional structures, class and developments has often led him to downplay the role of individuals and conspiracies as unimportant side issues.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         QUESTION:
        </strong>
        Well, do you feel also ... I mean, I know that you have advanced these arguments and a number of other people have also advanced these arguments -- they are there to be found by anyone who wants to seek them out.... But at the same time, I think there's a great effort in the mainstream media to write these arguments off as conspiracy theory.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         CHOMSKY:
        </strong>
        That's one of the devices by which power defends itself -- by calling any critical analysis of institutions a conspiracy theory. If you call it by that name, then somehow you don't have to pay attention to it. Edward Herman and I, in our recent book, Manufacturing Consent, go into this ploy. What we discuss in that book is simply the institutional factors that essentially set parameters for reporting and interpretation in the ideological institutions. Now, to call that a conspiracy theory is a little bit like saying that, when General Motors tries to increase its market share, it's engaged in a conspiracy. It's not. I mean, part of the structure of corporate capitalism is that the players in the game try to increase profits and market shares; in fact, if they didn't, they would no longer be players in the game. Any economist knows this. And it's not conspiracy theory to point that out; it's just taken for granted. If someone were to say, "Oh, no, that's a conspiracy," people would laugh. Well, exactly the same is true when you discuss the more complex array of institutional factors that determine such things as what happens in the media.
        <em>
         It's precisely the opposite of conspiracy theory. In fact, as you mentioned before, I generally tend to downplay the role of individuals -- they're replaceable pieces. So, it's exactly the opposite of conspiracy theory. It's normal institutional analysis -- the kind of analysis you do automatically when you're trying to understand how the world works. And to call it conspiracy theory is simply part of the effort to prevent an understanding of how the world works.

       Here is an article which describes how the influential intellectual Chomsky has distorted the historical record of JFK in order to make the point that JFK's murder was just the death of another
       <em>
        Cold Warrior

       and of little consequence.

       I think he has a point when he says who cares as it wont have any significance. Think about it, if tomorrow the Government comes out and says "after further investigation we've discovered 9/11 was in fact an inside job." Everybody would say "I knew it, it was that sombitch George Dubya." People would blame it on Bush, and because George Bush is no longer running the country, what can they really do?

       9/11 was a cataclysmic deep event. Like other deep events (Oklahoma City bombing, WTC 1993 bombing, JFK-assassination) it has been used by elements of the deep state to justify the expansion of the National Security State.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than any other deep event, 9/11 has shaken the conscience of the American public. After 9/11 mindless jingoism and patriotism were unhindered by caution and restraint. The people accepted and even supported the obscene increase in military spending. The people were willing to sacrifice personal freedoms for their
       <em>
        perceived savety.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the government cannot admit these lies and betrayal. The media cannot admit that they have helped to cover up this terrible crime. Such an admission would not only shatter all trust in the institutions, it would also change the direction in which the country is heading.

       It seems like Chomsky doesn't get that much mainstream media attention. Ask 100 kids under 25 and probably a small handful will respond to the name and maybe one or two will actually know who he is and what some of his more popular messages are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything Chomsky is universally hated and avoided because what he says isn't favorable to people in positions of power or influence, political or corporate/news-related.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who label themselves as intellectuals usually respond well to him because he presents ideas calmly and rationally (doesn't allow people to agitate or fluster him) and backs up his statements with a large body of references and examples while carefully explaining his line of reasoning. The flip side is that his style of delivery doesn't lend itself well to the tastes of the general public.

       The points I made were directly from personal experience. I've yet to have a discussion about noam chomsky with any of my peers, or anybody really. Most people (especially younger people) just don't know who the hell he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not really sure how I became aware of him, but I've read a few of his books and watched countless hour+ talks on youtube. He started off as a professor of linguistics at MIT and seems to have become a general "intellectual," amassing a large amount of knowledge on many different subjects. When I was younger I found his ideas a bit hard to follow and he just came off as another boring talking head that could seemingly mumble for days about anything. As I grew a bit older he suddenly started making a lot more sense, and his views greatly complimented my own conclusions and growing understanding of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       He openly criticises US and Israeli foreign policy, the unchallenged power and globalization of private (corporate) tyrannies, the state of education in the US, and the careful manipulation of public opinion and perception (specially with respect to creating public consent to wage illicit and morally abhorrent wars.) Those are some of the big ones.

       He's biased towards his own culture (Judaism).  He's critical of but loyal towards Israel.  He demonstrates why liberalism-as-multiculturalism is doomed.  I didn't want to believe this but have finally come around to accepting the unfortunate truth of it.  In the USA the political left is just a variation of social conservatism: it conserves Judaism at the expense of goyim.

       he is also so well-regarded and credentialed that he cant be ignored. hes the author of modern linguistics, the head of lingustics department at MIT and in the top 10 most cited authors of all time, up there with Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. He has pretty much been discredited indirectly because he is a huge advocate of anarchism and, like feminism, you now dont have to go after individuals to discredit them. their ideas have been sufficiently characterized and defamed.

       Well I suppose prattling on about Anarchism etc is just what people mean by his being a door keeper.  Who the hell is an anarchist?  It's just absurd.  Like moving through the external ghost populated world of a gatekeeper indeed.

       are you joking? Anarchism is the notion that authority ought to be justified. that is something, like feminisms gender/sexual equality, that all reasonable people actually endorse. You just proved that they succeeded in brainwashing you against your reasonable belief that they dont want you to have

       People's history is the history given out by a gatekeeper.  In no possible universe is Chomsky as bad as Zinn.  He's not even really bad - Zinn I'm not too sure about - just not Santa Claus. Being Israeli / Anti-Isrsaeli is the exact same as being Semitic / Anti-Semitic or Jewish Anti-Jewish etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel (Racist) / Anti-Israel (Anti-Racist).  This is indeed what Zinn effects in his American histories.  This is what the laughable nonsense of a peoples history means.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people would just pack in this Anti-Israel, or Anti-Zionist, or Anti-Jewish or Anti-Racist crap I might suspect otherwise depending on the individual.  But they never ever ever do.

       Enforcing a US etc (Anti-Zionist) /  Israeli (Zionist) dispensation is gate keeping.  The Anti-Zionism, non-Zionism, sub-Zionism, sub-Jewishness, Anti-Jewishness, Anarchism, Human (Racist) / Anti-Human (Anti-Racist),  etc etc are all just forms.

       I'm not sure what you mean exactly - are you talking about the appearance of anti/pro zionism within governments or in culture or something else?

       I can understand the notion of the dialectic and how it forms false dichotomies by which people live their lives and measure what is true, but I'm not exactly sure what you mean...

       I just mean that saying he is Anti-Zionism is meaningless.  Zionist / Anti-Zionism come as a package.   Which is fine if you are a Zionist but if that packaging is all you have and you are not it might feel ghost like.

       After all it is Israel which is Zion not the U.S. and etc.

       He thinks that the PR engine runs propaganda campaigns to get people elected, and to avoid dealing with political fallouts from things like the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       He often refers to US imperialism in the Americas - the contra movement etc., the overthrowing of democratically elected governments and the installation of compliant puppet governments which are usually dictatorships of one sort or another, he talks a lot about how the real terrorists are the US and that terrorism laws and policies are hypocritical... there's a bunch of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       His work is accessible, but having been through higher education I find that he spoonfeeds ideas and uses very simple wording to a fault - it can be hard to figure out exactly what he is saying because it seems oversimplified in some ways.

       I agree. I was conceding a point to discuss the bigger issue - I'm not out to whiteknight Chomsky or to start a fight, I'm more looking to see what people think about the whole thing.

       In fact, my opinions line up with his on this one. I always struggle with the right-wing no gub'mint crowd because they never seem to set their sights high enough to notice the true power brokers.

       I was just arguing that a corporation from another state could quite easily implement a dictatorship in a post-government state(or lack of state.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it wouldn't be a corporation, but a would-be state. And yes, very little difference between a state and a corporation.

      <p>
       But the abolishment of all states abolishes all corporations. The threat of the State on the stateless is not somehow an argument against statelessness that I will accept as truth.
