        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m 20, and wasn&#39;t able to vote until this last election but even before then I knew I wasn&#39;t going to register. In high school my American History teacher would let students 18 &amp; 19 register themselves, people at my college would set up tables and ask passing students to register, I always turn them down. My family knows my feelings about the government and how cynical I am concerning politics/politicians and have had some friendly debates with my grandma on the matter. My girlfriend has a brother who was in the Marines and my Dad was in the Air Force, so you can imagine what it&#39;s like for me saying my opinions on the matter.
Anyway, I get hassled by people who find out I don&#39;t vote and get into arguments with them. So I&#39;m going to explain to you all why it is I don&#39;t vote, and it may be the same reasons as you.
I don&#39;t vote mainly because I am cynical when it comes to government, we all have evidence supporting my reasons for distrust. I also will NEVER vote as long as the electoral college is around around. I also feel that if I don&#39;t vote, I have a right to complain about where this country is going, and those who do vote, don&#39;t get to complain.
The people I tell these reasons to always come back to this as a last resort, &quot;Well, the soldiers have fought and died for your right to vote, so you should.&quot; 
I respond with, &quot;That seems more like a quilt trip than a right. I view it as they have fought for my right to choose whether or not I want to vote. Being free isn&#39;t being told what to do, and being told to vote because I&#39;m free doesn&#39;t make me free. Being told to vote, and saying no, that&#39;s what makes me free.&quot; </p>

<p>What are your guys&#39; views on voting, and if you don&#39;t vote, do you get hassled for it?</p>

I asked my dad and he told me that they have them in a town that&#39;s about 45 minutes away. I wouldn&#39;t mind the drive, I just wouldn&#39;t know where to go from there.

However, when I move, to where ever that may be, I promised myself I&#39;d be an active member of the community. Going to town meetings and going to school board meetings, hell, maybe even trying to be a member of one.

<p>Ummm, your local elections take place at the same place as your presidential elections. Wherever your local polling place is? That&#39;s where you go vote.</p>

<p>Besides, you&#39;re obviously online. There is no voter information online? Are people expected to guess where to go?</p>

In essence voting <em>is</em> the initiation of violent force and I choose not to impose my will on others through the initiation of violent force.</p>

<p>Standing on one&#39;s principles is not apathetic. That&#39;s the message you&#39;ve been taught to believe and spread but that doesn&#39;t make it so. Apathy is simply going along to get along. Apathy is doing what ones peers are doing and not caring whether it&#39;s right or wrong. Apathy is not defending oneself when violent force is used against them. Those that can&#39;t see that are the delusional ones. </p>

<p>How does voting making any damn difference in the matter? If I had voted for all those years nothing would be different now.

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, not voting is akin to saying &quot;whatever happens in this country is fine.  I don&#39;t care.&quot;  That&#39;s fine, but you seem like you DO care about how the country is/will be run (ie electoral college reform).  So in your case I would recommend you vote for candidates who support your views in national elections, like third parties, and get active politically in other ways as well.  Voting is one fundamental right of the people to let their voice be heard, like protesting, donating to causes, etc.</p>

<p>If you take no action to support your views, what are your words worth?  You&#39;re wasting your breath if you put no energy into your words.</p>

<p>The electoral college has nothing to do with technology or calculating votes. It has nothing to do with an inability to count or calculate votes. That&#39;s not why it exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I do know that. And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like it. If this was a republic democracy like we&#39;re told it is, then voting would be like it is in the class rooms. Everybody will raise their hands for who they pick, the hands will be counted and the one with the most votes win.</p>

<p>If you understood what I was talking about you would have known that I&#39;m saying that is how voting for presidents should be like, and we have the technology to make it happen. Instead we have the electoral college that steals the votes from one person and gives it to another candidate. My dad voted for Romney, but IL went to Obama. Romney did not get my dad&#39;s vote. In the system I suggest, Romney would get my dad&#39;s vote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO the two-party system and the high percentage of republicans and democrats that we have elected in our government are to blame for most of this country&#39;s problems. But those that don&#39;t exercise their right to vote definitely aren&#39;t doing anything to make matters any better. The only way to change things in this country is to vote people into office that actually care about the state of the country..you can&#39;t do that if you aren&#39;t even registered. You non-voters do ALL of us a favor and get registered, educate yourself, and vote whenever you are given the opportunity. Whether you want to admit it or not, voting is a privilege that we all need to take advantage of.</p>

<p>False. Say you vote for Mr. A but the majority of people in your state vote for Mr. B. The electoral college is set up so that all those votes get put towards Mr. B. How is your voice being heard that way? You might as well have voted for Mr. B.</p>

<p>You can do a hell of a lot more besides vote, and it will probably make a bigger impact.</p>
