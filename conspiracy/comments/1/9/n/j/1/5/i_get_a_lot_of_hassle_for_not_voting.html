       I'm 20, and wasn't able to vote until this last election but even before then I knew I wasn't going to register. In high school my American History teacher would let students 18 &amp; 19 register themselves, people at my college would set up tables and ask passing students to register, I always turn them down. My family knows my feelings about the government and how cynical I am concerning politics/politicians and have had some friendly debates with my grandma on the matter. My girlfriend has a brother who was in the Marines and my Dad was in the Air Force, so you can imagine what it's like for me saying my opinions on the matter.
Anyway, I get hassled by people who find out I don't vote and get into arguments with them. So I'm going to explain to you all why it is I don't vote, and it may be the same reasons as you.
I don't vote mainly because I am cynical when it comes to government, we all have evidence supporting my reasons for distrust. I also will NEVER vote as long as the electoral college is around around. I also feel that if I don't vote, I have a right to complain about where this country is going, and those who do vote, don't get to complain.
The people I tell these reasons to always come back to this as a last resort, "Well, the soldiers have fought and died for your right to vote, so you should." 
I respond with, "That seems more like a quilt trip than a right. I view it as they have fought for my right to choose whether or not I want to vote. Being free isn't being told what to do, and being told to vote because I'm free doesn't make me free. Being told to vote, and saying no, that's what makes me free."
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your guys' views on voting, and if you don't vote, do you get hassled for it?

       Anytime someone tells me a soldier fought for my "freedoms", I just roll my eyes.  There is so much evidence to suggest that there is no number Arab people that can be killed that will secure my freedom. Does anyone actually believe that bullshit fairy tale anymore? Of course not, but it's what we tell ourselves to feel better when our soldiers are sent home in caskets.

       Drafted doesn't mean he didn't still fight (quite the opposite), and not everyone was drafted. And there were things like the American Revolution and the Civil War, so American soldiers fighting for freedom isn't totally false.

       But I do agree that some of the most recent wars are... of questionable value.

       I will say that at least WW2 was a declared war by Congress.  However, we have so much evidence to today to show that our government essentially allowed Pearl Harbor to be bombed in order to force the public to accept WW2.  Many Americans were sympathetic to Germany prior to that day.

       I live in a very small...village? No more than 100 people. No Mayer or anything like that. Just an elected "official" of the comity who is nominated by the home owners. Only homeowners can vote, I'm no home owner, and only 1 vote per household. My dad held that position for a while but he didn't like it because of all the bitching.

       Yeah, I want to but I have no idea where any of these things are held or what times they start. I've tried asking around but nobody knows. I asked my dad and he told me that they have them in a town that's about 45 minutes away. I wouldn't mind the drive, I just wouldn't know where to go from there. And as school board levels go I'm only there for welding and I'm about to finish up so it'd be just about pointless. However, when I move, to where ever that may be, I promised myself I'd be an active member of the community. Going to town meetings and going to school board meetings, hell, maybe even trying to be a member of one. I know there is so much corruption and if I can be a buffer between that and the people I'll do it proudly.

       After you register to vote you will receive postcards in the mail informing you of election dates, times and what districts, precincts, etc. that you are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many reasons as to why school boards elections are important but I don't want to sidetrack the overall conversation. If nothing else, you should care about allocation of taxpayer money and any tax rate increases that are proposed.

       Ummm, your local elections take place at the same place as your presidential elections. Wherever your local polling place is? That's where you go vote.

They try to fine you or send you to jail and if you refuse that then they will initiate violent force against you. That's all any governments are based on at any level.

       I disagree with this.  How does not voting give you any clout?  Do you expect public policy leaders to consider your plight if you can't bother to show up and check a box?  Vote for the leaders and initiatives that support your views, even if they are alternative parties.

       Lots of people disagree. I have absolutely no respect for those that support a government that initiates violent force to impose their will on others. In essence voting
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the initiation of violent force and I choose not to impose my will on others through the initiation of violent force.

       Standing on one's principles is not apathetic. That's the message you've been taught to believe and spread but that doesn't make it so. Apathy is simply going along to get along. Apathy is doing what ones peers are doing and not caring whether it's right or wrong. Apathy is not defending oneself when violent force is used against them. Those that can't see that are the delusional ones.

       I respect your distaste for violent and oppressive government, but the way by which you express it doesn't make any sense to me.

      <p>
       How is abstaining from voting making any damn difference in the matter?  If you really stand by those principles you keep referring to, aren't they worth taking action???  Even if you choose not to vote (which is a silly way of protest anyways), there are many other ways to better express your distaste for the way things are.  There are many people who believe the same things you do, but hiding under a rock doesn't help anything...

       How does voting making any damn difference in the matter? If I had voted for all those years nothing would be different now. Except I'd probably be dead from all of the anxiety and frustration caused by candidates never following through on campaign promises, issues that are claimed to do one thing and end up doing the exact opposite, etc.

       IMO, not voting is akin to saying "whatever happens in this country is fine.  I don't care."  That's fine, but you seem like you DO care about how the country is/will be run (ie electoral college reform).  So in your case I would recommend you vote for candidates who support your views in national elections, like third parties, and get active politically in other ways as well.  Voting is one fundamental right of the people to let their voice be heard, like protesting, donating to causes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take no action to support your views, what are your words worth?  You're wasting your breath if you put no energy into your words.

       I'll be a little less hesitant to vote once the electoral college is done away with. Protesting and donations are a lot different from presidential elections because of it. The electoral college really does throw away many peoples' vote. We have have technology that lets people vote and it shows how many voted, and what they voted for. We see it all the time on websites like facebook and newsmedia sites. We can do the same in presidential elections as well. I hate the fact that if 5 people vote for Mr. A while 4 people vote for Mr. B, all the voting 'points' go to Mr. A and Mr. B gets nothing.

       Yes, I do know that. And that's why I don't like it. If this was a republic democracy like we're told it is, then voting would be like it is in the class rooms. Everybody will raise their hands for who they pick, the hands will be counted and the one with the most votes win.

      <p>
       If you understood what I was talking about you would have known that I'm saying that is how voting for presidents should be like, and we have the technology to make it happen. Instead we have the electoral college that steals the votes from one person and gives it to another candidate. My dad voted for Romney, but IL went to Obama. Romney did not get my dad's vote. In the system I suggest, Romney would get my dad's vote.

       What you should do, then, is vote for a party, however small, that is committed to getting rid of the electoral college. That way, at least your vote is one of the few listed for the people who are against the current system, rather than not counted at all.

       That said, what a waste that you don't have any input on who leads the country, state, and local government!  I'm sure you have preference for who takes leadership of our public offices, so I don't know why you wouldn't put your vote in.  If people abstained from voting for having any issue whatsoever with government, no one would vote and the leaders would have even more power than they do now.

       I voted for gary johnson, mostly in the hopes of passing the 5% mark to help a third party be involved in debates and ballots more easily. I agree with your viewpoint concerning the government, but i get frustrated with people that wrote in ron paul or didnt vote out of anger. If everyone in those categories had voted for Johnson, we could have setup a great third candidate in 2016. As gary Johnson put it,  "i want to take power so that i can give it away."

       You should at least vote 3rd party for President every term. That has the potential to change something

       Exactly. Not voting is just quiet acceptance. And makes it easier for the establishment to continue its course.

       IMO the two-party system and the high percentage of republicans and democrats that we have elected in our government are to blame for most of this country's problems. But those that don't exercise their right to vote definitely aren't doing anything to make matters any better. The only way to change things in this country is to vote people into office that actually care about the state of the country..you can't do that if you aren't even registered. You non-voters do ALL of us a favor and get registered, educate yourself, and vote whenever you are given the opportunity. Whether you want to admit it or not, voting is a privilege that we all need to take advantage of.

       False. Say you vote for Mr. A but the majority of people in your state vote for Mr. B. The electoral college is set up so that all those votes get put towards Mr. B. How is your voice being heard that way? You might as well have voted for Mr. B.

       You can do a hell of a lot more besides vote, and it will probably make a bigger impact.

       Who said I was talking about voting for the President? If you aren't registered to vote, then there are many other important positions (at the local, state, national level) that you aren't voting for..and I'll agree that there is a lot of things you can do other than voting to help, but if you want to help why would you not simply vote, as well?

       There are other races on the same ballot. You'd be forfeiting your right to vote on them as well. You are not required to vote on every race/issue. You can leave POTUS blank and vote for whatever else is on the ballot.

       If you want to understand why, watch George Carlin. We laugh because we don't want to accept the answer. Or as Calvin and Hobbes once said (paraphrasing), "I think we laugh because we don't know what else to do, our brain just locks up when something is strange, stupid, or insight full enough. And we just laugh." Then Hobbes respond, "I can't tell if that's funny, or really scary."

       I really tried this past election: Waited for over an hour in line only to be told there was an issue with my registration and to go wait in another line. Eventually I just gave up, was going to "throw away" my presidential vote on a 3rd party candidate anyway.

       The electoral college and two party system are flawed but fuck you.  How dare you imply that because I use the mechanism available for change I have no right to complain.  What do you propose, withdrawal from the system doesn't exempt you from its laws and to propose violent revolution in the age of gun control and drones is foolish.

       The voting system needs to be reformed until then it's a waste of time. 
When Al Gore wins the election but gw bush takes office you know the whole thing is fucked. 
Between elections being stolen and special interests buying candidates our government is not representing the people and not a democracy. 
Special interests are starting wars and creating enemies - 
If we don't do something about it soon it will be too late.
