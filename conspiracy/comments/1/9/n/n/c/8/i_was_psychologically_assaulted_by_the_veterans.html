<p>I understand that some of you may think that I&#39;m suffering from a form of mental illness. I get it, I really do. I totally understand why you may feel that way. Please though, do all of us a favor and move along. I don&#39;t care if that&#39;s what you think. I care if you can relate or if you want to ask specific questions about what happened to me. I&#39;m just a redditor who experienced it. I mean, why are you in a subreddit about conspiracy to downvote real accounts of it? C&#39;mon...</p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ve literally tried to submit this story like three times in great detail but my computer keeps fucking up for no real reason. Of course, that actually makes perfect sense given what I&#39;m trying to share with you.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in complete details can PM me. Unfortunately, I now have to take an extremely long story and put it in a nutshell. I&#39;m more interested in letting you guys know they, Hey, this shit is real and it&#39;s everywhere rather than reaching out for help.</p>

<p>I have a unique experience with this because I was actually experimented on/assaulted at a government facility. This is real.</p>

<p>Here are some links to proof that I was at the least a &quot;patient&quot; at the Salem VA &quot;hospital&quot; that I&#39;m claiming. For your info - I was in building 8 which is completely separate from the &quot;real&quot; hospital. I&#39;m not even sure I was actually ever a patient at a real hospital.</p>

<p>Admission Info: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1eiWs">http://imgur.com/a/1eiWs</a>
Weird bullet: <a href="http://imgur.com/twV4g5Q">http://imgur.com/twV4g5Q</a></p>

<p>I was a patient here for weeks before my lawyer finally forced them to give me my patient rights and admission information. I still refused to wear the bracelet with barcode and photo and &quot;property of salem va blah blah&quot; on it. I&#39;m nobody&#39;s fucking property.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start by saying that I&#39;m just a normal, twenty-something&#39;s, dude and long time redditor. I&#39;m really just a normal guy. I also happen to be a veteran of Afghanistan. For all I know that&#39;s not even relevant to why this happened to me.</p>

<p>This all happened before I had ever googled &quot;mind control&quot; or any of that shit. My view of the whole thing is a lot different now that I&#39;ve educated myself a little on past government experiences.</p>

<p>My experience most closely resembles MKULTRA but it&#39;s still unique in the sense that it feels like less of experimentation and more like an assault.</p>

<p>During my 50+ days of being held against my will (they used EDO&#39;s, TDO&#39;s and involuntary commitment orders to keep me), I was a victim of mind control, thought interception, dream hijacking, intimidation, sexual assault and what I can only assume was some form of internal two-way communication with my brain. Some recent google-fu shows this might have been something called voice-to-skull. In addition, I was the victim of relentless (I mean, RELENTLESS) group stalking and electronic harassment for months.</p>

<p>At this point, it&#39;s possible that I was pardoned. I am to the best of my knowledge not being stalked or harassed any more but they do occasionally &quot;pop in&quot; top let me know that they are still around. I&#39;ll try to explain that as best as I can later in this.</p>

<p>Anyways -</p>

<p>Mind Control:</p>

<p>During my stay at Salem VAMC and other facilities where I was transferred from I experienced not only unnatural thoughts, seemingly from nowhere...but had other &quot;patients&quot; know things about me that nobody would. Dark shit that I&#39;ve thought about. Stuff that I wouldn&#39;t even tell a therapist. Personal information as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had other &quot;patients&quot; seemingly read my thoughts in real time. Never directly communicating with me but rather mumbling things i&#39;ve said in my head, while in passing or to a wall rather to me. never making eye contact. I believe this is important in some way.</p>

<p>I have fuzzy memories of conversations with staff, patients, and being in a zombie like state - mindless, if you will. Just bits and pieces of stuff happening that I don&#39;t think I&#39;m supposed to remember at all. I think the only reason I even remember some of this stuff is being I&#39;m so resistant. I have fragmented memories of being in a dog cage, being sexually assaulted during the night, having a collar on me, other patients brushing my hair - really odd things like that.</p>

<p>There were two instances where I was in direct communication with people on an internal/thought level. These two experiences take the cake for being freaky.</p>

<p>Situation 1: </p>

<p>This is a fuzzy or faded memory. I believe when it happened, I was under the influence of some sort of drug or hypnosis. Again, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m supposed to remember this.</p>

<p>I was taking a shower and while in the shower I heard the voices of two other patients in my head, literally. I remember not freaking out because I knew that I was drugged or low on oxygen or something. I remember telling myself to be calm, to force myself to remember that this was happening. Repeating over and over in my head that I was hearing them speak to me in my head. This could also be why I remember it faintly. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a passing thought of voices - I was hearing a conversation between them. Making fun of me and stuff and then talking directly to me, as if sharing a microphone or something. At the time I thought maybe the walls of the shower had giant transmitters behind them or something. The problem with the voices I was hearing was that they seemed to be in my head but were low. Almost like it was a low power transmission. They seemed mildly degraded. It wasn&#39;t &#39;t what you&#39;d expect a crazy person to be hearing. This actually seemed synthetic and to be honest actually didn&#39;t freak me out as much as I suspect they wanted it to. I didn&#39;t doubt my sanity for a second. I just immediately knew it was some form of intense technology. One thing they kept repeating was &quot;A compass is for safety&quot; &quot;A compass is for safety&quot; etc. Maybe a reference to the freemasons? I believe the logo has a compass for geometry in it.</p>

<p>This is just a summarized version, sorry.</p>

<p>Situation 2:</p>

<p>Laying in bed - hazy...disorientated...I&#39;m hearing a woman patient. I recognize her voice. She&#39;s saying terrible things about my mother. That I&#39;m the son of a prostitute and that they were going to follow me anywhere that I go and I&#39;ll never escape - stuff like that. Anything I thought, she responded to so I knew that this was the same type of connection I experienced in the shower. I mean this was all internal. I was alone in my room.</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering now if this was them trying to fuck with me or really them just trying to get me to talk about it. Because, pretty much the whole time I was in there - I didn&#39;t budge. Anything they did to get me to freak out, I simply kept my cool. I never admitted to hearing voices or any of that shit. I think that was the right thing to do - to just stay resistant.</p>

<p>There were so many crazy things they did to me, I can&#39;;t even think of them all.</p>

<p>They tried to get me to tell staff that I was smelling terrible smells (olfactory hallucinations) by putting these tiny knotted pieces of paper in my room. Those things smelled like raw sewage. I never admitted to smelling anything - simply threw them away and kicked the bag out of my room.</p>

<p>Um, let&#39;s see. They also had some sort of TV channels that weren&#39;t real. They had fake news broadcasts and fake newspaper. I&#39;m talking, obviously fake. This was all happening during the last election and they had weird election information, etc. They played commercials that were almost in tune with my thoughts. Almost like they were messages to me directly. Again this set off a red flag and I never told anyone about it - sure as hell wasn&#39;t going to tell some &quot;dr&quot; that I thought the TV was talking to me. I learned later that this might have been an attempt to get me to report &quot;ideas of reference&quot; to doctors. Pretty sure they were trying to smack a Schizo label on me.</p>

<p>At night, they often had weird noises going on in my room. The sound of crackling paper and slurping noises with no real origin. I never let myself get freaked out and never reported the sounds to my &quot;treatment team&quot;.</p>

<p>The TV would play movies but they would be edited in weird ways. I noticed anytime I was watching TV they left me alone and switched to some kind of observation mode or something. They&#39;d just watch me watching TV really awkwardly. I would always start to feel light headed, almost like the oxygen was being sucked out of the room. I&#39;d start to basically be high as I watched TV and sometimes I&#39;d notice that the movies were jumping around and not making sense. I pretended not to notice sometimes and other times I actually stayed there long enough to not know what was going on around me. Sometimes when I was in that state of being fucked up, it would all just go away - almost instantly I&#39;d feel lucid again. Like someone flipped a switch and brought  all the air back into the room. No hazy feeling, etc. A real mind fuck. They played three movies a lot. &quot;The Notebook&quot;, &quot;October Sky&quot; and &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; but I never saw any of the movies the whole way through because they&#39;d play certain scenes over and over. Oddly enough, during angels and demons, I&#39;d always leave the room/not wanna watch it and when I&#39;d come back into the TV room hours later, it would be playing in the same spot it was the last time I was in there.</p>

<p>The other &quot;patients&quot; would rotate in and out very quickly. Someone who was there one day might be gone the next and some might stay for a week. All of them harassed me. I&#39;m pretty sure they were actually Dr&#39;s in disguise.</p>

<p>I should note that I basically had my own wing at this hospital. I was the only real test subject, though they pretended to have other patients. That was also pretty scary.</p>

<p>One patient would often finish my sentences and laugh and walk away. I almost assaulted him out of frustration. Again - I kept my cool. I think they wanted me to think I was crazy or something magical was happening but in reality I knew I was being psychologically bullied. </p>

<p>They used the power of suggestion a a lot. They would make me believe things without saying anything at all. They&#39;d all be looking at me in a room without saying a word. Something simple like that is very powerful though. Just being silently stared at by everyone in a room. It screamed &quot;experiment&quot;.</p>

<p>Group stalking:</p>

<p>Where do I even start? Months and months before every being hospitalized, I was aware of this happening to me though I didn&#39;t know what it was called or if I was the only one.</p>

<p>People leaving the same time as you, other apartments slamming doors right as you wake up or cars honking right as you try to fall asleep. Shit that by themself wouldn&#39;t be weird but never catching a break making it obviously an attack on you.</p>

<p>Car alarms going off when you &quot;think&quot; certain things. Fucking...neighbors starting to not talk to you anymore out of the blue. People bumping into you, or cutting you off in traffic. Cutting in line, walking into your path so you have to avoid them. The shit is intense. This was the worst experience of all.</p>

<p>Some other things were people always following me and taking photos anywhere I went, sometimes secretly, sometimes not., People using cell phones to record you and stuff. Being followed at grocery stores, etc.</p>

<p>It ROBS you of any peace of mind. You NEVER feel safe. You feel completely hopeless when this is happening to you. Make no mistake that group stalking is a form of torture. At one point I didn&#39;t leave my home for at least 12-15 days to even remove trash because I was scared.</p>

<p>I believe I was pardoned from this. Nobody is following me anymore - not obviously at least and I&#39;m no longer being harassed.</p>

<p>If you are a victim of this, please PM me. </p>

<p>Electronic harassment:</p>

<p>I&#39;d find weird history on my computers/cell phones. Lots of wikileaks type stuff that I never look up.</p>

<p>I&#39;d see wardrivers outside and close by.</p>

<p>Unexplained turning off and on of my devices.</p>

<p>High pitched frequency in my left ear almost constantly</p>

<p>Fatigue attacks. Not sure how to explain it other than being fine and then out of nowhere being hit with a sleepiness so intense that it&#39;s got the weight of a freight train. This happened a lot in the hospital. I did notice that I could work my way out of it by thinking inward and not focusing on the sleepiness - instead reinforcing the fact that &quot;I&#39;m not actually tired, this is manufactured&quot;. Sometimes I&#39;d snap out of it and sometimes it was a tug of war with my brain.</p>

<p>Having a clear thought process and speaking and then almost like my thoughts were being jammed with a jamming device. Total loss of concentration out of nowhere.Might be another way they slap a Schizo label on you.</p>

<p>Dream hijacking:</p>

<p>This is actually an area that I haven&#39;t seen much about online. I hate to bring something up that you guys might not know about but I feel I need to share with you that this is also an attack they are using. I think it&#39;s for interrogation. Think Inception (the movie)</p>

<p>I noticed I&#39;d have weird dreams where people would be asking me questions and folllowing me around in my dream world if you will. They didn&#39;t seem to edit anything so much as just be there. I was completely disarmed in my dreams - I wasn&#39;t protecting anything while I was asleep. I believe they use this type of attack to get information they want because unfortunately, nobody can be resistant in a dream. I know it sounds crazy but let&#39;s be honest - so does mind control. Point is, they can intercept and read your dreams and now I know they can actually show up in them.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I was experimented on and or psychologically assaulted in government hospitals. </p>

<p>I feel like a lot of this is vague and in part that&#39;s because I want to protect my identity in case any of them feel like tracking me down again but to be honest - they already know where we all are anyways.</p>

<p>This took place at VA Medical Center in Salem, VA as well as in a maximum security mental ward at Richmond Community hospital. I was also transferred to Poplar Springs Hospital, which is private and it&#39;s located in Petersburg, VA outside of Richmond. Prior to the group stalking beginning and ultimately leading up to my involuntary commitment, I was being treated by a Dr. at Mcguire Hunter Holmes VA center in Richmond VA for PTSD due to service in Afghanistan. I have no history of mental illness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly man,  my best friend was skitzo when he turned 24 he started doing things like you are writing.  I lived right next door to him and I was the one who found him dead with a shotgun in his mouth.  I know it will be hard for you to trust anyone especially with stuff like you are describing going on, and whatever is inside you is telling you that everyone is lying to you. But you need to get help or your going to end up with a gun in your mouth. I feel for ya bro, it&#39;s a crazy disease that I don&#39;t understand but it is real and people who have it say the kinda things that you wrote.  I know from experience.  The last one to know your crazy is always you.  I&#39;m praying for you brother.</p>

<p>You really need to seek help, friend. It&#39;s only going to get worse. I know you&#39;re sick of hearing it and that&#39;s fine. Ignore me for now, but when it gets worse, and it will, remember what I said. My prediction will come true because mental illness has a way of getting worse over time, especially when it goes untreated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignorance: Lack of knowledge or information.</p>

<p>Your story is in plain view, so I&#39;m certainly not ignorant of it. You have also been informed that you are suffering from a mental illness, so you&#39;re not ignorant of that.</p>

<p>In fact, what we have here is mental illness covering it&#39;s tracks. It&#39;s the reason diagnosis usually come so late and why so many people deny their illness. It&#39;s very easy to write off mental illness as a candidate for the truth; I know this as I&#39;m bipolar and wasn&#39;t diagnoses until I was 26. Innumerable individuals with a mental illness experience it. In your case, it looks like Schizophrenia or Schizo-effective hiding behind it&#39;s own delusions (another thing that I experience, I just most often don&#39;t believe them).</p>

<p>In fact, the opinion that you <em>should</em> be seeking is that of a professional. Please, for the good of yourself, for the good of the people that love you and for the good of anyone that may come in contact with you as your illness progresses, seek professional help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who has informed me that I&#39;m suffering from a mental illness? A bunch of non-qualified people on Reddit that don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about? Do you even know what requirements you have to meet to be considered Schizophrenic or schizo effective? Look that shit up, dude. You don&#39;t know enough about me or my experiences to just slap a label on me. This is the type of shit that bothers me the most. </p>

<p>I live a completely normal life, the people that love me know about what happened to me. Nobody is suffering by proximity. You&#39;re making a lot of assumptions without any real information. </p>

<p>What the hell would seeking help do for me even if I were sick? I was in intensive &quot;treatment&quot; for over 50 days. Don&#39;t you think that would have been helpful?</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m trying to convince people the the earth is round. I get that you don&#39;t believe that what happened to me was real but why in the world are you so willing to pass it off as Schizophrenia? </p>

<p>And you convinced yourself that you&#39;re not, knowing full well that it fits the description, all the while you argue that it doesn&#39;t. This is denial.</p>

<p>You say that it doesn&#39;t still happen, while you also say that it does. This is denial.</p>

<p>You are in denial. You need to read what you yourself are writing because it&#39;s in plain view. Seriously, go see a counselor and tell them this story. I promise you, they won&#39;t be so keen this time in telling you that there&#39;s nothing wrong.</p>

<p>For now. It will happen again... and again... and again. It will get worse. You will always be able to convince yourself that you&#39;re fine, but eventually you&#39;re going to have to look back at a path of destruction.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not being passed off, it&#39;s being inferred from what you&#39;re saying because the shit you&#39;re talking about <em>ISN&#39;T REAL</em>. It&#39;s really that simple.</p>

<p>Three treatment teams assessed me in three hospitals and didn&#39;t slap me with a label. If I were schizophrenic, even being unwilling to talk to them, they would have figured out something to diagnose me with.

<p>No, man. I am a level headed guy and I want to say that I respect your opinion but I don&#39;t. I know what happened to me was real. You&#39;re entitled to think whatever you want, just as I am but only I was there, right. </p>

<p>Symptoms are not always on 24/7. They also lay dormant for decades. You&#39;re not saying anything that someone in denial of a mental illness wouldn&#39;t say. </p>

<p>You even go so far as to deny that it&#39;s still occurring:</p>

<p>I just went through a bizarre and terrifying experience a while ago</p>

<p>while you otherwise state that it is:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is, but that perception doesn&#39;t have to be the way it is for you. My grandmother is the same way, and I hate it. I don&#39;t hate it because she&#39;s delusional though. I hate it because it is such a heavy burden to carry. Her perception of her reality is so strong in her mind she can&#39;t or won&#39;t even consider the possibility that maybe some of it is in her head. I&#39;ve tried for so long to get her to question herself and nothing has worked. It&#39;s wearing me down. </p>

<p>My grandfather committed suicide in 1985, two years before I was born. My grandmother found him in their bedroom with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. She lived in that home for two more years, alone, before moving to another city far away. She was also committed for a short time and claims to have been heavily sedated, sexually assualted, had fellow patients finish her sentences or refer to her inner thoughts. She believed television broadcasts were specifically written or entirely faked for the intent of harassment. She believes she is being watched or monitored by individuals either from or connected to the city she once called home. She believes she is followed in grocery stores. She believes that in situations where most people would view as completely innocent conversation with a stranger are full with phrases of speech used intentionally to &#39;get her inside her head&#39;. </p>

<p>I argue with her over these &#39;signs&#39; or proof. She knows I believe its in her head, but once a month she will mention a recent experience she had recently. She will smile as if she knows she&#39;s just presented such strong evidence that I will no longer doubt her sanity. </p>

<p>But she&#39;s wrong. She just describes a typical everyday polite interaction with a stranger in public. If I ask her what did this person do to make her believe she was being harassed she reacts with anger. She tells me, &quot;I just know!&quot; She doesn&#39;t even have the ability to ask herself why she believes what she does. She is so convinced of her sanity that she blocks out the ability to recognize her irrationality. She ignores all of the signs that she might not be thinking clearly because she wants to believe what she wants. It&#39;s so frustrating to me. It kills me a tiny bit everytime I&#39;m reminded I can&#39;t help her find peace. </p>

<p>Your story reminds me so much of my grandmother, and how much I love her. Please, just consider that you may be wrong and this is in your head. Ignore your feelings, they could be lying to you. Focus on rationality. Try to tear apart your own narrative. Try to disprove yourself. Sane people would react to your situation with doubt and fear, their first and constant urge would be to question their own sanity. </p>

<p>Speak to someone. The technology required and sheer number of individuals that would be necessary to do this to you either doesn&#39;t exist or is too unrealistic to be plausible. Why were you picked? What purpose did the harassment serve? You say you resisted showing any response to what happens to you, ask yourself to explain why they continued onwards even though they couldn&#39;t break you. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know why I typed that last two paragraphs. If it doesn&#39;t work for my grandmother it won&#39;t work for you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry this is your reality, and I hope one day you decide to seek help. Life doesn&#39;t have to be like you are convinced it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I only read the first few paragraphs when I made my last comment.  But now that I have read it all, you are definitely skitzo, the only reason I say this is because you brought back memories of my BFF Jake.  I wish there was a way to convince you that this stuff is In your mind, but I know there isn&#39;t. You think there is a mass conspiracy against you, but there isn&#39;t. You are paranoid because you cannot control your mind.  You think you are resistant, you think you are strong, you think you are the only one you can trust, you think someone or something (I.e. organization) is using super technology to ???(I don&#39;t know what you think they are trying to do).  You probably don&#39;t have any info that the government doesn&#39;t already have or any skills that someone else doesn&#39;t already posses.  Like you said your a regular guy, why would someone mess with a normal guy like this?  Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m big on conspiracies and believe the govt has technology that they are not telling us about, but I don&#39;t believe they would do this.  My friends told me he would die and &quot;they&quot; would make it look like a suicide.  I found his body, it was a suicide.  I saw his finger on the trigger, I saw the blood spatter, I heard the shot.  He was crazy and I didn&#39;t understand that until he was gone.  I pray that you figure that out before its too late and you get help!</p>

I&#39;m completely level headed and lucid. I don&#39;t think anyone is watching me if I walk outside, nor do I think anyone is listening to my phone calls or anything like that. This is me retelling a story about some crazy shit that happened to me last year. I appreciate your concern though. I&#39;m not mentally ill. As to why someone would want to mess with me? I have no idea. I&#39;m not special. It doesn&#39;t make sense at all. That isn&#39;t the point though. I just figured I&#39;d share what happened to me. Thanks for posting.</p>

He died a year ago in may and I have had plenty of time to think about it.  I know it wasn&#39;t real because we could both talk to the same person at the same time and he would instantly come up things that didnt happen.

    <div class="md"><p>~people, stop downvoting this guy.  You aren&#39;t helping by doing that.~</p>

<p>Let me tell you just a bit about myself.
I got depression.  I got it bad.
I am 40 and for the last 10 years I have been on SSRI&#39;s and have been seeing a talk doctor.  The last 10 have been the best years of my life.  My depression goes all the way back to high school.</p>

<p>I have had nights where I have spent the night &#39;snuggling&#39; with a razor blade.  I have done this a bunch of times over the years (but not lately, THANKS DOC!).  It is a terrible place to be.  I wouldn&#39;t wish it on anyone.</p>

<p>Now here is the thing.  I describe the way I feel between being depressed and not depressed as almost having a split personality.  When I am depressed it colors everything I know and am.  You can ask me about the happiest moments of my life and I will swear with complete conviction that I wasn&#39;t happy at all.  That I fake it.  I put on a show for others.  The fucked up part is that I am not lying to you. That is really how the world is for me when I am depressed.  I really can&#39;t remember - I don&#39;t even know what it is like to be happy.</p>

<p>But catch me later on in a not depressed state and I do the exact opposite.
I know I was depressed because of the evidence.  &#39;Oh look, razor blades.  I didn&#39;t put them away.  How nice.  God damn, look at all that soda I didn&#39;t throw any of it away.  What a mess.&#39;
See, I don&#39;t remember how I felt.  I can&#39;t describe to you what it was like to sit on the floor with the razor blades.  I know I did it, I have memory.  I know I did it, the evidence is undeniable.
But I can&#39;t remember how I felt and I can&#39;t describe what I went through.</p>

<p>This creates something of an equation from hell.  When I am depressed I lack the ability to motivate myself to get help.  If help came to me I wouldn&#39;t turn it down.  I know I need it, I am screaming for it.  But I don&#39;t have the energy or the ability to do anything because of the demon that is depression.</p>

<p>But when I am not depressed I only understand I need help in a purely logical way.
&#39;Wow look at that mess.  That guy really needs help!.
Sit me down in a shrinks office and ask me to describe what it was like to sit on my living room floor for 36 hours straight and play with razor blades and I will retort with things like, &#39;I think I was really sad doc.&#39;.
Cause I don&#39;t fucking remember.</p>

<p>You sound like me when I am not depressed.  I mean, you know in some intrinsical way it is fucked up.  But because you are not currently fucked up you can&#39;t really connect all the dots you need to connect.</p>

<p>But then when you are fucked up you are much too fucked up to get help.</p>

<p>dude, I feel for ya.  I wish I could help.  I am praying for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your questions!</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;What makes you think apartment doors slamming had anything to do with you? And if they did, how did they know you were just about to wake up?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>At first, I didn&#39;t actually. I assumed my new neighbor was probably on a similar schedule as me. However, the way he slammed his door was pretty violent/loud. When i&#39;d wake up in the middle of the night, I started noticing I&#39;d hear his door slam. At the time I actually didn&#39;t think much of it. Although it did become like clockwork. More strange than anything else. I didn&#39;t make this connection until I was later on hospitalized and they would wake me up with loud slamming doors the second I fell asleep. After a few days, right when I woke up, they&#39;d slam a door next to mine. As far as how my neighbor might know when I was waking up, I&#39;m honestly unsure. However, in the hospital I was under constant observation and no more than an arms length from a staff member the entire time. They could see if I was tossing and turning, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Why do you believe cars honking their horns had anything to do with you? Could they have been unrelated to you? And if they did, how did they know you were just about to fall asleep?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, they could have been unrelated to me. It wasn&#39;t the act of someone honking a horn that bothered me. It was more like the amount of times it happened to me. There are only so many times you can think &quot;That&#39;s strange...wonder if it will happen aga<em>HONK</em>&quot; before it&#39;s clear that you&#39;re not imagining it. I&#39;d play with my iPhone stop watch and wait random intervals before asking myself the same question and getting another honk. That shit will really mess with you. No idea how they did it other than the ability to read minds is possible in some way - even if it&#39;s just that they learned how to read brain waves how they can read radio waves.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;When people cut you off in traffic or bumped into you, what made it clear that this was an ATTACK on you rather than the normal cutoffs and accidental bumping the rest of us experience?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a great question. Generally we all experience stuff like this and it&#39;s different based on where we live. For instance - living in a small town this probably wouldnt happen much. It all of a sidden increased 10x overnight. I&#39;d get bumped on the way to check the mail, cut off 5-10 times in a day, etc. This isn&#39;t normal because it was consistent. It&#39;s called &quot;blocking&quot; and it&#39;s real.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;How did your thoughts trigger car alarms? What did you think to make them go off?&quot; explained above</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Is it possible your neighbors stopped talking to you because you started acting strange? What indicated to you that they were in on this conspiracy to wear you down?&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is possible but unlikely, when this all started we (my gf and I) were good friends with them and I wasn&#39;t acting strange out of sheer fear that this might happen. We would see them all the time - the female and my GF were friends. She made the observation that she didn&#39;t see them anymore in and out on the way to work. Of course, I&#39;d already noticed but never brought it up. She would comment about awkward exchanges with them in the hallway and stuff. They&#39;d completely avoid me out of the blue, as if someone told them something untrue about me. That&#39;s the best way to describe it.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People with schizophrenia universally have auditory hallucinations. Those things you heard, they almost certainly didn&#39;t actually exist.</p>

<p>If neighbors stopped talking to you, it&#39;s possible they&#39;ve noticed that you are starting to act funny. Or they&#39;ve just changed and moved on. It does happen.</p>

<p>That&#39;s good. That means you&#39;re at least somewhat aware that what you experienced are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob5vubKWIac">classic symptions of schizophrenia</a>. When you talk about hearing voices making fun of you, talking directly to you as if they were right in your head...</p>

<p>That&#39;s schizophrenia.</p>

<p>The people around you being in on this, being against you, watching you, following you, attempting to disrupt your life? The TV being used to manipulate you, watch you, or even communicate with you?</p>

<p>That&#39;s schizophrenia.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to insult you. There is no shame in this. It happens. It&#39;s not your fault. Just make sure you share this with those close to you and that they assist you in seeking help.</p>

Clearly also you think you are far too clever to ever need medical help.
So.... Enjoy that descent into madness and later on, forced living in a medical psychological facility.</p>

<p>I do feel sorry for you though. Not that you&#39;ll care.

<p>Genuinely curious :) I&#39;ll be honest, in your stories you are very paranoid which means the reports can be seen as less valid, but on the other hand I&#39;ve had weird shit happen to me before that I can&#39;t explain to people without them discounting it.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the main reason that I didn&#39;t report what I was experiencing is because of two things. First, I didn&#39;t trust the doctors. i felt like this was a game that they were controlling. I had no doubt they were the ones doing it to me. Even before I was hospitalized and was experiencing group stalking, I felt the VA was behind it. I had some strange encounters with my doctor at the VA shortly before it all kicked off.</p>

<p>Second, I felt that they were &quot;trying too hard&quot; to fuck with me. It felt like they were doing anything they could to get me to report something. I probably would have reported what I was experiencing if they weren&#39;t constantly going over the top to make me uneasy. They kind of shot themselves in the foot so to speak.</p>

<p>As far as being labeled a Schizophrenic (which I wasn&#39;t labeled by the way), yes - I was trying to avoid that at all costs. Once you have that in a file somewhere, you&#39;ll never be able to defend yourself from anything without someone going &quot;Are you mentally ill?&quot;. It&#39;s basically a death sentence for your credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your explanation makes sense, if it&#39;s true that a diagnosis of schizophrenia would ruin your chances of supplemented PTSD treatment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really not doubting you all that much, especially since it doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;ve ever experienced anything like this before or since then (which, of course, would indicate schizophrenia).</p>

<p>However, being effectively trapped in a building, feeling unable to escape, can cause the mind to go into overdrive and start imagining stuff. It&#39;s happened to me before so I know it happens. Although I had some weird stuff happen that I <em>know</em> happened, too, so perhaps my point is moot.</p>

<p>Stay safe out there. Try not to dwell on it, I think, and if you&#39;re ever in that situation again, just try to get some sleep and see if it goes away. I&#39;m not saying it didn&#39;t happen. Just telling you what I would do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Negative, at first I was just noticing this one guy pull over in front of my apartment and whip out a laptop and a USB antenna of some kind. Didn&#39;t think much of it until it started happening by more than one person a couple times a day. Even then, I didn&#39;t actually care. Once weird stuff started showing up on my phone am laptop, I became concerned and started pointing them out to my GF. One vehicle that frequented had a &quot;hack.RVA&quot; sticker on the bumper. After researching that I realized that that company is local and teaches wireless hacking and security. Thanks</p>

<p>Edit- on my phone. Apologize for typos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this constructive post.</p>

<p>I was on the fence about posting this as it&#39;s been months since everything stopped. I decided I&#39;d rather let anyone else who is out there dealing with these people know that they are not alone. I know people will think I&#39;m crazy. The unfortunate truth is that these acts were done in a way to make me look insane. I lose my credibility because the assaults basically mimic someone who is mentally ill. However, I know that there are people out there who will believe me and that others will hopefully see this, even if they don&#39;t comment.</p>

<p>These people already know where I live, they had complete access to me for at the least 50+ days - there probably isn&#39;t much they don&#39;t know so I&#39;m just rolling the dice. I will try to keep a low profile though.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just here to shed some light on my experiences last year. Somebody is bound to eventually get me in touch with somebody else that this has happened to.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for posting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, I have some things I&#39;d like to say.</p>

<p>I had a best friend who was going schizo, it was scary shit. He is not dead though, and in a matter of weeks he was ok and back to normal. It was with a doctors help. However, it doesn&#39;t sound like your behaviour was similar to his at all, and for some reason I believe you. I have been fearing the same thing happening to me. While the Chris Dorner case was still hot, I had 2 posts go number 1, and 2, and even switch with eachother. 2 days after that, I noticed a black SUV following me with a men in black looking dude in it. I know he was following me, but made it as if I had no idea (and did a damn good job). My parents told me to relax and didn&#39;t believe me until I showed them the pictures I took on my phone. At that point even they got worried, because our phones have been tapped before, and we have been watched by the government before as well. This time I think it&#39;s me they&#39;re looking at, not my dad. I stopped posting on the r/dornercase sub. I notice one of the men in the vehicle weekly. I remember an AMA where a girl talked about a raid on her home because of her brother, her description fit what is happening to me very well. I also know people who grew up being test subjects in some kind of weird home type deal. I don&#39;t know what to do, but, I think i believe you.</p>

<p>That&#39;s good. That means you&#39;re at least somewhat aware that what you experienced are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob5vubKWIac">classic symptions of schizophrenia</a>. When you talk about hearing voices making fun of you, talking directly to you as if they were right in your head...</p>

<p>That&#39;s schizophrenia.</p>

<p>The people around you being in on this, being against you, watching you, following you, attempting to disrupt your life? The TV being used to manipulate you, watch you, or even communicate with you?</p>

<p>That&#39;s schizophrenia.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to insult you. There is no shame in this. It happens. It&#39;s not your fault. Just make sure you share this with those close to you and that they assist you in seeking help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your questions!</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;What makes you think apartment doors slamming had anything to do with you? And if they did, how did they know you were just about to wake up?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>At first, I didn&#39;t actually. I assumed my new neighbor was probably on a similar schedule as me. However, the way he slammed his door was pretty violent/loud. When i&#39;d wake up in the middle of the night, I started noticing I&#39;d hear his door slam. At the time I actually didn&#39;t think much of it. Although it did become like clockwork. More strange than anything else. I didn&#39;t make this connection until I was later on hospitalized and they would wake me up with loud slamming doors the second I fell asleep. After a few days, right when I woke up, they&#39;d slam a door next to mine. As far as how my neighbor might know when I was waking up, I&#39;m honestly unsure. However, in the hospital I was under constant observation and no more than an arms length from a staff member the entire time. They could see if I was tossing and turning, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Why do you believe cars honking their horns had anything to do with you? Could they have been unrelated to you? And if they did, how did they know you were just about to fall asleep?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, they could have been unrelated to me. It wasn&#39;t the act of someone honking a horn that bothered me. It was more like the amount of times it happened to me. There are only so many times you can think &quot;That&#39;s strange...wonder if it will happen aga<em>HONK</em>&quot; before it&#39;s clear that you&#39;re not imagining it. I&#39;d play with my iPhone stop watch and wait random intervals before asking myself the same question and getting another honk. That shit will really mess with you. No idea how they did it other than the ability to read minds is possible in some way - even if it&#39;s just that they learned how to read brain waves how they can read radio waves.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;When people cut you off in traffic or bumped into you, what made it clear that this was an ATTACK on you rather than the normal cutoffs and accidental bumping the rest of us experience?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a great question. Generally we all experience stuff like this and it&#39;s different based on where we live. For instance - living in a small town this probably wouldnt happen much. It all of a sidden increased 10x overnight. I&#39;d get bumped on the way to check the mail, cut off 5-10 times in a day, etc. This isn&#39;t normal because it was consistent. It&#39;s called &quot;blocking&quot; and it&#39;s real.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;How did your thoughts trigger car alarms? What did you think to make them go off?&quot; explained above</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Is it possible your neighbors stopped talking to you because you started acting strange? What indicated to you that they were in on this conspiracy to wear you down?&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is possible but unlikely, when this all started we (my gf and I) were good friends with them and I wasn&#39;t acting strange out of sheer fear that this might happen. We would see them all the time - the female and my GF were friends. She made the observation that she didn&#39;t see them anymore in and out on the way to work. Of course, I&#39;d already noticed but never brought it up. She would comment about awkward exchanges with them in the hallway and stuff. They&#39;d completely avoid me out of the blue, as if someone told them something untrue about me. That&#39;s the best way to describe it.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s cute. You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t care. Psychology doesn&#39;t have an answer for everything. Apparently redditors do though. I&#39;ll never be forced to live anywhere. I&#39;m not ill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is, but that perception doesn&#39;t have to be the way it is for you. My grandmother is the same way, and I hate it. I don&#39;t hate it because she&#39;s delusional though. I hate it because it is such a heavy burden to carry. Her perception of her reality is so strong in her mind she can&#39;t or won&#39;t even consider the possibility that maybe some of it is in her head. I&#39;ve tried for so long to get her to question herself and nothing has worked. It&#39;s wearing me down. </p>

<p>My grandfather committed suicide in 1985, two years before I was born. My grandmother found him in their bedroom with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. She lived in that home for two more years, alone, before moving to another city far away. She was also committed for a short time and claims to have been heavily sedated, sexually assualted, had fellow patients finish her sentences or refer to her inner thoughts. She believed television broadcasts were specifically written or entirely faked for the intent of harassment. She believes she is being watched or monitored by individuals either from or connected to the city she once called home. She believes she is followed in grocery stores. She believes that in situations where most people would view as completely innocent conversation with a stranger are full with phrases of speech used intentionally to &#39;get her inside her head&#39;. </p>

<p>I argue with her over these &#39;signs&#39; or proof. She knows I believe its in her head, but once a month she will mention a recent experience she had recently. She will smile as if she knows she&#39;s just presented such strong evidence that I will no longer doubt her sanity. </p>

<p>But she&#39;s wrong. She just describes a typical everyday polite interaction with a stranger in public. If I ask her what did this person do to make her believe she was being harassed she reacts with anger. She tells me, &quot;I just know!&quot; She doesn&#39;t even have the ability to ask herself why she believes what she does. She is so convinced of her sanity that she blocks out the ability to recognize her irrationality. She ignores all of the signs that she might not be thinking clearly because she wants to believe what she wants. It&#39;s so frustrating to me. It kills me a tiny bit everytime I&#39;m reminded I can&#39;t help her find peace. </p>

<p>Your story reminds me so much of my grandmother, and how much I love her. Please, just consider that you may be wrong and this is in your head. Ignore your feelings, they could be lying to you. Focus on rationality. Try to tear apart your own narrative. Try to disprove yourself. Sane people would react to your situation with doubt and fear, their first and constant urge would be to question their own sanity. </p>

<p>Speak to someone. The technology required and sheer number of individuals that would be necessary to do this to you either doesn&#39;t exist or is too unrealistic to be plausible. Why were you picked? What purpose did the harassment serve? You say you resisted showing any response to what happens to you, ask yourself to explain why they continued onwards even though they couldn&#39;t break you. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know why I typed that last two paragraphs. If it doesn&#39;t work for my grandmother it won&#39;t work for you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry this is your reality, and I hope one day you decide to seek help. Life doesn&#39;t have to be like you are convinced it is.</p>
