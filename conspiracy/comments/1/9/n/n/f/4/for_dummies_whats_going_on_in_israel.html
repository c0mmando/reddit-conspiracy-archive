        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Imagine you live in a beautiful flat. A lot of space, a nice view and more or less bearable neighbors.</p>

<p>One day, a stranger barges in and throws himself on your couch. He eats your food, thrashes around and finally, he sends you in the hall. Every time you need a toilet, he checks your pockets and asks you who you are and what are you doing there. When you ask him what is he doing in your flat in the first place, he tells you a very old book says that flat is actually his and that you living there for years and years was actually an act of violence against him.</p>

<p>Days and weeks go by when you lose your mind. You start shouting and in protest, you kick the door, barely damaging it. The police comes, a whole army of them, bashing your head in, sending you to the hospital. When you come back, you can’t even use the toilet anymore and every once in a while, the police comes and kicks you some more, for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>You realize there are other people in the building, so you ask around what the hell is going on. Some say it’s wrong and that they will have a meeting very soon. Except the neighbor from the last floor. He says the stranger has the right to defend himself from you and sends him a baseball bat to help him.</p>

<p>If this story isn’t straightforward enough: you are Palestine, the stranger is Israel, the neighbor from the last floor is America and other neighbors is the rest of the world.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to be clear here, before someone says I&#39;m anti-Semitic and the whole debate turns into name-calling: Criticizing Israel does not imply anti-Semitism, as every sane person knows. And while someone will surely bring up the Holocaust, one should be even more appalled about what Israel is doing to the Palestinians BECAUSE of the Holocaust. The Jews went through the worst hell in recent history and one would think they would never segregate, put a fence around, or kill anyone, exactly because they know what it feels like to be persecuted.</p>

<p>So, please think about that, before saying anything stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your analogy is flawed in several places.</p>

<p>For it to work you&#39;re going to have to change a few things: You are living in a beautiful flat that <strong>you&#39;re renting from someone else</strong>. The landlord leaves and splits the ownership between your neighbor, you and some guy you&#39;ve never met before. Your neighbor then takes your keys. The new guy takes the keys from the neighbor. You and the new guy get into a fight over who the keys really belong to, but the new guy is bigger than you and keeps pushing you down and putting his stuff in your old rooms. Instead of appealing to the local courts, you decide to fight dirty.</p>

<p>And on and on and on. The new guy is the Zionists. The original landlord is the British and Ottoman empires and the neighbor is Jordan, Egypt and Syria.</p>

<p>Naturally, if this comment isn&#39;t at least -4 after 10 minutes, I will be very disappointed in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. After all, the average poster here does like there version of history and really doesn&#39;t like it when they are presented with facts stated that they aren&#39;t completely correct.</p>

<p>As for you, OP, you&#39;re falling into the typical &quot;I&#39;m not an anti-Semite!&quot; trap. Nobody called you an anti-Semite. Nobody. In fact, I could probably count the amount of times that a legitimate criticism of Israel was called anti-Semitic on reddit on a single hand. And nobody is using &quot;the Holocaust&quot; to justify anything, certainly not on reddit.</p>

<p>I was frankly surprised at the number of upvotes I have. In general, reddit comments are rather dogmatic and things arguing with the accepted subreddit narrative tend to get downvoted with little to no intellectual arguments. A comment about how the Holocaust is a Jew lie will have a better chance of getting upvoted than a comment about how Hamas are not wonderful.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;m pleasantly surprised and so should anyone else who frequents this subreddit.</p>

Arafats first response to the Jordanian (and later Israeli) occupation of the West Bank was to start Black September, a terror organization who made plane hijackings a household term.

    <div class="md"><p>Britain didn&#39;t really &quot;own&quot; it, but they were the rulers. Historically, the last time the Palestinians had self rule (excluding Jordan which used to be part of Palestine) was almost a thousand years ago. Ever since then they were pretty happy being under whatever foreign rule happened to be in the area at the time, up until the British Mandate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to point it out as the standard anti-Israel narrative likes to ignore this fact in order to paint Israel as a land-grabber starting from the 1930s seeking to take over and push out the Palestinians. This narrative states that the Zionists came in, fought the Palestinians and took their land. Saying that the Palestinians were never really in charge of their own country when the Zionists took control changes matters. They didn&#39;t usurp the Palestinian leaders and take the land, they simply replaced the British who replaced the Turks before them who replaced the Mamaluks before them and the Sultanate before them and the Seljuks before them and Saladin before them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no worries. I am happy to disagree but i am more happy that we can discuss this kind of topics as i feel it is more productive then arguing about what one&#39;s favorite movie is.</p>

<p>&quot;soldier all you&#39;re doing is your job or duty&quot; are you familiar with the nuremberg defence? </p>

<p>After world war 2 Nazi were put on trial for their actions and their main legal argument was &quot;we were just doing our duty&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, the argument can be used for evil motives.</p>

<p>In that case I would say they should have deserted, the Jews were innocent civilians. To be more exact in my stating my beliefs I should say that fighting in war is pardonable as long as the normal duties of a soldier are performed (killing the guy that&#39;s trying to kill you). In the case of the Nazis they clearly weren&#39;t doing that. My definition of a soldier is one who fights in a war against an enemy who is fighting him back. Killing anyone other than the enemy would be extracurricular and extenuating circumstances. I&#39;m not defending extracurricular activities or extenuating circumstances. Those aren&#39;t in the job description and therefore not a part of doing the soldiers job.</p>

<p>It is important to look at context, absolutes don&#39;t exist in the natural world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm it is interesting to think about. </p>

<p>The founding fathers of America believe the federal governments only role is national defence. A person man may have a legal and more importantly moral grounds to kill people to protect their nation. </p>

<p>Applying these ideas to the real events. I think this is a core issue in terms of America&#39;s involvement in the middle east. Some believe that soliders that kill people in Iraq and Afaghastan is justified because of the belief it is national defence. </p>

<p>But noting that the NAZIs were blind to the immorality of their actions and they believed their actions was national defence and not wars of aggression as hard as that is to imagine that is what many Nazi soliders believed (as the NAZI regime lied to the public and said poland attack germany first). Is it not possible that propaganda (all so know as public relations and marketing) could be used to get US soliders to fight in wars that are injustice using similar tactics? for example associating bin ladin with suddam hussian and saying he had weapons of mass destruction convinced the soliders that it was their duty to fight and kill people in Iraq? not say that is the case just saying that is a possibility. In which case how do you safe gaurd to make sure the actions of a solider&#39;s duty are justified knowing soliders can be manipulated by corrupt leaders? </p>

<p>Just ideas i thought i would put out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really good point, and unfortunately that&#39;s entirely possible that that could happen. I would think that the soldier would be judged by God (or decided pardoned or guilty) by what he knew, if he was told it was self-defense then in his heart he was doing something pardonable. On the other hand if he knew the truth he&#39;s still at fault. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>right, very interesting. </p>

<p>These ideas seem to reinforce the notion that the healthy of society is only equal to those engaged in trying to understand it, thus it is important that we in others be engaged in trying to understand as deeply as possible in political issues particular war for the best possible safe gaurd against immoral acts of aggression. If we expect soliders to put their life on the line to defend the nation we should at least respect that by living up to our part of being engaged in the political processes. Reading the constiution i feel is a must for every citizen to understand how the founding fathers imagined the country should run.</p>

<p>Thanks for the discussion. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah? You believe that? That&#39;s cute, but this is reality where there either isn&#39;t a god, or he doesn&#39;t care, so we&#39;re going to have to go by what we know and these guys were here first! Okay? Okay!&quot;</p>

<p>Personally I think we should just take all people out of that region and turn it into farmland or something. If no one can be responsible about it, we&#39;re just going to have to take it away for everyone. Want to act like fucking children?

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Just to be clear here, before someone says I&#39;m anti-Semitic and the whole debate turns into name-calling</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I swear, critics of Israel cry about and bring up anti-Semitism much more than people who defend Israel do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And while someone will surely bring up the Holocaust, one should be even more appalled about what Israel is doing to the Palestinians BECAUSE of the Holocaust. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stop being retarded. You think when Israel erects a checkpoint it&#39;s because of the Holocaust, you think when they erect a security barrier, it&#39;s because of the Holocaust, you think when they carry out an air operation over Gaza, it&#39;s because of the Holocaust?</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s because Palestinians are notorious for their suicide bombings inside Israel, sending women and children at times, it&#39;s because even after completely withdrawing from Gaza, they were thanked by thousands upon thousands of rockets etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jews went through the worst hell in recent history and one would think they would never segregate, put a fence around, or kill anyone, exactly because they know what it feels like to be persecuted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah right, so because the Jews were subjected to genocide, the state of Israel is not allowed to take protective measures that virtually any other state would take in its position? Strong logic.</p>

<p>Let me tell you what&#39;s actually happening in Israel (in layman&#39;s terms):</p>

<p>First of all, it&#39;s important to know a little history. The Southern Levant is home to the spiritual, religious and ancestral homeland of the Jewish people, the &quot;Land of Israel&quot; (Eretz Yisrael) and was home to various Israelite tribes. The Levant was strategically an incredibly important piece of land as and such, it was conquered by various civilizations, and most relevant to what I&#39;m writing, the Romans. As we know, Jews were subject to pogrom, forced conversion, mass expulsion and second class citizenship throughout history, it was no different under Roman rule which was brutal and oppressive.</p>

<p>The Jews revolted several times but each attempt failed. After the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), the Romans decided to erase any trace of the Jews from history, the Jewish intelligentsia were murdered, holy texts burned and Judea and Samaria to Syria Palaestina - now you&#39;re probably thinking Palaestina sounds like Palestine and you&#39;re right, &quot;Palestine&quot; is just a bastardized version of Palaestina. The Romans decided to call it Palaestina to particularly spite the Jews as it referred to the Philistines who were the ancient enemies of the Jewish people. The Philistines were NOT Arab people, they were Aegean people from in and around the Greek islands who settled in what is known as Gaza which is why they were known as &quot;Sea People&quot;.</p>

<p>So fast forward to WW1, the Ottoman Empire had previously conquered vast amounts of land, including &quot;Palestine&quot;. Palestine was never an independent entity or state within the empire, the land was merely incorporated into the &quot;Syrian&quot; province (which is why Syrians often claimed Palestine as part of &quot;Greater Syria&quot; at one point). The Ottoman Empire sided with the axis, they lost the war and as a result, the empire collapsed. Former Ottoman territory then came into the hands of the British and French who divided the territory up under the Sykes-Picot agreement, carving out several Arab states and creating what is essentially the Middle East as we know it - this happened around 1915 but it&#39;s important to note that Jews had been returning and settling in &quot;Palestine&quot; since the mid-late 1800&#39;s on land that they purchased. Around this time, Jewish leaders were pushing the British to help them [re]establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine as the British were in control of the land (it was placed under a mandate). </p>

<p>The British agreed and promised to allow and facilitate Jewish settlement in Palestine, a right afforded to the Jews and enshrined in international law (See Balfour Decleration, San Remo conference etc) however around 1920, the British severed some 75% of the land promised to the Jews in order to create the Arab state of Transjordan (now known simply as Jordan) so the Jews were left with a long, narrow slither of land. Throughout this time, Jews had been moving to Palestine in waves of immigration known as aliyah. Fun fact: living standards and prosperity in Palestine (which was otherwise a land in decline under Ottoman rule) rose in tandem with increasing Jewish settlement as they brought with them important agricultural skills amongst others.</p>

<p>Now there had been an Arab population in Palestine for hundreds of years (arriving with the Islamic conquests) and naturally, they began to feel &quot;threatened&quot; by increasing Jewish immigration (who were immigrating because of increasing persecution in Europe), a series of terrible events took place such as the Hebron Massacre where the ancient Jewish community was completely wiped out, the Great Arab revolt, the Jaffa Riots etc, in fact, the earliest attack on Jews in Palestine by Arabs dates back to something like 1870 on Petach Tikva. In response to such attacks, Jews began to establish defense organizations, these arrived as early as 1910 and notably ended up with the likes of Haganah who were a purely defensive organization (clue is in the name) and eventually the notorious Irgun and Lehi who adopted Haganah&#39;s policy of defense but went on the offensive after increasing Arab violence against Jewish communities.</p>

<p>So now we have the rise of Nazi Germany, increasing persecution of Jews, a civil war between Jews and Arabs brewing in Palestine and the British losing control in Palestine - it was truly a mess. The League of Nations/UN proposed several partition plans to solve the fighting and a day before the British Mandate was due to expire, the Jews declared independence according to the UN partition plan and thus the state of Israel was created. As a result of this, a coalition of Arab states (Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen etc) invaded the nascent state of Israel with the aim of destroying it and cleansing the land of Jews. It was actually Stalin who ensured the survival of Israel, he funneled weapons through Czechoslovakia in order to establish Soviet influence. The Arab states were swiftly defeated and as a result, a de facto population transfer took place, some 600,000 Palestinians fled/were expelled and some 700,000 Jews fled/were expelled from their homes in Arab lands. </p>

<p>As a result of this war in 1948, Egypt occupied Gaza and Jordan occupied what is now known as the &quot;West Bank&quot;, both were placed under cruel military rule - these occupations lasted decades yet no Palestinian state was declared, instead both countries merely saw the land as an extension of their own, it was more about pan-Arabism than any independent Palestinian polity. Another war (with similar sides) happened in 1967, again the Arabs were swiftly defeated and as a result, Israel occupied Gaza, the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. Israel returned the Sinai in return for peace, it offered the Golan heights back etc - Israel today is less than half the size it was during its &quot;peak&quot;. In 2005, Israel completely disengaged from Gaza and was left in control of the West Bank and the Golan Heights. It&#39;s worth noting that Israel occupied the West Bank from Jordan but from which sovereign state did Jordan occupy it from considering there has never been a sovereign state of &quot;Palestine&quot;?</p>

<p>Right, so that&#39;s the basic history up until recent years. As it stands now, you have Gaza which is run by a bunch of genocidal maniacs, funded and armed by Iran who care more about surviving as an entity and fighting against Israel than they do protecting their own. Hamas are a lost cause. In the West Bank, based on the above, Israel disputes ownership of the land and in response to a campaign of Arab violence against Jews in Palestine which dates back over a century, Israel eventually erected checkpoints, the security barrier and blockaded Gaza etc - these were all in response to unrelenting rocket fire and massive suicide bombing campaigns.</p>

<p>So a more fitting analogy would be... Imagine if you were kicked out of your old house, some squatters move in and because they&#39;ve been there for a while, people just assume they own it, you eventually get promised by the authorities that you&#39;ll get your house back and you try to move back in but this causes a fight with the squatters. You agree to share the house but they want it all... Eventually the squatters friend come and try to forcefully evict you but you beat them, the same happens and you beat them but in fact drive them from their own homes! You give back some of their homes to make peace and you&#39;re now in control of your own home and you&#39;re forced to treat the squatters like children because they constantly try to attack you even though they&#39;re incredibly weak in comparison. Now the squatters have the worlds sympathy and claim that YOU moved in and attacked THEM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>take a read sometime at the history of the Bar Kochba revolt. </p>

<p>Hadrian had been an asshole to Jews, which lead to the revolt, but the revolt itself was worthless. Fustrated at the Israelites/Jews newest rebellion, Hadrian adopted the policy of &quot;scorched earth&quot; to quell it. Bar Kochbas&#39; revolt caused the death of 580,000 Israelites. 985 town and villages and 50 fortified towns. And for what? One year of Bar Kochba being <em>Nasi</em>? feh... All this nonsense took place between 132 and 136. Hadrian was dead in 138. If the Israelites had never bothered to have revolted, Jews would have not lost all we did. Jews didn&#39;t even lose the most. The Samaritans were almost completely wiped out after revolting.  </p>

<p>You should check out in the War of Kitos in 115. Where Diaspora Jews across North Africa, Mesopotamia and Cyprus, rebelled against leftover Roman Garrisons and temples. The Jews eventually began massacring locals. Libya was wiped out people and all:</p>

<p><em>&quot;The Jews ... waged war on the inhabitants throughout Libya in the most savage fashion, and to such an extent was the country wasted that, its cultivators having been slain, its land would have remained utterly depopulated, had not the Emperor Hadrian gathered settlers from other places and sent them thither, for the inhabitants had been wiped out.&quot;[2]</em></p>

<p>Zionists like to worship Bar Kochba but he never won anything. His &quot;victory&quot; was Pyrrhic. We Jews like to say how we survived empires and nations that are now lost to time. If Jews had never revolted like they did the second time, Hadrian would not have adopted Scorched Earth... Imagine how history would have played out if the Jews had never revolted? </p>

<p>I&#39;d be glad to clarify the rest of what you wrote. You have a lot of &quot;half-truths&quot;. I used to be a Zionist, I am very familiar with your arguments. However, if you only read Dershwitz and Zionist media, you will never get the full side of the story. Maybe tomorrow, But  for now I gotta be up for school tomorrow! :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we took advantage of them. You don&#39;t think Israel is taking advantage of the U.S.? They shout anti semitism and always remind everyone of the Holocaust. They do it so often that some countries (1 in particular) takes better care of Israel than their own citizens! That is a damn shame. I&#39;ll tell you what, put monetary and military aid to a vote through the citizens and see if Israel still gets the billions they currently get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right and don&#39;t forget to ignore the fact that the British Mandate WAS a two-state solution: Jews got Israel and Palestinians got Transjordan. </p>

<p>However, the Palestinians behaved so appallingly the Jordanian government kicked them out. That&#39;s why they now feel somehow entitled to Israel. </p>

<p>Having sided with the Axis powers in WWII, Palestinians were lucky to get ANYTHING afterward, much less their own country. It&#39;s not Israel&#39;s fault the Palestinians fucked up Jordan for themselves. Palestinians need to be begging for forgiveness from Jordan and trying to get &quot;their&quot; land and citizenship reinstated there, not trying to take over Israel.</p>
