I&#39;m personally not crazy about Wilcock and don&#39;t quite know what to make of him one way or the other.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s for real or not.

    <div class="md"><p>IT&#39;S SATIRE. </p>

<p>The Gore report? Really? </p>

<p>It&#39;s satire on global warming and Al Gore. Terrible satire but satire nevertheless.</p>
</div>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s satire, why then did it get pulled so quickly from his roster and never returned?  Why was it all but excised from the net?  Why has it been so difficult to find the archive of it when so many other reports by him are almost effortlessly easy?</p>

<p>While it may indeed be satire, the above questions are valid ones that claiming the piece was &quot;only satire&quot; does <em>not</em> account for.  Is it possible that his &quot;satire&quot; unintentionally (or intentionally) got close enough to a certain aspect of a truth that TPTB didn&#39;t want shared with the public?</p>

<p>Ultimately, if it <em>was</em> indeed &quot;only satire&quot;, then it would seem that someone as interested in keeping with the status quo like Limbaugh is would not only have kept the piece up, but he would have shotgunned it across the interwebs so that everyone could hear it and he could possibly make even more fun of &quot;all the tinfoil hat wearers that gullibly fell for what I said as I was making <em>fun</em> of them.&quot;</p>

<p>Instead the piece is apparently totally scrubbed from his show and is, it seems, <em>very</em> difficult to find.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not something that jives with an explanation of it being a &quot;simple satirical piece and that&#39;s it&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.  So then if this is/was a satire piece, then that&#39;s good to know.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an uncritical naysayer debunker shill, but I also certainly don&#39;t want to be the type to think something is valid if it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information.</p>

<li><p>The voice is an impersonation, it&#39;s not actually his voice.  I can tell because I&#39;ve listened to the guy off and on for fifteen years (usually until I get disgusted by one thing or another that he says).</p></li>
<li><p>He would never ever ever ever ever ever admit to anthropogenic global warming.  Ever.  The only way he would say something like that is if he was being sarcastic and the way this voice personality says it and, given the context, appears completely convinced of anthropogenic global warming, it&#39;s definitely not Rush Limbaugh.</p></li>
<li><p>Rush Limbaugh would not immediately accept a report purporting to NASA&#39;s knowledge of extra-terrestrial life.  This is not so much because he is skeptical of it, it&#39;s more that he doesn&#39;t break &quot;fringe&quot; news like this, he only comments on news vetted by AP, CBS, NYT, WSJ, et al. and, at the furthest, news that appears on the tenth page of those major media sources.  The most fringe news source he uses is Fox &quot;News.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>If this NASA report were indeed true and even if it were vetted by major news sources, the fact that it presumes anthropogenic global warming and pushes an agenda directly contradicting Rush&#39;s own views, given his prejudices regarding such viewpoints, he would immediately reject this report purely upon this fact.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>So all of these points are pretty much strictly based on your own personal opinion/perspective of Limbaugh.</p>

<p>1) I, again, have pretty much <em>never</em> heard Limbaugh.</p>

<p>2) You seem to be pretty knowledgeable about the man.</p>

<p>This being said, it would seem that even though every sentence you typed could be started with a &quot;Well, I personally think that...&quot;, or an &quot;In my personal opinion...&quot; antecedent, the things that you&#39;ve said none the less seem to be good and valid to me.</p>

<p>I thank you for inserting these thoughts into this conversation, as it allows me and others reading this to consider the possibility that this really <em>might</em> very well be a hoax.</p>

<p>Again, thank you.  I feel the points you made seem valid to me and are definitely worth considering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I suppose it <em>could</em> be real but, if it is, I would suggest Rush Limbaugh must&#39;ve started using drugs <em>again</em> (he used to abuse prescription medication). :P</p>

<p>I should also add that Rush <em>has</em> shifted a bit in his views from &quot;militaristic right-wing corporatist&quot; to &quot;semi-militaristic leaning-classic-liberal.&quot;  Typically neither position embraces anthropomorphic global warming.</p>

<p>If I haven&#39;t been clear enough, here is a quote from Limbaugh:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Despite the hysterics of a few pseudo-scientists, there is no reason to believe in global warming.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>That&#39;s</em> your reason for thinking Wilcock is full of shit?  You&#39;re either saying A) reincarnation itself is full of shit, B) Wilcock is full of shit for <em>saying</em> he&#39;s the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce, or C) both.</p>

<p>It it&#39;s A, then you have a <em>looot</em> to learn.  There&#39;s a lot more you don&#39;t know about this world and existence than there is that you do.  Go research the extensive studies of Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross, and Dr. Ian Stevenson for starters, then get back to me.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s B, then that may or may not be valid, as Wilcock may not be Edgar Cayce reincarnated at all.  That much might be true.  He and his close associates <em>do</em> indeed look a lot like Cayce and Cayce&#39;s close associates, however, in a side by side picture comparison.  That much is valid also.  A picture alone does not a reincarnation case make, however, and - again - Wilcock <em>may</em> indeed be off base in thinking he&#39;s Cayce reincarnated.  Who knows.</p>

<p>If C, then see my first point.</p>
