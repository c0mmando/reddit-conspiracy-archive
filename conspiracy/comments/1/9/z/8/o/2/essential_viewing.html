       I just revisited
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7EwXmxpExw">
        The Century of the Self
       </a>
       for the second or third time and while I was watching it, I couldn't help but think that this was one of the most influential and important documentaries I had seen since my 9/11 awakening.  And if I were pick one video as a starting point; as an introduction into the world of conspiracy theories, that this would be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that got me thinking about all the other videos that I've seen and if I were to try and introduce this subject to a friend or family member that is still asleep, what videos, and in what order would I want to show them?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be cool to try and create a list of essential videos to watch, that step by step will lead you deeper through the rabbit hole.  Each one acting as a precursor for the next.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll start with some big ones I can remember and I'll add and move around videos as they're suggested.  Even short clips will be considered.

       Seriously? Zeitgeist? The first one was literally one of the biggest jokes I've seen peddled as a "documentary."
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'd like to also add that anyone who supports their "Venus Project" solution has to be completely clueless. But seriously the part on religion is one of the most poorly researched things I've seen in years. Also, Peter Joseph later distanced himself from 9/11 truth so that part of the documentary clearly was added just to draw "truthers" in to their bullshit solution.

       Not sure why Zeitgeist gets so much flack around here. Looking back, the first one wasn't exactly great, but it was the film that got me on the road to finding out more about those subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sort of torn with regards to the Venus Project thing. I honestly can't see a better solution than a resource based economy - it genuinely looks like the best way to advance humanity. Will it come about within our lifetime? Fuck no. Unfortunately we live in a world full of idiots, and for every 1 person that is willing to keep a level head and work towards a better future, there are 99 that will fuck things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's got me confused about the whole 'movement' now, is that they've apparently cut ties with the Venus Project, so i don't exactly know where their 'movement' is going.

       It probably gets a lot of flack because it is the epitome of horrible research. Calling it a documentary is really a misnomer, IMO. Also the Venus Project is literally indistinguishable from what most people would call the "New World Order" in most ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't speak to the last part I haven't really kept up with what they're doing after seeing all the documentaries and actually looking into them a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: also, I'm sure it also gets a lot of flack because of Joseph's whole disavowal of the "9/11 truth" thing.

       I'm not sure how you've made that connection. I can see how you'd connect something like Agenda 21 to the NWO, but that is pretty far removed from what the Venus Project is, even if it masquerades itself as having many similar goals. Anyone with half an ounce of sense can see that Agenda 21 has nothing to do with 'sustainability' though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest issue with that is the motives behind such a thing, anyway. I'm sure you
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       use a Venus Project-type system to implement world social control, but you could also use it to solve a lot of the problems that we face today, and take humanity to the next level of social and technological progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, i agree that the first film wasn't done particularly well. And Joseph basically admits that the 9/11 section of the was just there as an audience grab when he was on Joe Rogan's podcast. Certainly worked on me, and i'm glad of it - it prompted me to start looking into things like this.

       Actually, it's exactly what the Project is designed to do. Joseph even said that you would be "reeducated" if you didn't see things the way they do. Everything would be controlled, though in this case it would be a "benevolent" machine. How wonderful!

       Well it certainly isn't perfect, but i can't see it being anywhere near as bad as the situation we're in now. I get the impression that you assume that the Venus Project would somehow trap us into some acceptable social norms that we don't want. Well guess what - we have that now. You're talking as if you think we're all currently free to do and think as we will, but we very much aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least with a resource based economy, we wouldn't be required to blow the fuck out of other countries and leave people to starve to death all over the world. There are issues with it, of course, but it's a hell of a step forward from where we currently are. We're way past the stage where we can allow people to be completely 'free', anyway. There are 7 billion people on this planet, it's hardly practical to let everyone do what they want without thought for others or the environment. Freedom is a complete illusion in the modern world.

       That's the kind of thinking I find legitimately worrisome. Clearly you don't see the problems with it. I encourage you to look to some of Joseph's interviews with people who disagree with him or to previous attempts at similar projects in the past. Also I don't know if you're a fan of the UN but you might want to look into that whole connection with the project as well. If you're a fan of the UN then it'll probably just reinforce your beliefs.

       You might also want to look at what a miserable failure it's been, practically speaking. It's also based on non-existent technology. Why don't we just base a theoretical society on perpetual motion machines or time travel or teleportation? Obviously those are all less realistic but come on, how can you support something that's built on an entirely non-existent framework?

       Whether it's worrisome or not, it doesn't change the fact that
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       freedom just isn't possible. I'm talking about freedom to acquire whatever resources you want to please yourself - like John Travolta's freedom to have 2 jets and a runway at his 40 bedroom house. That just isn't something you can do on a planet with finite resources and 7 billion people to share them with; it's ridiculous. Freedom of expression etc are completely different, and i can't see them being impacted negatively by this vision. Freedom is a nice idea, but we all have to abide by some rules, otherwise everything would go to utter shit.

       I could completely understand how it could have failed in the current system, because it is so at odds with it. As for the technology, i haven't seen a single example that doesn't yet exist being touted as fundamental to a resource-based economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do, however, make a good point about the framework being non-existent. This is the biggest doubt i have about the whole thing. I just can't see how we would transition from where we are now, to the vision that Fresco has. And tbh, i'm not actually a huge fan of the Venus Project itself, rather than the concept of a resource based economy; it just so happens that it is the poster-child for it. It seems like he has some great ideas, but in actual fact, i haven't seen him get down to anything beyond drawing pretty pictures on his website.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly believe it's totally possible, and would be a huge leap forward in terms of human progress. But if everything fell apart tomorrow, the world went to shit, and after 2 years of living in a state of complete collapse, we decided to band together and set out this vision for the future - I have a very hard time seeing how we'd get from there to something that resembled a functioning society.
      </p>

       Everything works in stages. We didn't jump from using horse-hair bulbs to LEDs, and we won't jump from where we are now to a RBE, without some fairly significant steps in-between.

       Try all of the technology Peter Joseph (edit: and Fresco, they're really inseparable) talks about. It's theoretical or at the most basic stage it's like planning Google in the 60s.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but I don't see why you'd be promoting an RBE while doubting the Venus Project since that's what it's all about. I find that confusing.

       eh I wouldn't dismiss the first part of zeitgeist as bogus. Indeed there were discrepancies in the area of Horus's birthday but not much more. What there giving you is a glimpse into the occult. A glimpse of what is taught in secret societies all over the world. And some would argue, the truth. Are you a christian?

       Nope. Looking at the first part, the mythology doesn't line up. It is factually incorrect. Zietgiest is a good way to get started but there are much better docs out there.

       Ugh reading through these comments reminds me why I hardly visit this sub anymore. Buncha haters. But I just wanted to thank you for recommending CoS. I'm about half way through and I can't stop watching. I haven't seen zeitgeist in years but I support you in including that. There's some legit material in it and it is most definitely thought provoking, which in theory is something this sub should get behind. Good post!

       Nope. Looking at the first part, the mythology doesn't line up. It is factually incorrect. Zietgiest is a good way to get started but there are much better docs out there.

       Not sure what you're getting at here. It's a complete

       Whether it's worrisome or not, it doesn't change the fact that
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       freedom just isn't possible. I'm talking about freedom to acquire whatever resources you want to please yourself - like John Travolta's freedom to have 2 jets and a runway at his 40 bedroom house. That just isn't something you can do on a planet with finite resources and 7 billion people to share them with; it's ridiculous. Freedom of expression etc are completely different, and i can't see them being impacted negatively by this vision. Freedom is a nice idea, but we all have to abide by some rules, otherwise everything would go to utter shit.

       No, i'm not a fan of the UN. I can't comment on that, but i will look into it.

       I could completely understand how it could have failed in the current system, because it is so at odds with it. As for the technology, i haven't seen a single example that doesn't yet exist being touted as fundamental to a resource-based economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do, however, make a good point about the framework being non-existent. This is the biggest doubt i have about the whole thing. I just can't see how we would transition from where we are now, to the vision that Fresco has. And tbh, i'm not actually a huge fan of the Venus Project itself, rather than the concept of a resource based economy; it just so happens that it is the poster-child for it. It seems like he has some great ideas, but in actual fact, i haven't seen him get down to anything beyond drawing pretty pictures on his website.
      </p>

       I honestly believe it's totally possible, and would be a huge leap forward in terms of human progress. But if everything fell apart tomorrow, the world went to shit, and after 2 years of living in a state of complete collapse, we decided to band together and set out this vision for the future - I have a very hard time seeing how we'd get from there to something that resembled a functioning society.

       Everything works in stages. We didn't jump from using horse-hair bulbs to LEDs, and we won't jump from where we are now to a RBE, without some fairly significant steps in-between.
