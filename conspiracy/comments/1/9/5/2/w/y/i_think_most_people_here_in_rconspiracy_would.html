       What I will explain to you will not be the best explanation for anarcho-capitalism. I would recommend that you look it up or watch Adam vs the Man for a thorough explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anarcho-capitalists believe that no man should be able to impose their will with the use of force over one another. They believe that government is the quasi-social, or socially accepted, monopoly of the use of force, which it is. If somebody breaks the laws the government makes, even if they are acting peacefully, they may be put in a cage and separated from society because they are deemed unworthy of society. Obviously i'm talking about jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government's foundation is the use of force through taxation. You are forced to pay taxes. If you don't pay taxes you are put in a cage deemed unworthy for society, despite you acting peacefully. Why can't people donate their money and establish voluntary efforts where tax dollars would normally go? This would kinda be like peaceful charity to those who need it (ex: hurricane victims, the poor, the homeless). When you use government, there's force and coercion involved, which an-caps find fundamentally wrong. When one says we need government, they're saying that we cannot peacefully, voluntarily accomplish something ourselves, and that we need an institution of force and violence to accomplish that for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       An-caps also believe in a complete free market where anybody should be able to trade anything as long as they are acting peacefully. We do not have a true free market in our current system of government regulations, trade restrictions, and the unfair allocation of money to big corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since most people in r/conspiracy understand the bullshit that government is, I think they would accept an-cap beliefs and ideals more easily than most. Obviously there's a lot more to anarcho-capitalism than this, and I'd urge you to look it up yourself. Like I said before,
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AdamKokesh">
        Adam vs The Man
       </a>
       is a good YouTube channel that thoroughly explains and argues for anarcho-capitalism. An-cap philosophy truly is beautiful, and an-caps are some of the most peaceful people I know, so go check it out

       But why only focus on the government?  Getting rid of collective government is a mafia wet dream.  I don't mean the corrupt bunch of whores in office now, but a government in the sense of people working together to enforce rules for the common good.

       There will always be imbalances of power, until the pigs who want to concentrate wealth and power are removed by evolution from our recessive genes.  Governments are the way that society respond to warlords who want to gather power at the community's expense.

       No it's logic. If govt were only 5% of GDP and had that level of power (as they were in early 1900s), the benefit of taking over that power would be negligible, while today, with govt costing 40% of GDP, and taking $millions from some citizens through taxation, it incentivizes those citizens to take over the govt and get their money's worth. Every tax increase gives the ultra wealthy just that much more incentive to get into politics. Humans are not sheep, we are reactive, thinking creatures. Let me guess, you think minimum wage laws help the poor?

       The warlords are corrupt because their brains and personalities are sick.  Probably their genes are broken.  They don't know what it's like to be human, so they just lash out in their greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       A government is an abstract, collective entity.  Our government is corrupt right now because it's filled with prostitutes that the warlords bought to fill those positions.

       Ancap is not seeking to abolish government as defined by you (it seems eerily similar to the definition of society).
Ancap is about abolishing governments monopoly on provision and enforcement of law. Monopoly is source of corruption. Monopoly is source of asymetry of rights between people outside and people inside of government. Warlords simply leverage this asymmetry in their favor. Why? Because its there and its tempting, because it allows to get monopoly at cheap price of couple of politicians, it's simply not economically viable to get it another way. The only way to get rid of corruption is to abolish the monopoly and decetralize the power so instead of corrupt politicians you get all the power over your own life and you get to choose what to do with it.

       Companies under free market are a lot more accountable than any bureaucrat will ever be, because government doesn't ask us for money or obedience whereas company in order to not go bankrupt must sell it's service/merchandise to willing customers. Of course as government influence over economy is bigger and bigger market becomes a lot more corrupted by changing incentives. Any firm would want to get monopoly in it's own niche because that usually means more profits for less work. Government makes that possible.

       Yeah, government fucks up the flow of the market. If a company is corrupt in a true free market, people will not use that company. Another company that doesn't pull the bullshit will come out and people will use that one instead. Without government aid, a lot of the major corporations we have right now would not exist because they're so fucking bad. But government bails them out because of the revolving door.

       Yes, property rights require violent enforcement. I don't see it as particularly controversial though. Certainly you would try to use defensive violence if somebody wanted to kick you out of your house against your will.

       It's a mistake to assume you are alone in that fear. Most people fear absentee property invasions and theft, so there would of course develop a market for policing and liability of theft... if you pay an entity to protect your belongings and they fail, THEY pay. Dispute resolution organizations, which have existed forever in every form of government and group of people, would become known as either fair or unfair, and - just as in any market situation - the ones with the fairest history would get the most customers to arbitrate disputes. A company who failed to pay for their customer's losses would then be given bad ratings by reviews and 3rd party "Better Business Bureau" organizations. There is insurance, dispute resolution organizations, charitable consumer advocates, individual reviews... i.e. many checks and balances. A huge monopoly who gained power not through persuasively providing $Billions of value to customers, but rather through force, is something that needs eradicated ASAP.

       You can't murder people because then you'd be using force to impose your will over another. You can't use force in an An-Cap society. That's breaking the non-aggression principle. If you were to break the non-aggression principle, society would deal with you as it sought fit because you initiated force.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can set up states, that's fine. An-Caps just want a place where they will be exempt from those laws. Obviously there will be government in a lot of parts of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those
       <em>
        evil
       </em>
       businesses will fail in an an-cap society because in a true free market, it's the consumers that decide what businesses succeed and which ones don't. The reason why we have evil corporations now that succeed is because government interferes with the free market by helping the big corporations with money, laws that support those businesses, and the revolving door. If a business in a free market is bad, people will stop using it and will use the better business. The bad businesses would not be able to exploit anybody because it would fail, or be forced to meet the demands of the consumers or workers so that it doesn't fail.

       So do you want to confiscate all currently held private property and start over? Because I'm sorry, but Monsanto is not going to lose to local farmers if you eliminate the state today. They will use their considerable wealth and power to rig the market in their favor as they do now. The institutions of control that are in place now are bad, but eliminating them will not weaken these large, entrenched interests it will only give them

       I'm not really firmly planted in any ideology. I don't know what is best for the world. Libertarian Socialism and real anarchy appeal to me a lot more than any kind of capitalism though.

       I'd put it this way, government currently holds a monopoly on fear-alleviation. Part of the appeal to govt-skeptics is precisely rooted in this fact. An anarchy would develop organizations who alleviate fear, including consumer groups who monitor restaurants (regulators), defense-minded people who would charge for securing specific geographical areas with fees (military), and local rule enforcement (police). The issue of roads, for instance, is mostly about interstate roads. Roads with high traffic would easily be able to corral money to finance maintenance since businesses and home owners want it. Anything that people actually want will be funded in an anarcho-capitalist system, whereas in government only a few people may want something, but if they have captured "political" power, they can force everyone to pay for their wars, their pork barrel project, their peaceful drug-use prohibition enforcement, etc.

       Kokesh might be controlled opposition.  He promotes a lot of really out there stuff sometimes.  Like having everyone hooked up to the internet via a chip in the brain.  Also he had a show on RT.  I used to listen to his show daily, I couldn't anymore because he was saying a lot of stuff like that.  Also he made an ass out of himself on Joe Rogan, who I also believe is controlled opposition.  Kokesh's man on the street type videos are interesting sometimes only for the people's reactions to him.

       So-called "anarcho-capitalism" isn't anarchism.  It's essentially private dictatorship.  And it's built on a false economic history.

       Anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchy.  It has no relation to the actually existing anarchist movement, it's theory or history.  Ancapism is a private dictatorship because it privatizes state functions and puts all authority in the hands of those who own property.

       I accept your surrender.  If you care to find me one case where anarcho-capitalism was part of the historical anarchist movement (which has always been anti-capitalist), feel free, but let me tell you ahead of time that Tucker was a socialist and described himself as one.  He was anti-capitalist.  And that was basically your best hope.

       You did not debate me because when given the chance to cite some evidence you were unable to do so.  Sorry your feelings are hurt, but maybe bone up on some history so in the future you can avoid making stupid statements you know nothing about.  Also, if you don't want to argue on the internet, then maybe don't start arguing on the internet.

       It doesn't have to do with winning per se.  It's simply who put forth the the more supportive evidence for their claim.  And although it's frustrating, once name calling and profanity come into play, it affects one's credibility, or
       <em>
        logos.

       So, it would appear as though you are insinuating that my mind is "weak", and my "debate muscles" untrained? Once again, I never agreed to debate anyone. As far as insults and name-calling go, it appears as though we have another case of the pot calling the kettle black. I also am not sure what evidence you are referring to being brought forth, seeing as phoenix and I were not debating about a topic requiring evidence - unless you are referring to my statement of him being an asshat, to which I would say the evidence requested is that user's comments and behavior in this very thread. Anyways, have a good day. :]

       Anarchy: Absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual, regarded as a political ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is exactly what an-caps are advocating.

      <p>
       And yes, government functions are privatized. That's
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       because the coercion and the use of force are taken out of the equation.

       First, I don't 't care for libertarians or libertarianism. Even the most decorated of libertarian Economists have behaved like fuckin ivy league frat boys theorizing real world economic problems with their useless rhetoric. Privitazation is the favorite of their solutions for effective delivery of services in society, of course they forget that free markets tend to create monopolies because as enterprises grow sucessfully they destroy competiition.There will always be those with more money who will use that money to gain power, and hoard property.the result will always be some form of a capitalist dictatorship. And since property is the ultimate measure of basic right of individuals in the most simplest form. In any society privatization creates the most exremist form of elitism and inequality.

       It is not a form of anarchy.  I swear, it cracks me up how ancaps use the dictionary to defend themselves.  It's telling considering there is actually a hundred and fifty-odd years of actual anarchist history that you could refer to if there was any actual evidence for your case.  But, no, there is no such evidence.  Stateless-ness is a feature but not a sufficient criteria on its own to constitute anarchism.  Anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism.  Anyhow, I am glad to see you admit that all you are advocating for is a privatized state where coercion will be privatized in defense of and coordinated by property owners.  I think that means I just won this argument.

       So, since there were few or no anarcho-capitalists in the past, that means that the word "anarchy" can only apply to the types of people it applied to in the past, regardless of whether or not the new people meet the criteria of the definition of the word? Did I get all that?

       Nope.  Political movements and theories have a history.   You probably ought to call yourself an anti-state capitalist, because that makes much more sense.  Anarchy has always been anti-capitalist.  If that bothers you, then I'm sorry for upsetting you.  Would you like some fresh, home-made cookies and warm milk?

       You're right! And your anarcho-socialism/communism has a very interesting history. Seriously, go read up on it. "Anarchy" is a word that means "a state of having no rulers". If that is too complicated for you (I doubt it is, you seem fairly intelligent for a left-anarchist, even if you don't understand these basic concepts), then anarchy is probably not for you.

       unfamiliar with the history of anarchy -- even as you claim its legacy.  This is hilarious to me but certainly proves my point entirely.

That's what you ought to do.  See?  There's actually precedence for it.  I do enjoy however how you have literally zero knowledge of that which you speak.

       And yet you continue to display your complete inability to cite anything relating to the anarchist movement, its history or its theory.  Hell, earlier I even threw out a bone by referencing Tucker and you still can't do anything with that.  Quite amusing.

       That is unfortunately a condition of AnCap society. Personally, I believe this has more to do with the inherent immorality of man, and less to do with the system. If man was somehow able to let go of it's innate desire to command power and force over it's peers that it deems unequal, a society based on the principles of AnCap would be ideal for me.
