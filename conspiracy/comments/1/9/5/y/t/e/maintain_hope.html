    <div class="md"><p>Hope is not needed when you recognize that it doesn&#39;t exist outside the human mind. Emotions such as hope and despair, don&#39;t truly exist they exist because our mind perceives them to exist. When you obliterate the divide between your mind and your surroundings you will see that the ills you speak of are only distortions in the true unity of all beings that arise due to human free will. We all have free will and some use it for good and others for evil, as long as you remain righteous and firm in your beliefs you will see it matters not if society crumbles around you, the path of true love and oneness will always be illuminated. Despair not doitforthewoods for the cycle of good evil has occurred on this planet since the human mind gained consciousness and as long as we have free will the cycle will continue. I highly recommend reading the Dhammapada its a very short book only 50 pages or so, I used to be confused, but when I read its like a switch flipped on and I could see again for the first time. Peace and love in your journeys friend.</p>

<p>How can one maintain any hope with all of this information? just wondering how other &#39;conspiracy&#39; people keep spirits up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strength is not about &quot;keeping your spirits up&quot;.  It&#39;s about being unafraid to arm yourself with accurate information about what exactly&#39;s going on in this world, being unafraid of the fact that it might be <em>real</em> bad information, and still having the wherewithal to move forward trying to do the best that you can with the prison sentence you have on this planet.</p>

<p>You see, for many of us, living here is like living in a prison.  As such, the question you ask is similar to asking someone serving a life sentence &quot;how do you keep your morale up?&quot;  Well, if you&#39;re zen enough, you throw away any interest in &quot;keeping your morale up&quot; and, instead, work at bettering yourself as a spiritual being so that you learn whatever lesson you need to learn and will hopefully never return to this same situation in the future after you&#39;re done with your sentence on this planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rambling:</p>

<p>OP, I don&#39;t know what your worldview is, but I&#39;m a Christian, and I&#39;ve been studying conspiracy-related matters for about 5 years now.  Learning about the Conspiracy is probably one of the most disruptive transformations I&#39;ve ever experienced.  It is depressing, and it really challenged my faith.  The people behind it all are so powerful, and they seem to have infiltrated every worldly (and religious!) institution of any power.  Between this realization, and the fact that 98% of people out there either don&#39;t care about it or don&#39;t <em>want</em> to know about it, it&#39;s easy to get depressed.  It&#39;s easy to ask difficult questions.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be lying if I said I never experienced doubt and despair.  Is God really in control here?  Does he really know what he&#39;s doing, allowing this to continue?  Who do I put my trust in, with this?  Do I put my trust in myself and my wits, to somehow escape the snares being laid all around us?  Or do I trust God?  And does trusting God mean that I stick my head in the sand and hope the bad things just go away?  What is the right response?  How do I even talk to other Christians about it, given that most of them are part of that 98%?</p>

<p>It has helped me to remember that God&#39;s ways are above our understanding.  He&#39;s got a bigger, deeper plan than any of us can understand, and he carries it out perfectly.  Take Jesus&#39; triumphant entry into Jerusalem, for example.  Everyone was all excited, because they thought Jesus was finally coming to reign over a worldly kingdom.  But he had a different plan.  Here he was, in a culture ablaze with religious fervor, one that had been looking forward to a Redeemer for literally hundreds of years, a culture who had been told in hundreds of prophecies what and who to look for, and yet they didn&#39;t recognize him.  All because they were expecting a savior to fit their human expectations.  Jesus even told his disciples exactly what was going to happen, and even they had to have it explained to them after the fact!</p>

<p>My point is, to virtually everyone, it appeared as though Jesus <em>lost</em> at Calgary.  It looked like check-and-mate, game over, all is lost, and we all go home.  So much for all our hopes that Jesus was the savior.  But through this &quot;defeat&quot;, God worked his plan of salvation - to perfection.  My hope lies in the fact that three days later, God raised Jesus to life.  I believe that.  Jesus told us who he was, and he proved it, and I believe him.  He spoke of the Resurrection and life everlasting, and THAT is the end goal.  That is my hope.</p>

<p>The Bible doesn&#39;t hide the fact that the end times are going to be terrible.  I believe the Conspiracy is attempting, on a grand scale, to make the end times happen <em>on their terms</em> - and they have all the power in the world to pull it off.  And to be honest, from a worldly perspective, the odds don&#39;t look good.  But I have to remember not to fit God into my human expectations, or to pretend that I know better than him.  Just like with Calgary, God has a plan and knows what he&#39;s doing.  In the meantime, day to day, I&#39;m reminded that there are important things to do, and that it&#39;s not too late.</p>

<p>However, in reality most beliefs in conspiracies are faith-based. The evidence for many conspiracies is about as solid as &quot;the Bible is evidence,&quot; so it is not a leap for someone who has no trouble putting faith in one to apply the same standard of evidence to the next.</p>
