    <div class="md"><p>I believe in what the ancients referred to as chi or prana. I believe there are several energy points in our body which control how we feel and think, because I have felt them. I was born with severe pectus excavatum and recently started my own type of therapy that consists of focusing energy on the inside of my chest and using it to push my chest wall outwards. It&#39;s only been about a week and I&#39;m already seeing great results. So yeah, I think I could be a wizard or something someday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a form of meditation in which the individual tries to focus on energy points in the body known as &quot;chakras&quot;. To feel one&#39;s chakras one must be free of thought. That is, you cannot &quot;think&quot; of what it would feel like, but you must instead just feel. This means that in order to sense these energies the way I and many others do you must be able to shut off the voice inside your head, which is not an easy task for most. Once your mind is cleared you can begin to feel the energy at said points, it feels like a swirl of energy radiating and creating a pulse throughout your body. This energy flows from the base of your spine all the way to the top of your head, although there can be blockages along the way. After a few days of meditation I was able to feel the first 3 lower chakras, but had trouble sensing the 4th which relates to the heart. So, I bought a stone. </p>

<p>Stones and crystals are tools for this type of practice. Different stones and crystals create different electromagnetic resonances, and some of them correlate with the different chakras in the body. I bought a 1 dollar stone which I was told correlated with the heart chakra, and it would help me open it up. I got into my meditative state and tried to open my heart chakra, again it wouldn&#39;t work. I tried it once more this time holding the stone directly above my chest and I felt and heard and intense crack. My chest had actually been pushed outwards a little bit, and I could feel the energy swirling in the center of my chest. I tried focusing the energy along my chest wall, creating a force from within my body that would help push my chest wall outwards. I started doing this about a week ago, and do it every day before I go to sleep. I can already feel physical improvements, and I also feel a much closer connection to the world I live in. I can think rationally, and can control my thoughts and emotions. I plan to make some sort of post showing my progress in the near future once I feel I&#39;ve made sufficient progress. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern science is just starting to catch up with the ancients. For so long science and magic have been pushed as diametrically opposed. Misunderstood science is seen as magic. 
Using binaural tones and isochronic tones, scientists have effectively recreated the same brain wave patterns and experiences of ancient mystics and yogis. 
Putting aside the fact that every modern religion is simply a retelling of ancient beliefs and creation stories, i have always been amused by Christians who say that magic is evil and/or ridiculous then go to church on Sunday and participate in ritualistic ceremonies largely stolen from &quot;pagan&quot; rites. What is the difference between a prayer and a spell? I grew up Catholic and routinely saw people invoking spells and calling it something else. If you bury a statue of a certain saint upside down in your yard and say a certain prayer so many times it will help you sell your house or find a lost object. This is a spell. 
I believe that there is some unifying power in our universe, but i am just not arrogant enough to think that I can&#39;t definitively define it. </p>

<p>Edit: sorry to be vague on the saint, i am on my phone. It is St. Joseph that you bury upside down. </p>

warning- this is a 5 hour religion documentary, but very well researched, I had watched this guys earlier docs on illuminate symbolism in hollywood, which were pretty good then found this 5 hour one.  It begins like Zeitgeist where there is a comparison between several religions, ancient and current, but this goes way further than Z&#39;s &quot;people have been doing new age forever; now onto things we can prove.&quot; and follows the stories of many religions combining dieties, gods, and deamons, then concludes illuminate religion is the most complete religion because it shares it&#39;s belief structure with all major religions, except they happen to be more likely to practice magic, summon demons.  The auther is at the time of writing this, practicing some OGD magic, and goes into great detail of magic.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how I feel about this sort of stuff, I did believe in magic A:.A:. OGD / OTO, but never actually tried much of anything, as I don&#39;t neccesarily trust Aliester Crowely to translate latin for me, and I don&#39;t want to think I&#39;m saying &quot;I call upon the powers of love and unity&quot;  when I&#39;m actually saying &quot; Great lord Satin, please take  over my body and use it to spread hate and chaos through out the universes&quot;.  Always having been basicly Agnostic&gt;Atheist, until the Atheists just started seeming way too faddy and arrogant, which deffinetly makes me question their theory. I only recently got the idea injected in my head that demons could be a real thing.  If so many high up people are practising magic (freemasons/bohemian grove/the founding groups of new-age and NWO propoganda, etc.), and relying on doctorines supposedly channeled from the beyond, while we&#39;re led to beleive that religion is myth, I&#39;m starting to take this a bit more seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta watch out for the great lord satin covering you in the finest of garbs man can procure. </p>

<p>On a serious note, I&#39;m still out on this too. I think there is a lot of myth but that the myths are based on some form of fact. We certainly don&#39;t know everything and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a form of &quot;magic&quot; existed. To an untrained eye, a car is magic, or really any form of science is magic. Is it in the way we traditionally think of magic with wands and exorbitant potions? I don&#39;t think so. Could it be that or something we havent thought of? Definitely. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think it exists, pick up a meditation regimen and try to explain some of the weird things you experience. It&#39;s not possible, at least in normal scientific reasoning that we have today, to explain that my heart races when I am sitting relaxed on a pillow. Or that I feel like I&#39;m spinning or flying although I&#39;m  sitting firmly in my living room. Is this magic? Not by normal definition because there is no outward phenomena. But it certainly is a phenomenon which I, and others, experience which we have no method, that I know of, to explain exactly how those sensory interpretations manifest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a cognitive science undergrad (soon to be grad!). Some of these phenomen can be explained by brain activity. What do you say to that? </p>

<p>Is there a particularly extreme event you can think of that might help convince me? Something totally unexplainable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well on multiple occasions when I meditate I experience what I said above. As for specifics, I&#39;ll lay them out. </p>

<p>Increased Heart Rate: This one is interesting in that it only happens for a short(5-10 minutes) time and then goes away. At the onset it feels like my heart is racing and there is a definite vibration all over my body and is more pronounced in my chest and head and less in my extremities. I don&#39;t know exactly what happens and Im even hesitant to say it is my heart. I&#39;m sitting on a cushion, eyes closed, breathing longer breaths than normal, but not in a way that I feel fatigued and definitely not in a way that would make my heart race. I notice that as I get &quot;deeper down&quot;(my term for going into my conciousness) the sensation increases and then stops when I feel that my mind is clear and I can begin some meditation exercises. </p>

<p>Spinning and Floating: this one is a weird one as well. Same setting with me on a cushion but this one seems to happen later in my meditation. It happens after the heart thing. It&#39;s usually accompanied by visions that look like the planet Jupiter. But not in the sense that I see a sphere but rather I&#39;m inside a sphere and the walls have parallel and lines like the planet. At the e where they meet on their horizontal planes from my view, there are many many spirals that could continue to infinity. After I see this is when the spinning sensations happen. I almost lose sense in my body completely. If I focus, I know my body is safely in my living room on the floor. But if I forget that and simply investigate everything in the mediation, that&#39;s when it happens. I&#39;ve described before that the spinning reminds me of a wheel on a car. You see it (in my case feel it) start up and you know which way it&#39;s going. After a while it seems to move the opposite way because it is spinning so fast, then eventually I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m spinning at all and have reached a state of &quot;harmony&quot; with what is spinning and the observation of it. </p>

<p>The floating occurs at the same time as the spinning and I wouldn&#39;t have said anything about it yesterday but it literally happened to me last night. So I&#39;m meditating like normal and passed the heart thing and my mind is quiet. I saw the Jupiter sphere and did spin a little. After the spin, without control, both of my legs(I&#39;m sitting in a sages seat. Google images) lifted off the ground. I was completely balanced on my butt on my cushion. It was the weirdest sensation and that all I really know about it. I&#39;d say that this one is different because it actually changed something in the material world. Or was powerful enough to have me believe that there was a change. Either way, I certainly felt light and weightless when I was perfectly balanced and almost forgot that I was up like that. </p>

<p>This can all be explained that it was in my head or I lost my bearings or fell asleep. I don&#39;t think it was any of these things and I have great spatial and orientation awareness(18+years of swimming experience) so I know what it feels like to be in a variety of unnatural positions. I just chalk it up to my mind wandering and losing connection with whatever gives me spatial recognition and orientation. </p>

<p>Hope this helps! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people feel this way, myself included. I think that this is also part of the conditioning - believers of so called &quot;New Age&quot; religions, as well as practitioners of O.T.O have <em>always</em> been painted in a negative, Satanic light by the mainstream. I think we need to ditch this whole paradigm if we are going to have a real chance of understanding the nature of our purpose on this plane of existance. If enemies of free will are aligning to use these forces against us, to oppress us, we need to at least understand the tools they use if we are going to have a chance of over coming them.</p>

<p>As far as spirituality is concerned, I trust and believe only what I am personally able to work through, whether it be through meditation or simple logical arguments in my consciousness. There is a veritable wealth of &quot;new age&quot; oriented materials out there, at your local public library or online, and I encourage anyone and everyone to at least get an idea of where these thoughts and ideas are coming from, if only for the sole purpose of knowing thy enemy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but I have actually put some research in it (before the game). And there was a good video, apologies I do not have the link at the moment. </p>

<p>I actually did some more research on it but not enough for me being convinced.</p>

<p>On another note though if you are interested in biblical mythical creatures giants are kinda cool, considering they were a hybrid between an angel and a human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, because I&#39;ve experienced very strange things that I do not believe can be explained by science, I believe these types of things exist. However, I do believe these things only exist when you allow them to. The spiritual world is very real, and also could be very dangerous.</p>

<p>I have been to places that would convert the most Athiest man in to a believer of Christ. Please do not take that the wrong way, as I am not a crazy religious nut, and I do believe in evolution as well. All I&#39;m saying is during my travels around the world, and being inside a cave that the Virgin Mary once took shelter in, you will feel the energy around you change. </p>

<p>Black Magic, Witches, Ghosts, are all very real. I think there may be Vampires as well (not the way we know of them), but I haven&#39;t looked in to that enough, just read some very interesting things from a scientific standpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I&#39;m on shrooms, acid, or 2CI, I can read peoples thoughts, and they can read mine as well. I&#39;ve done this with five people in total. You must maintain extended eye contact or it won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Ever heard the eye is the window to the soul? Yeah, it&#39;s true. And drugs widen the pupil (the door) to your eye (soul). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked this phenomena up online and have come across other stories of people sharing their experiences that line up with what I have said. Unless you have a very open mind you probably won&#39;t believe this. When I was doing this for the second time I was in a room full of people. Everyone wanted to try it but one guy. He left the room. Sucks for him cause we all had an awesome experience of mind-thought sharing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw some interesting photographs on a random blog, depicting the Tree of Knowledge as a giant mushroom, and Adam and Eve tripping balls on shrooms. They were allegedly from a very old version of Revelations. Perhaps they gained knowledge of the unified self, and that is why Yahweh, in his vengefulness, punished them. </p>

<p>Ever since my first mushroom experience, my thoughts on spirituality and the human consciousness have never been the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s something else. It opens doors for sure. One thing I did not mention, and something I can&#39;t explain, was that during that first mushroom trip, besides doing the mind thing with my friend, whatever I &quot;thought&quot; towards people, they did it. I felt like a hypnotist.</p>

<p>At one point my buddies gf who also was on drugs was in the other room. For some reason I thought this &quot;(insert name here) get mad at Ben&quot;. Immediately she comes storming in the room and starts yelling at him. My eyes widen in shock and I&#39;m thinking to myself WTF?! So I think towards her &quot;Stop!&quot;. </p>

<p>IMMEDIATELY she stops, looks confused, and says &quot;I don&#39;t know why I was yelling at you, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Then she went back to the other room.</p>

<p>Idk how the F that happened, but it blew my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this, or rather believe it may be possible (obviously I&#39;d need to experience it or see a study to believe for sure). Unfortunately psychedelics freak me out so I haven&#39;t really done them in a long long time lol.</p>

<p>Can you elaborate on your experience a bit more?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I call it mind reading for lack of a better term. The first time I did it with my buddy, I could actually tell you where he was in the house even when I couldn&#39;t see him. It was like we had an invisible cord connecting our minds. It was incredible.</p>

<p>Can you start by explaining these places? Can you tell me some of what you&#39;ve seen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but I do not have links to places I have traveled to. I also don&#39;t really know how to explain the places I&#39;ve seen. The best ones though were in Greece on some mountains. Mary&#39;s foot prints are still there, and there is other stuff that is there that you simply just wont believe unless you go and experience for yourself. If you have any interest in traveling there I can call up somebody to tell me exactly where it was. It could take at least a week to hear back though. I know you&#39;d assume I&#39;m lying or talking out of my ass, I really don&#39;t blame you. I wouldn&#39;t believe it either. I&#39;m just sharing my thoughts since you asked. The next time I do go though, now that I am older and know better, I will bring a camera and document my experience. I am really sorry that I can not provide you some kind of proof, or atleast some reading material on it. I probably would if I remembered the exact name of the location, but I have been to over 100 places in Greece so it is very hard to remember all of them. Imagine how paranormal it would be though, if I went there and asked someone else &quot;what brings you here?&quot; with you replying &quot;Reddit.&quot; That&#39;d be awesome!</p>
