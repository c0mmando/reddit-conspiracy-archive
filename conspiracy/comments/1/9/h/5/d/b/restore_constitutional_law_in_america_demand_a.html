        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today, our country is in peril. We require broad sweeping changes in order to continue the government&#39;s long standing tradition of protecting the weak and defending the innocent. The federal government&#39;s abuse of power has become unwieldy, and without being checked, we will wake up one morning trying to figure out exactly when Caesar disbanded the Senate.  Maybe you, like me, are already at that point.</p>

<p>There are many possible solutions to this dilemma. Talk of revolt reverberates across the internet, but that sort of action is a last resort, and we have not even begun to attempt to actually fix this problem from the inside. That is the goal of this community, to organize a national effort to have the state governments ratify a Constitutional amendment which will curtail the abuses of the Executive Branch, and at the same time grant them much needed additional powers which were not perceived by the founding fathers.</p>

<p>Over the course of the last several decades, it has become apparent that the rules and regulations regarding not only the Executive Branch but also the Legislative and Judicial have fostered a level of corruption in the system which could not have been perceived.</p>

<p>The Congressional need for re-election seems to have compromised the system. In conjunction with this need, created by the mere existence of career politicians, whose subsistence is predicated on their devotion not to their constituency, but rather to the corporations which provide funding for their information campaigns to garner votes from an uniformed and ignorant public. The existence of lifetime career politicians has corrupted the system, and term limits need to be imposed in order to ensure proper representation. Also, campaign contributions from corporations need to be severely limited, these organizations are not the primary concern of government, they are in fact, one of its biggest enemies today.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court, and its lifetime terms are equally compromised. For the last two decades, the Executive Branch responsible for ignoring the law of the land, and repeatedly violating not only the letter of the law but also the spirit of the morals of the country has been responsible for seating every single member of the Court. Since 1984, administrations tied to narcotics trafficking, organized crime, and Central Intelligence Agency abuses have now placed in lifetime office a group of corrupt judges who, not three days ago, destroyed the 4th Amendment of the United States Constitution. Their lack of discretion, via this treasonous and immoral 5-4 decision is a glaring example of just how bad things have become. The nomination of Judges by the President is antiquated, restrictive, and so susceptible to corruption that one family has effectively single handedly nominated five of the nine sitting Judges. Please. We need general elections for these positions, and we need them now.</p>

<p>Since 9/11, starting with George W. Bush and continuing like a deadly juggernaut under Obama, the Executive has taken a mechanism which was designed for clarification of legislation and turned it into a tyrannical edict. The &quot;Executive Order&quot; should be completely removed from our government. It&#39;s abuse has been too great to allow a single person to codify law for generations to follow. Make no mistake, ignoring the Separation of Powers clause of the Constitution of the United States of America is high treason, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Article V of the Constitution decrees that upon the request of 75% of the state legislatures, Congress will call a Convention for proposing amendments. This is exactly what we require today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Create a public fund that those running for office draw money from to run their campaigns. Ban campaign contributions from anonymous sources, limit the amount a person can donate each year. Repeal citizens united and create an upward limit that any single campaign can spend to get elected. Basically, create a simple set of rules that gives everyone who wants to run fair access to funds and advertising time. </p>

<p>Alternatively, we could dispose of our first past the post election system in favor of one that would create more diversity in the ideologies that get elected to office. I think that doing that is a better solution.  </p>

<p>That would be the majority of the government...not that I disagree with or have a problem with that, but if being a traitor is the standard for who gets hung, then there&#39;s gonna be a <em>lot</em> of hanging going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be right.  But, are you sure? It&#39;s a legal and effective method of curtailing rampant breach of power.  </p>

<p>There are states all over the country passing laws to &quot;unlegislate&quot; the NDAA and stricter gun control.  If these states instead moved together to modify the powers of the Federal government, they wouldn&#39;t have the other problems anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would a constitutional convention resulting from a revolution conducted by constitutionalists be a total clusterfuck? As long as corporations are people, and money is free speech, a constitutional convention can only result in gang rape IMO; and those conditions are unlikely to still exist after a popular revolution. I will grant, however, that said gang rape may actually be what it takes to get the revolution started.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s definitely too late for anything but revolution period - although I wouldn&#39;t be too super sure that a violent one is the <em>only</em> way.  I think that a non violent one should be tried first where EVERYONE simply stops cooperating with the system&#39;s m.o., but we should be ready to defend ourselves physically in armed combat if it comes down to that.</p>

<p>I would imagine that the chances are <em>huge</em> that it would indeed eventually come down to that - and so be it if it did - but I would definitely prefer to at least initially attempt a nonviolent revolution Gandhi-style first.</p>

<p>Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The District of Columbia organic act of 1871 defaced Our declaration of independence and turned America into a Corporation. The Country has been ran as a corporation ever since then. The dependence upon the federal reserve dollar is what really seals the deal in.</p>

<p>Our society is an illusion. The only reason it works is because people still believe in it. The 1%, the Owners of this Corporation know as America, keep this illusion alive by suppressing the intelligence of the population.</p>

<p>We cannot expect great change for Humanity, let alone the USA,without the deconstruction of the current global financial debt holdings and freeing the people. We cannot rebuild a new society upon past societies failures. I like the Venus Project and support the ideas and concepts. Resource based economies will create real change and it can benefit our species and generations to come.</p>
