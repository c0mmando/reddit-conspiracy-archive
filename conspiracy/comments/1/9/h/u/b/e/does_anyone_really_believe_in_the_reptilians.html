    <div class="md"><p>This. I have listened to all of his Wembley lecture (like 8 hours), and can say that it takes 8 hours just to get a grasp of his &#39;theory&#39; with very little time to present the evidence. I purchased Remember Who You Are and am about 100 pages in but still have not go to too much &#39;evidence&#39;. Not to say it&#39;s not there; I don&#39;t knwo if it is or not. I am open to the idea that he may be right, although I have not seen the evidence yet (because I find the more easily provable conspiracies such as 9/11, and the fact that our government is totally fucking us in the ass, to be far more important to spend time on; I will get to Icke when I get to Icke).</p>

<p>Honestly for those of us who have spent years studying conspiracy or  even those who make it a point to educate themselves in philosophy,history,science, etc, it becomes fairly clear that first of all we can&#39;t be absolutely certain of anything. Just because something has no evidence (if that is the case), doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s certainly wrong, and just because something has overwhelming evidence does not mean it&#39;s certainly right. Icke has been right about lot in the past (pedophelia rings, banking, aspects of quantum physics, etc), and he acts much more loving, logical, humble, and rational than Alex Jones leading me to believe that one should at least read a book or two before they come to even a relatively definitive conclusion on his work. </p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Is it probable ? </p>

<p>It is possible enough that it should be considered as possibility</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur">Dinosaurs</a> are members of the class <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile">Reptilia</a>. And they did develop earlier than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal">mammals</a>. There is a difference in brain development between this two species. </p>

<p>They did exist before mammals. And they do exist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile">now</a></p>

<p>It is probable that on some other planet reptile spices evolved in such a way that they could develop technology and some kind of civilization.</p>

<p>Civilization and technology have tendency to grow and evolve.</p>

<p>Until we have live specimen we will not know for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are correct. </p>

<p>I am creating a theory on probability that was observed in nature. </p>

<p>But, actually I was more thinking that reptiles would change course of their evolution and start to behave in such a way to not over grow the planet. Dinosaurs over grow their natural habitat. There were just too many of them for resources they had.</p>

<p>Something similar happened here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though it&#39;s hard for me to swallow, yeah I believe for the most part. It&#39;s not just Icke who talks about reptillians, other researchers have come to the similar conclusions, at least that they exist and have been a part of human history. These would be the Anunnaki of the Sumerian Tablets, our supposed progenitors. I have also heard several first and second person accounts from different sources with some pretty crazy stories. And I do not, like Icke, believe them all to be malevolent, simply another race with decent and rotten individuals same as us. I do not believe 100%, as others have said a full case is not there for them. I recommend everyone do their own digging on this and draw their own conclusions. But I have researched enough to know there are extra-terrestrials operating here on planet, and to have one of those races be of reptillian origin is not so big a jump to take anymore...</p>
