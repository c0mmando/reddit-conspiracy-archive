        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We totally fucked the Germans after they lost WWI. Everybody was poor and pissed off so they elected a mad man to lead them. We placed sanctions on NK and they are now poor and pissed off. so to &quot;make sure they cant afford to build a nuclear bomb&quot; the US is putting more sanctions on NK. They already let their people starve in order to fund their shitty military, now they are just going to divert even more money away from the already starving population to build their ICBM. </p>

<p>The US is backing NK into a corner so they have to act first and look like the bad guy, when in reality they have no choice but to try and regain their sovereignty. </p>

<p>I really hope this doesnt end in a war, but if it does I wont be surprised. because if it does Im sure the powers that be will have no issue with nuking NK just like they have no problem nuking Iran</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you must be new. this is nothing. nk pops off every few years and we pay them and give them food. big deal</p>

<p>i think you are reading too much into this nk shit. NK is run by a mafia, they dont care about their people and they are not stupid enough to be destroyed over this bullshit. they do this stuff to make it look like they are at war with aggressors to their people, to keep them all following the line.  Supposedly they dont even have a real nuke program, they just purchased some from the black market and they set them off to play this game. And dont even get me started about their stupid rocket. </p>

<p>the reason the people are starving is because the NK mafia wont allow them to grow food, they grow poppies and sell heroin instead. the farmers dont even know what it is, they call it drug flowers. so again, NK doesnt give two shits about its people or their starving. </p>

<p>the <em>real</em> danger of NK is who runs it and whats its purpose. The military calls it KFR, or Kim Family Regime. But I have a contact who tells me they dont actually know who runs it, and the kim family are just the idiot puppets they parade around. You also have to understand, the USSR created NK, <em>not</em> China. Further, what is this thing? Its a farm. Its a people farm. Someone decided to figure out what it takes to create a group of people who have complete obedience and will attack anything they are told. What does that take? 1 generation? 2 generations? A crazy guy who wears fur coats and high heals? Ok, done. </p>

<p>So I guess I invalidate my own premise by pointing out they are indeed dangerous. So hey, you might be right. But I dont think it will be because NK is just nuts and does something &#39;crazy&#39; - if this happens its going to be part of a larger global agenda.... but i dont think they are a real threat to the USA... SK maybe.....</p>

<p>The following sounds about right too:</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think even Americans are dumb enough to fall for that one!</p>

<p>&quot;NK might shoot missiles at us, so I&#39;m declaring martial law.&quot;  &quot;Why, what good will that do?&quot;</p>

<p>I never understand why people think that martial law is about to happen.  Our Glorious Leaders have us exactly where they want us - work slaves with an increasingly small segment of the pie.  If they declared martial law, it would impede production, cut into profits, piss people off - and what would they gain from this?  The abstract joy at having oppressed the population?</p>

<p>These guys just aren&#39;t that dumb.  They&#39;re not going to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.</p>

<p>Now, in ten years, or twenty - when the consequence of their evil policies has trickled down so much that there&#39;s a huge population of angry people with no reason to live - then they might be forced to declare martial law to protect themselves from the consequence of their actions.  But that&#39;s a long way away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Potential rivals such as China are anxious to exploit these transformational technologies broadly, while adversaries like <strong>Iran, Iraq and North Korea</strong> are rushing to develop ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons as a deterrent to American intervention in regions they seek to dominate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;U.S. nuclear force planning and related arms control policies must take account of a larger set of variables than in the past, including the growing number of small nuclear arsenals – from <strong>North Korea to Pakistan to, perhaps soon, Iran and Iraq</strong> –and a modernized and expanded Chinese nuclear force.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Over the long term, <strong>Iran</strong> may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has. And even should <strong>U.S.-Iranian relations</strong> improve, retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an essential element in U.S. security strategy given the longstanding American interests in the region.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is why, according to the CIA, a number of regimes deeply hostile to America – <strong>North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Syria</strong> – “already have or are developing ballistic missiles” that could threaten U.S allies and forces abroad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We cannot allow <strong>North Korea, Iran, Iraq or similar states</strong> to undermine American leadership, intimidate
American allies or threaten the American homeland itself.&quot;</p>
