       is obviously someone affiliated with gun control agenda. I recently put up a post proving Sandy Hook conspiracy (which I have since deleted for the purpose of exposing this guy) and was immediately attacked by the
       <a href="/u/Soullessandproud">
        /u/Soullessandproud
       </a>
       . I really didn't find it that odd at first since I knew some people may be offended by it but days later I went to check his history. Almost all of his comments are attacking people who talk about Sandy Hook conspiracies or are talking about our right to have guns. This guy is obviously in on something. I just wanted to call him out. Seriously look at this guys comment history, it is rather creepy if you ask me. He tries to cover it up by calling people "fucking retarded" or "a fucking faggot" to blend in with internet trolls but he most definitely has an agenda here.

       The sidebar is where the subreddit describes what it is all about, and nowhere do I see the questioning of authority or going against the "main stream narrative", also, you implied that the truth and "main stream narrative" are mutually exclusive.

       These things are not mentioned in the sidebar where the description of the subreddit is.

       Regardless of your beliefs, it's solid logic - how will deleting something expose anyone? How can you question anything effectively when really rudimentary logic like this only undermines your point? Tinfoil hat comment or not, the OP's methods here are unlikely to result in anything useful for anyone.

       Looking back through four months of comments, there are lots about video games and The Walking Dead. He insults people over Sandy Hook and racism, but there were only a few about gun control. He says he is 19 years old and his writing and spelling are definitely consistent with that. I don't see any signs that he is anything but a typical teenager.

       It's because sandy conspiracy people are the worst. They leave this subreddit and actually go harass the families that lost children or the people who were there to help.

       You're one of the worst offenders here.You haven't made a single factual argument for Sandy Hook being a conspiracy but you'll still repeat all of the debunked junk you can. Why? Nobody knows, we just know it's reprehensible.

       Every time evidence is shown for any of your conspiracy fantasies you give the same response.

       Actor! Planted evidence! CIA agents! Compartmentalization! MKULTRA! etc etc etc without ever bringing any facts that prove any of it.

       Oh you can't have pictures of dead babies? Well you better use that as proof of a cover up. I stand by my statement, you've never brought anything substantial to any conspiracy ever, you just spit out whatever Alex Jones tells you to.

       Like how you think since you're not allowed security footage of Adam lanza that somehow proves a conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like how you're not allowed autopsy reports of dead children makes you scream conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       What examples do you need? I am saying that everything you say is bullshit. If you had the videos of dead children as you so desire, you'd just say it was CIA actors. You can never be satisfied because you don't let the evidence lead you, you tug and pull at evidence in the direction you want so you can agree with nutty stuff like Dr. Carver not letting you have autopsy reports of children proves it's a conspiracy to take guns.

       What the fuck did you just fucking say about Navy Seal copypastas, you little newfag?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll have you know they've ranked top out of all the comments on the Internet, and they have been translated in numerous contexts on 4chan, and have over 300 confirmed variants. Navy Seal copypastas are trained in memetic warfare and are the top copypasta in the entire circlejerk arsenel. You are nothing to them but just another target. They will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this subreddit, mark my fucking words.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think you can get away with saying that shit about Navy Seal copypastas over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak this copypasta is contacting it's secret network of /b/tards across the USA and your IP is being doxxed right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Navy Seal copypastas can be anywhere, anytime, and they can confuse you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with mad-lib permutations. Not only are they extensively trained in trolling, but they have access to the entire arsenal of Anonymous and will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Internet, you little shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. This copypasta will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

       What in Davy Jones’ locker did ye just bark at me, ye scurvy bilgerat? I’ll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas, and I’ve led numerous raids on fishing villages, and raped over 300 wenches. I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another source o’ swag. I’ll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag. As we parley I be contacting my secret network o’ pirates across the sea and yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil. The kind o’ monsoon that’ll wipe ye off the map. You’re sharkbait, fool. I can sail anywhere, in any waters, and can kill ye in o’er seven hundred ways, and that be just with me hook and fist. Not only do I be top o’ the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my beck and call and I’ll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o’ the world, ye dog. If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment. But ye couldn’t, ye didn’t, and now ye’ll pay the ultimate toll, you buffoon. I’ll shit fury all over ye and ye’ll drown in the depths o’ it. You’re fish food now.

       I've already contacted the admins.  This is a notice to cease and desist from libeling me immediately.   I expect a full apology in lieu of any actual evidence that I have done what you so monstrously and disgustingly accuse me of.

       you accuse me of harassing people and seeking photos of dead babies.  This is a monstrous allegation, that is not only immoral, but illegal.  Maybe your lawyer can find the evidence that you can't produce - I doubt it.

       What is defamation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, defamation is a false and unprivileged statement of fact that is harmful to someone's reputation, and published "with fault," meaning as a result of negligence or malice. State laws often define defamation in specific ways. Libel is a written defamation; slander is a spoken defamation.
What are the elements of a defamation claim?
      </p>
      <p>
       The elements that must be proved to establish defamation are:
      </p>
      <pre><code>a publication to one other than the person defamed;
a false statement of fact;
that is understood as

a. being of and concerning the plaintiff; and
b. tending to harm the reputation of plaintiff.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       If the plaintiff is a public figure, he or she must also prove actual malice.
Is truth a defense to defamation claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. Truth is an absolute defense to a defamation claim. But keep in mind that the truth may be difficult and expensive to prove.

       You got butthurt on an internet forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not have legal precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not have any way to prove that he meant to do harm to your public self.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, he does not know who you are other than a severely sick person who sees conspiracy and butthurt at every corner when you have legitimately defamatory things to say about Government, victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claims you have made about him can actually be made about you and your posts, class action, from the families of Sandy Hook. But I'm not going to go messaging admins to find an IP of yours or your (lol) MAC address.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, as far as you know we're all using Tor and you're going to find a non-existent IP or MAC. That is not admissable. If you have a good lawyer these days, you can get DNA evidence thrown out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy your paranoia and butt-hurtedness because when you make ridiculous claims, we have a right to first amendment rights. A judge would throw out your case and your lawyer would not work on it -- they cannot stifle our first amendment rights just because you get butthurty.

       AND, since I figure you are in the US because of your past comments implying that "we the people expect better hoaxes for our $1 trillion."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is your lesson in FA rights:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The First Amendment does not protect you from:
       </p>
       <p>
        Criticism: If you're a comedian who makes a bad rape joke, people are allowed to point out that you're not funny as well as an asshole.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shame: If you tweet something racist about President Obama on your public Twitter account that's connected to your first and last name, people are allowed to say that is bad.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Right to Anonymity: If you take creepy photos of women without their consent and post them on Reddit, people are allowed to try and figure out who you are and post your information on the internet. No one is entitled to anonymity. It's up to you whether to make it easy for people to find you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mockery: Hi, PIKE brothers. Did you deserve to be mocked for your cheesy PG-13 photos? It doesn't matter. You put yourselves out there, which means your peers (and news outlets) have the right to LOL and comment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consequences: If you publicly express yourself in a manner that is offensive, hurtful, or just plain dumb, strangers might contact your friends/family/school/employer and tell them what you did. That is not infringing on your right to free speech; it's pointing out how you choose to exercise that right. Like the rest of the federal constitution, the First Amendment protects us from the government, not from private companies, which may be able to fire or otherwise punish you for stuff you say, even if it's outside of work. The laws protecting the free speech of private employees vary from state to state, aside from specifically protected speech like labor organizing.

       Same. It's too bad Adrian Chen has a hate-boner for reddit. Jezebel is okay, unless it's lazy copypasta from a NYT article about women, trying to justify certain given stereotypes.

       I do too, for some of his work. There needs to be a light shone on those subreddits (including the racist and anti-Semitic), but every time Chen does something about (or on) reddit since then, it just reeks of "grr i hate u guise :("

       Yeah, but to be fair, reddit acts like such asshats anytime someone calls them out on anything and loves to pull the "free speech" card. If I was assigned to doing reddit stories and they constantly acted like this I would feel very similar.

       Oh, definitely. I feel better in those niche subreddits. Quality indeed goes higher with most posts. I'm with you on the asshattery of reddit when they in general, or specific communities/users get called out, that would help form a stronger online community when they gain a better perspective of things and are not as black-and-white as they tend to be.

       You would, technically, have to host it in the city where Reddit's servers are located -- or 'where' the crime was committed. Since there aren't courts in the Internet tubes, you have a 66% chance of having the case here in the US of A

       The real question is whether you use this internet name on other internet sites.  You would then have to prove that all of the sites with that user name on them is yours, you would then have to prove that this undermines or assaults your character (which based on your posts it doesn't seem to, rather it underscores your character).

       Don't get so offended when people call you out on your retarded thoughts.  There is a thing called free speech.  You can disagree with anyone, and call them whatever names you want.  He didn't threaten you, or go out on his own to put a bad mark on your name.

       You know that the Reddit admins are going to think you're an idiot too and this is going to go absolutely NO WHERE.

       in Canada we had to.   our regulatory body tried for 10 years to get us to accept fake news on our TV.  they finally gave up, but still we are subject to USA fake news, top stories even.

       there is legal recourse against this bullshit.   and yes, I know the fascists don't give a shit about the law, unless it serves them.

       Did you just defame your regulatory body by accusing them of spreading fake news?

       They can air it.  I assume CRTC hasn't had complaints, and providing proof isn't trivial.

       They tried to change the law to allow production and broadcast of fake news from Canada.   10 years they tried before giving up.  Critical thought is not dead in Canada.  RIP america.

       If you knew what you were talking about, you would know you need to contact
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       local authorities to take your report. You would also know that reddit admins have zero obligation to give you any user's IP address. You will need a request by a judge, which you aren't gonna get since no one was threatened and no one is in any danger. You might get a judge to order one for any civil cases you may have, but...
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't it be easier/cheaper/less of a waste of time to just change your name here and go on? Or you could use RES and put those people on "ignore".......
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are gonna bring a civil suit for libel/slander (That's really the only thing I can think of that you could use for litigation here.) against a user you should know that it is on you to prove his/her words caused you financial damages or mental anguish. The accused has to prove nothing. Ain't that kinda shitty? For you I mean, not the accused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck! You'll need it...

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So... are you going to threaten to sue the local law enforcement for laughing at you and hurting your feelings when they inevitably laugh at you for wanting to have someone arrested and then sue them for calling everything you say bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly good luck at the whole tracing ip / mac address thing, IP's change and the MAC address isn't visible outside of the local network so reddit won't have access to that at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       but you know if you can afford to chuck money down the toilet feel free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also considering you think that Kurt Cobain faked his death to form Weezer I'd agree with the OP.

       This sub really needs to sit down and have a talk about whats "real", what constitutes "proof", and what a troll actually is. If anyone did more than 5 minutes of research you would find that
       <a href="/u/soullessandproud">

       likes to go into more controversial subs and stir up shit to call people out.

       Riiiight, like we all have the time and money to just fly where ever we want and stay in hotels. I think posting a video on the internet that billions of people can see with a few mouse clicks goes more towards "proving it to the world" than taking a vacation to another state and trying to talk with a couple of locals.

       this excuse. Makes me smile every time it comes up. You have the opportunity to expose one of the most heinous conspiracies of the last century and to reveal for the world the lengths a tyrannical government will go to in order to disarm its populace, to cast light onto a shocking ruse pulled off before the American public, but gosh, ain't nobody got time for that.

       You're basically saying that if I write a book uncovering the truth about who shot JFK, it's meaningless to try to get it published, and I instead should go to the grassy knoll and try to hand out copies, and failure to do so is failure on all fronts to spread truth.

       I'm not even arguing for or against there being an alternate series of events regarding what happened at Sandy Hook. I'm just saying your assertions don't make any real world sense.

       Maybe the fact that people would have to fly there in order to prove something shows that if the people who live in the area don't believe it's a conspiracy.  That should be VERY telling that someone who lives in the town or nearby doesn't think they are all actors, but someone thousands of miles away in their basement says they are.

       What would be proven by flying there? That the people who live there don't believe an alternate version of events happened? Neither do the people who live next door to me.

      <p>
       The notion that the entire town is a city of actors is obviously ludicrous. But it's a fantastic stawman used for discrediting anyone who might see a few anomalies in an official story and want further answers as to why these children died.

       I don't think any sane person needs to travel to the town to verify that it is not inhabited by paid actors. I mean, seriously, that's just fucking retarded. However, that doesn't really change the fact that there are some pretty strange oddities surrounding this event. Really, most of the official story doesn't make much sense when you start looking into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't know what happened there. All I can say for certain is that  the new gun restrictions would never have passed without this happening, and that there are holes and oddities in the story that TV gave us. I think that alone should warrant a bit of sane investigation.

       Again, if you verify that the parents are known and have been known, that shows they are not actors, which destroys a lot of the conspiracy theories.  If you find people who attended the funerals of the children, that will eliminate even more.  You can even go as far as to find people who have worked with the coroner, and ask if he really is like that in real life.

       That's first assuming that nobody died in the event. I don't have enough evidence to determine that one way or another. There's been a lot of oddities surrounding the forgoing of standard procedures regarding the autopsies and the bodies though, and that's worth looking into.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't suppose it would matter much though meeting parents. If there actually was some horrific conspiracy surrounding this, I could only assume that they would be in on it, and play their roles appropriately. But again, that's really neither here nor there.
      </p>
      <p>
       A coroner acting strangely doesn't mean much either. You'd have to be a bit of an odd person to take up that sort of profession. However, he does say some odd things regarding the gunshots and the bullet wounds that don't seem to add up with other reports some some officials involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I really don't know what happened. But I haven't been given the feeling that TV has given us the actual truth about it. A lot of testimonies don't line up. Some of the kids say truly bizzare things, and if you've worked with kids much, it almost sounds like they have been coached at times. That's pure speculation though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't shake the feeling though that if this were an open and shut case, well, it would be.

       If you could absolutely prove it then why don't you go and do it? This would shake the world. If you had irrefutable proof nobody would turn you down. Use peer review and be able to reproduce the results. Nobody would be able to argue that. If you absolutely can prove it then go and change the world. Don't just sit here on reddit and conman about how you are being trolled by one guy and now you have another conspiracy about him. Otherwise you either can't prove it or you're a coward. There are no other options.

       No proof is irrefutable. This is why Christians are able to convince themselves that evolution isn't real, and that the earth has only been around for 6000 years. The best we can ever hope for is that the right people see the truth at the right time, and spreads as far as it needs to for positive change to occur.

       This is different. There's a guy here who says he has irrefutable proof, but doesn't want to show it. This isn't the entire religion and faith system of a people. It's an isolated event that is causing lots of ruckus and OP is being a retard about it all. "I HAVE PROOF! BUT SOME GUY IS TROLLING ME SO I DELETED IT!"

       First of all, Our nation doesn't have the greatest track record protecting whistle blowers. The US tends to send them to jail or just kill them. You can't really judge anyone for speaking out on Internet about conspiracy theories, because the Internet is a Tool and  people Use it to accomplish certain things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be realistic. If Sandy Hook was a conspiracy it was one epic plan and it was perfectly executed because the whole country is now talking about gun control and the media is not questioning the story at all. If sandy hook was a conspiracy, you have to give mad props to the people who contrived this tragedy, IMO it would take a great amount of wealth,power,and influence to create and control such a horrific massacre and convince the entire world it was real.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means if Sandy Hook was an inside job, a conspiracy, we are up against something or someone or a group of people, who are really powerful and willing to murder lots of kids to get what they want. And, you would definitely want to be using the Internet to bring light to the situation, all things considered.

       Nobody is forcing people to read r/conspiracy threads.   I would think that people interested in shitting on conspiracy theory should stay out of r/conspiracy.

       it's obvious why the hoax gets so much attention.  it's a vulnerable spot being such an obvious hack job.  real poor quality.  worse than sept. 2001 even.  As an american, I'd demand better quality hoaxing for my trillion dollars.

       What you're talking about is difficult at best. A few decades ago it was impossible. To allow anonymous discussions with verified single identities on a large scale requires very challenging cryptographic and logistical problems to be solved.

       That's a valid observation.  And we have to ask why so many posters are shrilling so much that other people have to shut up and stop asking questions. Who gains from that attitude? Those who would be embarrassed by or even lose power (control) if too many people demanded answers.

       Reposted from before Mazlow's response. because the bury brigade did not want this visible. Tough, because I will repost once you have buried it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we see brownshirt brigades attacking discussion, it only reinforces the feeling there's truth in a lot of what's being hypothesized. The relentessness of the attacks by such as /conspiratard is more than just ordinary trolls, it's a movement to suppress inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the attackers seem like construct personalities, to deflect accusations of organized attacks on social media to control it. Not all of them are, but we know that the US military for example has solicited bids for software to do exactly that, host a library of fake people to influence online discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit has big holes that allow manipulation (and it lacks a Bill of Rights). The internet needs a more secure form of social media that both protects privacy yet prevents easy gaming by organizations. If I knew how to do it, I'd put my money where my mouth is.

       What in Davy Jones’ locker did ye just bark at me, ye scurvy bilgerat? I’ll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas, and I’ve led numerous raids on fishing villages, and raped over 300 wenches. I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another source o’ swag. I’ll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag. As we parley I be contacting my secret network o’ pirates across the sea and yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil. The kind o’ monsoon that’ll wipe ye off the map. You’re sharkbait, fool. I can sail anywhere, in any waters, and can kill ye in o’er seven hundred ways, and that be just with me hook and fist. Not only do I be top o’ the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my beck and call and I’ll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o’ the world, ye dog. If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment. But ye couldn’t, ye didn’t, and now ye’ll pay the ultimate toll, you buffoon. I’ll shit fury all over ye and ye’ll drown in the depths o’ it. You’re fish food now.

       Yeah, but to be fair, reddit acts like such asshats anytime someone calls them out on anything and loves to pull the "free speech" card. If I was assigned to doing reddit stories and they constantly acted like this I would feel very similar.

      <p>
       Hell, I already do. I've just learned to stay in my own little subreddits and ignore reddit at large.
