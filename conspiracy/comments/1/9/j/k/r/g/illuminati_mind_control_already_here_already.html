        mind control
       </a>
       involves the activation and suppression of action potentials, the firing of an individual neuron, in a pattern which creates a real effect in the brain of humans.  It can so

        subtle, you might not even notice it happening to you.
       </a>
       Neurons fire in patterns, and in groups, and the result of these firing patterns is thoughts, feelings, movements, etc.  It is scientifically possible to cause these firing patterns to be activated remotely, without the use of an implant, by "injecting" electricity into individual neurons using advanced technology.

       For the last 5 decades, U.S. intelligence has done a significant amount of research and development into a technology called "
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(codename">
        TEMPEST
       </a>
       ."  This technology was originally used in order to reconstruct usable information from monitors, integrated circuits, etc in order to remotely surveil electronic devices.  Later, technology was developed which was able to do the
       <strong>
        reverse
       </strong>
       , and cause these machines to act in a certain manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human brains are, for all intents and purposes purposes, advanced computers whose mechanism of action is the product of electrical impulses, and the technology surrounding "TEMPEST" could be modified to take control of, and remotely surveil the thoughts and feelings of human beings.

       We are trying to save the world from a tyrannical intergovernmental organization that is hell bent on destroying our species. Please help by reading the links below, and then acting.   I'd like it if the first action you took was telling everyone you know to read the same thing.   This will start what has been called an awakening at which point public knowledge of something really insidious might help to stop it from happening.

        How I know about mind control.
       </strong>
       This is a work in progress, updated daily.  It is a personal story of Illuminati mind control, gang-stalking, psycho-surveillance, and general weirdness.  It takes you through the story of events that occurred between 2010 and 2011, and describes my inner thoughts and interaction with the dark force shaping the future of humanity.  I believe this force to be older than humanity, unearthly, and directly responsible for many religious phenomenon throughout our history.   It is also current engaging world governments, intelligence agencies, and organized crime in a conspiracy designed to fulfill the prophesy of Revelation.

       First hand testimony ain't shit. If you have some sort of free energy perpetual motion machine or know someone that does, than please let them step forward with proof of this and let the evidence speak for itself. We can go ahead and throw out the 2nd law of thermodynamics while we're at it, as well as heisenburgs uncertainty principal and the rest of our thousands of years of scientific inquiry as well. Let this person who owns such a device step forward to claim their spot as the most brilliant man know to all of history so that a million years from now our children will read about him in history books. He can go ahead and claim every Nobel prize for the next century while he's at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, however, you have no evidence of a working device, than kindly stop making shit up on the Internet where teenagers may find it and think it's real.

       "It's also possible to reverse entanglement"
      </p>
      <p>
       Uh..
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah this is some campy bullshit and while I make throwaways for reddit, all of reddit because it's a fucking garbage collectivist pop culture training camp, the last thing I am is a disinfo agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It IS just media and social pressure. Flashing video clips with commentary IS enough to shape your thoughts. Literally, it carves neural pathways against your will and being presented with different views causes tension - cognitive dissonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't "reverse entanglement". This post shows a complete lack of any sort of understanding into what Quantum Mechanics even MEANS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The program is to give people easy access to sin and slavery. It is not to make meat puppets out of people. It doesn't "count" then, and if you know anything about this stuff you'll know what that means.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOUR POST is disinfo. It is pseudo science bullshit that discredits anyone telling their friends and relatives about "media mind control" that might have heard such joke ass shit about "mind control"
      </p>
      <p>
       May there be a way to control someone like this? Possibly. Is the goal to control EVERYONE in this way? No way. People need to walk through that door of their own free will for it to mean anything. This would be, at best, a tool to use here and there on a throwaway for the person of mass culture shaping - if even that.

       It does have a lot of woo. All of my friends are physicists and they all claim categorically that they do NOT understand quantum mechanics, they can use it, but it completely escapes them. I have one friend who, during his undergrad years (theoretical physics) claimed absolutely that he could understand it on some deep, almost spiritual level. He was wrong by his own admission, he in fact was guilty of and demonstrating perfectly, the Dunning-Kruger effect. Namely, the less you know of something, the more you think you know. It ties in with the old saying, a little knowledge is dangerous. Too many times the 'weirdness' of quantum mechanics pops up in these threads as though to confirm some pseudoscience BS, with links to YouTube and wikipedia as fact, or less often an actual published paper, usually taken way out of context. Too many similarities with conspiracy theorists in the way they think and how they process information, they're not retarded, on the contrary, a lot of them are quite smart.

       Feeding my addiction. I can't get enough of this stuff. And a post with QM is too good to pass on, I have to read more. I have not read all your links, but I'm getting through them. I like to take time reading stuff so you'll have to bear with me. It can take months for me to read a scientific paper, some things can't be rushed.

       Do you understand what this means?   I think you don't understand quantum entanglement which isn't surprising.  There's no actual teleporting of charge going on at all.  Please show me why you have such a mistaken understanding?
      </p>
      <p>
       In quantum entanglement, or 'spooky action at a distance' experiments, one particle exhibits the same spin (not charge) as another particle - e.g. two positrons created by the same event are said to be 'quantum entangled' in this way.   There is no teleportation of charge that I'm aware of.  Please enlighten me if you're not mistaken.

       From your original comment it seems you don't really understand what a 'qubit' is, let alone the difference between spin and charge.
       <br/>
       Spin and charge are both properties of some particles, and both have been shown to be "effected" by entanglement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Down below here, you comment that the paper I linked you to, that you read, says
       <strong>
        teleport charge qubits.
       </strong>
       You attacked the word
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation">
        teleport
       </a>
       , because you don't understand what it means in context.  It also appears you are not quite sure what the function of a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">
        qubit
       </a>
       is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it mildly humorous that you attacked wikipedia, since I gave you those links to show you that this is commonly accepted knowledge, not esoteric quantum mechanics.  I guess you didn't get the point.

       apparently you just accept this - but don't understand what it means.  there is not teleportation.   the one particle knows the state of the other through non-classical means.   and you leap from there to teleporting charge states that affect neurons.. you can't see how pseudo-scientific this is - enjoy.

       it isn't just knowing the state, it's copying the state through space time.  whether you are talking about charge or spin, you are changing the properties of one entangled particle, by modifying the other -- this is what 'teleportation' means in quantum mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
       meanwhile, when you are talking about charge instead of spin, that process could definitely cause the firing or suppression of an action potential.  it's not psuedoscience, its obvious.

       quantum entanglement is not teleportation of charge.  the proposal is to use 'superraciance' to 'teleport' charge qubits.    teleport is not a properly descriptive term for it, but I understand why it is used to gain common appreciation.

       do you see the links around the words you are trying to argue about?  those are the links you should read, after reading them,

        understanding what they say

       is an important second step.

       I understand why you want to sound smart... to uh gain "common appreciation," but you are wrong to comment on articles or papers that you do not really understand.

      <p>
       just to clarify, for everyone that upvoted your comment:  you as a "reddit commenter" read a paper written by quantum physicists, decided the
       <strong>
        used the wrong word

       That, is exactly how mind control works.  You have a preconceived notion, and no matter what you see or read, it will never change.  You will seek out
       <em>
        any and all
       </em>
       possible reasons not to change the belief you are mind controlled to have, regardless of its efficacy, and decide that your original belief must be correct.

       My mistake. You said you're a chemist with a familiarity with atmospheric chemistry. Which still isn't quantum mechanics, which is usually considered physics. No, I don't want you to post personal info. It would be helpful to your cause however, to mention at least where you got your degree, what degree it is, and who supervised your dissertation. That is hardly identifying information, as there are I am sure many people who've studied the same thing where you studied whatever it was, and I doubt even naming your professor would be identifying at all.

       or they also are 12, and worried about being 'doxed.'  most 12 year olds parents would probably be upset about their children claiming to be published physicists, so this all makes more sense now.

       Do you know who Heinrich Kluver &amp; Paul Busy are? In the late 1800’s they discovered through experimentation that the rhesus monkeys they experimented on who had their amygdales lesioned had profound behavioral shifts. These monkeys, who were caught in the wild would always react violently or aggressively with people. Monkeys who had a lesion became docile, and allowed people to poke &amp; pinch them.
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11060/">
        http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11060/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What was later discovered was that electrically stimulating, as opposed to destroying the applicable part of the amygdala creates a “rage response”.
       <a href="http://www.ane.pl/pdf/3355.pdf">
        http://www.ane.pl/pdf/3355.pdf
       </a>
       please note that artificial stimulation would make anger under these circumstances an involuntary response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you do understand that MANY human achievements have taken place since Kluver &amp; Busy’s discovery (e.g. Cellphones, Computers, human aviation, the internet) but neuroscience never stopped progressing!
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point in time, the entire human brain has been mapped out, including all primary motor and somatosensory functions.

       This means that scientists have determined the areas of the brain responsible for things down to an eye blink or a nose twitch, but this is laughably old news (you knew all of this, right?)

       How great is it to be able to play a video game with your mind? Although some would see this as a waste of mind-reading technology. Why would you care to sell a fancy controller to the public when you could instead keep mind-reading quiet and monitor the thoughts of foreign leaders? Seems like a simple choice, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And they’d never know if you wired them up using nanomachines:
       <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/02/body-implants/">
        http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/02/body-implants/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We know now that mind-reading technology is capable of RECEIVING information from our brains. Our brains are communicating with these devices. If mankind is capable of creating devices which can receive signals from our brains, do you really think that the creation and use of devices which can SEND information to our brains is a feat mankind is incapable of achieving?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let’s take a step back. Remember what you learned about your amygdala? Artificial stimulation of the amygdala unbeknownst to the target will produce an involuntary response. Our brains are biochemical machines DESIGNED to respond to certain stimuli, and artificial stimulation would simply be an exploitation of how we are built. If someone shocked the area of your amygdala responsible for anger, the “rage response” it is designed to prompt would occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what if you could use artificial stimulation WITH artificial thoughts? You could make people think and act in ways that they may not otherwise. This is especially true is people with certain psychological profiles are subjected to such treatments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine someone with little or no friends, and a lot of angst was targeted. For weeks this person is the recipient of a barrage of thoughts almost indistinguishable from his own such as “how dare they…” “they’re not getting away with that..” all being sent to him remotely, and in conjunction with the stimulation of the area of his amygdala responsible for anger. Eventually, the messages creep towards “I think I’m going to get a gun” and “I think I’ll do it today”.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you invest enough time (weeks, months, years) you could likely create a person capable of homicide. But because of the nature of the rage response, you wouldn’t end up with a cold, and calculating killer, but more likely something along the lines of a “school shooter”, at least for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this juncture I need to clearly state that all murderers are solely responsible for their own actions, but I will also state a few facts independent of opinion:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: This technology exists 2: This research field is not being properly regulated 3: as with everything, the potential for abuse exists 4: unknowing &amp; vulnerable populations have been exploited before, and as recently as 2005 when experimental AIDS medication was given to foster kids unbeknownst to them

       This technology does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       exist. There is such a monumental gap between reading an EEG and actually corresponding that to specific thoughts or impulses. What scientists are doing in these experiments is simply matching measurements to stimuli repeatedly. Don't get me wrong, it's incredibly cool but it isn't mind reading, it's more akin to being able to recognize
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       a brain is doing something in response to stimuli, not being able to see
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       the brain is doing. The word recognition example required thousands of sampling points to get even an attempt at matching words to responses. The machine would not be able to work had the subject not been in exactly the same situation thinking exactly the same thoughts that the machine was calibrated on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know how the brain works and neuroplasticity shows us that our brains our highly configurable and unique to each person. The concept of anything beyond trial and error pattern matching on calibrated stimuli is beyond our current understanding period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the jump to people being able to send messages. We had enough difficulty trying to flip bits in a highly engineered memory device twenty years ago and that was with placing a magnetic needles millimeters away. We are somehow managing to modify a highly complex, biological, constantly shifting system from a great distance all without emitting detectable radiation of any kind? Yeah, okay, no.

       This is wishful thinking and pathological science. You are extrapolating wildly without understanding the core principles of what you are extrapolating about.

       You are
       <em>
        wrong
       </em>
       .  Intelligence organizations have been researching this technology since the 1960's.  It exists, you just don't know about it.  There's links in both this comment and the original post.  Those links are smarter than you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for including the links, by the way, is because they disprove everything you are saying.  If the technology is not there, why was a well known researcher at
       <strong>
        Lockheed Martin
       </strong>
       talking about it... in
       <strong>
        US News and World Report
       </strong>
       ... in
       <strong>
        1999
       </strong>
       ?

      <p>
       At times like this I often feel the need to remind people that Phil Zimmerman did not invent public key cryptography.  The NSA did, two decades earlier.  I am not sure why they did not share it with the world.
This link might be interesting, or you might dismiss it as

       Have you posted this to r/neuroscience? Those guys over there are quite active in the field, you'll get some trained insight over there. To me it seems we're making progress but we're still a way off. Sure it sounds scary, but a lot of research might entail stimulating the brain and measuring a response, if that response is akin to mind control it isn't the purpose of the research, which is too learn about brain functions. Yes, all advances in knowledge can ultimately be used against us, but only by a minority, there are too many people working these areas to improve the world, the minority who abuse give the rest of us a bad name. The methods of mind control you mention are SciFi at best at the moment, we are manipulated far more effectively in more subtle ways and even then it doesn't quite work all the time.

       So, why stop at injecting thoughts?  Why not motor cortex control, or making the subject think they were at a shooting range.. just like..

       It's not the box, the computer hardware, that is the computer. It's not the thing within the box. It's not the thing that's within the thing that's within the box either. It's the logic and code that is embedded into those things deep down at a low level that controls all that hardware is that makes it like a brain. The state of Quantum Computing is close to being within a pin's prick of emerging to a point where it comes close to resembling something that is useful. Who knows what sort of code is possible on hardware that doesn't even exist yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists are becoming ever more aware of how computer-like the brain is the more they dig into it. They're beginning to be able to interface with it, directly give it input and receive raw output that actually translates into something meaningful. That's a computer. We just don't know the code. We don't understand the hardware.

       Almost. The brain processes information differently than a computer. A computer can only handle one thing at a time, so called serial processing, the brain on the other hand uses parallel processing. Advances in computers are trying to bring us parallel processing but it's no where near what organic brains are capable of. More research is needed, more open, transparent, publicly available research that is. I despise science done secretly, though I can understand their motives. But to me science is a human achievement and should benefit everyone!

       I met a man in the ER today.  He was a black middle aged man being forced to stay in his room by security.  He was swearing his house and car were being bugged because he would say something in private and friends and family would repeat it to him later.  He accused me numerous times of trying to read his mind.  I felt really bad for him.  It's very difficult to differentiate between crazy and concise in these circumstances.

       Hi others,
      </p>
      <p>
       As I noted many months ago, understanding the
       <em>
        qualia
       </em>
       of electrical brain stimulation is crucial if you want to understand mind control and the mental mazes that it can be used to construct:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Individuals whose brain centers are electrically stimulated believe their evoked actions are their own ideas; their conscious mind rationalizes the evoked actions away.
        <strong>
         People experiencing this electrical stimulation aren't consciously aware of an external influence.
        </strong>
        (José Delgado,
        <em>
         Physical control of the mind: toward a psychocivilized society
        </em>
        ; p. 116.)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This has a couple of implications.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         If an outside controller wants to make you do something using electrical brain stimulation, and
         <em>
          it seems like a reasonable thing to do
         </em>
         , you'll do it without hesitation, and even think it was your idea.  Brainwashing changes a person's idea of what seems reasonable.  Brainwashing can turn ordinary people into loaded weapons - and electrical brain stimulation used on those people "pulls the trigger".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If several people around you are having this kind of technology used on them, they can easily be made to do things that "seem reasonable" to them but that, from your perspective, seem threatening.  There's a carefully designed sequence of events a person can be led through, which I call "The Program", which will cause most people to self-destruct and may lead them to act out violently.  In my opinion it is based on the use of electrical brain stimulation (used on the target, and others around him, in a very deceptive way).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I talk about it in "The Program, explained" and "Sleight of Mind: deception and mind control" in a couple of
       <a href="http://www.talkshoe.com/talkshoe/web/talkCast.jsp?masterId=96083&amp;amp;cmd=tc">
        podcasts
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, pretty much every 'victim' web site or support group is worse than useless.  They
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       assets who are foaming at the mouth (negative PR and ridicule is an important aspect of the disinformation ecosystem surrounding this subject) and those assets will be goaded into spewing nonsense, non-stop.

       So I read through the four pages of comments you've posted in the last 20 days searching for something to indicate that you are not a quantum physicist.  I'm pretty sure you are not, but all I found was... lots of comments about r/conspiracy stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       What "field" are you a published author in?  Could you link us to a ... published paper?
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't just a spelling mistake, you said something completely retarded.  I guess you don't want to argue about the fact that you think the physicists misused a word, and your reason for them doing that was uh, "appreciation".

       From your original comment it seems you don't really understand what a 'qubit' is, let alone the difference between spin and charge.
       <br/>
       Spin and charge are both properties of some particles, and both have been shown to be "effected" by entanglement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Down below here, you comment that the paper I linked you to, that you read, says
       <strong>
        teleport charge qubits.
       </strong>
       You attacked the word
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation">
        teleport
       </a>
       , because you don't understand what it means in context.  It also appears you are not quite sure what the function of a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">
        qubit
       </a>
       is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it mildly humorous that you attacked wikipedia, since I gave you those links to show you that this is commonly accepted knowledge, not esoteric quantum mechanics.  I guess you didn't get the point.

       I can publish a kids book and then call myself a child psychologist... you're not published... you're not an author anymore than a person who sits behind a keyboard making crazy conspiracy claims... send me your lawyer's info, I'm gonna sue you.
