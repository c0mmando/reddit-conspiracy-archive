       First off, I would like to say that I hate the show. I don't give a shit about celebrities and I don't think anyone should. They get paid millions for acting. ACTING. I really don't understand why people care about "the next scandal." Which, sometimes, the scandals have in fact been set up. Paparazzi and all of the mass media who praise actors. And then the magazines of things that say "Actress shows you how to spice up your sex life" or something like that. Or the magazines given to younger women (mostly teen to pre teen) that have all of this bullshit to get them to like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for reading, I guess it was just kind of a rant. I'm so fed up with all of their shit and people seem to think it's crazy that it would be propaganda. If you have any thoughts on this that'd be great.

       I'm familiar with TMZ the show, but their online presence is even stronger. Instant updates on the most banal of things. The cult of celebrity and how it distorts normal day to day life is obscene. Little girls "worshipping" Kim Kardashians and Teen Moms along with their own mothers?? It makes me sick.

       "Actor" and "actress" are just terms used to cover up what they really are.  They are people who are paid to convince you they are someone else.  They are "professional liars", operating under the guise of "entertainment".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Academy Awards is disgusting: people who are professional liars voting on who's the best at lying.

       You and I may not be tricked by movies, but many people are.  I was speaking to a friend regarding details of Flight 93 a few years ago, and I was told, "That's not what happened in the movie!"  Another case is how many people are willing to accept "Schindler's List" as nonfiction, when it is a fictional movie based on a fictional book based on word-of-mouth.

       that's not what i mean at all, it's that you don't seem capable of watching any movie purely for entertainment value. you don't have to be paranoid 24/7, unless you want to i guess. sounds like a shitty existence.

       It's not.  I just don't care about the "lifestyles of the rich and famous".  People that stand around the water cooler at work, describing the awesome scenes from the latest Hollywood blockbuster, as if it were anything more than camera trickery---that seems like a shitty existence to me.

       Have you considered that they may be gathered around the water cooler appreciating art, knowing full well that Optimus Prime didn't really get thrown through an office building?

      <p>
       This is the paranoia he was referring too:  you indicate you are actually convinced that movies have "duped" your average water-cooler patron.

      <p>
       It is art, whether you think it is good art or bad art can't change that.  The Mona Lisa doesn't really tickle my fancy, but I don't get all hot and bothered, suppressing the urge to scream "

       I see, but United 93 was in no way a blockbuster; by an order of magnitude.  ZD30 hardly did better: Transformers DSotM made damn near ZD30's worldwide gross in it's first weekend.

       You opened making it seem like all movies are farces put on by liars to trick you, and show great disdain for those who enjoy them.  It is art.

       Hollywood "magic" can be used, and frequently
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       used, to portray lies as truth; or fiction as non-fiction, if you prefer.  Movies like
       <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/17/zero-dark-thirty-argo">
        Argo and Zero Dark Thirty
       </a>
       ,
       <em>
        based
       </em>
       on actual events, leave many (if not most) people believing that was the way things actually went down.  It can and does cause people to accept lies as truth.
      </p>

       When Reagan was running for president, he repeated on multiple occasions the story of a bomber pilot who went down with the plane rather than abandon the gunner trapped in the belly of the plane.  People ate it up.  It was fiction, from an old black-and-white movie called A Wing and A Prayer.

       I believe that the reason people worship celebrities the way they do is because TV shows, like TMZ, seem to mythologize celebrities.  It makes people feel that these actors/musicians are someone to look up to.  You can see the effect this has on the younger generations.  Young girls are growing up watching Kim Kardashian (Spelling?) make a complete fool of herself and they still idolize her like she is some sort of god.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also seems to be incredibly relevant when it comes to black impoverished communities all over the world.  Society backs them into a corner and limits the chances they have at success.  They in turn will begin to look up to successful black musicians who they can relate to because of the common messages they find in their music.  Most rappers these days seem to just flaunt the amount of money they have.  Their lyrics are all based around growing up in a hard life that has been full of gang violence, drugs, sex, and of course the never ending quest to make as much money as possible.  I know that this doesn't apply to all black people, but I'm just making a generalization here and I apologize if I offended anybody.  This is just my own personal belief.

       I've had the thought that since elites control most mainstream entertainment sources, they have set it up so that they, the elites, are valorized/idolized. Celebrity stuff, sports, etc (win/lose thinking - winners are awesome; must be the "best", seeking wealth is the main goal in life...).
      </p>
      <p>
       On a positive note, there seems to be a constant effort required to keep people in this mindset, so maybe this kind of thinking isn't native to some or most people.

       It's the opiate mainline. Feed them images of "celebrities" who they can strive to be like. Make them drowned their lives out with the importance of those on the boob tube. Keep watching and forgetting about your problems. apathy, disconnect, slowly giving up on everything but breathing, eating and shitting.
