        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This morning I noticed an excessive amount of man made looking clouds and trails left over from planes in the sky. Several trails run parallel to each other and eventually dissipate so much they connect just form a haze. I live in Santa Barbara, CA and this happens periodically throughout the day sometimes. There is an airport nearby so air traffic is pretty heavy in this area. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/AVgCy">Here</a> are some shots I took before leaving for work. </p>

<p>Anyways, why is it that sometimes planes leave behind these excessively long trails that last in the sky for several hours and sometimes a planes trail disappear after a few seconds? I am in no way an airplane expert and have no knowledge of what is normal and what is not as far as planes go. I have just noticed that sometimes they leave trails, sometimes they don&#39;t. I&#39;ve read a little into chemtrails but would like to read some other sources and information. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The height of the cloud ceiling on that particular day, and whether the plane is above or below it, will determine whether the vapor exhaust condenses and forms trails or not.  The height of the cloud ceiling depends mainly on temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>@ A crony man: I&#39;m in BC and we&#39;re in the end of a closed valley, and before all this shit started happening we already had the worst air quality in the country, but the sky was still blue. Now it&#39;s obscene.  They start around 4-5am (I am up everyday, watchin&#39; them.) You know what you don&#39;t get to see in a CONTRAIL? Definition of shape. An artist would have to use their artist skills to render a likeness of a CHEMTRAIL. No two are alike. All an artist would have to do to draw a contrail? A simple, single fucking line. DONE. Contrails often occur much higher, 3 miles or more. CHEMTRAILS in MY AREA often appear to be as low as 5000 ft, or about a mile. By noon whatever blue the sky had managed to muster hitherto was a wash of grey-silver haze. Not brown-beige-yellow like pollution. White-silver. ACROSS the WHOLE SKY. FOR AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE. I live two doors down from the house I grew up in and lived in around 1976 to 1986. I know what the sky looked like. I remember the clouds. I remember watching contrails disappearing as fast as they were created. I never once saw the skywriting I see today.</p>

<p>So you keep on thinking you know what we see in our skies. You don&#39;t have a clue. And fuck off trying to come off as rational for nature and we&#39;re the kooks who are makin&#39; you look bad. FUCK YOU.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geo engineering involves Arial spraying of small particles of aluminum and barium to combat global warming. Chem trails are basically the bi-product of that. Some claim that other things are being sprayed into the atmosphere based on the evidence and history of the US Gov spraying citizens with harmful substances and using the public as a controlled test study.</p>

<p>The US government has admitted to geo engineering and claim that everything they are spraying is completely safe. Although, frankly, there is no real way to know what the long term effects may be.</p>

<p>I have started to pay attention to the spraying in my area. Ive noticed a pattern. One day there will be heavy chem trails and then the next two days it will be very foggy in the morning and slightly rainy. The rain actually leaves this yellow powdery substance on all of my plants-its pretty gross, actually. I wouldn&#39;t mind documenting these things online, but it would be cell phone quality work. </p>

<p>Really?  Because the link you provide speak about the spraying of zinc cadmium sulfide particles into the air to track dispersal patterns as a safety assessment during the Cold War.  <strong>That&#39;s not geo-engineering.</strong>  And there has only been anecdotal evidence of harm coming from these largely benign, fluorescent particles.  Again, this was a short term series of wind dispersal measurements taken in the public interest.</p>

<p>NASA admits that contrails likely affect weather patterns and this means that all jets are having an impact on climate change.  ICEs tend to kick out a bunch of dirty gases and fine particulates, at altitudes where ice crystals can form and seed clouds - this has been supposed for many years.</p>

<p>But it is a HUGE stretch to cite what some would consider a necessary and important tactical risk assessment driven by an actual shift in weapons technology and NASA&#39;s admissions on human impact and then turn around and spout some vague paranoia that any plane in the sky might be an evil, geoegineering Illuminati pilot fucking up your air quality.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll need better info if you expect me to believe your goofy little yellow residue anecdote.  Just because the air is fucked up, doesn&#39;t mean it;s the government&#39;s evil clandestine plan - more likely it&#39;s some corporation shirking their responsibilities to the common good and violating already weak regulations with impunity, no legal accountability, and a measly fine when caught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have also been paying attention to the planes in my area and have noticed the same thing. Some of them leave no visible trail, others leave a normal, quickly dissolved trail, and yet others leave a trail that hovers for quite a while. Also, there are some planes that seem to go back and forth leaving trails. (On that, I could be mistaken, since there are so many planes). I live in Florida, and am between two major airports and a couple of smaller ones, so there is a ton of air traffic. I came across an article here a week or so ago that really made me start think about it and pay attention. </p>

<p>I need to do a little more research to fully formulate an educated opinion, but given the state of everything else and what is currently happening in the world, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too far of a stretch to believe that biochemical warfare is taking place or on the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask Paul McCartney.  He knows - he had the Russians seed clouds ahead of his outdoor performance.   They used rockets.  It&#39;s common knowledge.  Russians don&#39;t do it the expensive way for fun... they do it the economical way,...</p>

<p>Also Beijing olympics.. Chinese did the same thing..</p>

<p>For London Olympics it looks like they went overboard!  UK had it&#39;s rainiest spring/summer in memory, and mostly good weather (relatively speaking) for the games..  Silver ions in rockets.   Google.</p>

<p>&quot;.. The most common chemicals used for cloud seeding include silver iodide and dry ice&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cloud seeding chemicals may be dispersed by aircraft (as in the second figure) or by dispersion devices located on the ground (generators, as in first figure, or canisters fired from anti-aircraft guns or rockets). For release by aircraft, silver iodide flares are ignited and dispersed as an aircraft flies through the inflow of a cloud. When released by devices on the ground, the fine particles are carried downwind and upwards by air currents after release.</p>

<p>An electronic mechanism was tested in 2010, when infrared laser pulses were directed to the air above Berlin by researchers from the University of Geneva.[2] The experimenters posited that the pulses would encourage atmospheric sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide to form particles that would then act as seeds.[2]&quot;</p>

<p>why stop cloud seeding?  with a fucked up climate we might need to become experts at it.   at one point irrigation wasn&#39;t necessary... now we have fucked over the land so badly with monoculture mass farming techniques that without artificial irrigation we&#39;d starve!</p>

<p>Misleading at best. The vast, vast majority of those who did work on the Manhattan Project did not know the nature of the project. They did their own thing, working on some far corner of the project, without ever knowing they were working on an atomic bomb. Very few actually know the scope and specificity of the project.</p>

<p>The US government has admitted to geo engineering</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?  Because the link you provide speak about the spraying of zinc cadmium sulfide particles into the air to track dispersal patterns as a safety assessment during the Cold War.  <strong>That&#39;s not geo-engineering.</strong>  And there has only been anecdotal evidence of harm coming from these largely benign, fluorescent particles.  Again, this was a short term series of wind dispersal measurements taken in the public interest.</p>

<p>NASA admits that contrails likely affect weather patterns and this means that all jets are having an impact on climate change.  ICEs tend to kick out a bunch of dirty gases and fine particulates, at altitudes where ice crystals can form and seed clouds - this has been supposed for many years.</p>

<p>But it is a HUGE stretch to cite what some would consider a necessary and important tactical risk assessment driven by an actual shift in weapons technology and NASA&#39;s admissions on human impact and then turn around and spout some vague paranoia that any plane in the sky might be an evil, geoegineering Illuminati pilot fucking up your air quality.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll need better info if you expect me to believe your goofy little yellow residue anecdote.  Just because the air is fucked up, doesn&#39;t mean it;s the government&#39;s evil clandestine plan - more likely it&#39;s some corporation shirking their responsibilities to the common good and violating already weak regulations with impunity, no legal accountability, and a measly fine when caught.</p>
