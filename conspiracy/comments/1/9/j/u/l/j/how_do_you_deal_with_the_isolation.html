       I was just wondering how others deal with the immense sense of isolation that learning brings? Every moment my awareness grows, I find myself drifting further from 'the world' so to speak. Ironically, I know this is the exact opposite of what I should be doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that one of the ways we can overcome all of this is by realizing that we are not as alone as we had imagined. There are others (perhaps even on the same street) who we can talk to and grow with. Finding them is the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       And theres the crux of my problem. I'm finding it hard to want to be around people at all, I am so tired of playing a role.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to note, I do not talk about this with anyone in my life, such as family. I am an typical introvert who is intensely private and they have no idea of my views. I am just starting to feel that only option is to sustain a fake persona, which I am just not going to do any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example of this recently, I was having christmas dinner with  family and am asked if I had watched this advert that is currently on tv. I reply that I have not seen it, I don't have tv (in the normal sense). Not a slur, I'm not being a snob. I just don't watch tv in a traditional way and much of it doesn't appeal to me anyway. I get a patronizing 'I doooon't watch tv' mimic back at me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This occurs with language as well. I am patronized if I speak, well, normal. Not ridiculous vocabulary either, just words that any reader would naturally pick up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is ubiquitous and unrelenting, and I feel like I'm in an asylum. At what point did self improvement become a dirty word?
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't notice the advert question really until now after having put it into words, that is the perfect metaphor for exactly what I am discussing. Adverts are a talking point on christmas day. In an of itself, whatever, we can all talk lightly but in context of this post, I think it it displays it perfectly.

       People are intimidated, threatened and offended by intellectuals. Not that intellect is some supreme attribute, but rather, certain people are afraid of being outwitted when shit hits the fan. Having a fat wallet, a big dick or a sharp mind isn't something everyone can celebrate with you, unless you've convinced them that you're 100% on their side.

       Don't get obsessed with conspiracies. There are some people who actually suffer from a variety of severe mental illnesses because they just lose themselves in assumption and paranoia. Accept that there are things outside your control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew a man who got so obsessed with Israel and Jews controlling the world that he ended up killing a family including a kid thinking they were Jewish. If I remember right, they actually weren't.

       Great advice there. I can't let this control me or even make me fear, it's just the amount of corruption is so large and touches almost everything. I'm itching to be around people that give me hope and strength.
      </p>

       Killing anyone based on nationality or culture is insane! I can see how lack of moderation in these matters can be deadly and I try to keep myself grounded with healthy things, such as art and study.

       Its hard to find people who give you hope and strength, especially a friend who makes you feel that way. Find old acquaintances and mingle around; I was surprised to find what I was looking for.

       Dont play a role which makes you feel uncomfortable. We all wear masks but only rarely do we show our face to others.

       Oh we are not as alone as we once imagined. Sometimes we snap ourselves out of this dream, or at other times someone is waking you up with a smile, a plate of eggs and bacon. Simply, be awesome, surround yourself with awesome. My view of awesome is that we are all just god damn awesome. Like, Boba Fett awesome.

       You need to realize that people aren't as stupid as you seem to think. The majority of people turn a blind eye to the truth when they are uncomfortable with the implications. Not having a TV in this day and age is like being a vegetarian in the early 1900's. You can't expect people to understand you or your rationality when you don't interact with them. Instead of blaming society for your feelings of isolation, how about you take actions into your own hands and try to make others understand your views. Talk about politics, speak up to your family about controversial bills and proposals, and, if all else fails, don't look down on your fellow man for his ignorance. Instead blame those who are responsible for the awareness limiting media and education system.

       A lack of empathy comes from a lack of connection. When the majority of someone's human interaction comes from a screen, where do you think that leads? People need to get out of their house more. Go to a park and talk to someone, say "Hi." when you pass someone on the street. Waking people up isn't all about forcing shocking statistics on them, it's about making them see the reality in front of them.

       It is not easy being different from the people around you. It takes courage to be open and admit that you do not share the same belief systems that "normal" people do.
      </p>
      <p>
       But once you become open and freely admit what you believe, without any shame, people will generally respect you for it (even if they don't agree with you). Some people will gravitate towards you and ask you about this stuff (it is an interesting topic, even though we are supposed to feel ashamed for believing any of it). Some people will even admit to you that they feel the same way... you'll make new friends. 
Of course, there are some people who might react negatively... but in my experience the only negative reaction I have come across is that a very small amount of people don't really seem to want to talk to me much after they know what I believe - but that's fine because if they don't like me, then that's just too bad for them really... it's not like I have lost any good friends over this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big problem comes in having discussions with people. When I first started to understand what was going on, I tried to convert everyone. I was very passionate and I was angry. This is not good. Anger doesn't win people over. It took a few years for me to understand how to talk to people about it without getting into arguments or alienating people. Now if someone disagrees with me, I am totally fine with it, and I can still like that person and be sharing a laugh with them in the next sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I do share your frustration with people in general. I don't think that they don't care, I think that many people willfully refuse to believe (or give any time to) the conspiracies because it challenges not just one belief, but their entire world view. Also, all the crazies out there spouting provably false conspiracy theories are not helping making us look legit, so it is easy for them to discount us and go back to their nice, safe, comfortable lives and belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, good luck being you. No need to be ashamed. Being different is not a crime - it is what makes the world a more interesting place. If people around you can't see that, then it is their problem... Just be you and be a good person. What else can you do?

       Oh, they are like aliens to me. For a very long time I thought that there was something wrong with me and that this sociopathic attitude my family have was normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are the type of people that will group up and verbally attack someone in the guise of humour to publicly humiliate them. If they can get everyone else to laugh, it encourages them further. There are no bounds, and it is not just me in the family that gets this. It could be weight, nationality, intelligence. It seems to be anyone with empathy, They can almost smell it on a person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately I realize that they are like this at the moment when they suddenly want to know me! For some bizarre reason, I've suddenly been accepted into this sick clique and I'm still wondering why.

       Thank you for this, I love meeting kindred spirits. Everyone is so busy trying to survive and the task is so large that nobody wants to lead. We will all have to lead by example.

       Not to be too cheesy, but my mind always jumps to something Andy says in Shawshank redemption:
      </p>
      <p>
       Andy: And in here. That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you. Haven't you ever felt that way about music?
Red: I played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost interest in it though. Didn't make much sense in here. 
Andy: Here's where it makes the most sense. You need it so you don't forget. 
Red: Forget? 
Andy: Forget that there are places in this world that aren't made out of stone. That there's something inside...that they can't get to, that they can't touch. That's yours. 
Red: What are you talking about? 
Andy: Hope. 
Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. It's got no place here. Better get used to the idea.

       I'm 47 and my family and friends have told me many times about how this  is very dark stuff and they feel they cannot change any of what is happening , and they are right on that point. Here we have a situation where the vast majority of the kids who sign up to go overseas and "fight for freedom" have no idea what they are really there for. I had another friend that said I would not have the life I have(nice home, life, career, vacations, cars, boats, bikes, etc... ) if it were for not those things that we do overseas and I cannot disagree on that point. But all of this material bullshit I have in my life , I cannot justify as I look in the mirror. They risk death so that you and I can sit here and bitch about everything that is wrong with this world and our country.   But my retort to all of this is, if I can save one life by making them aware so that they don't go down and offer themselves on a platter to live another day, I think I have done my job. I think of all the lives lost fighting over a piece of paper, and or even if it was gold, I don't think it is right ,asking someone else to do so that I would have a better life. It would be one thing if I/we are being attacked. Hell at my age I would pick up a gun to defend us also. But that is not the case. So try not to get to down about what is going on. My friends and family are right, over 99.9999% do not have any power to change what is going on. If it came to armageddon and the gov'ts were cracking down on people and commiting genocide well then its all hands on deck. But that is not what is happening now.  When I grew up there was a movie called the day after, about everyone pressing the button to send off nucs everywhere and the world goes up in a bunch of mushroom clouds. I have lived with that one for 30 years, and I don't give it a second thought, if it were to happen so be it. Just have as much fun as you can. Live as if today were your last day and plan as though you will live forever. Strike that balance in life and you will find happiness. Go make babies with that beautiful lover and find real peace and happiness in spite of all the ugliness of this world. I promise it is worth it. My girls are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

       This is the problem. Don't go hardcore on them. Say, "Hey, guess what I learnt today" and then speak about a topic. Don't make that all you talk about. But for instance, I often speak about federal reserve actions that a lot of people haven't heard of- most people find it somewhat interesting and then they share something they've learnt or read about with me. Make sure you simply engage people with what they are talking about too.

       I know that feeling. Reading through my school reports, the common theme was 'Needs to interact and stop daydreaming'. I basically grew up on the net and I feel that now even that avenue is being eroded away. Nothing feels authentic anymore and the manipulation is absolutely everywhere.

       Where do we go from here?  I feel one answer would be to simply keep stepping in the direction that you personally feel is most ideal for you regardless of what that direction might be.  I know that might be an entirely nebulous response, but I think that while being in
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       much isolation and not having any actual physical, day-to-day interaction can be NOT a good thing, I also very much feel that one's imagination is a powerful, powerful tool that can be used to enrich one's life in such a manner that can help one
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       need to really feel themselves living in
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       much isolation really.  Hell, although I haven't done it
       <em>
        super
       </em>
       lately, I tend to make it a point to just go on a lot of random drives throughout the city I live in...Just fill up the car w/gas and go drive around randomly...hopefully get lost - actually
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to get lost...just to see the sites, see what's around, park and get out and take in the air and walk around if I find an interesting place.  Sometimes I come across some really neat and fascinating things.  Sometimes it just helps to clear your head a bit.

       Possibly, but I certainly wouldn't give myself that much credit.  No sooner than I think I'm cool or doing something right than life shows me just how much of a stupid fuck up I am.  All I know is that I at least

       Have you even read anything about human evolution, everything that we have is accredited through interactions with other people. Positive emotions, speech, physical touch, were all needed in the early days(pure civilization) for humans to actually survive. All that is still needed for the human psyche to be healthy, it wouldn't make sense at all for us to go from a social group to an introverted group.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to be a lot more into the future as current technology couldn't make it possible for us to be fully introverts yet.

       It would be the opposite of what you suggested in the next step in our evolution. That would make us more connected then separated. Just like websites, communities would form on this brain net. Even then something like that wouldn't make sense. Are brains our nothing like regular computers, they are more like a NAS. They can hold a ton of information that can be accessed instantly. While most computers can do complicated events multiple times at once. Good luck figuring repeating loops in the thousands in half a second like an computer. The brain just doesn't need to do high speed calculations like a computer. There is no need to connect our brains like they are computers it would make more sense for our brains to be connected to the same network hosted in different nodes like the internet however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something like that though, it would basically be what Google glass is but without the hardware. Imagine like the matrix when you need to learn something all you need to do is run a get command and you know it. If we reached that point most of our lives would be probably be focused on academics or something. It would be weird to grow up as a child in that time where everyone is basically equal in intellect. I'm sure you can think of a lot of implications (to much for me to write) if we were all equal in intelligence based on what politics would form, what would wealth mean, if an economy is possible, if some didn't want to join, etc etc

       Ever hear of hive mind? We would become like worker bees. Don't let yourself be tricked into joining a "global consciousness", that's what TPTB want. They want us to all be tapped into the same information source so that they can find a way to control everyone all at once. Think about it, social networking is about as close as we've come to having every human connected to the same spigot.

       I actually posted almost the same thing a few months ago. I was so depressed and anxious about all the things I had learned and the fact that if talked to anyone about it I would be looked on like an idiot, or at best they just wouldn't understand. Even now I get it sometimes but it is much better. What did I do differently? Well honestly I didn't really do anything, it just kind of came. First I think I kind of learned to just adapt to it, but more importantly I expressed my views to an extent. I helped educated those around me, and made it known to those around me that I am aware of this information, and found many people who already knew this stuff but never talked about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would
       <em>
        make
       </em>
       (and continue to do so today) those close to me, review the information that I have reviewed. If you just say 'oh blah blah new world order', they are going to think you're crazy, but if you don't preface it and just show them the same information that got you to where you are, it will be much more effective. Of course start them off with the much more easily digestible things, such as (documentaries) the Zeitgeist series, Loose Change, The Corporation, Owned and Operated, Invisible Empire, Gasland, Inside Job, The Union, Secrecy, etc. Or tell them to look up the Iran Contra Affair, Operation Northwood, the Bayer AIDs affair, Bhopal, DDT, Agent Orange, etc. Making them watch even one film such as Loose Change will most likely make them go 'holy shit'. Most still don't care; to my knowledge no one whom I've had this 'holy shit' moment with went on to actually attempt to study it to any level comparative to how those of us around here do, but they are still more educated and still more open minded as a result. I think those of us who come to this information may be a 'special kind' of people. Whether that's because we got lucky in the way we were brought up, or whether we were just born with better critical thinking skills, or that acid we took in highschool, or something else, I couldn't comment on. Of course there are those who just happened to stumble upon such information and aren't all that great at weeding out what is fact and what isn't and why, but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make it a point to always be rational, calm, cool, collected, respectable, loving, caring, helpful. People will see this and respect you, making them more open to things that you believe and your opinions on things, and thus you can wake more people up,which should ultimately be the goal of anyone aware of this information regardless, and thus have more to talk about it with/feel less isolated. Of course, you should be kind, caring, rational, etc. regardless of the 'benefit', but I have notice that me being this kind of person has made many of those around me more open to the things I say/find-important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find things which you love and do them. The 'fear' that often begins to overwhelm anyone when first learning about this stuff plateaus and actually drops of significantly the more time that passes and the more you learn. Learning about science (quantum mechanics and astrophysics) has been a huge part in me being happier, along with more 'spiritual' things such as pyschedlics DMT, and lectures by Alan Watts, Terrence McKenna, etc. Even just learning about the people who actually made a difference, like MLK, Gandhi, Ron Paul, or just various places, people, things where liberty has prevailed gives me hope that we can change this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am just rambling at this point with no coherent structure in my writing so I am just gonna end it there. Hopefully some things I said will help you out!

       Don't mention that you don't watch TV, just jump to something worth talking about. Prior listening is important and the more you know someone the easier it will be. Don't lose an opportunity to create real discussion with your family. All that being said, it's still good to just shoot the shit about pointless crap every once and awhile. Know your audience and keep things enjoyable when possible.

       I feel the same way. Since i first saw a video on the cruelty of animals in the food industry i began to research and document all the information i could find and it shocked me how little anyone knows about this stuff. I too don't watch tv much at all. My news comes from the internet and generally from user-generated websites. I feel cut off from my family and friends because i know things that are too horrible to be on tv, if i told them about these things they would tell me i shouldn't be using the internet for such things. but i have to ask the question, is it better to remain blissfully ignorant or to seek truth and risk becoming depressed over it? i seek the truth and i will always feel alienated from my ignorant friends and family..

       We have become so reliant on the food industry, it's scary. It is one of the major things we need to address because who ever controls the food, controls us.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just keep on pushing. Food prices for example, my close family and I are now down to one meal a day (and we consider ourselves lucky), but they would have you believe that this isn't happening in western countries.

       This is an excellent post because I have been dealing with this same sense of isolation and a growing sense of urgency to awaken those around me. It's fascinating that some people respond positively and with intrigue as if it's something they had a sense of all along and didn't have the courage to embrace alone, while others act as if you are stirring them from a deep slumber and couldn't be more offended. Don't underestimate the depth and commitment some feel to the hypnosis.

       The truth scares the shit out of people, that's just how it is. Try and open people's eyes and if they can be opened beautiful you sparked that seed. I for one take it upon myself to be informed so when things go down I can help those ignorant who didn't have a clue, that's why it's a burden to be a truth seeker but we have a duty to fellow man and women no matter how ignorant they may be or how much empathy they lack. Who will they turn to when shit hits the fan ? You ! Because they won't be able to cope or comprehend with what's happening. Just remember your never alone the divine spirit is with you and you have a group of people on here that you can always talk to.

       deal with the isolation?
      </p>
      <p>
       isolation from reality.   isolation from real relationships..  isolation with your TV - watching people interact passively.   isolation in your condo, from your family, in your cubicle... isolation in your car.  isolation in your thoughts.. does anyone else have the same thoughts as me?  isolation in your facebook profile..   be thankful.

       My advice is to talk to people, then you wont be so isolated. you just have to carefully gauge how you talk to people, and the way you talk to them, as not to offend them and turn them off.

       As George Carlin said , imagine how dumb the average person is.

       Being empathic towards your fellow man does not equate to equal respect for ideas or intellect.
       <br/>
       Most people, by definition, will always be behind the curve.

      <p>
       But, however self-aware or intelligent we are is largely irrelevant.
       <br/>
       Be thankful that you're not as blind as most, but be aware that the journey will never finish.
       <br/>
       Just keep following your instincts and try to trust your intuition.

       I feel like I can somewhat relate to how you feel. When I left my parents house years ago,  I was plugged in. I ditched the tv at some point, and slowly found my way here through things like Joe Rogan. I never expected my family to care about many of the things I've learned about. But in a recent visit home, I got chatting with my family about GMO's. I think its about trying to connect with people about what their interests are and what they know about the injustices of our world. Then try to expand their knowledge a little bit. It would be overwhelming to have everything you think you know about the world torn away from you. Having it pulled back, one thing at a time would be much easier, and I think people are generally very accepting of learning that way.

       I feel this happening to me too. I point out the flaws in our society and people pin me as the dumb one or the shallow one. I point out men are under served and I am told I have no issue’s or I am being silly, even my own mother dismisses these issues. We are taught in school to show evidence; well maybe they should teach how to accept evidence as well. I try explain the problems of the two party system only to be met with “Ya well, what ya gonna do?” How about standing up for ourselves? Starting a petition? Or I’m called unpatriotic for pointing out we’re only in the Middle East for resources. –and how dare I not support the soldiers. WTF? I feel just as bad for them for being lied to as I do the innocent people they are bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep hearing the phrase “unplugging from the matrix.” I know it isn’t giving up but I am not sure I can unplug without giving up. I feel like I am damned in one form if I do and damned in another if I don’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when I find someone who understands a few things they haven’t gone as far as I have and this is also frustrating. It’s said know the truth and it shall set you free… well in truth it’s just making me crazy.

       Good stuff but it's not like I give lectures. One sentence of something basic and most people write me off. It just comes down to people not wanting to know or caring that the world has changed. I learned years ago to take my time but if someone doesn't wanna listen then I have done all I can do. It's just too many people don't wanna listen.

       It gets easier after awhile. I am isolated: I share a subset of my views offline, but not the entirety of them. Most people don't want to understand reality beyond what's required to get by.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice is express yourself/learn/sharpen your debate through online community, figure out how to make money in the "real world" without selling your soul, and try to spend some time outdoors camping and hiking.

       It's a cliche, but most people really are cattle. The 2007 financial collapse showed how vulnerable people are. Try to be invisible to the system and insulated from it. Resist being depressed about the state of the world and look at how you can better your own circumstances so you have the resources needed to survive.

       You'd be amazed how many sympathetic souls there are. I ran into a guy working on a major TV show who found out I'm into this sort of thing and he began asking barrages of questions. This is a professional man with a career and a teenage son.

       This subject and line of inquiry does two major things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) it filters out bad friends right quick.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) it forces you to be a better human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article two usually happens after a couple years of having a bad time (I acted out at this time - I defaced banks; trust me, when I say that this is not something to be proud of). Now I'm able to discuss this level-headed. When people ask me about things I can tailor my ideas so that they don't appear hostile toward others. I can have extraordinarily normal conversations with Democrats and Republicans; they usually remain ideologues, but they now know that there may be kinks in the machine. Baby steps. Rome Wasn't built in a day. Patience is a virtue. And whatever other phrases you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patience, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patience with yourself and with others.

       The whole bit about people interacting through TV - symbolic interactionism is worth looking in to, also I can strongly recommend simulacra and simulation by Baudrillard. It will be enlightening for you.

       The bit about self improvement being a dirty word, that's called ressentiment. It's the bedrock of our society. Scheler's eponymous writing on it should be worth while, but Nietzsche's the genealogy of morals is definitely

       Oh, also don't be afraid to fall in with some far lefties - especially the anarchists - the more academic of them will probably have an innate distrust of the three-ring political circus, mass media and the rest. There will be some out there who might do more than entertain the conversations, they might even share some of your views.

       I didn't get much respect when I lived in Nicaragua or China but for some reason after a year and a half of living in Ukraine my family seemed to think that what I was doing was pretty cool.  Also years ago I was working on them pretty seriously and I met only resistance and hostility.  Now I rarely get into any of it with them things are more fucked up down the line so its obvoius that I was onto something.  My family can see that I am doing interesting things with my life and I will easily let them know that I think that the current leadership is just complete garbage.  They seem to respect my position more when I simply state that the elites are complete garbage and don't represent me and that that I don't pay taxes and that I don't try to receive benefits.  I'm not invested in the myth.  By travelling I have gained some sort of status where otherwise I would be more just a garden variety under achiever and drifter and so they can't easily ridicule me anymore.  I've grown beyond their little tv shows and when they try to tell me about an issue that they assume I must not know about like Sandy Hook I school them on facts and ideas that they didn't know about.  So I've nullified the petty facts and I rise above it by simply being more knowledgeable and cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in short I don't have to say "I don't watch tv" and to face the wrath.  I can say that I was in Ukraine fucking some hot white chicks.  I don't have to say it and its not more than I would at home even, but the perception is there.  By doing interesting things even if the idea of it is misunderstood will gain you points.  They wouldn't even try to pretend like their little bullshit show was more relevant than you living an interesting life filled with whatever wild fantasies that they project onto it.  They would make it hell for you if you ever left home but after a few years they would respect you more even if they couldn't deal with you personally.  Then you would be very unconcerned with those of them who can't rise to the occassion.

       I'm with you my friend. It's difficult to connect with people who seem oblivious. Instead of shutting off I have attempted to open the awareness of friends and family, but it only forced me more to the outside in their eyes. People are asleep and they don't want to wake up, and Im rather sick of trying to bring them out of a false reality they seem happy to support.

       Luckily I have friends who are on the same page with me on this shit. Otherwise I woudn't know what I would do You might benefit from moving to a place like Portland, OR. There are so many more "awakened" people than your average city.

       Ah, tried that one at 15..and many after it. I find antidepressants impossible to stay on, the numb feeling made me feel like I was internally exploding. All of those emotions were still there but I couldn't work through them. Hard to put into words, but I can see why some people lose it on antidepressants.

       Been there. The key is not giving a fuck what others think. Extremely difficult, but the most honest way forward. Ask yourself: why are you afraid to speak your mind? Because, I wonder if that's what your isolation is about. I spoke up about 9/11 being an inside job 8-9 years ago, when it was verboten. Not so any more. I spoke up about Israel/Palestine and lost work because of it. Once you experience some of the nasty shit I have for going "off the reservation", you just stop caring about the reaction. Grow some balls and speak your fucking truth.
