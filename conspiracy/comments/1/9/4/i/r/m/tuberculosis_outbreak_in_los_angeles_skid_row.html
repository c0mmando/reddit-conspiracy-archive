        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">76</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-02-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ProfitsOfProphets.html">ProfitsOfProphets</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The CDC has announced that there is an outbreak of tuberculosis in Los Angeles. The test used to detect TB in humans is called <strong>LAM-ELISA</strong>. 
<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/cdc-to-investigate-escalating-los-angeles-tuberculosis-outbreak">http://www.examiner.com/article/cdc-to-investigate-escalating-los-angeles-tuberculosis-outbreak</a></p>

<p>Weeks before this outbreak was announced, a Canadian tourist named <strong>Elisa Lam</strong> went missing in Los Angeles. Her decomposing body has since been discovered in a Los Angeles hotel&#39;s rooftop water container after hotel guests complained about foul-smelling, foul-tasting, and darkened water. </p>

<p>The Cecil Hotel, where Elisa Lam&#39;s body was found, is located adjacent to Los Angeles&#39; skid row, the same area where the TB breakout is believed to have originated. </p>

<p>What&#39;s more is the following video shows Elisa Lam acting suspiciously in an elevator prior to her disappearance and death. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4LmWiDiC0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4LmWiDiC0</a> </p>

<p>And, as of this moment, the coroner has not yet been able to determine the cause of Elisa Lam&#39;s death, nor has the CDC been able to pinpoint the origin of the TB scare. </p>

<p>EDIT: Elisa Lam went missing weeks before the outbreak, not days. She was last seen on 2013/1/31.</p>

I do agree that they are too close to just be coincidental and I really hope whatever is going on will come into the light soon.

    <div class="md"><p>From what I saw, it seemed like she was on some kind of drugs, but I could be wrong. Only because I have experimented many times with hallucinogens, but then again, there very well may have been someone there that knew there were cameras on the elevator which may have been why they didn&#39;t show themselves. The video doesn&#39;t make sense though. The elevator door doesn&#39;t shut, she was looking out like she was seeing if someone was messing with it, but why did she press all of the buttons for the different floors? Uggh it&#39;s just so strange. I would say that a staff member at the hotel could have something to do with it because of how she got access to the roof, but the alarm may have had something wrong with it which would be why it didn&#39;t go off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mentioned in another post about this that I feel like the maintainence man that found her maybe the one that knows something. Looks like he knew to stay just out of camera range then limited access to the roof. But even that aside, those tanks are 10 feet high and hold 1000 gallons of water. The cover looks to have a small hatch type opening where I would think would be difficult if not impossible to see all the way to the bottom to find her body. It would be too dark with just that small hatch for an opening to look through. I am sure that authorities have spoken to him but don&#39;t know if he&#39;s been cleared. </p>

Not to mention if she herself didn&#39;t wedge her body in there in some kind of... drug fueled delusion, then who was both stealthy and bulky enough to haul her body through the alarmed security doors and 10 feet up to the water tower to cram her in there?</p>

<p>And that&#39;s ignoring that the test for the outbreak of the disease that resulted is her name flipped. I mean, all that&#39;s left is to blame this on Chris Dorner...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the police have to have that video and if they don&#39;t then the operator is under serious investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, I want to believe this--but something about this &quot;investigation&quot; has become eerily <em>quiet</em>. Since the initial autopsy was inconclusive, I have heard NOTHING about potential suspects or causes of death...we should have heard about further testing by now. Furthermore, you would think it would take less than a month to hear news about the results of investigating the operator. </p>

<p>Again--I simply cannot get over the fact that all hotels have floor cameras that would show exactly what she did before and after this elevator footage...yet this obvious fact is ommitted from all counts that I have looked into. The ommission of this footage paired with this ridiculous lag on any further conclusions makes me entirely suspicious of this case. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>how&#39;d she get to that state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another one of those &quot;You believe this?&quot; things, but...
Elisa had apparently been blogging in regards to cloaking technology--to make soldiers appear nearly invisible (this is not a ridiculous topic, its a reality that is now undergoing research and being produced with varying degrees of success). </p>

<p>Now, I would think it to be absolutely ludicrous that she was dealing with an invisible harassment...</p>

<p>And even with this tidbit of info, I still do of course but...just saying, its fun to consider, and at least I am honest about that. But also, the following information makes no fucking sense:</p>

<p>Google Maps shows a company named &quot;Invisible Light Agency&quot; located within the hotel. It appears to be there for the sake of GPSing directions, as it is virtually impossible to research anything in regards to the company aside from the location. </p>

<p>Am I being ridiculous, or is it a bit odd that this company with nothing on their site but a logo, with a history of visual effects, has come up listed within a hotel building where a girl was recently murdered following posts about this technology? There are reports claiming that she had been seeing someone from the military...just a bit unnerving and odd, probably no connection though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a concept as to what happened to this poor girl.</p>

<p>Because of her lack of glasses, she couldn&#39;t remember which floor was hers, so she went to the 14th floor, because she remembered it was a middle button, perhaps confusing the floors &quot;4&quot; with &quot;14&quot;. She tried to enter what she thought was her room, and this alerted the occupant of that room.</p>

<p>She comes back to the elevator but the original one she took is now somewhere else (that&#39;s a different tape), and she enters the 2nd elevator.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TjVBpyTeZM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TjVBpyTeZM</a></p>

<p>Start the video.</p>

<p>0:07, she&#39;s trying to read the numbers, but can&#39;t, so she just hits all the buttons in the middle row, and then hits the &quot;HOLD DOOR&quot; button, thinking it reads, &quot;CLOSE DOOR&quot;.</p>

<p>00:20, the occupant has left the apartment, is holding the elevator button in the hall, and is outside the vision of the camera. He says calmly, &quot;hey, get out of the elevator.&quot;</p>

<p>00:24, she checks the hallway, and sees the man standing by the button. She positions herself to view the the man, and is waiting for the elevator doors to shut. The occupant holds the button to the elevator, and calmly asks who she is.</p>

<p>00:37, She approaches the man and attempts to apologize.</p>

<p>00:48, the occupant tells her to get out of the elevator. She shyly and slowly begins to, but sees danger.</p>

<p>00:53, the occupant pulls out a gun, and this causes her to jump. The occupant is now telling her to come closer to him. She doesn&#39;t understand there&#39;s a camera in the elevator, while the occupant is fully aware of this.</p>

<p>1:03, the occupant grabs her at gunpoint, and tells her to get out of here or he&#39;ll kill her, he probably mugs her, and he releases her.</p>

<p>1:30, she enters the elevator and is terrified. In a panic, she hits all the buttons, but she keeps hitting the &quot;HOLD DOOR&quot; button. The man is telling her to leave, and she doesn&#39;t understand why she can&#39;t.</p>

<p>1:50, the occupant hits the button again and orders her to come back. She&#39;s in tears and is trying to say she&#39;s confused.</p>

<p>1:57, the occupant places his gun on the back of her head, and she&#39;s pulling away, giving the strange look about her arms.</p>

<p>2:05, the occupant grabs her neck, and gives her a yank and tells her to shut up, and she completely submits.</p>

<p>2:12, she begins begging for her life.</p>

<p>2:20, the occupant tells orders her to be quiet.</p>

<p>2:25, the occupant leads her away from the camera by her neck, and a gun to her head.</p>

<p>2:45 (aporox) the occupant lets go of the elevator button.</p>

<p>2:58, the elevator shuts, and begins going to the floors pressed.</p>

<p>It is my belief she was accosted by an occupant of the 14th floor, probably someone in a room with a fire escape access to the roof. My belief she&#39;s on the 14th floor is because of this picture...</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/we6I2JX.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/we6I2JX.jpg</a></p>

<p>...this is a picture of the buttons in the elevator in that video. According to this, she kept hitting all the buttons in the middle row, in this order from top down, 14, 10, 7, 4, M, B, and &quot;HOLD DOOR&quot;. She was staying on the 4th floor, and I believe made a simple error, due to not wearing her glasses, where she picked &quot;14&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice in the video that the top button in the middle row does not light when she presses it. That is because, as you see in the photo, it&#39;s the 14th floor, and she&#39;s already there.</p>

<p>What happens then till she ended up in the tank is anyone&#39;s guess, but I believe her time was very quick. Check out this news report from Stephan Chase for KTLA News, specifically the testimony of Bernard Diaz starting about 1:30 in. He talks about an &quot;explosion&quot; that &quot;knocked him out of bed&quot;.</p>

<p>ktla.com/2013/02/19/womans­-body-found-in-cecil-hotel-wat­er-tank-2/#axzz2LpWbGbvH</p>

<p>I believe this proves my concept that the killer forced her to climb into the tank, because he then followed, stuck his﻿ gun in the tank, and then shot her. Why else would he do this, unless she was alive going in?</p>

<p>And it gets worse, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, yes. The horror doesn&#39;t stop there. This girl had a rare form of tuberculosis from China and has been infecting almost every single person with it. Don&#39;t take my word for it, take the LA Times...</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/22/local/la-me-tb-outbreak-20130222">http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/22/local/la-me-tb-outbreak-20130222</a></p>

<p>...no one knows what the hell this thing is! Oh, we know it&#39;s TB, but nothing like this was ever known before. &quot;Unique!&quot; They call it &quot;unique&quot;. So far, it&#39;s estimated over 4,500 people are infected, 11 deaths.</p>

<p>This guy&#39;s murdered 12 innocent people so far.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to her and to all that know her.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been around the Cecil Hotel, please get tested for TB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I caught that after I posted it.  Bad site on my part.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have anything to back up where exactly she contracted it, or anything to back up that she actually does have anything, it&#39;s simply the most logical explanation.  Her parents immigrated from China to Canada, and she was visiting America.  If there is a strain of TB going about that area that we&#39;ve never seen before, which there is, and being that this fits in the timeline (this strain has been showing up for about a month now).</p>

<p>It makes sense to me that there are strains of TB in China that we&#39;re completely unaware of.</p>

<p>I&#39;m using the razor, I know, but when you&#39;ve got a strange TB outbreak that&#39;s all obviously coming from Skid Row and you find a body of a girl from China in a watertank on the roof of a hotel in that area...to me it seems pretty obvious what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve been keeping up with the case, but they finally released the toxicology report, and it came back clean (no drugs found), so now the LA detectives are saying that it&#39;s an accidental drowning that had something to do with her being bi-polar.</p>

<p>Basically, they put all their eggs in the &quot;she must be on drugs&quot; basket, and when that fell through they are now saying she&#39;s crazy.</p>

<p>They completely dropped the ball on this.  If fact, they dropped it so many times, now they&#39;re trying to deny there was ever a ball to begin with.</p>

<p>To be honest, I really don&#39;t believe she had TB.  I was just using that as a tactic to get people to talk about her, because I feared people would assume she&#39;s crazy and forget this poor girl ever existed.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, I made a small video to help illustrate what I believe may have occurred.  Please turn annotations on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to post a firm request that people stop trying to imply that this girl, without access via keys to the top floor or the water towers, or any means of disarming an alarm that would have been recorded for evidence...somehow committed suicide by way of drowning herself in the tower...most importantly because they have concluded that she was dead prior to entering the water. Its important to rule out suicide if we are going to keep this story from simply blowing over the way im sure LAPD wants it to. How about trying to find a hotel in existence that doesnt have clear footage of every single floor and room entrance...someone is excusing this lack of footage or taking WAAAY too long to conclude from the confidential evidence.

    <div class="md"><p>Them being the autopsy team, who apparently had made a statement regarding water entering or not entering the body. I grant that my source and hence conclusion are both shaky, I actually heard it from a news article (which of course I would have provided had I any recollection of where I was in my long string of articles when I read it)--but I sure think that if this were a suicide, then one of several floor cameras would have been released providing obvious evidence of that case. There is definitely a reason that they have not released or announced consideration of cameras that undoubtedly provided further explanation--if it were a suicide, there would not be so much still needing explanation, because there would be nothing covered up and no factions waiting for investigation or interest to more or less blow over--which is what is happening right now. Call the first test inconclusive and allow the curiousities to die off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we are going to allow that there was more to the story--why is it so hard to take the extra step and speculate that the victim name was chosen to mimick the test instead of the test mimicking the victim? There is no evidence against the possibility that Lam was lured and invited on her tourist vacation--her family and friends are unsure of exactly the purpose of it. If there is a symbolic motive, does which comes first seriously discredit possibility of occult symbolism driving the case? I admit that I don&#39;t feel much is off aside from LAPD/Hotel coverup and that the test may in fact be a coincedence, but I guess I just think its funny what people will consider conclusive. Even if the supposedly elitist occultic faction behind this made it clear as day (which they wouldn&#39;t), people would still be calling out those who connected the dots as paranoid schizophrenics--so does it even matter? Sry to sound cynical and pessimistic but I would venture a guess that more than half the people in this country would not accept conclusive evidence until it were declared conclusive by a fucking television. </p>
