       Personally, I find this really upsetting that people are buying this and now see Bill Gates as evil.  In my eyes, he is doing the greatest thing by trying so so hard to eradicate fatal diseases around the world and he has obviously revolutionised the world with his input to computing.
But I want to know your views, and perhaps why.

       Not a fan of Alex Jones and don't have an extra 20 min to watch a video. But, I have seen the
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaF-fq2Zn7I">
        TED Talk with Bill Gates on global warming
       </a>
       , in which he says something very odd between the 4/5 minute mark. In the talk, he says that there are four factors that affect the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and that the only way to bring this number to zero is to bring one of the factors down to zero. He then proceeds to say that of the four factors, which science can or cannot work on, we should lower population growth (since according to him, we're a huge cause of CO2 production in the atmosphere). He then says that the way to lower population growth is to redistribute vaccines (I rewinded several times to make sure I heard that correctly...) I also find interesting that he is the money-guy for Monsanto, which defends GMO's because they claim their food is a solution to overpopulation; Monsanto is an entire conspiracy on it's own.

       At first when you hear them say they need to reduce hunger, disease and poverty, you think "Great. Someone with vast resources and free time is doing what I don't have the time to do."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you realize that the plan is not to create wealth for the poor, just to reduce their population, thereby "reducing" hunger, disease and poverty. Sure, some disease may be prevented by the vaccines...at the cost of sterility. The vaccines they have been sending over to Africa and elsewhere have a long history of being contaminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the modern-day version of the English sending the Native Americans smallpox infested blankets to speed up the genocide. Bill Gates father was head of Planned Parenthood, which began as a racist eugenics program to literally get rid of brown people. They don't want to help, they just want their land.

       But these governments, they don't mind the procrastination.

       The population is reduced DUE to vaccination and due to treatment and edadication of disease.  People in these third world countries are having 6 or 7 kids because it is unlikely any of them will reach adulthood because of these diseases.  With vaccines, people do not need to have so many children because if they have one child they are not hugely more likely to survive to adulthood - therefore the population growth rate is reduced.

       Look, like it or not, depopulation for countries such as India, China, or Africa in the end SAVES LIVES. Their populations are simply too great to support in any sustainable fashion.  So you know, maybe it is depopulation, but I think in the end game you're going to have a lot healthier lot of people leading much more productive lives for all of humanity..... than if you let them continue to reproduce themselves into their own squalor...  I'm just saying there is a plausible, rational argument for a depopulation effort.....  it might sound evil, it might sound cold and demonic.... but if you're looking on scales of hundreds of years... its really the only good option....   mind you I have no research or evidence to suggest this is in fact true.... this is just the mindless ramblings of a conspiracy nut.

       It is shown that in poor countries, people have
       <strong>
        MORE
       </strong>
       children because if they do not then they will be forced to die alone with no one to take care of them, and since they do not know if their kid will die in the first six years (i believe 6 years it could be less) then they have more kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other advantage, is helping with the land and the kids can get food and medicine for their parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       In places like America, it is not needed for people to have 10 kids because we know we will have food when we wake up and medicine when we grow old.

       Enlighten me. Please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: In my view, our immune systems have evolved to fight off almost every disease. That is why we are here now. If our ancestors had died too young, then we would not have been born. Those who did die, didn't have the defenses for the illness. Evolution took them out of the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be diseases that kill many of us, but those who remain, will pass on the resistance to their children and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what I ment by evolution taking care of diseases.

       That is not necessarily bad. We are not above everything else on Earth. there is no reason that Man should survive instead of any other lifeform on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We either do, or we do not. Life WILL go on, and there is nothing we can do about it. For me that means, that there can be some illness that wipes us out. Like we came after the dinosaurs, there will be someone or something after us, that will dominate Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, I believe vaccination is doing more harm than good. In the long run, those that would not survive until they were able to have children, will survive because of vaccination. Maybe life only works right if they don't survive.

       Does that mean you are against helping those with disease?  I think we live in a day and age where 'survival of the fittest' is definitely not valid, at least in the developed world, because we have the power to treat and even prevent disease.

       Not helping those with a disease would be cruel. Not wrong, but cruel. I believe I am not cruel, so I think the ill should be helped, BUT illness should be prevented. We must not wait until someone becomes ill, then treat it. Most chronic illnesses are diet based. Serious genetic flaws don't get passed on, because the child dies before reaching adult age.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is a mistake to think that we can treat illness. It is true in the literal sense of the word, but it usually means that you take medication for the rest of your life. That is not very effective medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am positive, that the current views on diet will change soon and that will bring great improvement to human health. Vaccination is a dangerous game. It alters things we do not fully understand. That is foolishness.

       Because it's a buttload (literally) of harsh compounds of dubious effectiveness and consequence during the primary developmental phase of your infant's immune system. That's a
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       . The
       <em>
        opinion
       </em>
       is whether or not this is 'tolerable' by the infant, and whether or not the 'perceived social benefits' are indeed worth the 'risk.'
      </p>
      <p>
       People should be skeptical of a man who is also one of the larger stock-holding investors of Monsanto corporation, which infiltrates governments globally with revolving door tactics, sues farmers, structures their criminal policies to do damage in a tailored fashion (see destruction of Indian Land Owning Farmer over BT Cotton Pricing and Terminator Seeds), hires ex military/law enforcement to harass farmers and patrol private farmland looking for Intellectual Property Theft, fights GMO labeling movements with millions of dollars, who lobbies presidents for litigation protections, whose products have not been tested long enough to know what will happen between them and indigenous species, and did I mention attempts to place their officials in all positions that might have regulatory influence on the company? Yes, I did, when I mentioned infiltrates governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to have a conversation about the scientific legitimacy of monsanto's own company claims about its own products. You can, and should, have one about its actual historical actions, as described above, and their ethical imperative of "feeding the world's starving," through corruption, deceit, manipulation, financial clout, lobbying, and obfuscation and suppression of any criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you should have one, too, about any public official or personality who chooses to invest millions of dollars with such an organization, no matter how noble and reasonable his reasons for it sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I mention that Gates also uses his money to develop ways to surveil and track opponents and critics of his vaccine plan? Surely he is truly just a simple philanthropist, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I'm also not going to comment further, as it is quite obviously saturday shill bait in here. But good luck defending an elitist simply because his work and goals sound reasonable, and fit the mainstream global-steering-group-fed concept of the world's ills. This is the way the Reasonable People of the Progressive Left of Mainstream have and will continue to be seduced by global steering group liars chanting "facts do matter" derisively at any critics, and how they are then encouraged to view such critics as departing from real reality--the same real reality that features unethical, corrupt infiltration of regulatory bodies and corrupt uses of financial lobbying clout by corporations that tell you they are doing it to help the world become a better place.

       It sickens me how blindly parents line up their children up for vaccinations without even doing 10 minutes of research.  They don't even have to go as deep as Eli Lily Rider, vaccine courts, or Homeland Security. Just a simple, "Hmmmnn, should timersol, titanium dioxide or Polysorb 80 be injected into my newborn baby's body?" would suffice.

       It's idiotic to not try to help other people. If you're so convinced you're right and you want everyone to know about it, give them a
       <em>
        starting point
       </em>
       for their own research. Obviously you don't need to tell them everything, but saying "Isn't it so great that I know everything? Look at the stupid sheeple, hahaha. What? Present evidence and argue my position on the same ground that my opponents are on? Nah, we can never do that." is a pathetic way of thinking.

       So often on this subreddit I see people, yourself included, respond to well thought out and research arguments respond with a two-line comment of nothing but name-dropping and referencing vague and irrelevant concepts with not so much as a single link. If you're so concerned with the "poisoned water", the "killer clouds", "corrupt banks", the "evil government plan to strip us of our rights and kill us all", or the "Illuminati Zionist Lizard People Who Totally Did 9/11 And Are Going To Turn Us Into Mindless Automatons To Do Their Bidding (IZLPWTD911AAGTTUIMATDTB™)", then

       Alright Alex, nobody wants to kill 90% of the fucking population. There would be no work force for the remaining elite to use to eat and build their houses and boats.

       If I was the richest man on Earth (I know Bill is only the second richest, but that doesn't matter right now), I would probably influence Politics, Education, Health care, etc. I think, that providing a western quality of living to all 7 billion people on Earth is unrealistic, so population reduction is a goal, that helps the wealthy people of the world (most of Europe, US, Japan), keep their standard of living high.

       Manual labor will be done by robots soon. Energy can come from low maintenance solar, hydro, wind, fusion (in 50 years or so) sources. Those who still live, will live comfortably. The rest, either in deep poverty (which would mean the rich would be feeling bad about it), or dead (that means the rich can live without thinking about poor people).

       This is pretty much the propaganda story they put out to make it seem acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Elite are a long time in control and have most things under control to prevent Humanity to rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Fiat Money by the banksters.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Alternative Energy is surpressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Health is controlled by big Pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Hemp is illegal
      </p>
      <p>
       -Control over Goverment.
      </p>
      <p>
       and other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Elite are seeing you also as usless feeder not more worth than the people in africa starving.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not in the club and the plan is massive depopulation in the end.

       let the record show that bill gates owns 500,000 shares of MONSANTO. i really once believed he was a good guy but i think every super billionaire regardless of how much you'd like to believe they are helping with charity and all are still fucking us up the ass. pretty sure everyone and their mother know how fucked up and crazy Monsanto is. and this rich mother fucker owns a big ass chunk. it's kinda funny isnt it?

       The population is reduced DUE to vaccination and due to treatment and edadication of disease.  People in these third world countries are having 6 or 7 kids because it is unlikely any of them will reach adulthood because of these diseases.  With vaccines, people do not need to have so many children because if they have one child they are not hugely more likely to survive to adulthood - therefore the population growth rate is reduced.
