        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Its just fishy to me, that one man has played such a large role in weaving the current conspiracy theorist narrative. So many stories I read always link back to infowars or Alex Jones. I&#39;m starting to think the whole Infowars platform is a conspiracy in and of itself. Also doesn&#39;t help my opinion much when they make so money money on ads and selling &quot;survival equipment&quot;. Just seems like from a business perspective that fear mongering will bring in the dough which makes me lose any feeling of objectivity. Also Alex is so eccentric that the fact that so much of the narrative that is controlled by him becomes harder for people to buy, so even if there is truth to the conspiracy theories he is the sort of person to make people not look into it further and just write it off as lunatic bullshit. Does anyone have any more info on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will pick up the argument that he makes money by selling products and advertises products. Let&#39;s see. Somehow he has to make money. So would you prefer him running ads from companies that are connected directly with the military industrial complex, oil exploitation, big pharma, and products based on consumerism, surperficial enhancement and distractions like celebrities, tv shows and sports? Or would you rather like to see advertising from products like water filters, alternative medicine, self defence, healthy food, precious medals and informative books? If he is honest about fluoridation then he would not sell you any colgate and he would avoid to advertise connected products or companies who are connected. That are a lot of advertisers already that would never advertise on his show or on his site. What you see is in my opinion the alternative to the mainstream advertising.</p>

<p>But in reality, all Jones does is to spout off wild and crazy even stupid ideas and when anything even remotely seems connected by the most twisted and flawed logic..he the rants about how right he was. Or when one of his &quot; predictions&quot; doesn&#39;t come true he claims that it was because of him and his revelation of the truth that it didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a snake oil salesman and doesn&#39;t deserve any credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never read Info Wars until the other day looking for some info. Still I looked beyond what I found on the site.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he is the sort of person to make people not look into it further</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not his fault. If people don&#39;t look into anything further they can only blame themselves.</p>

<p>I consider AJ a conspiracy guy but I have never looked at him as an authority. In his defense he got into the game early, especially Youtube which really gave Endgame a boost considering all the films he had previously made. A majority of conspiracy theories have been going on for thousands and thousands of years and people have known and had proof. AJ and a lot of modern so called conspiracy gurus, unless they have specialized knowledge really are at the tail end of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But do they source material which is typically overlooked information.  If it wasn&#39;t for infowars, I wouldn&#39;t be aware that in <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WcYgAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=mmoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=2660,5001170&amp;amp;dq=nyse+cheif+meets+top+colombia+rebel+leader&amp;amp;hl=en">1999 the NYSE Cheif met with the FARC leaders in Columbia</a> to try and get them to invest.  The FARC is considered a narco terrorist group known for kidnapping &amp; ransoms, yet capitalism trumps foreign policy.  </p>

<p>Look, the bottom line is, I don&#39;t like Alex Jones and listened to him for a long time.  He is a shill to make everyone who questions the status quo look like an out of control nut job who spits out random facts (whether they are correct or not) and tries to tie them together to further his agenda.  The fact that he has an agenda needs to be kept in the forefront while reading anything from his websites.  With that said, they use a lot of good content that most websites don&#39;t point out, but they also are full of their own propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found these interesting facts about Alex Jones.</p>

<p>He has a﻿ Jewish wife named Kelly Rebeca Nichols, and he has three(3) children with her. His son&#39;s name is Einstein (ya think it&#39;s jewish?? LOL)
He and his Jewish wife and children all qualify for Israeli citizenship under Israel&#39;s &quot;Law of Return&quot;.</p>

<p>He has at least twenty(20) Jewish sponsors and advertizers that financially support his radio show and websites.</p>

<p>He has a Jewish lawyer named Elizabeth M. Schurig who is also the lawyer for Holly Lev Bronfman, the sister of Edgar Bronfman, Jr. Thus there are only two degrees of separation between Alex Jones and the Bronfman family, one of the most powerful Jewish Zionist families in the world.</p>

<p>His flagship radio station, KLBJ AM, in Austin, Texas, is owned by Emmis Communications, a media conglomerate based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The founder, president, CEO, and chairman of Emmis Communications is the dual Israeli citizen Zionist Jew Jeffrey H. Smulyan.﻿</p>

<p>His radio show is broadcast on Sirius XM Radio. The chairman of Sirius XM Radio is the Jew Eddy W. Hartenstein. The CEO of Sirius XM Radio is the Jew Mel Karmazin. The President of Sirius XM Radio is the Jew Scott Greenstein. Of the six(6) executive officers of Sirius XM﻿ Radio, five(5) are Jews.</p>
