       Its just fishy to me, that one man has played such a large role in weaving the current conspiracy theorist narrative. So many stories I read always link back to infowars or Alex Jones. I'm starting to think the whole Infowars platform is a conspiracy in and of itself. Also doesn't help my opinion much when they make so money money on ads and selling "survival equipment". Just seems like from a business perspective that fear mongering will bring in the dough which makes me lose any feeling of objectivity. Also Alex is so eccentric that the fact that so much of the narrative that is controlled by him becomes harder for people to buy, so even if there is truth to the conspiracy theories he is the sort of person to make people not look into it further and just write it off as lunatic bullshit. Does anyone have any more info on this?

       I made a comment about this fairly recently. Even if he has the best intentions, and it isn't some sort of conspiracy, he

       conspiracy. That's his product. If there isn't one, he'll find one.

       I will pick up the argument that he makes money by selling products and advertises products. Let's see. Somehow he has to make money. So would you prefer him running ads from companies that are connected directly with the military industrial complex, oil exploitation, big pharma, and products based on consumerism, surperficial enhancement and distractions like celebrities, tv shows and sports? Or would you rather like to see advertising from products like water filters, alternative medicine, self defence, healthy food, precious medals and informative books? If he is honest about fluoridation then he would not sell you any colgate and he would avoid to advertise connected products or companies who are connected. That are a lot of advertisers already that would never advertise on his show or on his site. What you see is in my opinion the alternative to the mainstream advertising.

       It's easy to have a monopoly on it when you make shit up AND have thousands of people who are so desperate for meaning or a sense that they are " smarter than the rest of us", that they are willing to believe in anything with even the smallest grain of truth to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in reality, all Jones does is to spout off wild and crazy even stupid ideas and when anything even remotely seems connected by the most twisted and flawed logic..he the rants about how right he was. Or when one of his " predictions" doesn't come true he claims that it was because of him and his revelation of the truth that it didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a snake oil salesman and doesn't deserve any credibility.

       No one is forcing you to buy it, but you'd rather pay 50% taxes and have it go to few select corporations, than you choosing where you spend your money.

       I've never read Info Wars until the other day looking for some info. Still I looked beyond what I found on the site.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       That is not his fault. If people don't look into anything further they can only blame themselves.

       I consider AJ a conspiracy guy but I have never looked at him as an authority. In his defense he got into the game early, especially Youtube which really gave Endgame a boost considering all the films he had previously made. A majority of conspiracy theories have been going on for thousands and thousands of years and people have known and had proof. AJ and a lot of modern so called conspiracy gurus, unless they have specialized knowledge really are at the tail end of things.

       it's actually a great site if you know how to use it. They cover topic and expose otherwise overlooked articles. As long as you don't read their propaganda to justify their theory and only look at the MSM sources they use to push their point of view, you're fine.  Keep an open mind, read their articles with a grain of salt, and look at what they are referencing, it's a great sight for unusual information.

       Look, the bottom line is, I don't like Alex Jones and listened to him for a long time.  He is a shill to make everyone who questions the status quo look like an out of control nut job who spits out random facts (whether they are correct or not) and tries to tie them together to further his agenda.  The fact that he has an agenda needs to be kept in the forefront while reading anything from his websites.  With that said, they use a lot of good content that most websites don't point out, but they also are full of their own propaganda.

       Your just jealous.  He built a network of insiders feeding him stories the others don't get first. Kinda like ZeroHedge.

       Its funny when you people rant about the ads and the water filters. Guess what kids? Hes on over 100 stations. Hes doing 3 hours a day on over 100 stations. I suspect the schwag he sells is a drop in the bucket compared to the fees hes getting from being on OVER ONE HUNDRED AM AND FM RADIO STATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY......

       Alex Jones has build his media platform from ground up since almost 20 years now and has broke the biggest stories like bilderberg and bohemian grove.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "alternative" media has only really exploded since 9/11 happend so that is the reason why probably Infowars is the largest "alternative" media platform.

       You must work for Alex. Is he an OK guy to work for? He seems like a tyrant to me, but maybe he's not so bad in person.

       Yes, we make also vacation with the rothschilds every year on their yacht to plan their new PSYOP and are paid with jewish gold.

       No seriously, there is so much bullshit rumors going on every conspiracy person its incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no solid evidence mostly and the disinformation is most times the "disinformation" itself.

       Classic divide &amp; Conqour.

       This doesen't mean there aren't disinformation agents like glenn beck and others.

       Follow the Money, a real person for the cause will not accept a show on FOX news like Glenn Beck .

       I get annoyed by the whole "calling people a shill" thing, but after reading the comments here I might start to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones is a loudmouth.  He is also a spaz that yells too much and talks to loud.  He also regurgitates theories and maybe takes credit for shit he shouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you read between the lines and really examine him, he's the least of our worries.

       I found these interesting facts about Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a﻿ Jewish wife named Kelly Rebeca Nichols, and he has three(3) children with her. His son's name is Einstein (ya think it's jewish?? LOL)
He and his Jewish wife and children all qualify for Israeli citizenship under Israel's "Law of Return".
      </p>
      <p>
       He has at least twenty(20) Jewish sponsors and advertizers that financially support his radio show and websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a Jewish lawyer named Elizabeth M. Schurig who is also the lawyer for Holly Lev Bronfman, the sister of Edgar Bronfman, Jr. Thus there are only two degrees of separation between Alex Jones and the Bronfman family, one of the most powerful Jewish Zionist families in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       His flagship radio station, KLBJ AM, in Austin, Texas, is owned by Emmis Communications, a media conglomerate based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The founder, president, CEO, and chairman of Emmis Communications is the dual Israeli citizen Zionist Jew Jeffrey H. Smulyan.﻿
      </p>
      <p>
       His radio show is broadcast on Sirius XM Radio. The chairman of Sirius XM Radio is the Jew Eddy W. Hartenstein. The CEO of Sirius XM Radio is the Jew Mel Karmazin. The President of Sirius XM Radio is the Jew Scott Greenstein. Of the six(6) executive officers of Sirius XM﻿ Radio, five(5) are Jews.
