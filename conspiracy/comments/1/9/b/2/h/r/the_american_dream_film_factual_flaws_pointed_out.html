<p>I contacted the creators with the following email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Tad Lumpkin and Harold Uhl,</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if either of you use the site reddit.com, but I found a post &gt;pointing out the supposed factual flaws in your documentary. If you submitted a self-post on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy</a> for a rebuttal, I think it would gain a lot of attention as well as clarity. I originally found your cartoon on reddit and have always been a fan since finding it. After reading this user&#39;s post, however, I feel like the documentary may be misinformed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tad Lumpkin&#39;s Response:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey ██████████ :</p>

<p>No I don’t really use REDDIT myself, but I will try and respond to the below and you can feel free to post this if you want to.</p>

<p>First off, this guy’s entire commentary shows me he doesn’t understand the point of the film. When we set out to try and communicate why, debt based money, central banking, fiat currency, fractional reserve lending as well as the other concepts we hit on are fundamentally dishonest and diametrically opposed  to long term economic sustainability,  individual liberty, broad prosperity and self-reliance. We looked high and low for what others had done prior to this. What we found was that there was quite a bit on it infact. Lots of economic and history books as well as information packed documentaries and interviews that institutions and think tanks have made over the years. You know what else we found out? That no one looks at any of that stuff, well no one outside of a relatively small group of junkies myself included that will sit around for hours talking about various political and economic white papers written by some guy at some think tank somewhere. That my friends isn’t going to move the needle and frankly it’s the reason why the liberty movement has been stuck in neutral for so long. You have to get people to care, so we took another tact. We are story tellers and film makers and we figured out a way to communicate the concepts and philosophies that would prime the pump for the masses. We told a story based on how it works and the ideas behind it, we did not regurgitate a text book. Hence the reason the film has been translated into dozens of languages and watched over 10 million times.</p>

<p>For example and I will hit on a few of the topics:</p>

<p>3:00-“Actually banks get 40% of the their income from fees and noninterest sources.”
Yes banks do make lots of money in fees, generally those fees surround various products and instruments that rely on the current debt based system for their expansion, which again is the point of the film, to convey an idea and philosophy. The entire housing market at this point is nothing more than a candy land for politicians to manipulate for votes and bankers to manipulate for profits.  You can call it fees, interest or a purple lepricon for all I care, it’s the inherent corrupt nature to a debt based system run by a cabal of government elites and private industry insiders that I want to get across, who cares about a fee structure breakdown of individual revenue streams. It’s the same thing with much of the financial system. Why are so many people invested into the stock market? They pay huge fees for a less than average return, when they themselves tend to know very little about what it is they are investing in? Its because when you have a system that inherently devalues your currency it incentivizes risk taking,  if you don’t chase a return your purchasing power falls. Why do banks have high leverage trading departments? Where is that leverage come from? Here is the point, without the ability to create and utilize debt in the ways that our current system does, banks would be vastly less relevant than they are and they would make vastly less money and for that matter so would our politicians. Debt creation and the manipulation of that debt is the center piece to the modern mixed banking system and a massive driver of your 40% so called fee and noninterest related revenue. Its also the reason government can hand out both guns and butter.</p>

<p>7:15 and 7:30: Really? You might want to look at the potential problems with unwinding an almost $4trillion balance sheet. This is classic smoke and mirrors. You can read me the definition of the FED structure from a textbook, but what I am telling you again is the net effect of the concept the thing is build on, what we put in the film. Read the below article and take note of the projected losses between $216 billion and $550 billion? Oh but that is later so it doesn’t count? And who are they losing it too? Again, here is the bottom line. You can tell me what its “supposed to be” I am telling you what it is. There isn’t something for nothing. Debt is up, wages are down, wealth is transferring upward and banks are bigger and richer than ever. Government is bigger than ever. Just read the below from Bloomerberg. I would suggest you listen to some of this absurd testimony Bernanke gave to the Senate this week. Its literal nonsense.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-26/fed-faces-explaining-billion-dollar-losses-in-stress-of-qe3-exit.html">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-26/fed-faces-explaining-billion-dollar-losses-in-stress-of-qe3-exit.html</a></p>

<p>Things like 18:30 and Old Hickory’s last word’s being I killed the bank. Have you ever watched South Park before or any other animated film? I don’t know if those were his last words or not. The lore is that they were, it doesn’t really matter. The point isn’t for you to win Jeopardy on Jackson’s dying words. The point is to entertain you while we give you the information. He hated the central bank and went through multiple secretary of Treasury’s to get the thing shut down and of course he was “randomly” shot at by lone gunman as well. He did shut it down in the end and if those weren’t his literal last words, they are consistent with what his feelings were and he should have said it if he didn’t.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to watch more satirical media and to take a view from a higher altitude on how the system works. The Fed is currently monetizing our debt and will have to do even more of it in the future. Take a look at websites like Zero Hedge who does more mathematical and analytical analysis. Go to our website, we link you to places like The Von Mises institute, you can read all you want there too.</p>

<p>We aren’t misleading and we aren’t inaccurate. We are priming and exciting people about what the hell is going on and what they are dealing with. We also point them in the direction to get more specifics and purely academic information. Its mischaracterizing what the film is and what it isn’t.</p>

<p>I hope this clears things up a bit. If anyone wants to hear our ongoing take I suggest they tune into our radio show called THE BULLET WIRE, live or on podcast:<a href="http://www.thebulletwire.com/">http://www.thebulletwire.com/</a></p>

<p>One last thought, does anyone know at which department at Goldman Sachs Kahirsch works in?</p>

<p>People are already widely led around by the nose by &#39;satirical&#39; advertising; an overly inflated &#39;dire&#39; message tends to do its job (on the popular scale) better than an objective intellectual take on the situation.</p>

<p>No shit. This is one of the fundamental basis of our economy. Every time someone starts up a small business they are taking a huge risk with a potentially huge payoff. Every time an innovative individual leaves their corporate job to strike it out on their own, they are taking a huge risk. And yes, Every time a bank gives a new business owner a loan to help them get started, the bank is taking a risk.</p>

<p>Without risk we would not have innovation or growth. Risk is <em>good</em>.</p>

<p>Now ass hats risking other people&#39;s money with no chance of loss for themselves? That is bad!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He sent me an abridged version for you guys:</p>

<p><strong>Tad Lumpkin&#39;s Response</strong>
Hey ~~          ~~:</p>

<p>No I don’t really use REDDIT myself, but I will try and respond to the below and you can feel free to post this if you want to.</p>

<p>First off, this guy’s entire commentary shows me he knows more than me. When we set out to try and communicate why, buzzwords, I forgot to end this sentence with a point. We looked on Alex Jones radio and in our asses for what others had done prior to this. What we found was that there was quite a bit on it in fact. Lots of economic and history books as well as information packed documentaries and interviews that institutions and think tanks have made over the years. You know what else we found out? That no one looks at any of that stuff, well no one outside of a relatively small group of non-experts, myself included that will sit around for hours talking about various political and economic white papers written by some guy at some think tank somewhere that we don’t understand. That my friends isn’t going to move the needle and frankly it’s the reason why the liberty movement has been stuck in neutral for so long. You have to get people to care, so we took another tact. We are ‘story tellers’ (read: liars) and film makers and we figured out a way to lie about the concepts and philosophies that would prime the pump for the masses. We told a story based on how it works in our minds and the ideas behind it, we did not regurgitate a text book (clearly). Hence the reason the film has been translated into dozens of languages and watched over 10 million times. Do you know how eager people are to believe this stuff?</p>

<p>For example and I will hit on a few of the topics:</p>

<p>3:00-“Actually banks get 40% of the their income from fees and noninterest sources.”
Yes banks do make lots of money in fees, generally those fees surround various products and instruments that rely on the current debt based system for their expansion, which again is the point of the film, to convey an idea and philosophy. In this instance, anything inside a bank is debt based. They even write on debt based pens. The free coffee? Paid for with a mortgage. Even though non-interest sources clearly disregards all loaned funds, I’m doubling down on this. The entire housing market at this point is nothing more than buzzwords without substance.  You can call it fees, interest or a purple lepricon for all I care, I want to believe something else. It’s the same thing with much of the financial system. Why are so many people invested into the stock market? They pay huge fees for a less than average return, when they themselves tend to know very little about what it is they are investing in? I also cannot prove my previous statement and do not know anything about EMH. Its because when you have a system that completely unrelated stuff, if you don’t misleading words. Why do banks have high leverage trading departments? Where is that leverage come from? Another scary question I won’t answer. Here is the point, without the ability to create and utilize debt in the ways that our current system does, banks would be vastly less relevant than they are and they would make vastly less money and for that matter so would our politicians. We would also have no economy, but I’ve read white papers so that’s of little concern. Debt creation and the buzzwords is the center piece to the modern mixed banking system and a buzzwords fear mongering and misunderstanding your point.</p>

<p>7:15 and 7:30: Really? You might want to unrelated to your point of the FR not being wholly private. This is classic smoke and mirrors. I’m referring to what I’m saying by the way. You can read me the definition of the FED structure from a textbook, but what I again, I have read white papers. Read the below article and unrelated to your statement on structure? Oh but that is later so it doesn’t count? And who are they losing it too? Again, here is the bottom line. You can tell me what it is I am telling you what I say it is. There isn’t useless adage. Debt is up, wages are down, wealth is transferring upward and fear mongering. Government is bigger than ever. Just allow other people to do what I can’t. I would suggest you listen to some of this absurd testimony Bernanke gave to the Senate this week. Its literal nonsense to me as again, I have read white papers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-26/fed-faces-explaining-billion-dollar-losses-in-stress-of-qe3-exit.html">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-26/fed-faces-explaining-billion-dollar-losses-in-stress-of-qe3-exit.html</a></p>

<p>Things like 18:30 and Old Hickory’s last word’s being I killed the bank. I have no response to this but I will still write a paragraph and use the words South Park. You guys like that show right? This is literally the same thing.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to watch more satirical media and to take a view from a higher altitude on how the system works. See what I did there? I started this saying I’m trying to inform you, then I hid behind the medium used and the word satire to make up for lying. </p>

<p>What is true is true because I say so. What isn’t true South Park. Everything else, White Papers.</p>

<p>I hope this clears things up a bit. If anyone wants to hear our ongoing take I suggest they tune into our radio show called Self Promoting Plug.</p>

<p>One last thought, does anyone know at which department at Goldman Sachs Kahirsch works in? I suspect he has a rather large nose and a taste for bagels.</p>

<p>Tad</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Some of kahirsch&#39;s comments are true, and the cartoon contains many inaccuracies. </p>

<p>However, some of kahirsch&#39;s comments are wildly disingenuous, and I&#39;m afraid many people at Reddit are taking his &quot;rebuttal&quot; at face value because they aren&#39;t familiar enough with the financial system to realize this.</p>

<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve is audited by outsiders, including the Government Accountability Office&quot;.</p>

<p>This is technically true, but so disingenuous as to be in practice a lie. The GAO conducted a PARTIAL audit of the Federal Reserve for the FIRST TIME EVER in 2011 as mandated by an amendment to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill (don&#39;t get me started on how the banks gutted most of the reforms in that bill). The Fed vehemently opposed this amendment. kahirsch makes it sound as if GAO audits have been a routine, ongoing part of the Fed&#39;s history. That is flatly false. There has been only one audit, it was extremely recent, and by mandate it examined only the 2007-2010 bank bailouts. Here is a link: <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11696.pdf">http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11696.pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve doesn&#39;t loan money to the government, at least not directly&quot;. </p>

<p>Again, this is so disingenuous as to be in essence a lie. Buying Treasury securities is precisely the same thing as lending money to the government. The only difference between making a loan and buying a bond is that the bond is securitized. kahirsch is obviously familiar enough with the financial system to know this.</p>

<p>&quot;Your taxes do not go to your government -&gt; Yes, they do.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, this is entirely disingenuous. No one disputes that the government COLLECTS taxes. The question is where those tax funds end up. Between explicit payments (e.g. TARP) and implicit payments (artificially lowered short-term interest rates) a substantial portion of tax receipts in recent years have been handed to banks by the government.</p>
