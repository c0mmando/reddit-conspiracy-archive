    <div class="md"><p>I think a big market correction, or recession, or whatever you want to call it, is on its way. But there might be a bubble on its way to delay things again. Remember your recent history folks...
In 2000 we had the internet bubble (result: a lot of investors lost money)
Then came the housing bubble (result: rich homeowners, homelessness, expensive houses and the 2008 crash).
The debt bubble, which involved the printing and lending of trillions of dollars (result: we are still waiting to see).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, but I think, perhaps (and I&#39;m not an expert, just throwing it out there) that we might have an energy bubble coming with all these new gas and oil mining techniques (fracking) and all the natural resources in the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting you guys say that: <a href="http://bullmarketthinking.com/peter-grandich-when-gold-breaks-from-this-base-it-will-trigger-a-stampede-of-momentum-buyers/">Peter Grandich</a> made this comment </p>

<p>“They [the metals] have digested a decade’s worth of large gains, they’ve built a very strong base…as tough as it is for somebody to struggle with it, the longer the base is built, when the inevitable breakout to the upside comes, the bigger that move can be. I believe that move is coming this year. When it does, we will see a momentum flow into gold that we haven’t seen in years. So many technical buy signals will be triggered by that, and pure momentum players who really don’t care about the fundamentals of the story…will flow into the metals.” </p>

<p>“Everyday somebody sends me an article, predicting the end of the gold bull market. Those are the type of things that I like to hear because, the fact that we go sideways despite this onslaught of negativism, tells me the market still wants to go higher.” </p>

<p>“[And] with the German repatriation of gold, we’re probably in the early stages of a gold backed currency,” he added. The chief priority for investors during this period Peter explained, is capital preservation. </p>

<p>“Safety of principal is going to be key,”  he said. “It’s not going to be how much you make in the next few years, it’s how much you don’t lose…which you will then use to take advantage of assets which have dramatically dropped down in price.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stock in tangible companies are going to maintain their value.</p>

<p>Stocks are not going up, the dollar they are measured in is getting smaller. </p>

<p>Do you think stock in a company like this: <a href="http://www.silverdoctors.com/german-automaker-reportedly-hoarding-as-much-physical-silver-as-it-can-acquire/#more-21530">http://www.silverdoctors.com/german-automaker-reportedly-hoarding-as-much-physical-silver-as-it-can-acquire/#more-21530</a> is going to keep pace with inflation?</p>

<p>And by the way... how much gold does Germany have?  <em>(I think the FED sold off the German gold)</em> How much gold does the US have? <em>(I think they have sold off that gold also)</em> Search the internet for how much gold each country has. You may notice they do not list the 144 tones Libya had, and they do not list the 1,000 tones that Iran really really does have.</p>

<p>One day, your pennies will buy dollar bills!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think 5 years is too early for China. China will have to become stronger for them to wake up to the threat. Then, they will manufactuer a war, perhaps. </p>

<p>They may try with only the financial war, or perhaps tarrifs like they did with the solar panels, but I don&#39;t think it will work. China is too big and too strong and growing stronger. The US suppresses its population and China will raise its up. </p>

<p>They are doing oil with the ME and North Africa now. That is why they have to make the Muslims out to be assholes. They could just as easily make Islam out to be &quot;The Religion of Peace&quot; if it suited their purposes.  The propaganda is almost total at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look the  recession and collapse is inevitable. There is no way the market can climb to such heights with nothing to fall back on. There is no safety net. Are you suggesting we ignore this obvious fact in our reality? If so, then please carry on Sir, this post was not directed at you. It seems every time we are at this stage of pre-doom , few insiders know and the majority lose out. We are in the age of information, and what we are witnessing is a huge mainstream rally to &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;buy&quot; when the insiders are betting against those exact indexes, and are gonna make a killing when the dust clears. So it is already a pre-programed collapsed,  and the more people that know, the better they can prepare themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>whats wrong with getting reaction? many posts here are like that. is /r/ conspiracy no place to have discussion on some possible financial schemes going? if that is so, then I had no idea. Between, repatriation of gold by countries is a common discussions in the maintream media, I don&#39;t see the problem with talking about that.  Everything in the blogs is found in the maintream, it is just riskier to be shouting it  out on Huffington post or something,  but is all there. It always is. The critical moment has not passed, not for those who have  a chance to move their little savings. And definetly not for the guys betting against those indexes, who are waiting to cash in. IT is one thing to be pessimistic and another to be stupid and pretend like its okay to watch people  manipulate the masses and take advantage of what little they have because you think the ship is going down anyway, and they should just go down with it willingly.</p>
