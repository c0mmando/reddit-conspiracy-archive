        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I live right next to the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles. I&#39;ve seen police investigating, it&#39;s been on the news here. The whole thing seemed pretty gross so I began reading about it. The level of coincidence here is frankly the most astonishing thing I think I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my timeline of research:</p>

<p>Decomposing body found in water tank that of Elisa Lam.. <a href="http://youtu.be/lH21FeFi50A">last known footage of her relased</a>.
Hotel guests/residents were drinking/ingesting, bathing etc. with this water.</p>

<p>Gross, sure. I recall this is pretty similar to the way the movie &quot;Dark Water&quot; ended. Characters body in the water rank on the roof, male lead character has hard time shutting elevator. The Cecil hotel where this girl died has a long history of really bad shit going down. The Black Dahlia girl is known to have frequented it. The main characters in &quot;Dark Water&quot; are named is Cecilia and Dahila. So I think, shit, that&#39;s really a crazy coincidence. </p>

<p>The news begins reporting a fast spreading <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/22/us-tuberculosis-losangeles-idUSBRE91L13Z20130222">drug resistent outbreak of TB. This specific form of TB is contracted by ingestion and also notorious for being passed along by from the dead to the living,  in the exact area of this death in downtown LA</a>, which is worrisome, I live there. While the news is talking about the TB outbreak, they mention the name of the TB test. The name of the TB test is letter for letter the girls name that died but first name last. LAM ELISA. 
<a href="http://www.cli-online.com/featured-articles/lam-antigen-testing-an-effective-rule-in-test-for-tbhiv-co-infection/">TB test, which is for a particular form of TB (that can be contracted by ingesting) MIRRORS HER NAME.</a></p>

<p>OK at this point sirens are going off in my head. I&#39;m calling my gf like &quot;can you believe this? this is fucking nuts, what are the chances of this being coincidence?&quot; So I start playing with her name. Maybe the universe is trying to say something right?</p>

<p>So I arrange it to L.A. Melisa, I&#39;m on that for a while until I arrange it again to SEAL I LAM. Then I&#39;m like hmmm...seal... lamb... <a href="http://bible.cc/revelation/6-1.htm">the first seal in revelations is broken by the lamb</a>. OK mind blown. Look up the meaning of the name Elisa. <a href="http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com/search.php?p=qsearch&amp;s_copt3=2&amp;i_search=elisa&amp;x=-912&amp;y=-58&amp;searchtype=sitewide">The name means &quot;Gods vow&quot; or &quot;dedicated to God&quot; or God is my oath&quot;</a> These aren&#39;t far reaching stretches of the imagination, this is in your fucking face.</p>

<p>I am not a Christian, nor religious really. I do think there is more than what we see. I can&#39;t wrap my head around this. Anyone care to chime in?</p>

<p>Sixty of those [78] cases [&gt;&gt;&gt;<strong><em>in the past 5 years</em></strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;] were homeless individuals leaving in the skid row area.</p>

<p>So unless those homeless people were spending all their booze money on time travel and staying in that hotel, your theory doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States had about 10,528 cases of tuberculosis in 2011</p>

<p>That&#39;s from <strong><em>ONE YEAR</em></strong>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean his &quot;theory doesn&#39;t add up&quot;? According to the Los Angeles Times article, it&#39;s estimated that approximately 4,650 people were exposed in this most recent outbreak. 
<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/downtown-la-tuberculosis-outbreak-brings-federal-forces.html">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/downtown-la-tuberculosis-outbreak-brings-federal-forces.html</a></p>

<p>The reason why there have been so few &quot;cases&quot; of TB in the information you&#39;ve sighted is because they&#39;ve nearly stopped testing for it in the US. When I was living in San Diego five years ago, I had a cough for two months and my doctors refused to test me for TB by stating that it was very rare. They believed this because of the same flawed information you stated. Thankfully, it doesn&#39;t appear as though I caught TB, but I&#39;ve never been tested. But now, probably because of the lack of testing, we&#39;re looking at what could very well be a full-scale outbreak.  </p>

<p>Statistics can be misleading. With the quantity of non-immunized illegal immigrants we have in Southern California, this place is certainly not &quot;TB proof&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they do not inquire about TB. At least, not in California. I hold a substitute teacher&#39;s license and didn&#39;t need to show proof of TB immunization or prove that I didn&#39;t have TB. They were primarily concerned with measles, mumps, and rubella. This was also the case when I entered college.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A coincidence, yes. However, let&#39;s look at some facts. It appears that her friends have confirmed she suffered from some sort of mental illness. Taking that into account, if she found out about the TB outbreak and her &quot;name&quot; was spotted on a sign or in a paper, she could have fallen in to a psychotic episode, which explains the weird behavior in the elevator.</p>

<p>Whether this was a suicide or homicide is still undetermined. Someone could have very well targeted a mentally ill person as their potential victim. If it were a suicide, the aforementioned information would seem to be just cause.</p>

Maybe she even climbed in to a tank to hide, not knowing she wouldn&#39;t be able to get out. Also, the 82 y.o. resident who heard a bang-like explosion could have been from a water pipe bursting under the pressure of her body in the tank, similar effect to flushing a toilet out by pouring a jug of water in it. There was flooding probably from excess force or the bang could have been from hearing her forced in to the tank. Just a theory...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many weird things about this video.</p>

<p>1) She appears to casually stroll in the elevator and press several buttons.
2) when the elevator doesn&#39;t move she pokes her head out cautiously.<br/>
3). Throughout the video she appears to try to hide and presses the buttons again, but never shows much panic or urgency in her movement.
4). Finally, she gets out and appears she might be talking to someone.<br/>
5). After she disappears off frame, the elevator finally begins to move.</p>

<p>It looks to me as if she was trying to avoid someone, but not someone she had necessarily labeled a threat....maybe a stranger had been trailing her in the hall and she wasn&#39;t sure if he was intentionally stalking her or not.  The stranger holds the call button and prevents the elevator from moving while talking to her...maybe trying to get her to come with Him/her?  She eventually goes with the stranger ...apparently voluntarily.  After that, who knows?  Rape, strangulation, murder?  Or maybe she was just really strung out and paranoid..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elevator genuinely seemed to not be working properly, it seemed to not respond to her button pushing at any point and yet exhibited two distinct patterns of sustained/repetitive behavior. One, the door remains open and does not move. Two, the door opens and closes and then opens again... The fact that the elevator skipped from pattern one to pattern two after she left the elevator indicates that her presence was the cause for the pattern change. The elevator could have been broken, but in practical experience a broken machine doing something will not change to something else on its own, something has to interfere and add variables to the system. This is the long way of saying that it was human intervention/action which changed the elevator behavior and if it was not Elisa, then who? </p>

<p>A big question here is are you able to hold the elevator open by holding down the call button outside the elevator. The one you press and then wait for the elevator to arrive. I would imagine that elevator systems differ so not sure about this particular hotel&#39;s elevators. Either someone was just behind Elisa who held the elevator from just outside the elevator car, or if the hotel&#39;s system does not permit this then it was someone in a maintenance room/area that stopped the elevator. This option calls for two or more culprits at least. Whoever any of these people were, they knew damn well the elevator has a camera and stayed the fuck clear of it. How visible is the camera? Could just anyone notice it or did this person have intimate knowledge of the elevator system? Perhaps a &quot;repairman&quot; who serviced the elevators in recent days?</p>

<p>She certainly seemed to be on some kind of drugs, and while this does leave the possibility that she was simply so fucked up that she actually never pressed any elevator buttons. However, if you watch the video you can see that at some point she just presses everything. So while audio and visual hallucinations may have been present she was able to use the panel, keep in mind that she had to ride the elevator previously at some point not to mention that she did speak English. My point being that she was able to think somewhat well enough to troubleshoot the elevator like a normal person would be expected to, albeit her other actions show that her perception of reality was likely very skewed.</p>

<p>So this brings us to how she got to the water tower. We know she was not alone. Someone took the time to lock down the elevators, trapping her on that floor. So we can skip over the assumptions that she got to the roof still on the run and climbed in the water to hide. IF she climbed in herself then someone was very close behind, guiding her to the water tank. The state in which she appeared to be would make her very malleable to suggestions so one could likely get her to do all sorts of things with the proper verbal coaching.</p>

<p>The coincidence with her name and the TB test, is perhaps the most solid evidence here. If someone is a math major they can run the odds for us, but I&#39;ll just take the logical route. We know she left Canada under strange circumstances that her parents cannot quite explain. To me this means that someone or something convinced her to travel and then followed her to the hotel. If we could find video from other locations around LA or wherever she arrived first from Canada we could likely gain more info. Someone was likely watching her when she arrived and then followed her around. Either this person watched from a distance or they befriended her, posing as a student traveling from Canada to LA, anything that would put her guard down.</p>

<p>I cannot believe the name is just a coincidence. Who ever picked her, wanted her death to be linked by the public to a TB outbreak. But why go through all this trouble, just so the history books will read, &quot;The 2013 TB outbreak is widely believed to have started as a result of the death of ELISA LAM in a public LA water tank. As confirmed by the longstanding LAM ELISA TB test...&quot; IDK it just sounds stupid.</p>

<p>Do dead bodies ALWAYS produce TB when in water like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theory doesn&#39;t hold up. I know that area very well. Right near the Cecil you have skid row, plus 3 homeless shelters; the LA mission, union rescue mission and midnight mission. TB tests are mandatory for all shelter residents because TB is an ongoing problem. Now, I would not put it past the globalists to use that, they very well could be piggybacking their own strain into the area for depopulation agenda etc, but we need more than what&#39;s presented here.

    <div class="md"><p>I admit that the correlation between the TB Strain being investigated and the woman&#39;s name is quite odd, but, you&#39;re trying to connect things that may have nothing to do with each other. Cecil has a dark history. Richard Ramirez &quot;night stalker&quot; lived there. But I don&#39;t see anything mind-blowing here. The only true anomaly is the woman&#39;s name being almost identical to the strain. THAT&#39;S interesting. The stuff about the film &quot;Dark Water&quot;? A reach. Also, you&#39;re overhyping it. &quot;Most amazing coincidence&quot;, Etc etc.</p>

<p>&quot;With the availability of <strong>ELISA-based LAM antigen</strong> detection assays, researchers have sought to establish the effectiveness of the diagnostic test in people suspected of having TB. Increasingly, studies have revealed that when used as a general screening tool, the <strong>LAM-ELISA</strong> test sensitivity is significantly lower in subjects who are HIV- when compared to HIV+ subjects.&quot;</p>

Those tanks hold 1,000 gal. of water and is 10 feet tall. Could you see the bottom of the dark tank that only has a small hatch type opening in the top full of water? I don&#39;t know if they drained it and then found her but it seems doubtful that you could see what is on the bottom of that dark tank. Then the survelience video..Who was she hiding from? It looked like she was talking to someone towards the end of the tape that was just off camera. I have to say I am looking forward to getting the full story here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a concept as to what happened to this poor girl.</p>

<p>Because of her lack of glasses, she couldn&#39;t remember which floor was hers, so she went to the 14th floor, because she remembered it was a middle button, perhaps confusing the floors &quot;4&quot; with &quot;14&quot;. She tried to enter what she thought was her room, and this alerted the occupant of that room.</p>

<p>She comes back to the elevator but the original one she took is now somewhere else (that&#39;s a different tape), and she enters the 2nd elevator.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TjVBpyTeZM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TjVBpyTeZM</a></p>

<p>Start the video.</p>

<p>0:07, she&#39;s trying to read the numbers, but can&#39;t, so she just hits all the buttons in the middle row, and then hits the &quot;HOLD DOOR&quot; button, thinking it reads, &quot;CLOSE DOOR&quot;.</p>

<p>00:20, the occupant has left the apartment, is holding the elevator button in the hall, and is outside the vision of the camera. He says calmly, &quot;hey, get out of the elevator.&quot;</p>

<p>00:24, she checks the hallway, and sees the man standing by the button. She positions herself to view the the man, and is waiting for the elevator doors to shut. The occupant holds the button to the elevator, and calmly asks who she is.</p>

<p>00:37, She approaches the man and attempts to apologize.</p>

<p>00:48, the occupant tells her to get out of the elevator. She shyly and slowly begins to, but sees danger.</p>

<p>00:53, the occupant pulls out a gun, and this causes her to jump. The occupant is now telling her to come closer to him. She doesn&#39;t understand there&#39;s a camera in the elevator, while the occupant is fully aware of this.</p>

<p>1:03, the occupant grabs her at gunpoint, and tells her to get out of here or he&#39;ll kill her, he probably mugs her, and he releases her.</p>

<p>1:30, she enters the elevator and is terrified. In a panic, she hits all the buttons, but she keeps hitting the &quot;HOLD DOOR&quot; button. The man is telling her to leave, and she doesn&#39;t understand why she can&#39;t.</p>

<p>1:50, the occupant hits the button again and orders her to come back. She&#39;s in tears and is trying to say she&#39;s confused.</p>

<p>1:57, the occupant places his gun on the back of her head, and she&#39;s pulling away, giving the strange look about her arms.</p>

<p>2:05, the occupant grabs her neck, and gives her a yank and tells her to shut up, and she completely submits.</p>

<p>2:12, she begins begging for her life.</p>

<p>2:20, the occupant tells orders her to be quiet.</p>

<p>2:25, the occupant leads her away from the camera by her neck, and a gun to her head.</p>

<p>2:45 (aporox) the occupant lets go of the elevator button.</p>

<p>2:58, the elevator shuts, and begins going to the floors pressed.</p>

<p>It is my belief she was accosted by an occupant of the 14th floor, probably someone in a room with a fire escape access to the roof. My belief she&#39;s on the 14th floor is because of this picture...</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/we6I2JX.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/we6I2JX.jpg</a></p>

<p>...this is a picture of the buttons in the elevator in that video. According to this, she kept hitting all the buttons in the middle row, in this order from top down, 14, 10, 7, 4, M, B, and &quot;HOLD DOOR&quot;. She was staying on the 4th floor, and I believe made a simple error, due to not wearing her glasses, where she picked &quot;14&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice in the video that the top button in the middle row does not light when she presses it. That is because, as you see in the photo, it&#39;s the 14th floor, and she&#39;s already there.</p>

<p>What happens then till she ended up in the tank is anyone&#39;s guess, but I believe her time was very quick. Check out this news report from Stephan Chase for KTLA News, specifically the testimony of Bernard Diaz starting about 1:30 in. He talks about an &quot;explosion&quot; that &quot;knocked him out of bed&quot;.</p>

<p>ktla.com/2013/02/19/womans­-body-found-in-cecil-hotel-wat­er-tank-2/#axzz2LpWbGbvH</p>

<p>I believe this proves my concept that the killer forced her to climb into the tank, because he then followed, stuck his﻿ gun in the tank, and then shot her. Why else would he do this, unless she was alive going in?</p>

<p>And it gets worse, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, yes. The horror doesn&#39;t stop there. This girl had a rare form of tuberculosis from China and has been infecting almost every single person with it. Don&#39;t take my word for it, take the LA Times...</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/22/local/la-me-tb-outbreak-20130222">http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/22/local/la-me-tb-outbreak-20130222</a></p>

<p>...no one knows what the hell this thing is! Oh, we know it&#39;s TB, but nothing like this was ever known before. &quot;Unique!&quot; They call it &quot;unique&quot;. So far, it&#39;s estimated over 4,500 people are infected, 11 deaths.</p>

<p>This guy&#39;s murdered 12 innocent people so far.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to her and to all that know her.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been anywhere near that building, please get tested.</p>

I don&#39;t think corpses are nearly as big a danger of infection as they are presented to be.

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean to infer that it doesn&#39;t kill, or cause respiratory issues. It certainly can, but scientifically it&#39;s nearly impossible to connect it back to smog. The cause of death would never be directly linked back to ozone and particulate matter from diluted vehicle exhaust.   </p>

<p>Also, do keep in mind that the statistics in the cited report are estimates the researchers made based on the levels of ozone and particulate matter, they are not counts. There is plenty of room for flaw, which I&#39;m sure is present. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean by the first part is that long-term exposure to smog certainly can be the cause of many deaths; however, it&#39;s nearly impossible to prove a direct cause and effect relationship to any specific death. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that smog is a greater health concern than TB. Based on my own personal experience, I believe that TB is under-tested and is therefore under-reported (I had a cough for two months that was caused by a bacterial infections and the doctor refused to test for TB). Also, regarding the OP, he lives in the exact area of the outbreak; at this moment he should be much more concerned about TB than smog - it would be ridiculous for him to think otherwise. </p>

<p><em>In 1958, Klaus Conrad published a monograph entitled Die beginnende Schizophrenie. Versuch einer Gestaltanalyse des Wahns,[1] in which he described in groundbreaking detail the prodromal mood and earliest stages of schizophrenia.

<p>I don&#39;t see it as a humorous thing, just an insignificant thing.</p>

<p>If you use language like &quot;when you sit with your thumb up your ass&quot; and &quot;smug assholes&quot; and &quot;snobby-ass&quot; and &quot;egotistical bullying&quot; etc. and feel offended when this influences the tone of the conversation, then chances are your offended state is not that meaningful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the proof is in the text: your litany of strange hostility. You appear to be one of these people that&#39;s needlessly antagonistic then gets offended when the same sentiment is returned. While I&#39;m sure you haven&#39;t arrived at this attitude intentionally it&#39;s possible you have a subconscious instinct to manipulate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think we both know the answer but I&#39;m sure you want me to stroke your momentum here: It takes a bit of &quot;connecting what appears to be coincedence&quot; to produce conspiracy cases (in almost all cases that they are theorized).

    <div class="md"><p>I did enjoy the article, and it is a valuable read--I still echo its point that there are rare casing when getting offended is valuable. Personally, I see my offense as valuable in this case, as it serves as a motivation to defend strangers from your assumptive diagnoses of their very mental states based on a single line. I am not sure I would&#39;ve had the drive to continue this nonsense without having been offended, but would consider it necessary nonetheless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny because I have noticed people who bank on stoicism as an upgraded crutch from taking offense. As long as you are stoic, you must be correct. The emotional person HAS to be the idiot...this is typically the case when a popular establishment does not recognize an organization fighting to present truth above the words of dominant institutions...very effective. </p>

<p>So is that not what they are doing--implying more evidence is needed? Since when have they claimed evidence by saying its in your face?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For this being r/conspiracy, there sure is a massive lack of people understanding the motive for occult symbologies and the like. If they wanted to give us TB they would just put it in the water, but maybe after that they might like to laugh about getting away with shoving a clue about how we &quot;shouldn&#39;t drink the water&quot; right in front of our faces. Regardless, the LAPD has not even mentioned the footage from floor cameras or why we haven&#39;t found conclusive evidence on other cameras or why that footage doesnt exist--what hotel is without floor cameras? And as such this thing STINKS to high heaven of massive coverup with more than one company involved. </p>
