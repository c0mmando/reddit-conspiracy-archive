    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMvGtx-kHdo">George Carlin says it best</a>, usa fought the germans in wwii because they were cutting in on our action, wanting to dominate the world. Pearl Harbor was to World War 2 like 9/11 was to the war on terrror. Whether the government allowed it to happen,or for whatever other conspiracy, Pearl Harbor galvanized Americans to want to fight the enemy and gave the government reason to go to war. the government wanted to go to war but the American people did not. like 911, Americans galvanized to fight the enemy. While the government had a different reason for war, they wanted to rule the world.  after war ended, the nazi Germans were covertly brought to America, because the government did not see them as the enemy, but a rival, so why not join forces for the shared goal of world domination. It was done covertly because the American people were not and is not the American government. the American people&#39;reasons for war was different then the government reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>LOVE</strong> and miss Carlin...here&#39;s what <strong>richard belzer</strong> had to say about JFK...</p>

<p>&quot;...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that&#39;s why he was murdered. Because there&#39;s so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it&#39;s charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I&#39;m going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. <strong>They&#39;re supposed to be covert</strong>--they&#39;re not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There&#39;s a lot of dark stuff--but it&#39;s in the public domain. There&#39;s thousands of pages that can&#39;t be released until 2075. But there&#39;s an interesting thing in 2014--England&#39;s statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we&#39;re going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Oddly enough, in a PNAC document titled &quot;Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses,&quot; it was written that &quot;the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, with Pearl Harbor the National Archives made available Japanese codes sent during Nov., 1942 that were decoded and read by Roosevelt. Around 2002, a book was made based on these messages the ONI took the records out of circulation. Even worse, the records from the end of the war are kept from &quot;We, the SERFS&quot; as well...</p>

<p>With JFK, many of the records released are redacted and it is known that over 6,000 files have remained unseen by the public...how can we judge history if we do not know <em>what really happened</em>???</p>

<p>JFK, MLK and RFK were all opposed to Vietnam...</p>

<p>JFK had signed documents to take out 1,000 U.S. troops out of Vietnam by the end of 1963 (and the rest by the end of 1964)...</p>

<p>April 4, 1967: MLK gives his powerful &quot;Beyond Vietnam&quot; speech in NYC...in the speech MLK called the U.S. &quot;the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.&quot; MLK was berated by the press--Time magazine called his speech &quot;demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi&quot;.</p>

<p>April 1, 1968: RFK gives his &quot;Plan for Peace (in Vietnam)&quot; speech in San Francisco as he builds momentum in the Democratic primary race.</p>

<p>April 4, 1968: MLK was assassinated 3 days after RFK gave his speech-- and exactly 1 year after his own &quot;Beyond Vietnam&quot; speech.</p>

<p>June 5, 1968: RFK was assassinated in Los Angeles. (RFK is one of two sitting senators to be assassinated).
What are the odds two brothers--both very high ranking politicians would be shot within 5 years of each other???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t believe any of their bullshit.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re in this subreddit in the first place.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve stacked lies ontop of lies on top of lies.  If they ever change their narrative about the past it will delegitimitize their current political position.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge house of cards.  If the JFK card falls, and the populace trys to relearn the true history of the United States...  It would cause a mass awakening.  They&#39;ll do anything to prevent that from happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comments by Preston James, Ph D (posted in comments of article titled &quot;The JFK War: The Case of Federal Judge John Tunheim&quot; by Dr. James Fetzer on VeteransToday.com)...</p>

<p>Excellent article. The sealed “executive sessions” of the HSCA should be released. These were the highly classified executive sessions with folks like Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis of OP40 who testified and provided numerous photos and docs. They were given immunity in exchange for cooperating. The records provided included a photo of the Op40 crew at the Motel the night before with Jack Ruby and much more. Ask Gaeton Fonzi, he knows but I’ll bet he won’t admit it.</p>

<p>When Frank Sturgis was arrested in NYC right before the HSCA Hearings, he made one phone call, supposed to Gaeton Fonzi, who then contacted infamous mob attorney Frank Nelson who came and bailed Sturgis out of jail the next morning. The <strong>executive sessions boxed and sealed evidence</strong> is filled with so much smoking gun evidence that it would have brought down the whole US intel system and much of the USG, which basically was transformed into a huge criminal syndicate by those who murdered JFK. What is in the sealed files?</p>

<p>That the JFK Assassination was a deep black USD covert operation run right out of the JCS with LBJ, Bush1, Nixon, J. Edgar Mary, Lemnitzer, Lansdale, E Howard Hunt, Phillips, and CIA/Op40 doing the shooting with numerous others ops and mafia brought in to provide false leads. </p>

<p>If the boxes were opened now and released 100% as is, they would still probably bring down much of the USG and American Intel, since many of the same power control groups who did it are still in power and are completely illegitimate. One of the boxes contains a “signed finding” by LBJ that JFK was a clear threat to US national security. And there are numerous videos taken from Dealey Plaza which show what really happened. These videos are the real deal, not morphed and edited like the faked Zapruder film.</p>
