       Kind of obvious.  The 2nd amendment is not about self defense.   It's about keeping an armed revolution feasible if need be.  The proposed assault rifle bans attack that directly.

       Thank you. And most of the sheep see an "assault" weapons ban as a good thing. Which there isn't any true classification of "assault weapons", its simply a term used to scare the public into supporting the movement to take away their own rights.

       Are you fucking kidding me? The 2nd amendment absolutely is about self defense, that's why it's stated as "the right to keep and bear arms" with no restrictions as to when or where you can keep and bear those arms which means it IS intended to provide every citizen with equal opportunity for self defense.
      </p>

       Who in the fuck was going to attack the congressional congress? They all brought their guns with them.

       So where's the armed insurrection? The second amendment is all about corporate profit through the selling of arms to a scared/righteous/indulgent/lonely population, and of course there is a distribution bias to monied white folks. Guns aren't cheap.

       Parking your car on an interstate and walking away has more strategic value than owning traditional weapons. All that time spent at the gun range is worth less than having spent that time learning horticulture or even getting to know the neighbors really well.

       There's nothing like white privilege bonding over the smell of gunpowder in the morning. So can I put you down as a volunteer for the armed insurrection? Oh, thought not. You probably just keep a gun so no damn ni...e're-do-well gets at your stuff.

       Time is a zero sum game and for many so is money—there is always an opportunity cost. Personal gun ownership which is what most 2nd amendment fetishists want is no help regarding tyranny.

       Was he trying to argue with me with "right up until you need one"? I can only imagine needing one if one was drawn on me, so unless I keep a gun drawn at all times I lose my "competitive" advantage. It's also useless against tyranny.

       Obama is a crook, but I've never met the man and only ever once been to the state of Florida so my arguments are I suppose baseless. I have never visited a concentration camp either so any negative arguments I may have against them are also baseless, right?

       If anything it is the 2nd amendment fetishists. Where were they during Vietnam? Black rights movement? Female rights? Worker rights? Universal healthcare? They often lead selfish lives with selfish politics, the noble idea of preventing tyranny is a sham.

       Of course, the ones who can afford guns shooting ones that cannot. Relative poverty united me with the have-nots so they wanted nothing from me. This proves my point: guns are a last resort with all else having failed. Guns don't prevent inequality or social cohesion and every purchase along with ammo is empowering to
       <strong>
        gun makers

      <p>
       May I suggest you use reason to understand that "the gun" and "force" are not synonyms. I'm very much certain I could do more damage to the state without a gun than you can with a cabinet full. Ammo runs out and imagination is unbounded and that along with social cohesion are the two greatest threats to the state, which too many in the US have forgotten. BTW, you haven't really been philosophical but anecdotal (the weakest form of argument) and rhetorical:

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       My position is that all the handguns in the world will not take down a tyrannical government because it necessitates that any winner be the one that used the most violence. One is replaced for another and it is very often the arms dealers that are the silent victors. To kill a government is to kill its currency not its army, and the state loves nothing more than to divide and conquer with home invasions or gun lust.

       Guns are to ammo what energy is to water.  Future control will focus more on ammo and water because those are things that they will be able to control more in the 21st century.

       I study nonviolence. Research shows that no one needs a gun to overthrow the government. In fact, using weapons may just prolong conflict and increase the body count. In addition, it is not necessary to have a "back-up" militia (which people will usually chime in to say) - civil society movements are the most effective means of combatting corrupt, genocidal dictatorships and militias usually hold everyone back from progress.

       see, now you pointed out examples. You can't just expect me to do your research. I did my research on my argument. I believe the only one i know well enough is the arab spring. That didn't really become fully successful til the army sided with the protestors

       It's important that the military "sides" with the protestors, but not that they use their weapons against the government on behalf of the revolution.  They just need to agree not to use their weapons against the nonviolent rebellion.

       The second amendment is already irrelevant - it has been for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       it was meant to allow a revolution if need be, when the people had the same armaments as the Military.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason it's irrelevant, is if you try to spark an armed revolution, the government can easily respond with tanks and drones, things the founders couldn't even conceive would be used in time of war.

       They can terrorize the people with drones but that only will be useful for putting down a highly organized force.  They will need to have boots on the street to kick down the doors to really maintain control.  In that case a 3d printed gun that is only good enough for shooting 1000 rounds is more than adequate for killing cops and soldiers.  They cannot just so easily fight a war against the people where every door that they approach leaves them open to sniper fire from ten other locations.  Then once they start taking a few hits they are forced to treat the entire street like a hostile warzone and that means alienating entire communities every time that something needs to be done.

       I know this isn't going to be popular amongst many in this thread but I think in today's world, the second amendment is a false security blanket to most of my fellow citizens. There are no amount of weapons that an individual or group of Individuals can collect that can equal the power of our government and it's military. If the government wants something or someone, we have given them the ability to take it.   All your guns in the world will not protect you from it and our obsession with collecting them speaks more to our ignorance of the scope of the situation and less about protecting liberties etc. it's my 2 cents and I'm in the mood to share. Y'all have a great day!

       You're very wrong about that. two wrongs don't make a right? get out of here with that childish playground logic. Is it bad to fight back against a government that murders, steals, lies, and strips rights away from citizens? Oh sorry lets try telling them were upset instead, because thats working so well right now or in the last 10 years for that matter.

       I am against gun control, but you do not get power from a gun, you get fear. If you don't know this then you are the one with playground logic as any halfway intelligent human knows this fact.

       I'm pretty sure they'd prefer we have them. It'd be really hard to convince American soldiers to march on fellow Americans who weren't reasonably suspected to have guns.

      <p>
       Do you really think we'd stand a chance against the US Army? There may be tens of millions of guns in the US, but there's no where to hide. A few attack drones could subdue the American public quick enough. With or without guns.

       It's very possible. Supposably two guys in Boston warranted an assault through the town. To say it was not a full on Fallujah style house by house assault is bullshit. Imagine if they did that in the south side of Chicago. ChiRAQ.

       I think as long as the American people don't fire first, the soldiers won't initiate.

       Problem is, if we're all rioting in the streets, I don't think US soldiers would hesitate to put an end to the violence. Peaceful protest is the best case scenario.

       I think that it is more likely that they would use the giant microwave gun that causes you to feel like you are burning alive when it resonates on your nerves.  I'd imagine that two of those devices would be able to keep an 8 lane major road completely free and clear if they also used a little tear gas and just even a few snipers with rubber bullets.  They will be using this high tech shit on the people because it is not very lethal and it causes severe unbearable pain so they will get their kicks off with the control while knowing that the lasting effects are minimal.

       of course not. you're posting to r/conspiracy. Most people who come here have a predisposition to what they believe is true, and no open mind to what is reality. So it is very likely that what ever you believe is true, whether it is real or not, is definitely replicated in the minds of many other redditors on r/conspiracy.

       And that's an illogical argument. A predisposition is not the same as a suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can suspect something, with an open mind - E.G A Scientist. Or you can make a case with a predisposition to your view, and a closed mind - E.G a Zealot
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy has more zealots than r/christianity or r/atheism.  If you read the blurb on what  r/conspiracy is about - it's that everyone has a point of view. But the fact that there are only three different subjects on the front page right now, and anyone who disagrees with them gets downvoted, sort of shows that r/conspiracy is not an openminded subreddit, but rather a breeding ground for bigotry and zealotry (still not entirely sure if that's the right word) - rather than wanting to learn with an open mind.

       Actually, if I had said "Everyone on r/conspiracy is a bigot or zealot" that would be the same as saying all catholics molest children. I am not sure why you would call me an idiot and then follow it up with a statement like that. That's just silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying r/conspiracy as a subreddit is a breeding ground for bigotry and zealotry is, to a degree, a generalisation, but the critical difference ist hat I stated a proven basis for my argument. It was a "rough" fact, but I am quite confident that if i were to do more study I would be able to validate it very comfortably.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dismiss (and yes, you can call this a predisposition) blanket and uneducated statements that are repetitive, uninformative, and do not offer an open-minded, objective, view. This is not having a "predisposition to rejecting ideas that upset the consensus" - unless you are agreeing that the consensus is that r/conspiracy is a breeding pool for bigotry and zealotry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also - and don't get me wrong - truly I am enjoying this debate - I would like to point out that my original statement was not an "Argument". I was merely pointing out that what they are saying is very common because people hold to what they believe and a lot of people on r/conspiracy believe what that person was saying. I am actually not entirely sure why you bothered to respond in the first place?

       I am not entirely sure where you get your point of view from - mine was based on visible evidence, having watched r/conspiracy move further and further away from it's core message over the last year.

       It's a shame that your response has just been "you're an idiot and you're wrong and go away and don't come back" without any reference to fact or experience. It sort of reaffirms my original statement.

       When do you sleep? I mean, you've made a comment almost every hour in the past 24. The longest you went without commenting is 2 hours. Hardly enough time to get some restful sleep.

       Oh, I know it's a shill account. I'm just trying to get him to answer it himself. He's quite a dickbag and they need to be called out every now and then.

       Parking your car on an interstate and walking away has more strategic value than owning traditional weapons. All that time spent at the gun range is worth less than having spent that time learning horticulture or even getting to know the neighbors really well.
