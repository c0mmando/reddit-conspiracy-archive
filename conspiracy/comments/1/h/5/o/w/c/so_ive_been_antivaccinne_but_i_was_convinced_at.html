    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re gay. There&#39;s no need to give you any infertility drugs via a vaccine because they&#39;ve already gotten to you through social engineering. Hell, maybe it was a vaccine when you were an infant/child. Maybe it was a cocktail of different chemicals that your mother had ingested/absorbed while pregnant with you. Maybe it&#39;s natural selection removing you from the gene pool because somewhere in your genome there&#39;s a defect (not the gay) that would harm future generations. Or, maybe you were just born that way.</p>

<p>Now, before the LGBT community comes down. on me for saying that, I just want to say that I have and have had gay friends, employees, and relatives (my ex-wife and current wife happen to be bisexual. The ex-mother-in-law is a lesbian and we suspect that her mother was also a lesbian as well). I say, no man or woman has a right to stop any other man or woman from pursuing what makes them happy without physically or intentionally hurting others. That is the meaning of Liberty and Freedom, and it&#39;s what this country has lost over the last 30 years and needs to find again, fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait... a vaccine targeted at gay men.... gosh it sounds so familiar..... so very familiar.... i&#39;ll leave that as an exercise to the reader.  </p>

<p>Ever heard of a gay man getting meningitis? Nope? Me neither. Convinced by Beelzebub to get all up in your veins....  </p>

<p>Let me posit for you a question..... you&#39;re out with a beautiful young lady, sweet... caring... yall are having a great time and ya&#39;ll get a little silly and are on the cusp of continuing your good time in the nude.... do you at that point say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey pretty lady, I know we&#39;re having a good time.... but you see I got this label of mine. And This label says, that I&#39;m not having a good time.... So not tonight you see.... this label means I can&#39;t have a good time....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See most people don&#39;t let labels/words prevent them from enjoying themselves... and as a result.... men having been having intercourse with just about anything since the dawn of time. They are designed that way. So is selecting people for their self assigned &quot;gayness&quot; really all that scientific? Nope. So much for the science of this vaccine.</p>

<p>What should actually be selected for is the amount of foreign DNA you allow into your blood stream.  Because that&#39;s where you actually have the chance of getting ill. Probably not from meningitis, since that is a pretty swift illness.... but hepatitis is reported to be common amongst those who have a lot of fluid exchanging intercourse (gay or straight) with a lot of different partners.  Basically, to be blunt, keep your mouth out of others asses and semen out of your butt babe.  </p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s a vaccine – the CDC recommends that all 11 and 12 year olds be vaccinated -- which is why the doctors decided to issue their warning, now, just before Gay Pride weekend celebrations.</p>

<p>Gotta make sure all of those 11 and 12 year old gays don&#39;t get gay meningitis while having gay sex with the gay men at the gay parade. </p>

<p>WAT? </p>

<p>The entire article is about meningitis infecting gay men and vaccinating them prior to the parade (you know , because it&#39;s just one massive &quot;they took our jobs&quot; gay orgy in the street) and then they switch gears to preadolescent boys. I don&#39;t see the connection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do see where my confusion came from, right? Also, there&#39;s no way that they would know that you are planning on reproducing unless you told them. I don&#39;t think this is a case of eugenics or population control in the sense of sterilization. However, others here have brought up some really good speculations..</p>
