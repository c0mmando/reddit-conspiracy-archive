       HIM, Beezlebub in this case appears to be named Sanofi Aventis...

       What if this was the story... "A Secret group of men in France invested in a vaccine program, and they say you are currently having an outbreak. They have put this clear liquid in a needle and say you should inject it into your veins to save your life."  How about then? Does the story sound a bit more..... suspect?

       Now at what point does belief become science for you? When a doctor tells you so?  Maybe my dear friend Beezlebub can have a talk with him... get him to believe in his clear vial of liquid... if I throw enough big words at the monkey trained to recognize big words.... maybe that will ellicit that happy feeling of doing well on a test, and he'll believe me...  and then he can spread his foolish belief.... just like a virus.

       You're gay. There's no need to give you any infertility drugs via a vaccine because they've already gotten to you through social engineering. Hell, maybe it was a vaccine when you were an infant/child. Maybe it was a cocktail of different chemicals that your mother had ingested/absorbed while pregnant with you. Maybe it's natural selection removing you from the gene pool because somewhere in your genome there's a defect (not the gay) that would harm future generations. Or, maybe you were just born that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, before the LGBT community comes down. on me for saying that, I just want to say that I have and have had gay friends, employees, and relatives (my ex-wife and current wife happen to be bisexual. The ex-mother-in-law is a lesbian and we suspect that her mother was also a lesbian as well). I say, no man or woman has a right to stop any other man or woman from pursuing what makes them happy without physically or intentionally hurting others. That is the meaning of Liberty and Freedom, and it's what this country has lost over the last 30 years and needs to find again, fast.

       You do see where my confusion came from, right? Also, there's no way that they would know that you are planning on reproducing unless you told them. I don't think this is a case of eugenics or population control in the sense of sterilization. However, others here have brought up some really good speculations..

       I did too. I really don't know what came over me that day. I refused it the last time they asked me, and this time they asked me over and over. It was a nice well-meaning lady and I didn't want to offend her. Blehhhhh. I'm usually very prinicipled and passionate about issues I care about. I have no idea how I let that happen.

       Wait... a vaccine targeted at gay men.... gosh it sounds so familiar..... so very familiar.... i'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever heard of a gay man getting meningitis? Nope? Me neither. Convinced by Beelzebub to get all up in your veins....
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me posit for you a question..... you're out with a beautiful young lady, sweet... caring... yall are having a great time and ya'll get a little silly and are on the cusp of continuing your good time in the nude.... do you at that point say
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hey pretty lady, I know we're having a good time.... but you see I got this label of mine. And This label says, that I'm not having a good time.... So not tonight you see.... this label means I can't have a good time....
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See most people don't let labels/words prevent them from enjoying themselves... and as a result.... men having been having intercourse with just about anything since the dawn of time. They are designed that way. So is selecting people for their self assigned "gayness" really all that scientific? Nope. So much for the science of this vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       What should actually be selected for is the amount of foreign DNA you allow into your blood stream.  Because that's where you actually have the chance of getting ill. Probably not from meningitis, since that is a pretty swift illness.... but hepatitis is reported to be common amongst those who have a lot of fluid exchanging intercourse (gay or straight) with a lot of different partners.  Basically, to be blunt, keep your mouth out of others asses and semen out of your butt babe.

        Fortunately, there’s a vaccine – the CDC recommends that all 11 and 12 year olds be vaccinated -- which is why the doctors decided to issue their warning, now, just before Gay Pride weekend celebrations.

       Gotta make sure all of those 11 and 12 year old gays don't get gay meningitis while having gay sex with the gay men at the gay parade.

      <p>
       WAT?

       The entire article is about meningitis infecting gay men and vaccinating them prior to the parade (you know , because it's just one massive "they took our jobs" gay orgy in the street) and then they switch gears to preadolescent boys. I don't see the connection.
