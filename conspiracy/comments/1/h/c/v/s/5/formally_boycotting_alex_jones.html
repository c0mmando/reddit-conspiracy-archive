       It's sad in a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones was the first person whose voice I heard speaking out against impending tyranny. I was raised in Austin and followed him since around 1997. When he predicted the 9/11 attacks he got my full attention. But like you I have grown to harbor negative feelings about his entire campaign. He is extremely religious. He reports on invalidated scenarios as facts. He is entirely too angry and aggressive. I have come to realize that he harms the search for truth far more than he helps it. He has become the bane of the truth movement. He is basically the Bill O'Reilly of conspiracy theories.....

       He warned of an impending terrorist attack and mentioned airliners as weapons and the World Trade Center as a target. Tried to get people to call the White House. This was in July. 2 months before the attacks.

       I'm sorry but not once in the video did he say World Trade Centre is a target.  He mentions WTC in the context of the bombing that happened some years before.    All he says is the government will stage terror attacks in the US, but its not hard for a conspiracy theorist to make that claim.

       Nowhere in this video does he predict anything. The airliners as weapons I'm pretty sure he's referring to northwoods which he still rambles on about to this day. When he mentions the WTC it's in context of the 93 bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't prediction, it's post-diction and its the bread and butter of his genius business plan. Warn of impending woes constantly, when anything at all happens weave it into your narrative like it was a prediction and then do your product plugs.

       I wouldn't mind his religiosity if he didn't come off as petulant. His tone and style of rhetoric, oddly enough, remind me of
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       . It has the ring of rigid and unquestioning dogma. I get the impression that he can't be bothered with trivial things like theology and the symbol of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the sake of comparison, when Bill Cooper said he was a Christian I took him far more seriously in his statement than Alex Jones. Bill Cooper studied the early church and read the Bible in context. When Bill said he was a Christian even the way he said it suggested that he'd actually spent some time on it. As where when Alex says it he sounds like he's on a TBN infomercial.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex will take a claim and then report it as fact. That's the opposite of journalistic integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       He does talk about real things often enough, but I no longer feel like filtering for his bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       O'Reilly is a good comparison.

       I agree with many of his positions in terms of being aware of what's going on.

       But he does nothing other than huck his water filters and T-shirts.

       I'd have more respect for him if he went to jail for his beliefs. He talks about the evils of The Feda and the banksters . . . and he takes frickin' VISA. I bet he pays Federal Income Taxes too. I don't think he's willing to put his money where his mouth is.

       He is at least working 6 days week since about 20 years, i think that shows how dedicated he is and put his money aswell in infowars.

       It isn't

       he says. It is the
       <em>

       he says it.  He makes every thing sound so apocalyptic. This isn't necessary. You would almost think he is going to keel over from high blood pressure. I much prefer the young fellow with the British accent. He is much easier to listen to. I don't feel the need to boycott infowars at all. I just don't like listening to Alex's hyper tone.

       I understand that. But surely the subject matter should speak for itself. He is, after all, dealing with heady topics. Not to mention that after all this time he is quite well known. I think it is time he progressed.

       Ok, let me get this straight.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        You appreciated that Alex Jones was right.
       </li>
       <li>
        you do not appreciate his personal style.
       </li>
       <li>
        you do not appreciate that his staff is unwilling to work for free
       </li>
       <li>
        You do not appreciate that he has to make ends meet, and in order to do so, he has to huck some products.
       </li>
       <li>
        You appreciate that he has not disappeared behind a paywall, much like Bill o Reilley
       </li>
       <li>
        You do not appreciate his tone.
       </li>
       <li>
        you do not appreciate the fact that he takes visa.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Ok, I get that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do not get is why that makes him bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, just in my view, purely personal, he has gone a bit snickers, but that does not mean much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, as a single person, appreciate that at least someone comes and says the really hard things, and takes whatever pains it needs to at least get them heard, including making himself look like a redheaded buffoon. I accept that even though he sometimes gets stark raving mad, even though it sometimes is a bit embarassing to hear god brought up in that kind of debate, I think it better that someone at least has that debate, then to have that kind of debate disappear entirely because you can't agree on a speaker.

       Well, maybe the problem is not with alex jones, it's with your way of explaining things? 
check for the following signs: 
- do you approach uninterested parties with news about catastrophic events in the near future? That cauises the gut reaction of questioning everything you said in their first response to you. 
"Dude, the banks are crashing, twinkies are extinct, and Steve Jobs performs in a tight leather combo for satan. RUN FOR THE HILLS!"
"well, my local credit union is doing well, I never liked junk food, and I happen to think that it is amazing that steve jobs came back from the dead, why must you hate everything?"

      <p>
       Instead, try to recognise that ignorance is bliss, and that most of the times, there is a basic human right to be ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, try listening to the conversations, and when they have a problem, or are wondering, interject with usefull information. That causes them to be totally stumped that what you said was actually relevant to their case, and will cause them to at least listen closely.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Try to talk calm, quiet, and a bit lower in volume then your other side. oldest troick in the book. Scream at someone like alex jones, and the first thing they do is shy away. Actually talk calm, nice and a bit quieter, and they have to strain to understand you, at least a bit, causing them to become more awake.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you happen to have proof of more dangerous stuff, layer your info. Think of it like talking to Reddit. 
12 page rant on reptilian lizzards infiltrating apple and switching their screens so they intentionally crack? Might be absolutely true, but the most likely response would be "op is a fagot" and "TL;DR"
Half a paragraph, that adresses the problem, and leaves the other people room to ask, and you keep that up for 12 pages? winning, most likely best thread of the year.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If nothing else helps, and they continue to yell: do not yell. Never show emotion. Just show them your nicest smile, while you picture them having their heads unscrewed by a band of hungry Zombie cannibals wearing apple nanos. Alex Jones yells, and pesters people. You drop actually relevant information, stop if they show no interest, are open for follow up questions, and are not afraid to change your viewpoint if someone gives you good enough arguments, all of that while politely smiling?

       He couldn't be more right. Every interview anyone else in his team does is better than him. They ask a question then let the person answer, something Alex is incapable of doing. He destroys most interviews.

       He's another "safe" conspiracy theorist like David Icke, easy to discredit and blames everything on the NWO or the royal family. Screaming truth in people's faces discredits your point to the mainstream but he can still say he told the truth to his followers, same as David Icke and holograms/lizards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of them are paid by the government in some way or another, they get higher page rankings on google, seem to pop up everywhere and are there to discredit truth. I'm watching one on twitter who covers up for paedophiles. When the conversation gets interesting he tries to divert it to aliens or some wiki leaks distraction.

       Came to this conclusion last week when a woman called into his show saying some kids of a specific race threw rocks at her car, and he said he would have run them over (and worse). Then he said some things about demons and the world becoming hell and such. I've listen to his show for a few reasons (mainly because its hard to get an analytical and contrary perspective on current events and history). But yeah turned it off that night and haven't listened since.

       Alex certainly is not perfect. The way i see it is that anyone doing anything is better than doing nothing. If you dont like the way AJ is doing it, then i would suggest getting out there and do it better yourself and stop being an armchair patriot.

       Just because I quoted someone else, does NOT make me a "sheep".  I do not listen to Alex Jones because I find him to be a raving lunatic that is so irrational, I wonder why he isn't institutionalized.  I was being nice by saying what I did, not a sheep, but nice.

       OP, your reasons are sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget that Agent Jones is COINTELPRO all the way and works for two MAJOR Zionists--George Friedman (CEO of STRATFOR) and Jeffrey Smulyan (CEO of Emmis 'Hebrew for Truth' Communications).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even a TINY bit of research into Jones shows the truth about him and why his CIA handlers/employers will NOT let him discuss Israel in a negative light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good on you OP. I have "boycotted" Agent Jones for over 13 years now and have been glad that I did--especially as more and more connections to intel agencies and Jones arise. I started "boycotting" him right around 2000, when Bill Cooper was very vocal about what a "bullshit artist" he was--and then, of course, because of his utterly ridiculous show on the eve of Y2K telling his audience that Russian ICBMs were inbound. I then realized that Agent Jones was "installed" in his position by people who wanted to marginalize the "conspiracy movement."
      </p>
      <p>
       He is nothing but classic disinformation--he feeds people
       <em>
        just enough
       </em>
       truth to sound credible--all while raving like a lunatic. Remember, Agent Jones IS the "face" that most people put on the "conspiracy movement."
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       how they planned it...it's a perfect set-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT/PS--I recommend everyone on here either try Shoutcast or one of the front ends for it such as XiaaLive on Android. You will find TONS of alternative programming by people who are not fear-mongering ZioSlaves. Personally, I
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       the "FreedomFeens" podcast--these guys are all about liberty and battling statism...and aren't controlled opposition like Agent Jones! It's a shameless plug but they are really good.

       Who is AJ's target audience? it's definitely not people that are awake. and I think that's who get's turned off by his show is the people that already know what he's preaching. I don't listen for the very same reason, because at this point I already know what he's gonna say before he says it and I've moved on.

       Alex is a carnival barker who makes money by bellowing. He is the mirror Bill OReilly, two of a kind.  Both are toxic and damage democracy just as a cockroach can crawl on clean food and ruin it with contamination.

       It almost seems like he's a misinformation agent.  By feeding the public fear he's easily drawing attention away from the real issues.  He went on someone's show pretty recently, did his shpeel and then when the cameras cut, everyone claimed he dropped the act.  Not buying it.

       Histrionics is what made Jones... so he's never going to stop that (at least 75% of his airtime is spent just him ranting... THAT is what his show is about, him ranting). Also, people say they don't want histrionics and then they tune in because they secretly like watching the histrionics.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day Jones is running a business and his end goal is to make MONEY. That's why every YouTube video he does is littered with ad segments pushing his products.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all though the world is better with people like Jones doing their thing because at least it makes open discussion about a lot of topics more prevalent in society.

       Alex Jones is simply the stepping stone, hes the guy that gets your feet wet. You'd normally listen to him for maybe a month before you find other sources to get information from then you realize that he's just a fear pusher. I don't support his approach as I believe he his the perfect stereotype of what society deems a conspiracy theorist, at the same time though it works for him the and intellect he wants to attract and hold. Often when people mention him I will suggest others to go to and explain how he's just for "beginners".

       I doubt this sub would even exist without him. Or be 1/10th the size. Overall he does good waking people, I don't think anyone hangs on his coat tails for long after they awaken. Once you get as far as the Zionists you are done with A.J.

       Even controlled opposition gives up a piece of usable information every once in a while to keep up their base.
