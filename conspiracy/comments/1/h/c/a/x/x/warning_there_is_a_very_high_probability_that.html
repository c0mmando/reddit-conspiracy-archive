       Their logo, which came from "IRC" volunteers (who first spread their image around the MSM and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       presented it to the subreddit), is widely suspected to be
       <strong>
        an anus joke.

       The image was undeniably
       <em>
        soundly rejected
       </em>
       by the users and yet it's now plastered
       <em>
        everywhere
       </em>
       on that subreddit and being used in the corporate media. The implied symbolism behind this spread anus image being:
       <em>
        "Hey government/police, come sodomize us! We're prostrating ourselves for you!"
       </em>
      </p>

       I tried to address my concerns about this with the head moderator, an account created just prior to creating the sub (it could be any of the other mods alt account) and was promptly
       <strong>
        banned
       </strong>
       for doing so.

       Examine Kuwait circa 1950 and the CIA protocols for 'controlled demolition'. Always remember that the intelligence community will circumvent opposition by introducing support channels they control. You can call me paranoid but this is just SOP. The reason for doing it is pretty simple: It's a lot easier to control people by supporting them and then directing the thing that they're supporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       One does not joust with the best minds in social engineering without a healthy dose of skepticism. It is their job to mislead you and they are good at it. If you think you're paranoid then you're then you're observing the wrong person; you're not the one you should be concerned about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monitor primary users, word choice, message consistency, reaction time, primary participation windows, speech patterns. No one is operational and high functioning 24 hours a day on one account. Most people write with their own syntax and it will be clear if multiple people are operating one key activist. This will help you spot a damage control team and let you know you're being mislead. If you need a real world example then I'll refer you to Tatsuma who haunted/haunts a website called Fark.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ironic but if you see anyone that seems like a savior, don't trust them. Vet them as best you can. Snoop, check post history, evaluate writing style from a few random samples and remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Not that these are amateurs but it's unlikely a damage control team is prepared for someone running counter intelligence. They assume you're cattle to be herded and that's the one advantage we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing...be subtle. First off, you could be wrong and there's no reason to start a fox hunt over a squirrel. Second, this is the most advanced intelligence agency on the planet. Their hungover C game will eat your A game for lunch. Don't give them a reason to get serious unless you have to and never, ever make it personal. They're just doing their jobs...and you really won't like what happens if you become their hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not playing forum whack-a-mole for right or wrong; this is your future we're talking about. Your freedoms and basic human rights. Stay sharp, think through what anyone says as to where it's going next, not what it's saying. Ask questions and take notes. Set your ego aside, play for the endgame and play to win.

       I saw pacified draftees in Viet Nam change in a matter of minutes.  All it takes is the right stimulus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest problem will be containment after todays pacified are stimulated by too much of governments attempts to control everything.  The government feels compelled to proceed, steady as she goes, but that is a house of cards based on fear and intimidation.  Things work until they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government workers who are trying to control, within the Internet,  are being exposed to the truth and that will change their views and opinions even when they won't say so. Learning the truth will separate their  hearts from their orders.  They will obey their orders in a half assed manner and not be on the governments side when push comes to shove.  The governments underpaid workers are not stupid enough to not be persuaded by the truth.

       I disagree. Vietnam was, again, in another time. People are much more pacified now. All of your talk about fear and intimidation, and "things will work until they don't" - you don't think the manipulators know that? They know EXACTLY what it takes for people not to riot amd seriously rebel. They've only hundreds and hu.dreds of years of observation for it, the passed 100 of critical note, and the manufactured Arab Spring which was greatly beneificial to them to study.

       for all the governments talk of 'security' and defending of it, one of the prime reasons for 'govt' is stability and resource allocation, when 'govt' fails in that, as it almost did in 2008 with the financial crisis and govt's role in bringing it about by allowing the wall street crooks to disembowel mainstreet.

       Don't assume that the people will just "riot and burn everything down" if things start shutting down.  There's a possibility the people caould come together and organize themselves into a unit that works for its own betterment while simultaneously fighting against the controlling PTB.

Hell, finding out that there is a GREAT likelihood that factions inside the very government of the United States killed over 3,000 people on September 11th hasn't done it, so what on Earth would make you think that revealing something as piddly as mere "information" would cause everyone to get up?

       Somehow, every part of what you just said seems unrealistic.  I don't think the population's been completely convinced about the truth of 9/11, and I don't think the government slaughtering people on national television is necessary for us to change the system.  I think this NSA thing is the first thing that's really struck home since the 70's, and I think people are still scrambling to get a grip on what it means, but can tell the government's explanations are bullshit.  So I don't really see this ending in anything

       Of course not.  Part of the point of the statement that I made regarding 911 necessarily involves the acknowledging that many
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       are under such a deep sense of denial that they simply refuse to believe the truth about 911.  That's why I said that if something like 911 didn't wake us up enough to act (and it didn't), then finding out about any NSA surveillance, etc certainly won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing unrealistic about that assessment.  That's just putting two and two together and reaching the logical conclusion.

       (great big if) the population in the U.S. wake up enough to protest en mass like in Bahrain, Egypt, or any of the other countries presently going through major citizen revolts (which is
       <em>
        awesome
       </em>
       ), then what will likely happen is that the U.S. police or armed forces will simply begin attacking the citizenry.  It will be like what's happening in many of these other countries, but on a much grander scale.  So as far as "non violent revolution" goes?  Sheeeit.  TPTB in the U.S. will see to it that it becomes
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       violent, because they'll start shooting civilians after a short while, and the citizenry will likely start fighting back - shooting back, since we still have

       Of course it does.  To someone who's in so much abject denial that they're going to ignore all the truth relating to what really happened during 911, I promise you they can come up with a good reason to excuse what the NSA is doing.  The fact that the truth about the NSA is out and yet the people of this country are not

       up in arms and TOO pissed off about it is pretty good indication that what I'm saying is being proven right.

       All this is to say that 1) maybe you haven't been paying anywhere near as much attention as you think you have, and 2) we're actually on the same side and are ultimately not really disagreeing with one another that much.  We both have the same end goal, I feel.  We just have different perspectives on what will happen in order for it to be reached is all.

       They haven't heard an argument that was convincing enough to get them to change their viewpoint.  Willful ignorance plays a role as well, but the stronger the ignorance, the stronger the argument to convince somebody away from it is required.

       The people will revolt, and it will not be a violent revolt.  The police will not retaliate unless frightened, because a clearly peaceful protest simply does not evoke the necessary environment to allow them to personally justify retaliation - even agents provocateur will not be able to incite violence.  There's a point where these tactics simply stop working.

       That shouldn't necessarily be the case though.  A solid argument is a solid argument regardless of one's personal need to have it be "more convincing" for them or not.  Somebody saying "I need
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       ...something
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       ." to the overwhelming evidence that already exists is simply, like you said, willful ignorance.  It's abject denial.  That's not a fault in the least of the argument "not being strong enough".  It's a fault of the individual not being
       <em>
        intelligent
       </em>
       enough.

       But the thing with what the NSA is doing, however, is that it can
       <em>
        easily
       </em>
       be ignored because it doesn't have any immediate, direct, and
       <em>
        discernible
       </em>
       effect on the individual.  Even if the sheeple are told they're being monitored, it really doesn't matter if you keep the bread and circus, dog and pony show of daily tv/job/money distractions going to keep their/our minds off it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not doing anything wrong, then you've got nothing to worry about with getting monitored right?  That's how many think, so it allows for a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       willfully ignorant mentality.

       That couldn't be more wrong, as has already demonstrably been shown by the peaceful protests that have taken place throughout the country and that have been met by things like

       You wrote a full page about how you think revolution is impossible.   You don't see that as "demoralizing people"?   i gave you some pretty concise counterarguments, but you kept dragging the discussion the way you wanted it to go, which was plainly wrong, so I disengaged.

       Every valid question or criticism is met with responses by new accounts assuring everything checks out via a private chat they had or a phone call.
They are deleting threads and comments that bring out these points. KingContext began calling them out when the logo selection process was underway.

       Why would Reddit allow a scam like this to be run through Reddit?
Anyone donating or buying merch from these people is paying to disclose their identities.

       I seem to rermember that old BetYou is Gramps or Herk, forgot which. Either way being warned by any of these two is as creepy as being told by John Wayne Gacy that he was some nice candy at his house.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, that crowd currently is big on setting up honeypots, false opposition, and other dirty tricks. If it's just a hobby for kicks, they're just sick fucks. And if they're not mentally ill and it's a pro effort, well, it shows how desperate the jackboots are getting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Admiral Ackbar said "it's a trap'. BipolarBear is a mod there, that ought to tell you a lot since he just finished bragging about the honeypot trap for racists he set up, then invited a number of people to comment in. Seems to be the 'in' game fad among the ctard crowd.

       "Restore an arbitrary protection afforded to us in a document that's designed to justify our oppression."
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it's controlled opposition.  It's ideologically boxed itself in as an appeal from a slave to a master.  This thing has been idiotic from day one - we need to abolish "government" and bring "society" to a state of peace and natural harmony, not keep fiddling with this bullshit system they built to control us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our rights are meaningless as long as police and militaries exist, because their very existence means that people are being brainwashed into  being insane killers and thugs - led away from remembering what it actually means to respect life.  After all, that's what you have to forget to be a cop or a soldier.   The belief that things like murder and theft are acceptable, once sanctioned by the legal system the Constitution spawned - that's the entire point of documents like that.    It's a whole system of insanity, and "Restore the Fourth" is about accepting and strengthening the cornerstone of all of that insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with a real appreciation of the problem knows we need to just abandon this entire framework of belief.  Wrong is wrong, and people doing wrong is like a wildfire that starts with the "government", because the belief that their thugs start off with is the belief that "law and order" result from them committing crimes like murder and imprisonment.

       Hopefully, the real spirit of Restore the 4th will make the inside joke of the flag completely meaningless. If the movement gains ground and makes more people aware of the impending tyranny that will confront them in the near future, then we will have the last laugh.

       The op is too well thought out, with it's properly bolded words and insight on the matter.

       I agree.  People in this sub are blowing off steam because
       <a href="/u/bipolarbear0">
        /u/bipolarbear0
       </a>
       was posting racist content in this sub so that he could tell everybody how racist this sub was.  He went through a lot of trouble to discredit this sub and then tried to play it off like a joke.  The fact that he went through so much trouble makes people here suspicious of him and anything he is involved in.  I haven't made up my mind one way or the other about his motives, mostly because I don't give a fuck.  So in a nutshell there you have it.  It is all nonsense, its a worthy cause, one dipshit is derailing it, whether its intentional or not is up to you to decide.

       Nope.  That won't do it in the
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       .  Hell, finding out that there is a GREAT likelihood that factions inside the very government of the United States killed over 3,000 people on September 11th hasn't done it, so what on Earth would make you think that revealing something as piddly as mere "information" would cause everyone to get up?
      </p>
      <p>
       No way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the only thing that would do it is if the military and/or police started going door to door and shooting and killing everyone - men, women, and children (especially children) - and it was all televised 24/7 for all to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do you think the chances are of that happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep.  Zero.
