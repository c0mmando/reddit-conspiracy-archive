       First Off, I want to say that I really am confused at how there aren’t more people talking about this (“This” being Snowden as a distraction). I understand that a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of new people have joined into this sub as a result of the NSA leak, and that many are excited that “our beliefs are confirmed” (Even though, for those who actually looked into this stuff there really was little “belief”, mostly just alignment with the facts), but shit guys, it’s been 3 weeks and
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       half of our submissions are about Snowden. Our sub is clogged with rehashes of the same article, or new, little
       <em>
        drops
       </em>
       of info on the case when we've already known most of this stuff for a decade, (Just a few:

       ), The only thing new being the manhunt, reality-TV-drama that the mainstream turns
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       into, yet everyone is freaking out like this info is new.

      <p>
       <strong>
        Do you really think that TPTB would waste such a great opportunity to keep everyone, even the communities who generally pay very close attention, distracted?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on guys, use your brains; Remember how Aurora happened the day of (or maybe the day before or after) the first big release of all the HSBC stuff? And then how Sandy Hook happened right at the time of the second release? How during the Boston Bombing CISPA and the gun control bill almost slipped by under the radar (seems with each major event more and more is getting released, potentially to utilize the media black out as long as possible) ? We all got distracted for the first few days, yes, but we soon came to our senses and started talking about what was slipping by under our noses (Please note: I am not saying that these were false flags, there is not nearly enough evidence to claim definitively that they were. There is more than enough evidence to be suspicious, and to desire further investigation, something we all know isn’t going to happen, but that is besides the point. Whether they were orchestrated or just abused, they had the same effect in regards of distractions). All that happened was they refined their tactic; They released information (or allowed the release of information) that we
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       care about (and released a whole lot more at once); Stuff that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a very big deal to us (Not to say that the lives of the people lost in these other events were not important, but putting the alleged perpetrates on the news for 24 hours a day 7 days a week, blocking out all other news, was not the way to mourn them). But we need to at least multi task guys!

       Now, maybe I haven’t convinced you of all this (I'm not 'convinced' either), but I hope I
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       have  made you think that maybe having our entire sub just a mirror of
       <a href="/r/politics">

       </a>
       , going on 3 weeks now, is not the best thing, and hopefully have intrigued you enough to look into this further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I would ask:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Please, If you see the same old shit about Snowden, down vote it, or at least don’t upvote it, but do upvote the things which seem important yet are not getting attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Go into the new/controversial tab or a couple pages deep and upvote the good posts who are getting downvoted/not getting attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Repost any of the links listed here (or of any other topic) which you think require more attention that they are getting.

       Yup. What started out as a whistleblowing (orchestrated by TPTB or not) has now turned into a reality drama called, "catch the spy". I have been noticing the huge amounts of Snowden related articles being posted to this sub and other related ones, meanwhile shit like the Immigration Reform bill is getting 0 notice, despite the huge uproar we caused when we heard about the biometric database.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be just another example of how easily our conversations and discussions can be shaped by the flow of information. Keep us inundated and distracted by the left hand, meanwhile the right hand is engineering our demise.

       ...and will continue to post this link over and over and over again with every so called "news" story on reddit that involves Snowden.
