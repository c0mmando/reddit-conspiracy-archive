        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a ton to go on here, but I have noticed something quite interesting about my front page during the past few weeks of the NSA scandal.</p>

<p>When I say my &quot;front page&quot;, I am talking about the amalgamated content that is displayed when I go to reddit.com and login to my account. This &quot;front page&quot; is of course a dynamic entity, fluctuating based on each user&#39;s subscribed subreddits. </p>

<p>So, now to the inconsistency I have seen repeated time and time again.</p>

<p>I am subscribed to very few subreddits on this account, my front page currently looks like <a href="http://i1.minus.com/ibctMiwz5e1sgX.png">this</a>. </p>

<p>The most upvoted post stands at 456 and 7 hours old from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>However, if we go into <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> we&#39;ll see that I am <a href="http://i5.minus.com/if1fwd1JEQWfp.png">indeed subscribed to that subreddit</a> and that the top post stands with 1558 upvotes on 7 hours old.</p>

<p>Now this is but one instance of a pattern that I have noticed, which is that stories from larger subreddits about the NSA story have been allowed to remain at the top of their respective subreddits (to appear neutral?) but the posts are not amalgamated into the front page of a user who is subscribed to those subreddits.</p>

<p>What I have also noticed is that a highly upvoted post from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> will be displayed on my amalgamated front page if the content has not been NSA related.</p>

<p>I submit this only to ask; has anyone else experienced the same phenomena while subscribed to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> over the past few weeks? Could this perhaps be a subtle mechanism by which reddit inc is controlling content dissemination?</p>

<p>Just for thought.</p>

<p>*Update 10:53 AM EST; would you look at that, 40 minutes after this post <a href="http://i7.minus.com/iXkmovwWvB8iS.png">my front page has changed</a> and now includes the post from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (now standing at 2284 on 8 hours old)! One time glitch or a pattern revealed? I will have to continue my observations for a larger sample size of data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying they have a back door literally (although they probably do for data retrival purposes, I don&#39;t think they could actually manipulate content from a server side entry point. But yes, Eglin airforce base is certainly used for MISO) however, I may be implying that the US government (or a faction thereof) may be a client of a PR firm whose owner happens to be a reddit administrator ;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the recent NSA and related disclosures, it is obvious to anyone who isn&#39;t completely lost in space that social media is being manipulated.  Money can buy you a lot of things and one of the most useful things is a multitude of voices saying what you want them to say.  Look at the Tea Party via the Koch brothers for an excellent example.</p>
