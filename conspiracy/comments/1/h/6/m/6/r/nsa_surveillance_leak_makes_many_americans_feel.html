<p>What is one thing the people in power would love for us to do?  Give up!  They want us to just give up on dissenting, voting, protesting, rioting, occupying, etc.  </p>

<p>This whole NSA leak is just one more thing that shows Americans they have no control over what the government is doing, no matter who is in office, who is in charge.  The Government is driving this point home with all of this propaganda -- the sentiment all over is that we cannot stop them.  THIS IS NOT TRUE!</p>

<p>Talk to people, convince them that we are not powerless.  We can put us, the American people back in charge of this country -- but we have to do it together, UNITED.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But we&#39;re not. As individuals we are completely powerless, and they know that. As long as they can keep us divided, keep us separate keep us quiet, subservient, they will have utter domination of all mankind. It is through this that ALL humanity, not just Americans, but all of humanity has to realize the gross injustice that is taking place around the world at the hands of a very select few people. Once the world wakes up to this, power will be ours again. The only question is, we will realize it too late?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said the other day, this reminds me heavily of the Boston Bombing where the military/police was going door to door performing warrantless searches and pulling families from their homes.  No one did anything about it: they just let it happen in the guise of security.  Now we have someone saying &quot;Everything you say or do is unconstitutionally recorded and kept on file to be used against you.  Oh, and there are much worse things being planned by your elected officials.&quot;  Yet half the population is saying &quot;if you have nothing to hide you shouldn&#39;t care.&quot;  You have politicians clamoring for this whistleblower&#39;s head on a platter and no one is doing a damn thing about it.  I think they&#39;ve proven their point again: they can do or say anything they want, and the people will just sit and watch.</p>

<p>the establishment already have such a stranglehold that the question above is moot</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been setting this up for years.  Hollywood has peoples&#39; minds so accepting of any idea that happens in reality, and many of them feel that someone else will come along and solve their problems.  We&#39;re sedentary, fat, lazy, busy, and tired.  I can&#39;t tell you how many people I know who complain about never having any money, but they spend every cent they get on useless material possessions.  Nearly everyone is on some prescription medication.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t argue with that. A demoralized population is much easier to govern - you don&#39;t have to expend resources on force when all you have to do is invoke authority.</p>

<p>What most people don&#39;t seem to have quite realized is is that resist or don&#39;t resist, the line ends at the slaughterhouse... So you lose nothing, at least, by putting up a fight. And the more people do it together, the less worth it it is to these so-called authorities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The greatest irony with the government is that they actually have no power. </p>

<p>If everyone suddenly decided to stop paying their taxes, the government would collapse instantly. They couldn&#39;t throw 350 million Americans in jail after all. Not to mention, the police and jail staff are all Americans also. </p>

<p>Where the government gets its power though is by pitting groups against each other. Rich vs poor, black vs white, democrats vs republicans, etc. </p>

<p>The governments power lies in the populations division against itself. </p>

<p>So until people &#39;wake up&#39; nothing will change and it will only get worse. </p>
