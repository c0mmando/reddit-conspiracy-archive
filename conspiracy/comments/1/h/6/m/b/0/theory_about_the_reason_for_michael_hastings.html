        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay this is my theory and I&#39;ve provided links at the bottom, so my theory is that Michael Hastings was assassinated because he was about to expose that the real reason that David Petraeus resigned as Director of the CIA is because he &amp; the Obama Administration disagreed on major operational procedure expected from Petraeus as Director of the CIA. Petraeus wrote in his own book that he almost resigned as war commander in Afghanistan over Obama&#39;s decision to draw down the amount of troops there and all of the surge troops [1]. I think that Michael Hastings was about to expose that the FBI used secret NSA surveillance to record all of Petraeus&#39;s conversations and use his extramarital affair to blackmail him thereby reigning in the CIA&#39;s secret agenda somewhat. He emailed his loved ones that he was working on an important story and that he had to go under the radar and disappear because he suspected that the FBI was following him mere hours before his death [2]. Hastings also contacted Wikileaks&#39; lawyer regarding the possible FBI tail that was intimidating him [3], of course the FBI has since come forward and formally denied the charge that they were following Hastings [4]. The media has been  reporting that Hastings was working on the Jill Kelley story, Jill Kelley was the woman that was having the extramarital affair with Petraeus, but Hasting&#39;s widow has since come forward and said that Hastings work was not focused on Jill Kelley [5]. Evidence that the FBI, NSA, and Obama Administration were working in unison to archive all of Petraeus&#39;s conversations to blackmail him into reigning in the CIA or engage in covert ops under the order of the Administration is pretty damning to say the least. It would be the type of explosive proof needed to create a groundswell of anger against the NSA surveillance state that exists apparently to use everyone&#39;s personal lives against them in effect making the Administration omniscient extortionists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brennan is basically an extension of the White House; he conducted drone strikes and kill ops with POTUS in the building on the day to day for years. Petraeus has his own clout, he could have run for president one day. He&#39;s the hero general, who has more experience and operational control with security strategy. So, basically by ending Petraeus&#39;s career he eliminates a potential threat, and strong arms his guy into the CIA (which since it has been granted lethal authority has become a very powerful paramilitary force, to rival that of conventional forces under the Joint Chiefs). If you think about it, the NSA thing could also be a power play by Brennan, if he wanted to hamstring a rival agency and keep his prints off it, well... the leaks we&#39;ve seen would be perfect.</p>

<p>I really want to know what the story was that he was on, but there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s convinced me that it was about Petraeus </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a highly plausible scenario, thank you.</p>

<p>Of course whoever did kill Hastings has some &quot;protection&quot; from the fact that Hastings had many different enemies, for different reasons - the military, The White House, Hillary Clinton etc. The final story may well be the key.</p>

<p>It may help us to determine whether he was murdered for:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) retribution (for previous revelations),<br/></li>
<li>2) as a prophylactic (to prevent him revealing further damning information) or </li>
<li>3) as a deterrent (to scare off other investigative journalists)</li>
</ul>

<p>...or perhaps a combination thereof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are close. </p>

<p>I tend to believe that Petraeus was involved with Libya and the smuggling of guns and jihads into Syria, Via Turkey and Jordan and he was also running death squads in Iraq.</p>

<p>You can look up the documentary that has information on the deaths squads in Iraq lead by him and some other general that was in Nicaragua doing the same thing in the 80&#39;s</p>

<p>Michael Hastings was more than likely killed, for trying to expose someone and some lie. </p>

<p>it&#39;s all speculation. </p>

<p>The affair seemed like a front, so he could step down and not deal with the death squad issue and the Libyan issue. That is all </p>

<p>Libya was about jihads and guns into turkey. Someone found out where the CIA location was in Libya and killed everyone there to send a message. Maybe Iran, Syria, Russia or even Gaddafi Loyalists. </p>

<p>You are on the gossip shit. Back away and se the bigger picture. This is all about the coming war for Iran</p>
