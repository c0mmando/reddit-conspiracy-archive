       Boiled down, freedoms and privacy are gone. The Constitution really
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       just a piece of paper. When are people going to wake to the fact that the Government has been lying through their teeth for 50 years ?. They tell the truth about nothing. They "classify" everything in the name of "national security" (which actually means
       <em>
        Government
       </em>
       security).
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK/RFK killings, 9/11, Watergate, the Federal Reserve Bank, any war...all lies. The list is almost endless.
      </p>
      <p>

       Yes and no. The more you (we) learn the more "they" know they need to create something to focus our anger etc on.
      </p>
      <p>
       To them, we (us) are just pockets to raid. We pay the money, do the menial tasks to support "their" games. Those games - using your (our) military (and lives) to pillage a nation for X reason has been going on since forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its no different today than it was when the Pope ordered Richard to send the army into Palestine to retrieve a mythical wooden cup.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pope got 4 things - More subjects - more power - a kingdom and a King.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing more ordinary than a psychopath / sociopath in power, be it under cloth or under oath that he would not impoverish someone to gain power over them. In that case he Turned England into a pre industrial ghetto, devoid of an army, devoid of wealth, devoid of economy. He gained a nation of the poorest of people, sold them a fairy god story then nickel and dimed them all. He also got power of a king, power over the nation and used them to pillage loot from the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the men thought they were looking for Gods cup.. A noble cause..

       I don't think they really want enslavement. I don't think they really care that much about us to enslave us. Also that opens up too much opportunity for revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they want is unchecked power and secrecy. Those are the tools to give them the ability to do as they please, when they please.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've got us right where they want us, really. There's enough freedom for people for both people and government to do as they please. Because of that, most people's lives really aren't impacted enough to care about the actions of the government. The US Military droned a 10 year old, but does your neighbor really give a shit? As long as they have a house, a car in the driveway, electricity/TV/internet at their disposal, food at the grocery store, and a job, probably not.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, the US government has too many guns and weapons to be overthrown, by anyone. Any person, group, or country would fail in their efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as long as they keep you in your box, they want to be left alone in their box. I think that's what this is really about.

       I´m curious... do you really feel this way? I am from Germany and to me it feels like the level of obviousness that something is going wrong has never been this high, probably because of the expiration date on the financial system. Maybe it´s just because I never really started looking for alternative sources when getting my news, but to me it feels more like a mix of that and the fact that things really are getting more obvious. 
So yeah has it always been this obvious? And have I missed something about the UK? Feels like most big things originate in the US..

      <p>
       The us government can be overthrown, look to the russian bread riots and the Ptomken (spelling?) for historical basis -- the reason being, there are fellow americans holding the rifles, they will put there guns down after the first couple massacres. At least, if history repeats itself. But violence is not always needed to overthrow a government, look to Gahndi in India and Egypt during the Arab Spring - the violence upon the protesters caused outrage among even those within the government; egypt was not forcfully overthrown, it imploded.

       None of these countries shares more than one or two significant similarities with any other of the listed countries.   Culture, government, demographics, economy, ideology, geography, all very, very different.

       I mean to a certain extent, yes people are people and governments are governments but that's only on a very superficial level, and to imply otherwise would seem to suggest an extremely oversimplistic view of the world

       The Government is still elected officials, just people. Not saying they don't have the system pretty locked down but at the end of the day we elected them, we can just as easily un-elect them next time around. The problem really lies with how much of the message they control. But we pretty much let them take advantage of that as well.

       In theory they can un-elected, yes indeed. It has been my observation over the years that rarely offers an actual solution. I suspect this is because of the system (for lack of a better phrase) in place that seems to affect the individuals (exceptions notwithstanding, or course). Because if simply un-electing them was the answer, then why has the problem persisted for more then 6 decades ?

       I think it's because the general populace is not aware of, or not willing to confront, the problem. They're comfortable or scared or (like my grandparents for instance) they believe the story being fed to them (communism is bad. Terrorists are everywhere. Different people are scary). I don't know now it coincides with the timeframe you're setting though. Maybe television?

       Yes, Television does play a major role in this. How much of all this was the case before World War II (ie.. before TV became big time) ? TV has had a profound effect on society, mostly negative since about 1948 or so. It has not been all bad, of course. But on the whole TV does indeed live up to its name of "idiot box". The general populace is aware of only what TV makes them aware of. If you get your information about the world
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       from TV then your world view is skewed. The Ruling Elite know this. So do the advertisers.

       Quite true. But the US Government has many people who have been part of the Government for a long time. There has developed a system where the whole is greater then the sum of the parts. Just as a car has many individual powerless parts, when properly assembled becomes almost a life form in its own right. Same with the Government. It has a culture, if you will, that is far greater then any individual. It is this culture that is the issue, not the individuals.

       No, the US government is quite fragmented and disorganized. That's why it fails at everything so much. Lack of communication coupled with an ease of getting distracted and a lust of money produces a government unable to accomplish anything in the civil realm, and having agencies more capable of doing anything they want without any oversight. How often do you imagine the CIA, FBI, NSA, or anybody else actually talks to their congressional oversights? We already know from recent news that even if they did talk with them, they're probably lying when they do. God only knows what they tell the president to get him on board.

       This assembly is hardly like a car, and it would be a miracle if it got even remotely close to 25% of efficient mileage. It's a cancer. The gears don't work, and keep producing new gears that don't fit, so the engine goes no where. But fuck, the asshole driving it keeps pouring more gas into it, so it just keeps trying, bursting into flame on occasion, and exploding a time or two as well. All it can do is puke CO2 and blast out heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is nonfunctional. Its agencies are their own governments in their own right. Its elected representatives don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminds me a lot of the Foundation Series. A book in which a galactic empire became so nonfunctional, that it's own agencies began running the show as micro governments, with the imperial court becoming a pile of rocks on a ruined planet, with an incompetent king unable to see the fact that what he sees as his on the map, no longer operates as his in reality.

       It's sad because usually what happens is that the military replaces its leadership at that point, as you see in Egypt today. But our military has been so thoroughly bred into submission that it can't happen at this time.

       Well, the OBVIOUS fraud is right there for all to see in the statistics!
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering that you are EIGHT times more likely to be killed by a cop than an "act of terror" (and let's face it, the real number is FAR higher because this stat not only includes those murdered on 9/11, but is very ambiguous on the meaning of "act of terror") I can only see the draconian measures the ZOG has taken post-911 as blatantly unnecessary. Take away 9/11 and you would probably be more likely to hit the Powerball 5x over the course of a lifetime than to fall victim to a "terrorist" (either domestic or foreign).
      </p>
      <p>

       The worst part is that the terrorists don't want to take away our freedom and privacy, they just want to be left alone, and to extract our forces from the holy lands (which was the original reason for 9/11 to begin with).  If we would stop meddling in their affairs they wouldn't even bother us.

       Think about it - what motive do they have to lie?  The whole point of the attacks was to punish us for what we are doing to them, and draw attention to the issue.  What's the point of orchestrating a complex terrorist attack to further a cause, and then throw up a smokescreen to divert attention away from their true grievances?  Our government on the other hand has done everything it can to hide the true motives behind 9/11 behind this veil of secrecy.  If you asked the average american why they attacked us I bet most would claim the terrorists hate our freedom or they think our society is too sexually liberal or some other nonsense, these are the truly ignorant people, the kind of people our gov't wants.

       So that is as far as you think of it?  You think of human beings with guns and you expect them to shoot on you if you were try and make change?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is not reason enough to RISK something and create change rather than living like a slave kinda/sorta?  Then I don't know what is.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Kill your apathy.  With EVERYONE together in solidarity.....you won't even hear a gun shot.  They'll know the people are serious.

       You speak like no action should be taken ever because....DA BULLITZ!!

       Think beyond that.  Live and breathe for what is right and TALK like it or die like a dog waiting to be put down by his owners.  It's becoming a real choice that you will have to deal with.

       I disagree. We are NOT the government. Just because we elected officials into office does not mean we were the ones who compelled them to lie and deceive us on a massive scale. Laws still get passed without the consent of citizens at times. Is that also our fault? I agree it is our responsibility to change it, but to say it is our fault because we were essentially tricked is silly. Besides, when it comes to some voting options, the choice does not really matter because you are just picking one side of the same coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have yet to elect anyone to lead me, honestly. I have not voted in ONE politician. I believe anyone has the potential to become corrupt when given certain powers. Maybe we are guilty of not realizing this sooner and keeping better tabs on it, that I agree with fully. But it is not like we willingly choose people who campaign to take away our rights. They lie to us and deceive us. If anything we were tricked. Which, I guess, is technically still our fault, but you can't really blame people for not knowing what is going on in other people's heads.

       In my mind we are unfortunately in a lose/lose situation. We do nothing we slowly lose our freedoms. We do anything we become the enemy. There is a proper way to approach this but it will take a lot of time and tact.

       Because these are the 1% who have the most to lose. The system only benefits their profit and control. The better question is If you had that power, what would it take to take it from you?

       The end is a global system of information control. The average person will have little real choice, an illusion of democracy and security, and no real way to enact change. I call it a global dictatorship.

       There is nothing sad about that.  We are just behind the ball that's all.  Don't make it sound like we're totally fucked.  We're only fucked when we give up.

       Informing and molding minds back to their former glory is a lot to do.  It is hugely doable.  Once people see they are directly affected, that they have been the target all along.....they will make efforts and we will have it back.

       Honestly, I think that is just a shallow way to look at it. I am sure if people knew of a way to make change that would actually work, they would. I also feel that we aren't very organized at all. I mean... look at all the stupid, insignificant shit we still argue about on a daily basis.

       Well, radical Islamists
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       believe that Western civilization and individual freedoms are un-Islamic and, in the eyes of radical Islamists, anyone who doesn't agree with them is no longer a Muslim and should be killed. There has been much speculation on the reason Osama and his few friends (literally like 5 guys, tops, unlike the 'global terror network' our government has portrayed it as) plotted to attack the WTCs (They didn't actually go through with it; why they didn't attempt I am not sure), however I really am up in the air on which one is the truth (if any). Radical Islamists definitely
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       hate freedom (at least to my understanding), and radical islamists (a small subsection of the middle eastern population) do hate America because it's materialism and individualism and lack of belief in anything is the source of that penetrating into the middle east—they want their countries to be filled with religious fervor and focus in God and committment under one leader to follow God's will (or something along those lines).  So, again to my understanding, the words that 'they hate us for our freedom' isn't really untrue However, they have never attacked us, they are not coordinated (Most radical islamist groups, even people within groups, will kill eachother because they have differing opinions and thus are unislamic infidels), they are a tiny subsection of the middle eastern populations,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       they don't care that we are 'free' (note, again that freedom to them means our consumerist culture, not our bill of rights), they just don't want it to corrupt their countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is all as I understand it so far, The level of disinformation, warped views, and everything else is so excessive that it is almost impossible to be sure of anything when it comes to the 'real' history unless you literally devote your life to it, but hopefully this helps to answer your question.

       How does freedom and privacy in America prevent them from doing that? America can still export Hangover movies even if it's not free and doesn't have privacy. We can still monkey with their governments, prop up military dictatorships, whatever. Freedom and privacy have nothing to do with that.

       It's kind of hard to explain because the truth and the lie are so close to each other that it gets difficult to make clear which is truth and which is not, but basically:
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't. I'm sure they're rejoicing that the evil American empire is falling into a police state, however the key things that they hate are still here—consumerism and materialism and thus lack of conviction for what is 'important' (they believe it is God). So in a way, the 'they hate us for our freedom' slogan isn't entirely untrue, however it is being manipulated thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't reitterate enough, that they have never attacked us (or at least not nearly to the extent that those in power would have us to believe). While the plot to fly planes into the WTC buildings
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       originally Bin Laden's idea, it was not committed by him or any 'terrorist group'—it was committed by those in power who control our government to fuel this endless war on terrorism and keep us afraid of a foreign enemy (when the true 'terrorists' are the ones in control of our own government).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I cannot reitterate enough that the overwhelming majority of the civilians in the middle east hate these radical islamists and don't agree with their ideals, and many are being killed for it—unlike the story purported that the middle east is our enemy and that we are in a fight for 'democracy' around the world, because that couldn't be further from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is still not entirely clear check out Adam Curtis's - The Power Of Nightmares and, while not necessarily related to this topic, I can't recommend enough his series: The Century of Self. Both are on youtube I believe.  While it (The Power of Nightmares) doesn't tell the
       <em>
        whole
       </em>
       story, it the best comprehensive portrayal of the situation that I am describing that I know of. It paints the picture that these situations occurred much more by happenstance and 'is all just a big mix up' than is actually the case, but you can't expect 'the whole story' to be laid until on cable TV.  Unforuntately I don't have any comprehensive resources that can fill in the blanks this leaves open, but the work by
       <a href="https://wikispooks.com/ISGP/">
        The Institute For The Study Of Globalization And Covert Politics
       </a>
       is probably best I could recommend.
      </p>

       Why? What good does that do them? If anything a police state is WORSE for them, because it means Americans will be less capable of protesting US foreign policy.

       "Im sure" was entirely speculation.  Also i dont see why  radical islamists would really care too much about US foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As i said, the many things that they hate about the west still exist and have, if anything,  flourished in recent years. However their worldview, like all world views, dont have all the information (otherwise they wouldnt think having an educated, informed, populace is a bad thing), so i simply speculated that its probably they see the current state of the US as good under a
       <em>
        anything bad that happens to evil entities is good
       </em>
       ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, i am in no way an expert, and even if i were, i assuredly could be entirely wrong . And seeing as radical islam itself has essentially zero effect on our situation at all, i wouldnt recommend spending too much time trying to figure it all out (however watching The Power Of Nightmares will more or less give you as much info as i have on the topic)--radical Islam was just the scapegoat for this decade's Great American Lie with Communism preceding it. And if America somehow survives the petro dollar collapse, im sure theyll find a new scapegoat (currently looking like it will be global warming).

       Why would they necessarily see it as bad? Look at the governments that radical islamists install in places like Iran and Afghanistan: those places are FAR more dictatorial and oppressive than the USA. We're talking about countries where homosexuality is still a crime, often punishable by death. We're talking about countries where little girls get savagely attacked merely for going to school, and where women who accuse of men of rape get attacked and stoned to death by angry mobs sanctioned by Sharia courts.

       There is something of influence that is higher than government. People with the means and desire to influence change by indirectly paying other civil servants, representatives, "mouth-pieces" if you will, to change the rules we live under. TO make us comfortable with what should make us uncomfortable. Those SAME people with the power and false authority also run the world's financial systems, they control most of the world's military groups, they engineer things years in advance, they tip over dominoes which they know will lead to death and injustice, for their own TRUE purpose of not letting power get away from them. There is no black and white litmus test for evil and greed and corruption or goodness. There are signs which show you whether a person is under the influence of goodness or greed, which a person can succumb to or switch-back to multiple times a day, hour etc, and it can be impossible to spot if the people are behind closed doors, making decisions. Transparency is the only way, Truth will follow at the beckoning of the countless downtrodden, after most are dead.

       If ever, in the terms of our lifetimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTHING is going to change, I fear, unless there is a catalyzing event in which MANY people die...I'm talking a civil war, a pandemic, etc. And it would have to sweep the ENTIRE country...at this point I don't even think a false-flag nuking of an entire major American city would do the job sadly enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a great country once. I am old enough to have been alive to see it. Sure there were issues (Vietnam, civil rights, etc.) but not long ago America MADE things. We kicked ass. Now we can't even keep up our essential infrastructure. I mean, it's a testament to just HOW great America was that bridges built 50+ years ago that have been basically neglected/ignored since the 70s are still standing!
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama hasn't done SHIT and, thanks to the Republicans, never can. I mean, look around! See any construction? Any huge public works projects? If Obama would have kept his promise to put massive numbers of Americans to work doing just this type of ESSENTIAL work the economy would basically be, for lack of a better term, kicking ass. BUT...the truth (and, coincidentally, his excuse) is that the Republicans have tied up every plan, promise, etc. Obama had in Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now ANY movement would be better than no movement at all!

       you are at a low level of enlightenment if you mention political affiliation with any arguments.

       the two party system is designed to give you the illusion that you are making a change every four years. When in reality, both parties are drinking the banker/NWO kool aid.

       Come the hell on, I know this...I am only telling you what Obama's "excuse" will be in his memoirs down the road. And on the surface, he will be correct.

       But of course the two-party system is bullshit--only there to give the illusion of "choice" and "change."
