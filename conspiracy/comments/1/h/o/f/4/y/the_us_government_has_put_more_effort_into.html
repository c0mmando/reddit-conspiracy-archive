    <div class="md"><p>That is true. Osama Bin Laden has been dead since December 2001 (and, yes, I can prove it). The years 2001 until that bullshit speech on May 2, 2011 were just political propaganda tools in the phony &quot;War on Terror&quot;. By the way &quot;War on Terror&quot; is actually &quot;War on Terra&quot;, Terra meaning the earth. So in fact the &quot;War on Terror&quot; is really &quot;War on Earth&quot; or war against the people of the Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>approach it from the other way</p>

<p>multiple sources, some hostile to the US, but many friendly, all said OBL died in 2001 or early 2002, the <em>evidence</em> he was alive were those very fake videos that CIA sources released to the MSM.</p>

<p>every so often some corny CGIed video would surface, to scare the American public, pretty much whenever Bushco needed some &#39;scare&#39; in the news.</p>

<p>maybe he was alive all those years, but it did not seem so, at least to anybody with a brain and working eyesight.</p>

<p>the biggest give-away was GWB saying (in 2005 or so) we are not interested in finding OBL, that was a big clue to his dead status.</p>

<p>OBL if the <em>&#39;accurate&#39;</em> translations of his speeches are to be believed denied anything to do with 9/11, BUT he was still top of the FBI&#39;s most wanted list for the USS Cole and the Kenyan embassy bombings. Even if he never was officially wanted for 9/11, the other attacks warranted his capture, arrest and trial.</p>

<p>9/11 seems to have been a Saudi money and Pakistan organisation, KSM and nephew and assorted govt and non govt players/funding, there were many accidents happening to suspected planners of the 9/11 attack, VIPs and govt players from Saudi and Pakistan died in the year or so after 9/11, off the book revenge killings no doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, although the evidence becomes harder to find as the years pass, there are still a few videos and a few web sites. Not to mention that after they &quot;killed&quot; (sic) Osama Bin Laden there were <em>no</em> photos, <em>no</em> videos and his body quickly, and conveniently, dumped into the ocean. Add to that the US had no sovereign right to with hold hos body from his family in Saudi Arabia. Just like JFK&#39;s body. A fast cover up. </p>

<p>Same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given that the Obama (and Bush) Government were obviously looking for political points, why did they not parade him around like they did with Saddam Hussein ? OBL was, after all, thee most wanted man since Jesus. Since the Government is clearly not above lying, and sice they provided absolutely no proof of his body, and since they quickly dumped the body (who ever it was) in the ocean, could only point to the fact that it wasn&#39;t OBL. Additionally, I have seen, since 2001, much evidence (a lot of which is sadly missing) of his death in 2001. A famous Sherlock Holmes quote &quot;If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth&quot;. This doesn&#39;t prove anything, but it does convince me.</p>
