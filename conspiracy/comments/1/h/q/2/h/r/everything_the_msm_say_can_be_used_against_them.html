    <div class="md"><p>What you left out is Jeff Gannon. Though technically that is part of the Franklin scandal.</p>

<p>But what makes it more credible than any other story, is that there are pictures of young kids, tied up, being sold. <a href="http://able2know.org/topic/159313-1">Franklin Case File: Jeff Gannon is Johnny Gosch!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Noreen Gosch reports that it was to be years before she learned that the CIA was part of the International kidnapping and pornography ring. She and others have attempted to obtain copies of the catalog of children for sale,</p>

<p>There has never been a single reply to any request to produce this document&quot;. She also attempted to obtain from the Washington Press Core photographs from the hearing, also with no success. Noreen Gosch reports that Paul Bishop was in his early 20â€™s and called her, &quot;Mom&quot;. She now wonders if he was one of the &quot;lost&quot; children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that Gannon has not been questioned by police, his DNA taken to establish his identity, and compelled to tell what happened to him and to the other boys, shows that this group has power enough to stop the investigation. </p>

<p>Now Gannon/Gorsch survived. But what of the other boys? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorkslime.com/gannon.html">Conservative White House &quot;Reporter&quot; was a GOP Plant</a></p>

<p>Gannon was probably tricking with Bush or Rove or both. </p>
