       A subreddit with statistical evidence and humor that is about blacks intentionally made to ruin society, all falling within the right to your own opinion, has been banned!  Soon, r/conspiracy will be next once we become too aware.  r/niggers for life!

       Just because you may not like that sub, doesn't mean it's ok to stomp on the people that do.  It would be like banning your favourite porn subreddit.

       I don't agree with their hatred directed at black people but free speech should be sacrosanct and this censorship is a worrying trend here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if reddit is a privately owned company I always thought free speech was one of the most highly regarded principles here. Unfortunately I see it gradually being eroded away on spurious grounds like comment brigading when utter shitholes like
       <a href="/r/shitreddit">
        /r/shitreddit
       </a>
       who's whole existence revolves around hatemongering and vote manipulation remain untouched.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a shame when you have such clearly selective and biased admins running this site. This is why top down power with all the control in the hands of a select few can be so damaging if you have bad people in those positions.

       Whether you definite it as free speech or not it's clearly a form of censorship to ban it, it's not illegal and shows that admins are bowing to some kind of pressure or general political correctness which appears to be what happened with

       The majority of posts in
       <a href="/r/niggers">
        /r/niggers
       </a>
       were about pointing out the total lack of mainstream media attention of black on white (and black) crimes. Sure, there were some ignorant, redneck racists over there and it did occasionally get heated, but the last time I visited there wasn't a race war brewing.

       If I'm not mistaken, it was banned for multiple instances of inciting violence and mod misconduct. So you know, valid reasons for banning, not just because somebody didn't like it. If that was the case it would have been gone the minute it was created.

       There is a group of racists trying to foment their fantasy of race war.   There was even a subreddit about it.  They have created a Trayvon group and dominate it with racial smears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly Frank Taffee was overusing the phrase "keeping it real" to insult some black ladies he was addressing, so the race baiting is coming right out to center stage, unabashedly.

 got banned it was because it was the fastest growing sub on reddit.

       Everyone acting like they knew what was going on in r/niggers were never even a part of it.  It never once incited violence.  It was the equivalent of r/imgoingtohellforthis just directed at niggers, and to discuss their behaviour that brings the hatred on themselves.  We differentiated between blacks and niggers.  I have no problem with black people. Every time we were invaded by a black guy trying to promote their version of r/niggers however, its always a post about raping all the white women to show us who's boss.  So yeah, don't act like just because the name is r/niggers that we were going to lynch them.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the equivalent of r/imgoingtohellforthis just directed at

       Find another instance where I said that within 2 seconds.  Because I was typing out èniggers the whole time when referencing the sub I ended up typing that, rather than black people.  And Im not trying to convince anyone of anything besides the fact that people are having things they enjoy revoked from them.  Weather you think Im racist or not, youre right.

       Why don't we make a new r/niggers and call it hateniggers or ihateniggers and stop complaining about it. Adapt and change the name this will happen again so don't think it won't.

       I don't fucking care if I'm racist or not.  I'll say it all fucking day.  Even racists are against conspiracies however and banning of r/niggers should not have happened.  I have just as much right to speak about things I disapprove of as anyone else does.  It's funny how everyone on this sub talks about people not getting the bigger picture; yet here  you all are talking about how racism is the issue.  It's the fact they took away a prominent sub from us.

       Anyways simpleton, a few people do understand what I'm talking about.  Fuck the racism issue.  It was a sub that had 10k people on it.  If any other sub, regardless of topic had 10k people in and it got shut down, it would be a conspiracy.  This is no different.  The majority of you guys need to open
       <em>
        your

       eyes, and see what is going on around you.

       a douchebag by being condescending about not knowing what racism is. Yeah.

       I get that you love anonymously being an asshole behind peoples' backs because you're not brave enough to do it in person, so I know it's shocking to you that other people value human dignity, but racism
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the issue. What you're saying is tantamount to "it would be wrong to fire the Hawthorne PD officer who shot that dog because a lot of people don't like dogs," which is precisely as retarded as it sounds. There is no conspiracy, it's just that no one likes you and we would prefer it if you'd just go the fuck away. That shouldn't be foreign to you.

       Your analogy is as dumb as your mother for not aborting.  That is not what I'm talking about, way to be a douchebag and a moron.  There is a difference between reading and looking at words then trying to bang something out for the sake of it.  Next time, try to comprehend what you read instead.  Now that doesn't mean for you to go on a tangent about this paragraph as well like you've been doing on every thing I've said.  The issue is that the sub reddit has been banned for no apparent reason.

       For the record, I've had my feelings hurt more by a paper cut. You're neither intimidating nor clever, you're just showing off how mad you are.

       It actually did not rally anyone into violence.  All people did there were discuss unnoticed crimes committed by the blacks that weren't put in the paper.  It was actually the black people who invaded and made threads about how they were going to kill white people to get their revenge on us.  In fact, if you go to a sub about white people that were made by blacks, you'll find a lot of blacks posting about killing white people.

       Everybody has a little racism in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       About nine months ago I (I'm white) had a black dude come in my store that was located in a primarily indo-asian town. We were shootin' the shit for a while until somehow (he brought it up) we got on the topic of racism. His exact words (I'll never forget them) were, "as a black man, I never thought I'd say this, but living in &lt;redacted town&gt; has made me racist towards Indians." I also had an Asian girl say pretty much the same thing regarding her Indian dorm mate.

       No, it's a scientific fact, moron. Asians aren't smart because they're yellow, Asians are smart because of they are born with larger craniums. IF you look at any race, you will see the similiarties in them. Asian - smart, small, skinny, etc. Blacks - Big, strong, dumb as fuck because of their small craniums they are born with. Of course there is the small percentage of people who don't fit their culture but that is found everywhere in life due to mutations and what not.

       EDIT: I'm surprised he didn't talk about black people having extra muscles, what a scumbag.

       When someone acts unintelligent, they are called stupid.  When someone acts like a violent, sensless chimp, theyre called niggers.  Everyone gets called a deragatory name when they do something frowned upon by society.

This is the 2nd time you failed to respond properly, when the fuck did I link to a website?  Jesus Christ, you're as dumb as these fucking chimps I'm talking about.

       Oh, but I think that is the point. Let's ignore your pathetic attempt at an insult and the fact that there are far and away more whites defrauding the system by getting welfare to pay for their hoverrounds than there are blacks buying liquor as a matter of statistical census population data fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you feel about being an active participant in the Fascist takeover of this country? You think if "they" actually believe you and get rid of all the blacks, that you're not next? "They" don't need you, "they've" discovered that they can import cheap labor that can replace you. And the captians of industry are calling for MORE 'guest workers' to replace you and every white person you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now poor whites are out of a job, a class of which you are most assuredly a part of if you were so easily duped into such a self-destructive ideology. What do you think is going to happen to poor whites when they're sitting idle, suckling at the teat of the State, waiting for a handout? They same thing that's already happening to them and to poor blacks; getting processed into the Prison Industrial Complex and rendered as... cheap labor.

       Stop trying to debate weather me being racist or not is up to your standards of what human equality should be like.  That isnt the point of this thread.  For the 5th time, this is about having a sub taken away once it becomes political mainstream.

       You constantly want to divorce any and all context from a situation in order to make a point that is ultimately invalid. Your terrible sub got banned. Happens all the time. That's why I brought up the jailbait sub getting banned elsewhere in the thread. Conde Nast didn't want any part of that, and now it's your turn.

       If this happend to r/niggers for growing quickly and becoming informed, it sure as hell can happen here, especially since there is more knowledge being passed around here.

      <p>
       So thanks for coming out.

       You're doing exactly what I said you're doing. If anything, I've been vindicated. You're here to be a rabblerouser because your hate sub got kicked to the curb. You thought you'd found a haven for your nonsense, (probably because you also sub to r/conspirit@rd?) but you were wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have to SAY you don't have a problem with black people, it's pretty clear you do. You're not
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to have a problem with one group of people, racist. That's not how normal people operate. I hope you can understand how people are a little quick to paint you as ugly when you are adamantly in defense of a sub called r/niggers. If you don't, again, that's part of your problem.

       You think I can only express my views on that 1 sub¿
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly youre understanding my views perfectly from this sub so I can pretty much do it in any other sub I choose.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, you fucking imbescel, a lot of people will tell you they donèt have a problem with black people but sure as hell hate the fuck out of niggers.  Remember when you even said that you dont have to be black to be a nigger¿  Clearly you too must have a negative opinion on NIGGERS.

       But thanks for coming out, try again next time.

       I wonder how well received a post proclaiming "
       <a href="/r/niggers">
        /r/niggers
       </a>
       for life" will be viewed by those who could potentially join our subreddit...

       Yet there you are doing it.  Learn to read next time you try to post an edit about something someone didn't say.  Anyways, you can keep arguing with yourself now.

       These claims of "Reverse racism" come from people that don't like being called out on the carpet for viewing their own racism behavior as the acceptable norm.

       Whether you definite it as free speech or not it's clearly a form of censorship to ban it, it's not illegal and shows that admins are bowing to some kind of pressure or general political correctness which appears to be what happened with
