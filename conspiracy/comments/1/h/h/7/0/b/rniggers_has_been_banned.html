    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with their hatred directed at black people but free speech should be sacrosanct and this censorship is a worrying trend here. </p>

<p>Even if reddit is a privately owned company I always thought free speech was one of the most highly regarded principles here. Unfortunately I see it gradually being eroded away on spurious grounds like comment brigading when utter shitholes like <a href="/r/shitreddit">/r/shitreddit</a> who&#39;s whole existence revolves around hatemongering and vote manipulation remain untouched. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame when you have such clearly selective and biased admins running this site. This is why top down power with all the control in the hands of a select few can be so damaging if you have bad people in those positions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone acting like they knew what was going on in r/niggers were never even a part of it.  It never once incited violence.

I have no problem with black people.

<p>I get that you love anonymously being an asshole behind peoples&#39; backs because you&#39;re not brave enough to do it in person, so I know it&#39;s shocking to you that other people value human dignity, but racism <em>is</em> the issue.

His exact words (I&#39;ll never forget them) were, &quot;as a black man, I never thought I&#39;d say this, but living in &lt;redacted town&gt; has made me racist towards Indians.&quot; I also had an Asian girl say pretty much the same thing regarding her Indian dorm mate.</p>

<p>[–]Kinggeriller 1 point 15 hours ago</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s a scientific fact, moron. Asians aren&#39;t smart because they&#39;re yellow, Asians are smart because of they are born with larger craniums. IF you look at any race, you will see the similiarties in them. Asian - smart, small, skinny, etc. Blacks - Big, strong, dumb as fuck because of their small craniums they are born with. Of course there is the small percentage of people who don&#39;t fit their culture but that is found everywhere in life due to mutations and what not.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t talk about black people having extra muscles, what a scumbag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, but I think that is the point. Let&#39;s ignore your pathetic attempt at an insult and the fact that there are far and away more whites defrauding the system by getting welfare to pay for their hoverrounds than there are blacks buying liquor as a matter of statistical census population data fact.</p>

<p>How do you feel about being an active participant in the Fascist takeover of this country? You think if &quot;they&quot; actually believe you and get rid of all the blacks, that you&#39;re not next? &quot;They&quot; don&#39;t need you, &quot;they&#39;ve&quot; discovered that they can import cheap labor that can replace you. And the captians of industry are calling for MORE &#39;guest workers&#39; to replace you and every white person you know. </p>

<p>So now poor whites are out of a job, a class of which you are most assuredly a part of if you were so easily duped into such a self-destructive ideology. What do you think is going to happen to poor whites when they&#39;re sitting idle, suckling at the teat of the State, waiting for a handout? They same thing that&#39;s already happening to them and to poor blacks; getting processed into the Prison Industrial Complex and rendered as... cheap labor. </p>
