I&#39;m not an American but from the outside looking in I can&#39;t understand why the people of America aren&#39;t standing up and saying a lot of whats going on is far from ok. I&#39;m talking about the nsa, the police brutality, the illegal wars, corporations running the government, keeping the poor poor, extortionate third level education and health care.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on reddit for almost a year and I get the impression that most (redditor) Americans are not happy with any of the things I listed. So why is no one standing up and saying &quot;NO!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Along with being uninformed, these same people are also <em>afraid</em>. Life in the late 20th Century and early 21st Century in North America has been abnormally good (for everyone to a lessor or greater extent), by the standards of history. The people, over about three generations, have come to depend on this abnormal high standard to the point that returning to a more normal standard is unthinkable.</p>

<p>The revolution hasn&#39;t happened in earnest because people are afraid of what they will lose, and, because the system has been engineered to remove any viable alternative for life support. This is/was intentional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reaction is quite understandable and rational. What <em>are</em> you to do ? I am single so I have a little less to worry about. But, if a real revolution were to go down, then all bets are off. Then we (as a society) will find out what our true colours really are. I am in Canada, and I hope we will weather any storms a little easier, but I doubt it. If I had kids and a wife to that depended on me I would seriously think building my personal network of mutal support so that your immediate community will be able to help each other.</p>

<p>well thanks for not resorting to name calling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na.  Again, you&#39;re being honest and stating a very, very real concern.  I was talking to my gf about this yesterday, and said myself that if I had kids, a wife, a house, etc, I wouldn&#39;t want to just abandon them (esp the kids).  What would be the point of &quot;going to save the country and the constitution!&quot; if my actions were effectively ruining my children and my family by just leaving them?  I know it&#39;s not that clean, cut, and dry, and we&#39;re quickly getting to the point as a nation and as a people where if we DON&#39;T do anything and keep on keeping on as if nothing&#39;s happening, then we really ARE ensuring the demise of our family, but still...it&#39;s a tough situation definitely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was really in hopes some smart redditor would suggest an obvious solution for me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems there&#39;s no smart solution as in &quot;easy&quot; solution.  Perhaps you can find ways to demonstrate <em>occasionally</em> or only take SOME time out of your day to take part in the movement(s), etc.  Just a thought.</p>

<p>In the OWS and March Against Monsanto movements, I was able to just get up and go no problem - and <em>did</em>.  Maybe you could, as one example, go and demonstrate only for a bit or something then go back home and tend to those responsibilities.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kinda guessed that was the answer... that&#39;s part of the problem too i suppose. Do you think it&#39;s because they&#39;d rather pay attention to things like Paula Deen being shamed or is it this is just that&#39;s what the media spews out and people accept this as news?

    <div class="md"><p>It also makes it harder for people to confide in each other. Harder to find solitude, or companionship.  Which is one of the first stepping stones to a totalitarian state.   Men alone yet crowded in the same room.  I re-read a book by Novak recently which summarized his life in Soviet Russian under Stalin in which he stated he could only find solitude and privacy in the bustling streets of Moscow, and never in the confines of his home with neighbors constantly weary of each other, always prying, and willing to give up their fellow neighbor in fear of their own lives.   I keep thinking back to that paragraph, it haunts me.  Day by day I see this as becoming the norm in modern US society. Perhaps more so having been living in a massive metropolis myself and hearing my peers talk of similar characteristics as well as experiencing it some what myself.</p>

<p>To be so bold as to say a revolution won&#39;t happen is to imply that you understand all facets of realities and thus all probable and possible outcomes so much as to make a statement eliminating any possibility of a revolution?</p>

<p>Do you know how many records there are from Rome of people saying that it will never fall? That revolution won&#39;t happen? Do you know how many records there are of people saying that about EVERY REVOLUTION?! </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on reddit for almost a year</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on reddit for <em>three</em> years (different accounts), and the revolution DID happen, well, it started anyways. Maybe you didn&#39;t follow it much, but there was this thing called Occupy Wall Street. OWS was about, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>..the police brutality, the illegal wars, corporations running the government, keeping the poor poor, extortionate third level education and health care.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was huge, and it galvanized a generation that knew nothing of protest. It was very very big, all over every subreddit. All the memes were about it, all the jokes were about it. It was everything. It spread to Europe and through the world. It soon took some hard thumps, and total aggression from every side. It didn&#39;t die though like some would have you believe. It merely went to sleep. Nope, it lit a spark in millions, and millions of American AND people all over the world still completely believe in the ideals of OWS, that will never go away. </p>

<p>I think the big changes come in waves, look at Egypt, they had the most massive protests the nation had ever seen...in 2011. It was so big, it fought through extreme emergency law and a dictator that had been president for like 40 years. The protests forced him to resign! But it didn&#39;t fully work, now, like a wave, they are protesting again, even more than before. I think it will be like this in America, it is inevitable from my perspective.</p>

<p>I hope your right and it has lit a spark in people. I appreciate your optimism :)</p>

<p>Here is the original Declaration of the Occupation of New York City as presented to the NYC General Assembly (the original political body that emerged from within the original space at Zucatti Park) on September 29, 2011,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nycga.net/resources/documents/declaration/">http://www.nycga.net/resources/documents/declaration/</a></p>

<p>As you can see, it touches on a broad array of problems. Basically, many if not most OWS supporters understand and believe something along the lines of the adage, money is the root of all evil, and more zeroed in for the 21st century, the banks are the root of all evil. Many of the problems addressed in the Declaration can be traced back to interactions and actions of the large multinational banks and governments.</p>

<p>That is not a real revelation is it? The actual people on the street being counted was statistically so small compared to the world it was insignificant. Because it took place on the internet it was faceless and people went about their daily lives, some times talking about it  but only to laugh and mock the Hippies. They are the only ones I saw at most Occupy&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhhh. This may have been your perspective on it which may be based upon what you saw in American media. However the OWS had a huge effect on the rest of the world.</p>

<p>People from other countries watch us just as we watch them. To see Americans get upset about those issues was big, enough for other countries to follow suit e.g. Brazil, Istanbul. </p>

<p>Regardless of how OWS was &#39;Portrayed&#39; we are all individuals. And anyone who put their own rationality to those events got value from it. It stated &quot;We know somethings wrong, you are not alone.&quot;</p>

<p>What, did people actually think that it was gonna change over night? We are changing people&#39;s MINDS, brainwashed minds. Shit takes time son. </p>

<p>Also, OWS had many forces trying to break it up including FBI. If not prepared for such divide and conquer tactics any &#39;movement&#39; would have suffered the same fate as OWS. Which gives us another important fact, they were afraid of OWS.</p>

<p>That last bit is the most telling of all the information. It was not a valueless event. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t agree with this sentiment more. And no matter how many people upvote you or downvote you, know that this is real and true and right, and this sentiment,</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>is so completely, 100% wrong. Even people who never went to a single camp or protest felt a sea change in their hearts and souls. </p>

<p>People who try to characterize OWS as small, or insignificant, or not relevant, at this point, are being very very ignorant, willfully adversarial, or even part of the documented and confirmed attempt by the opposition powers to mis-characterize the true history of what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many &quot;hippies&quot; one saw, was completely irrelevant. Because they didn&#39;t encapsulate occupy, they supported occupy. To me, people like Noam Chomsky are a symbol of the occupy movement. And anyways, on the &quot;statistically insignificant numbers&quot;, this just is a poor characterization if not a flat out untruth. Every major city in the United States had the largest protests they had seen in decades if not in their history. Let us not forget, OWS completely shut down huge areas of downtown Manhattan and other major metropolitan cities, more than once with marches and unprecedented spontaneous protest camps set up in public areas. OWS spawned numerous NGOs that are thriving and active today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think (hope?) there&#39;s a slow revolution of ideas going on. I see it here on reddit. Finally, after Obama being an obvious GWB II not even a year into presidency, people on here are coming around to that. Now I see very little, if any, Obama support compared to just a few months ago. And a lot of the posts in the political/news subreddits are no longer based on farcical left vs. right bullshit, but on how both in power with their kin in corporations are screwing over everybody, worldwide. This is a great change, and again, I hope it&#39;s just the beginning, because if it&#39;s not and this subsides, I fear for the totalitarian direction our world, and America especially, is headed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, getting active in your local communities is more important than online presence at this point. The internet is amazing, so we gotta get those people who still aren&#39;t using it as a tool for learning and the older generations who do care about liberty, justice and have experience to share with all of us. We desperately need to talk to one another in our offline interactions. </p>

<p>For example, anyone living in the 60&#39;s must have a tremendous amount of knowledge of what the actual social interactions were then, the mental climate of the people, understanding of how propaganda was used to attack them as well as the positive things they figured out. Values, civilization history, etc. Educating ourselves about the human race will not only shed light on all matters concerning conspiracies but just as importantly, how we go about fixing it. </p>

<p>The government are also not trying to keep the poor poor. The social welfare here is too easy. It&#39;s too easy for people who don&#39;t want to work not to have to, but that&#39;s their choice. Things like springboard and jobs bridge, were brought in for people to get themselves back out there to jobs in businesses that couldn&#39;t grow without it. Local enterprise boards love to help people who are out there trying. </p>

<p>They may not be the best but I think we&#39;re getting there and I&#39;d much rather be here than in the states. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember, we are talking about peripheral nations to the Western Civilization. Right now America is where the Core of the Western Civilization currently resides. This was originally held by Germany that was held previously by England and before Rome.</p>

<p>We are all still part of the expanding empire of Western Civilization.</p>

<p>What this means is that peripheral nations can be members of said Empire by/for a varied number of reasons. &#39;Do it or die!&#39; or &#39;Do it and we will give you protection&#39;, etc. </p>

<p>Ireland is one of those peripheral nations. These nations can retain their identity while still being at the mercy of the nation that currently holds the core of the civilization (ask Ireland about their history with England sometime, I think they understand cultural and military occupation.)</p>

<p>(It is important to note that the Western Civilization is unique to almost all civilizations that came before it.</p>

<p>1.) It is the first civilization that rather then crumbling or being destroyed by outside forces it has managed to repeat the stage of &#39;Expansion&#39; 3 times, moving the core of the civilization to peripheral nations i.e. Rome to England to Germany to the United States.</p>

<p>2.) It is the first global civilization. Via the banking cartels the Western Civilization has managed to have a central bank installed globally, effectively giving the money changers control of prosperity itself (ability to inflate and deflate currencies impacts the quality of life for all)</p>

<p>Now this next bit is important. If the core of a civilization can move, like it has done so in this case, than the United States can easily collapse to a point where it is NOT the core anymore, but still exist in a way that the central power moves to another peripheral nation. Imagine that the core of Western Civilization moved from America... to China... Without a war, but in the form of electorate corporations and finance. </p>

<p>Theoretically, the core of Western Civilization could go on for quite some time. This is extremely bad considering the mass numbers of small and large cultures that have been completely decimated, and in some cases, annihilated both past and present. (we see the evaporation of the Arabic world via conquest and economics as well as by Western customs).</p>

<p>Right now, there is an opportunity for people to have the core of Western Civilization taken from nations and put in the hand of the people of Earth. </p>

<p>Through technology we have something that is unprecedented, a global voice.  If the people of the world unite, not under a flag or commerce or family name, but under an ideology.... The world could see a time in history that would mark mankind&#39;s next step in evolution. We have an opportunity to discontinue the old way of life, identifying with nations, flags, religions, obligations but instead identify with life itself. This planet is our home and it is also us. We are a part of this world and whether or not we like it is our responsibility to it and ourselves to protect it just as we would anything we love. </p>

<p>The current civilization has set the &quot;will&quot; of the people to a mind full of profiting and business void of thoughtful consequence and for the happiness of others, only the self. Through the use of propaganda (a continual illusion that convinces people that &#39;everyone in this world wants money and it is okay to hurt others to obtain this and possessions&#39; fabricated by the news and other major media outlets), brainwashing (the use of schools to effectively dumb down people by hording knowledge in an effort to handicap the mind to be sufficient for only remedial tasks whilst stifling imagination - the key to critical thinking and individuality) and the perpetuation of the culture by controlling all avenues of revenue (the systematic over throw of our Universities in an attempt to further increase the worker drone base). </p>

<p>We are currently living in a world civilization whom&#39;s morality has been skewed to match those whom benefit from such a morality. </p>

<p>Of course they would try to stop any change to this system because of conflict of interests. It currently benefits them. 
One must look no further than the Unions in America whom claim to be united for prosperity but the lack of adaptability as well as stagnant growth serves only as a counter to their mission statement. Simply because those who currently benefit from how the Unions work now do not want it to change for those that the Unions are no longer working for. Conflict of interests. </p>

<p>America had represented an attempt to change the people&#39;s morality by becoming a nation driven by ideology. That we have a right to life. That all man are created equal. That the pursuit of happiness is a pursuit worth having. That no matter your race, creed, nationality if born here you too can have these rights. Never before in history was the power been given to the people in such a way that the right to life was intrinsic to existence itself.</p>

<p>We are all children of men, and we do not come from fearful men. Just as we learn from our own mistakes in our linear existence so does our species.</p>

<p>Do we unite as a global people improving upon the knowledge left for us by free men? </p>

<p>Or do we allow fear and intimidation to direct our lives and the lives of our children into an abyss of ignorance and misery doomed to serve out time on this planet as prisoners rather than adventurers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because revolutions have big costs, like death, destruction, and war. Most people who think about revolution know that the US military will gun down the revolution. We would not stand a chance. Our glocks against their tanks, right! So, that leaves a mental revolution. But the media and the education system are controlled. The political process is controlled. That leaves the internet, which they are now trying to control as well as tap. Basically, for there to be a revolution, the society would have to break down first, which it may well in the next 50 years or so.</p>

<p>If there was no more oil, it would wreck the economy and fuck with the police and the military too. This would be the revolution. A lot of people will starve. It will happen sooner in Egypt, much later in the US. The government will want to retain control, but if they lose electricity, they will not be able to brainwash the masses. We would devolve to smaller political units like the states or counties or warlords or MadMax...</p>
