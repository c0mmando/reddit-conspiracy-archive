<p>We should get a petition or a mass amount of email to Mercedes that we don&#39;t consider it luxurious to have our car drive us into trees on its own. If we put pressure on Mercedes and imply its their fault, the truth will have to come out regarding the real reason it happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This Video is the reason I started this post, thought it was just brilliantly portrayed. The kicker for me is the engine location, it&#39;s like something I&#39;d imagine seeing on Mythbusters. Also really enjoyed the Hispanic witness whom hears a &#39;boom&#39; &amp; saw the car Already in flames hitting the tree. I like the idea of contacting mercedes, doesn&#39;t sound like a bad idea. I&#39;ve tried to link their contact page but alas, I&#39;m currently suck on my phone &amp; it won&#39;t open the page. Maybe a little full Internet capable redditor can help us?? :) </p>

<p>Btw thanks for the upvote &amp; comment which equal to me shared concern about Michael Hastings tragic &amp; sudden death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the engine location is pretty extreme at 180 feet away, but i think it indicates a very high speed rather than an explosion. There was another female witness in the crash video who said the car exploded on impact. I interpreted the male witness as saying that the car was slamming against the ground due to bumps in the road and the high speed. I think the lack of break marks in front of the tree is suspicious, and supports acceleration tampering theories. And the fact that it burst into flames seems awfully convenient, since it probably destroyed any findings of his journalism in the car.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, i dont understand how the car set fire too easy. one time this person flipped her truck, we smelt gas it never caught fire.i slammed my jeep into the side of a tree, no fire. my sister tboned a moving car with a combined speed of around 65 mph no fire. my ex friend slammed my bmw into a jeep, we smelt gas, so did other witnesses no fire. maybe i am just a lucky fucker. but i dont think the engine flew that far, maybe 25 feet of air time and then skidded on the asphalt. though everything about this car crash makes me think wtf?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never thought of the evidence inside the car, good call. The possibility of tampering for sure seems probable considering colleges have been able to hack cars. What is to say the power to do so isn&#39;t in the hands of some agency. It&#39;s like the electronic bugs that shut off the car that they shot in 2fast2furious I believe, don&#39;t quote me that though, my movie memory is a little fuzzy right now.</p>

<p>What is more interesting is how easy it is to hack cars to control them to do that remotely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hopefully whatever appears to be concluded after a thorough investigation of the wreckage. The thing that still keeps getting me is the engine location, so I don&#39;t know much about physic but maybe someone here does, how much force would be needed to move ~300 lbs (guesstimating off some engine weights for other model Benz I found online, couldn&#39;t find exact weight) at least 100 feet? Not factoring in the fact that the drivetrain was connected to the rest of the car. I would assume a lot of force, but hey I may be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been wondering this too. Surely MBenz must have to submit to some sort of oversight for legal/insurance reasons, into the exact, detailed, cause of the accident? Has there been any word about this from his beneficiaries? His parents perhaps? </p>

<p>Here is my latest idea about this story,</p>

I&#39;m in Az &amp; one of the first instances of the events happened here had a loss of life, &amp; they never thought of turning off the car. Although I did just read that in an article, it may have been incorrect,I believe they had audio evidence.</p>
