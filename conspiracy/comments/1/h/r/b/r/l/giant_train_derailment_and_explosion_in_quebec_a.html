        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/07/06/quebec-train-derailment-fire.html">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/07/06/quebec-train-derailment-fire.html</a></p>

<p>Many of you may not have seen this story yet.  A train carrying oil from the tar sands derailed in Quebec today, evacuating at least a thousand people, with a massive fireball of an explosion.</p>

<p>Now, this is just speculation, but did someone derail this train on purpose? Let&#39;s look at a few facts:</p>

<p>Location: This happened in a city and province that the Conservative government in Canada HATES. Harper and his merry band of conservatives <em>loathe</em> Quebec for being left-leaning, organized, and non-anglo. the city where the crash occurred, <a href="https://maps.google.ca/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=Lac-M%C3%A9gantic&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x4cb74699b00c67a7:0x7dc4a6f8c8252429,Lac-M%C3%A9gantic,+QC&amp;gl=ca&amp;ei=DVzYUbfLL8KfiAKJ84DIAg&amp;ved=0CIoBELYD">Lac-MÃ©gantic</a> votes heavily for either the NDP or the bloc Quebecois. Both of these are parties directly opposed to the neoconservative agenda of Harper and his party (CPC).</p>

<p>So we can ascertain that the location for the crash is suspicious. That&#39;s one strike.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look at motive. The Keystone XL is a huge, multi-trillion dollar investment project meant to take the tar sands bitumin to Texas for processing to send to China. The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/oct/05/koch-keystone-xl-pipeline">Kochs</a> have invested significantly in it. So obviously there is a lot of money they stand to lose if Obama for some reason refuses to allow the pipeline to be built.</p>

<p>So, did someone intentionally derail that train? Watch how quickly they claim that pipelines will be &#39;safer&#39; than trains after this accident.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: </p>

<p>Here are some other red flags:</p>

<p>The small town of Lac Megnatic is not a destination for unprocessed crude. Why was this train even there??</p>

<p>Since when does unprocessed crude explode in a giant fireball? Hint, it doesn&#39;t. A crash would have just caused a spill, not a giant explosion. So what really caused the explosion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Media may cover up false flag in cooperation with CIA, as CIA must be on to false flag by now. I believe Israel did this, 9-11, and the San Fran bombed plane (sorry, entire top blown off, didn&#39;t skid and do a cartwheel, and Facebook CEO doesn&#39;t use personal miles to switch from a business-paid flight, sorry, and Facebook has Mossad links up and down). However, CIA/media must deflect blame from &quot;arab terrorist&quot; (Israeli false flag target - Al Quada, etc.) to avoid entering an unnecessary retaliatory war. I imagine the &quot;Arab terrorist&quot; stories are well-concocted by the Mossad, would be tough to discredit publicly (think hijackers), and don&#39;t have Israel&#39;s fingerprints. However, since israel&#39;s fingerprints are off, Israel must officially cooperate with the media gag order, and therefore we take the sting out of false flag. Good job special agent Barry Sotero, that&#39;s why we reelected you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Reuters, Montreal, Maine, &amp; Atlantic Vice President, Joseph McGonigle, said that the train had been parked without a conductor aboard at the time and was somehow released.  </p>

<p>The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said it has sent four investigators to the scene of the accident. The investigators are set to arrive Saturday afternoon, and will be joined by additional investigators as the day goes on.</p>

<p>âAt this point what we want to do is gather information,â said Chris Krepski, a spokesman for the TSB. âWe will travel to the site to gather information, interview witnesses and talk to the operator, but we will have to wait until the area is safe and secure before we go in and examine wreckage.â</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This incident is already being used to caution environmentalists who oppose the Keystone XL pipeline</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/quebec-train-explosion-underscores-benefit-of-pipelines/article13068608/">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/quebec-train-explosion-underscores-benefit-of-pipelines/article13068608/</a></p>

<p>Until this incident the rail industry had a relatively solid record, with crude reaching its destination safely 99.997 per cent of the time, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Still, trains, trucks and ships are all second-best methods. Pipelines have a record that is about five times better than rail. <strong>This incident will further skew the statistics in favor of pipelines.</strong></p>

<p><strong>That should give pause to environmental opponents of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry Canadian oil to the United States.</strong> Preventing construction of the pipeline would not stop Canadians from extracting their crude reserves, which at 175 billion barrels are worth around seven times current GDP net of production costs. <strong>Instead, one result will probably be more tragedies like the one seen in Quebec this weekend.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the Koch brothers have a lot of people working overtime to eliminate viewable speculation om the purpose of the crashes. Their goal of course is to get the pipeline built, and setting up trains as &#39;unreliable&#39; might push opinion to support pipelines. Notwithstanding that a pipeline can be blown up, too.</p>

<p>Funny how reasonable speculations are getting pushed below the -4 viewing threshold, eh?</p>

<p>This thread smells of manipulation, especially with the cross post in the neocon hive  r/conspiratard intended to vote game it. I see a large presence of the ctard regulars. That&#39;s usually a sign of focused manipulation in a targeted sub.</p>

<p>Added:  police now have found evidence brakes were released and are calling it a crime.</p>
