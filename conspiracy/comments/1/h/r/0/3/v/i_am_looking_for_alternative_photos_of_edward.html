        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Will someone find me at least just 5 alternative photos of Snowden, NOT from his video interview? I&#39;m having a hard time finding any others while surfing on my phone. You would think that with someone so highly profiled, his entire life story would be streamed all across the web by now.</p>

<p>If the most powerful country (or organization) in the world wanted you dead or captured, there is no hiding in a fucking airport hotel. There are no written letters from mom &amp; dad to plead your case, because they would be in custody &amp; heavily interegated to find out EVERYTHING they know. Realistically if you are a threat, they WILL be held at ransom. Please don&#39;t hesitate to think that the same people that dropped atomic bombs on innocence &amp; agent orange on unsuspecting, would suddenly change all of their fucked up moral ideals. Call me crazy, but I just get this feeling that this Snowden situation is all smoke &amp; mirrors. These things that are being leaked come to NO surprise to me, &amp; in fact are on a certain level EXPECTED from such a powerful organization, morally correct or not.</p>

<p>Something is being effortlessly covered up; the average citizen is WAY too gullible and easily distracted. </p>

<p>“How fortunate for governments that the people they administer don&#39;t think”
-Adolf Hitler</p>

<p>Edit: I really hope I&#39;m wrong and I have an over active imagination. The only problem is... the proof is in the pudding. </p>

<p>It is possible that this entire issue is hyped up to see who we can trust in South America. At any rate, I just posted the following in response to another post, and I thought it belonged here:</p>

<p>The US government openly supports Syrian rebels.</p>

<p>Syria is a known ally of Iran.</p>

<p>Iran is a known ally of China (most importantly, China is responsible for continuing Iran&#39;s nuclear program in the 90&#39;s, &amp; supplying weapons during the Iran-Iraq war [yes, the same Iran-Iraq war in which the US supplied Iraq with weapons]).</p>

<p>The US and China (you can include Russia with China) currently have a decent relationship, entirely relied upon trade relations and an equal amount economic support.</p>

<p>However, there is no hiding the fact that the US government and China/Russia do not see eye to eye on MANY policies. If the super powers of the East become agitated with the super powers of the West, the results WILL be disastrous.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that parts of South America have recently showed displeasure with the US (Bolivia is mad, Ecuador&#39;s embassy is housing the founder of wiki-leaks, &amp; Venezuela just announced their approval of giving asylum to Snowden). That puts enemies in serious proximity, and if push comes to shove, our most serious threats won&#39;t hesitate to exploit that issue.</p>

<p>That day may not be tomorrow, &amp; the chances of a direct conflict are currently slim, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it should be ignored. </p>

<p>Edit 2: The democratic process is currently paused in Egypt, which makes me wonder who is in control. Is it US &amp; friends, China &amp; friends, or is it finally the people? Something tells me it isn&#39;t the people... Egypt is an extremely important strategic military foothold.</p>

<p>Edit 3: I beg upon these nations for peace... Why must there be so much blood... We&#39;re all in this together. In time there will be NOTHING left of us but a memory, and you want to be remembered by the amount of blood you&#39;ve spilled, how many lives you&#39;ve ruined, the amount of gold that you&#39;ve horded but never even had a chance to fucking significantly USE?!?!?! FOR FUCKING WHAT?!?! It deeply saddens me that something so simple like a smile or a hug or the sharing of laughter is completely ruined by ultimately USELESS ideas like pride, greed, anger, hatred... emotions that YOU WILLINGLY choose to complicate your lives with that FIX FUCKING NOTHING FOR ANYONE, INCLUDING YOURSELF... blood only begets blood... when will these people just let it go...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree as well.  Somethings funny about the Snowden issue.  Aside from that, he looks SO familiar to me just from the photos that are published.  I think I&#39;ve seen him before, but it&#39;s not coming to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS. It&#39;s very strange that you say this because I thought it the second I saw him...although I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s probably that part of my brain responsible for deja vu firing.</p>

<p>Anyhow, OP is precisely correct...there is absolutely NO possible way that Snowden would&#39;ve eluded capture had they really wanted to perform a &quot;rendition.&quot; The thought of this is simply ludicrous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At some point I WILL figure it out...it&#39;s just so weird that the minute the Snowden story appeared here I looked at him and that immediate &quot;Shit! I know him! But from where?&quot; response was elicited.</p>

<p>I am somewhat deeply involved in the IT world, especially in the Linux &quot;scene&quot;--that&#39;s immediately where I thought I knew him from but am now not so sure. I&#39;ll let you know if/when I figure it out though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the same response.  I also thought IT immediately, so we&#39;re on the same wavelength.  RedHat kind of clicked, but I never checked.  And, thanks, cause it bugs me every time I see his face.</p>
