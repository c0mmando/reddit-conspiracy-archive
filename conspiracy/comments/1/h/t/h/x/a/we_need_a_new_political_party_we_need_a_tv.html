    <div class="md"><p>The only thing that would work is unite people behind beliefs that are common throughout different groups and agree to ignore divisive issues for the time being. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Government and big corporations work together. End the revolving door between Big Corporations and bureaucratic leadership.</p></li>
<li><p>Absolutely no earmarks! No moving money under the radar and out of the public spotlight.</p></li>
<li><p>Government agencies like the FDA, NSA, CIA, federal reserve, IRS etc. have become independent bodies. Leaders of those agencies need to be accountable to the people and not the bureaucracy. They need to be voted in as part of the democratic process, not appointed by the corrupt bureaucracy. </p></li>
<li><p>Officials will be held to the same legal standards as every citizen. Leaders that lie to congress or the people must be tried in a public trial, just as citizens are.</p></li>
<li><p>Government secrecy must no longer be used to cloak behavior that the citizens do not approve of. Government secrecy must not be used to cover illegal activity. Any violations must be tried in an open trial just as it would be for any citizen.</p></li>
<li><p>The body of government that investigates illegal activity within government agencies must be elected by the people and not appointed by the bureaucracy that they are tasked to investigate. As of now there exists a conflict of interest because these positions are appointed. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are examples of government corruption and abuse of power that most citizens want to resolve. Libertarians, Tea Party, Occupy, Liberals, and Conservatives all agree on these issues and want to end government corruption that is so rampant in our system. This is where we need to start. This needs to be our goal. Other issues that are divisive must be ignored for the time being if we ever want to reform our system. Coming together on these issues and these alone will give us the numbers and power to actually stand against the power and money of those that would keep us divided. Only when the government-corporation bond of corruption, secrecy, and abuse is broken can we the people reshape the system so that it is fair and controlled by us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to identify who &quot;they&quot; are. They are the political-corporate conglomerate that works in unison to further each others interests. They are also the divisions of government who have split off and become unaccountable, independent entities like the FDA, NSA, and IRS. Those two things are the enemy; we need to break wallstreet away from DC and reign in rogue agencies like FDA, NSA, IRS, etc. that have gained too much power with no oversight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I like your thinking.  And thanks OP for your passion!</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to suggest a central, unwavering commitment to non-violence in every way possible. It (violence) is the lie keeping us bound to the cycle, at the whim of our hypocritical <em>protectors</em>.</p>

<p>Further we need to re-define violence socially – economic violence, technologic violence, agricultural violence, etc. Think of it as a rebranding of terrorism – turned back on those shady predators who are hijacking our system. The UN made <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130023318">a report</a> saying cyber warfare is subject to all the same rules &amp; punishments as traditional warfare – why shouldn&#39;t other forms of violence/terrorism/warfare?</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to know who &quot;they&quot; are and how they operate. But also important is building a message and identity which the masses can get behind entirely without fear. Many of us realize that a &quot;dismantling&quot; of the system would fail for many reasons, and isn&#39;t advised. The system (body) must stay in tact and in place, and the people (white blood cells) must unite against the invading forces (viruses). Hegemonies are not destroyed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-hegemonic_globalization">but countered</a> (that is what&#39;s happening to our human culture – our potential a body of great nations has been sacrificed for the benefit of a few),</p>

<p>As for a name? I nominate The <em>General Union</em>. Those words could/ should strike fear into fear mongering globalists everywhere...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>3 of your ideas really stand out. first, Non-violence is key. Any movement would be a PR based thing and violence would get the group smeared in the media and lose support. second, Building our identity and clearly what we stand for. Third, dismantling the system would never work. It just needs to be cleaned up, rid of corruption, and appropriate oversight and watchdogs without conflicts of interest need to be put in place.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t rockefellers, we can&#39;t spend a million here and a million there.</p>

<p>I think the better way to do things is trying to inform people in a conversation or handing out information. </p>

<p>Also David Icke is doing what you are describing with his crowdfunding tv station <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-people-s-voice">&quot;The Peoples Voice&quot;</a>. </p>

<p>they already have reached the minimal funding campagin goal, so this might be something to look into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First we need to get the message to all r/conspiracy , and get everyone behind this goal. Post on r/occupy , and r/teaparty to propose an alliance for the better good , for they are both fighting the same tyranny .

We can be the change we so crave . Wake them up , start a movement </p>

    <div class="md"><p>first and foremost we need to lay out what we want changed. Problem with occupy was lack of a goal. We need clear goals. Goals that major political movements can all stand behind. Find the common threads between groups and demand that we start seeing the change. A common purpose, a common goal, and a common enemy could bring people together. I mentioned the things that are essentially the core of almost every political movement at the top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing my own research the last 14 months, i&#39;ve read so much shit, i think i finally got it. I&#39;ve been a victim of anxiety, desperation and such, people keeps defending themselves with &quot;it has always been like this&quot;. But, i saw, they are very interested on the subjects they know. Like, the gold is being filled with tungsten, teaching about freemasonry and how freemasonry works, and MONSANTO. people do care about their health, start boicoting corporations a little bit, that might wake up the human inside humans. I with some of my heart-friends(they all fighting the same evil shit) cut all of our hair in sign of protest against our families/friends/etc. I do not know if this will work, but it&#39;s ag ood way, to recognize ourselves and to show people, we give no fucks about our image, and that we are not alone. We are so much people, but we&#39;re separated from this silly countryborders.</p>

<p>Thanks bros, we&#39;re not alone, no fear, even if it costs us our death.(A freemason already stopped by my house, to give me a pleasent message). No fear bros, write books, spam messaged all over social networks, real life, do whatever you can, it&#39;s never enough.</p>

<p>Thank you all again. And hi, im new to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The LP is corrupt as fuck, and heavily influenced by the Koch Brothers (who in turn own CATO, and largest funder of Reason). I used to support GJ btw, but now have firmly gone back to Ron Paul and the &#39;Mises Institute&#39;. </p>

<p>You should read more about the Koch&#39;s here: </p>

<p>And speaking of GJ; after having shat on Ron Paul in multiple interviews, this guy is trying to stay relevant. I made a huge mistake supporting him, and now this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8D204yiWzs">private-prison supporting</a>, Federal-reserve defending, <a href="http://youtu.be/X1KKAqTUnoQ?t=1m3s">foreign-interventionism supporting</a>, Israel supporting, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRlGXuGHfrc">GITMO defending</a> dunce just won&#39;t go away.</p>

As long as keep fighting amongst ourselves and not the real enemy they&#39;ll keep going unchecked.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I like your thinking.  And thanks OP for your passion!</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to suggest a central, unwavering commitment to non-violence in every way possible. It (violence) is the lie keeping us bound to the cycle, at the whim of our hypocritical <em>protectors</em>.</p>

<p>Further we need to re-define violence socially – economic violence, technologic violence, agricultural violence, etc. Think of it as a rebranding of terrorism – turned back on those shady predators who are hijacking our system. The UN made <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130023318">a report</a> saying cyber warfare is subject to all the same rules &amp; punishments as traditional warfare – why shouldn&#39;t other forms of violence/terrorism/warfare?</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to know who &quot;they&quot; are and how they operate. But also important is building a message and identity which the masses can get behind entirely without fear. Many of us realize that a &quot;dismantling&quot; of the system would fail for many reasons, and isn&#39;t advised. The system (body) must stay in tact and in place, and the people (white blood cells) must unite against the invading forces (viruses). Hegemonies are not destroyed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-hegemonic_globalization">but countered</a> (that is what&#39;s happening to our human culture – our potential a body of great nations has been sacrificed for the benefit of a few),</p>

<p>As for a name? I nominate The <em>General Union</em>. Those words could/ should strike fear into fear mongering globalists everywhere...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>3 of your ideas really stand out. first, Non-violence is key. Any movement would be a PR based thing and violence would get the group smeared in the media and lose support. second, Building our identity and clearly what we stand for. Third, dismantling the system would never work. It just needs to be cleaned up, rid of corruption, and appropriate oversight and watchdogs without conflicts of interest need to be put in place.</p>
