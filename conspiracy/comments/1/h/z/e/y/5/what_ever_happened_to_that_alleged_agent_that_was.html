<p>I know it was three whole weeks ago, but I saw the vid on Youtube and he said his name was David (can&#39;t remember last name).  I remember seeing a headline shortly after that they HAD connected the name to a former CIA or NSA agent, but the story went dark after that.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find the video online anymore, so was wondering if anyone else was thinking about this or has any more info.</p>

<p>Edit:Daniel not David</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With every keystroke we are actively spreading the word of the truth.  People are telling themselves that they don&#39;t have time to worry about this.  </p>

<p>To be honest I could say the same thing.  I just got married about 2 weeks ago.  I have two young children.  A mortgage, bills, and 177 other things to worry about.  </p>

<p>Clearly the US Constitution does not matter to DC anymore.  They have made this clear.  The only way we are going to be able to fight this without being labeled enemies of the State, extremists or terrorists is by electing people to office like ourselves.  People who go to DC to make a difference not to just get money and power.  These people need to go to Washington and shrink the government to a size that is manageable and ultimately completely transparent.  </p>

<p>As of now we have elected officials that are elitists.  They feel they know better than us because of a degree they received from a prestigious university.  I have always loves this quote.  </p>

<p>&quot;I am obliged to confess I should sooner live in a society governed by the first two thousand names in the Boston telephone directory than in a society governed by the two thousand faculty members of Harvard University.&quot;  - William F. Buckley Jr.</p>

<p>He was also a huge opponent on the so called War on Drugs the US has been waging for decades.</p>

<p>EDIT: Added a line about shrinking government.  Thought I should be more clear.</p>

<p>False. The SYSTEM is corrupt. When you feed it individuals, those individuals become corrupt. Peaceful non-compliance, and communal self reliance. That is the only way. </p>

Just trying to get on the same page with your version of history here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Defence Secretary said that the US had already begun &quot;spikes of activity&quot; to put pressure on the regime. No decisions had been taken, but he thought the most likely timing in US minds for military action to begin was January, with the timeline beginning 30 days before the US Congressional elections.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran. We should work up a plan for an ultimatum to Saddam to allow back in the UN weapons inspectors. This would also help with the legal justification for the use of force.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Apologies, there&#39;s more than one AUMF, and I am fuzzy on the dates. The Downing Street Memos show that debate was underway about the correct course of action and that the Bush Administration felt it needed to make it&#39;s case for unilateral executive power to declare war TO THE UN, which was in front of my face. Powell, as you know, was part of the executive cabinet. He was sent to THE UN with cooked information to put &#39;a nail in the coffin&#39; of the UN debate over giving the US Executive unilateral power to proceed with the PNAC agenda already drafted and decided on. </p>

<p>I was confused about who Powell made the presentation to. Powell made his presentation to the UN Security Council in February of 2003. Downing Street Memos would have context in this case, and places this presentation after the passage of the AUMF in Congress. There was still debate at the international level, and I gave our cowards in Congress too much credit for reasons I can only attribute to the foggy passage of time.</p>

<p>You were correct, but in my defense it&#39;s christfucking hard to keep all this criminal activity straight in your head 10+ years out. Thanks for making me revisit the facts. </p>

<p>No, he was sent to the UN. He gave his speech at the UN. He did so almost five months AFTER Congress had already voted (by fillibuster-proof majorities) to authorize the war. </p>

<p>The purpose of that speech was to convince the UN, not congress. Congress had already given Bush everything he needed at that point.</p>

<p>No they&#39;re not.  Seems like they&#39;ve gotten worse as a matter of fact.  However, think about two different scenarios:  In one, you have a situation where everyone was doing what I was doing.  In another, you have a situation where everyone was doing what <em>you</em> are doing.</p>

<p>Which one do you think would result in a better world?  I think if everyone were doing what I was doing, then we would have a world where everyone would be or at least have the opportunity to be equal, intelligent, educated, and not  lied to and manipulated.  If everyone were doing what you are doing right here, however, we would have the world that...well...very similar to the world that we actually live in right now where we are lied to, manipulated, dumbed down, coerced, etc, etc...and it continues to happen because we don&#39;t really do enough to stop it...so it keeps going on and happening over and over again.</p>

<p>We are sheep.  We are cattle.  We are serfs being manipulated and enslaved...and it&#39;s greatly due to the efforts/non-efforts of people like you that this continues on.</p>

<p>So get up and <em>do</em> something as opposed to doing what you&#39;re doing here, because if you <em>did</em> do something closer to what I and others were doing, then the world would be very different and much better than the one we&#39;re currently living in.  I don&#39;t know if you care about that much one way or the other, but...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you&#39;re going to solve this by having some protests?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gandhi did more in one minute than you will ever, <em>ever</em> do in your entire slaving life by effectively and correctly protesting...so yeah.  Protesting is definitely a start.</p>

<p>How old are you?  What&#39;s your life like?  Are you like...15, 16?  Or...are you a super multi-millionaire?  I wonder because it seems all of your posts seem to indicate that you are in no way sensitive to what is <em>really</em> going on in the world and in this country.  If you <em>did</em> know what&#39;s really going on and if you <em>were</em> sensitive, then you would simply know a lot more than you do.  You wouldn&#39;t say the things you&#39;re saying.  It&#39;s greatly ignorant, and I wonder what life circumstances you&#39;re experiencing or have experienced that have caused you to be this very clueless and unaware of what&#39;s really going on in the world.</p>

<p>Good luck (no /s).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you know. US Embassy Official being kidnapped takes his last opportunity in public to scream about how he&#39;s being taken, how they are going to kill him, how he is being made an &quot;unperson&quot;, how they will kill his wife, how he is about to be disappeared, is not taken seriously.</p>

<p>Then he lands in the Unites States and is disappeared. Whereabouts unknown since June 13, it is now a month later and he&#39;s still missing. The media goes silent after making it seem like he threatened(rather than tried to make people aware of a threat to them) NSA/CIA/NRO employees.</p>

<p>&quot;Lol crazy conspiracy theorist freaks out about how he&#39;s being disappeared on a flight from Hong Kong&quot; ..disappears as soon as he lands never to be heard from again. &quot;Hahaha!&quot;.</p>

<p>Desaparacidos used to be a mexican/south american phenomenon, where political dissidents or whistleblowers/witnesses/activists would be disappeared by &quot;criminals&quot;/the police/taken by the army never to be heard from again. The new generation of desaparacidos(the disappeared) are American.</p>

<p>&quot;Taken to a mental hospital &#39;for an evaluation&#39;&quot; ..disappeared, whereabouts unknown. This is the first public example of this, take note. This is how it happens. Some people go quietly, some people scream and cry, then they disappear. They are the disappeared ones.</p>
