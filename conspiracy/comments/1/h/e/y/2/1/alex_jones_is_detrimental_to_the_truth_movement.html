       If you were to talk to a random person on the street and ask them who Alex Jones was and they responded in the the affirmative, their next likely response will be something along the lines of "the conspiracy theory guy that thinks 9/11 was an inside job?".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average joe doesn't care at all about geopolitics and the international monetary system and the rife corruption at every corner in public office. When he thinks of conspiracy theories, he equates them to aliens, and as far as the more internet savvy, preachers of Icke's reptilian theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones's has made an effort to be the poster child for conspiracy theories. I must admit, I would listen to his show everyday at work because he was at least talking about things CNN and other news networks wouldn't touch, although his delivery was a little much. I didn't think much of it. Then I can across this gem of a video of AJ completely sabotaging a Libertarian 2nd amendment rally in Austin where he divides the crowd and tries to take over and make them seem radicalized.

       if you are interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was instantly turned off. It was a shame too; Alex did talk about real shit from time, and I know people who would have never opened their minds if it wasn't for him, but then I realized he's hurting our cause rather than helping it.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Sandy Hook and Jones went on Pier Morgan's propaganda showcase house, he went absolutely berserk (click
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZvMwcluEg">
        here
       </a>
       if you are interested). He starts frothing at the mouth saying "1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!" implying and possibly trying to incite a riot of violent revolution, which would really be just what TPTB would want.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, I started to speculate...
      </p>
      <p>
       What is Alex really trying to do? Is he actually trying the
       <em>
        hurt
       </em>
       the movement? The MSM has been having him on to represent conspiracy theorists and he always blows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard about him working for Zionists, although honestly, I dont really care what any despots philosophy on authoritarianism is, I only want to identify and destroy the means by which they are able to exact their plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Alex is a scapegoat. A figure head everyone can immediately identify a face with for the term 'conspiracy theorist'. He is a lost leader, and more and more I'm starting to think he's getting paid to be that way...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone have any legitimate information about Alex being illegitate and working for the 'bad guys'?

       Aside from the man being a buffoon and not being able to filter bullshit, he's also a complete egomaniac and shameless self-promoter. Every twenty minutes he starts talking about how great he is, then says "I'm not bragging," or some shit AFTER he went on and on about how he's so much smarter than everyone. He cares about one thing- himself.

       I think this sums in up nicely. Alex Jones has been developing his schtick, and a line of products, for almost two decades and has followed the "persona formula" taught by Marketing guru Dan Kennedy to the letter: Pick a schtick and a persona, and stick to it under all circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Jones appeared on Piers Morgan, there was no doubt he was going to foam at the mouth. That's his schtick. Morgan's producers knew it and they got exactly the performance they wanted. Jones won from that too because his cheering section saw exactly what they believe is "necessary to wake up the sheep."

       It's true, the man often speaks the truth and has woken up tens of thousands of people. I love much of his work.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, he has done more to marginalize the community from the mainstream than any other single person. He makes the movement look ridiculous.

       As far as legitimate information goes, I know that his editor-in-chief
       <a href="http://www.occupycorporatism.com/alternative-media-king-hires-cia-stratfor-agent-as-publishing-editor-in-chief/">
        has worked at stratfor and stratfor subsidiaries, and authored some papers on how the US should address cyber warfare.

       I remember when he hijacked an architects for 911 event at a crucial time. They didn't want him to talk because he's not an architect but he pushed his way in some how. He went on and hogged the stage for ages and turned it in to a circus. If I remember correctly there was a load of other jones types that basically crashed the event and tried to turn it in to talk of aliens and stuff.

       I've seen various videos of him "showing up" at peaceful calm events/protests and turning them into shouting ranting rallies against peoples' will using his celebrity. It's without a doubt intentional sabotage to make any kind of legitimate truth movement look like a crazy tinfoil rally.

       I just don't see it. I'm not putting him on a pedestul by any means, but he has woken up thousands upon thousands of people - even if he IS project mocking bird. If people are too dumb to differentiate facts from his charisma later down the line, or not listen to a WORD he says, that should not bear any weight on the message. Perception is an action as well - and with actions there is responsibility.

       Dude seriously are you new to conspiracies or something?

       The only reason this shit thread has so many upvotes is the conspiratards get wet in their panties over attacking Alex Jones and love to push threads like this up on our sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that logically for a moment, the conspiratards hate Alex so much, they've dedicated an entire sub to attacking him.  If he was so ineffective at waking people up, wouldn't they be promoting him instead.

       Hate to break it to you but there's a million Alex Jones's on YouTube right now. and if you care who stupid, uninformed sheeple associate you with, then you care too much about what people think of you and you're setting yourself to conform to the herd mentality. and if AJ is disinformation then don't listen, or take what's the truth and forget the rest.

       I don't have any legit info on him working for bad guys aside from stratfor and him saying some pro israel stuff. He has also said some very anti israel stuff as well though. All in all, Jones has probably overstayed his welcome but I don't see anyone else being a good successor. Adam Kokesh is not the best we can do. Also, the dude exposed Bohemian Grove. Gotta give him credit for that.

       i'm so sick of people saying this like it's some profound or groundbreaking statement. a) nobody cares b) he's a fucking entertainer if you somehow haven't figured that out already. people just don't know how to digest the dude. christ, you might as well say dane cook "ruined" comedy...

       mike rivero is pretty good but he has the same shitty sponsors alex does and uses essentially the same rhetoric ["money junkies" as opposed to "globalists"] to be perfectly honest, i think a lot of people are just jealous of the fact that alex is a charismatic guy who managed to parlay being a conspiracy nut into a full-time career. there's a reason other entertainers like rogan and stanhope like the guy.

       I think you're asking the right question about Alex Jones: whether he - and his ilk - are here to delegitimize "conspiracy theorists" by putting a crazy face on the rational concerns a lot of Americans have about (insert your favorite conspiracy theory here). His schtick is pretty over-the-top as it is, but as you've pointed out, the minute he gets a chance to have a rational conversation on a national stage he goes bat-shit crazy. He makes it too easy for the mainstream to write him off as a delusional, bellicose, tin-hat-wearing nut job. It's a shame, really, because he could be making a bigger difference if he'd ratchet back the crazy just a tad.

       With any conspiracy personality, there are going to be fans and haters, the reason he is successful is because of his outrageous personality.  He may have a Rush Limbaugh vibe, but the stories he talks about on his show are really all that matters.  He appeals to the everyday average joe, not necessarily people on reddit.

       OP, you are wrong although in a very forgivable way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think free speech exists in America because cointelpro operations like infowars convinced you of this.  What you don't know is that genuine, calm, informed, and collected leaders in the past like Bill Cooper have inevitably been assassinated for speaking their mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooper had a worldwide broadcast before the internet was even really a thing.  When short wave operators had to pick up his station and rebroadcast it, when you had to pay out the ass for satellite time to get it overseas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones isn't half as big as Cooper and Alex has the government backing him and the benefit of 15 years of improved technology.  You perceive a lack of care, but what you don't realize is that it is only a disguise for fear.   Speaking out is VERY dangerous if you know what you are talking about.  If you've ever leaked important information in your life, you know the government visits and does it real fucking fast.  You know that America is a full on rapid response police state with brutal efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
       But people who are "red pilled" by reading online or hearing various cointelpro agents like Alex don't have the first clue about just how real all that is.

       Alex is a good news link source, nothing more. He does not represent the truth movement as a leader. But he does seem like the only one that is willing to stand up and speak out. Maybe it shouldn't be left to Alex and then complain about the job he does.

       I notice he is being trotted out quite a lot recently, and I believe it's designed to make all conspiracy theorists, of any intensity, look like kooks. When he was on that Sunday show in the UK, it was precisely because they knew he'd go off on one.

       THERE IS NO TRUTH MOVEMENT. Just quit it with that shit already! What movement? The one on the internet that posts fucking memes and bullshits every day and solves NOTHING? Conspiracy fucktards that circle jerk each other and get NO WHERE? I'm not here defending Alex Jones, because the man has his flaws, but at least that guy is actually accomplishing things unlike the lot of you people on here that criticize his every god damned move.

       Alex Jones is a good entry point for people who are unaware of the situation. Only if they're willing to look beyond Infowars will they get to the real truth. He's part of the control the opposition theory. He will not speak truthfully about the elephant in the room.

       He's reaching new levels of ridiculous lately. Just like how the media will focus on the tinfoil hat wearing, obviously insane individuals when covering these topics, these types of TV personalities like Beck and Jones simply service the push for the marginalization of these topics and the idea of questioning the status quo etc.

       You know something is wrong, but you don't know what. The truth of the matter is that the leaders of your truth/conspiracy movements are two faced. How can this be? I'll explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex is demonically possessed, and its not like the movies make it out to be. The way you see him act is what happens when the first demon in 1:Kings 11:5 takes over a host. He is not who he says he is. This demon's name was incorrectly translated as "grove" in nearly every instance in the King James version of the bible, the 1 Kings line is an exception. This demon is incredibly deceitful and will wrap itself in Christianity to cloak what its doing. Its so dangerous due to the law of attraction:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Your mind is your preview to life's coming attractions" -Albert Einstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your mind is a magnet and you attract what you think - if you listen to Alex all the time, you're going to manifest that Hell into your life and it will make your spirits will fall, which is what this demon does.

       Alex's flagship station in Austin is owned by Zionist Jeffrey Smulyan, CEO of Emmis (Hebrew for 'Truth') Communications. Mr. Smulyan attends the yearly "Cremation of Care" ceremonies at Bohemian Grove...which is how Agent Jones "infiltrated" the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, his employee Molly Maroney was employed by Austin-based STRATFOR...owned by (you guessed it!) Zionist George Friedman.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has direct links to Stratfor (the civilian CIA) as well as COINTELPRO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, just search Google. You will learn all about his connections to Zionists and intelligence agencies.

       I disagree. I think that he has stayed a long and straight course. He cites pretty well. He has been the loudest voice for the movement for the longest time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the cnn/fox bots want to call him crazy means nothing. They would be calling ANYONE who was as vocal as he has been crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is some of his stuff a bit too conservative/right. Yes. But it is in part his OPINION.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has had the highprofile guests, the government whistleblowers, and the oportunity to speak more publicly than anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is part of the waking up. Proof? How about all the MSM guys trying to coat tail ride the IDEA of truth and info...trotting out pop-shills like Glen Beck, regurgitating what EVERYONE has been saying for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not about to fabricate or twist the situation so that certain people who (who in my opinion just WISH they were as successful as he has been, that is the motivation.) dislike him for whatever reason can toss him (or anyone they don't approve of) under a bus.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know who really makes the movement look bad? David Icke.  Nancy Lieder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, If a person cannot fact check, or understand that someone is providing info AND opinion and so seperate that opinion from the info...they don't CARE about the info. Has he posted incorrect info. Yep. Should he do more to retract mistakes? Probably. Has he been one of the most vocal, persistant, invested spreader of things that ARE true? Absolutely. Is he one of the biggest successful spreaders of truths nationally? Yep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought that anything that got MORE people listening to the truths is a positive thing. I thought that anyone who invests as much as he doesn't HAVE to, is proving that his intentions are genuine. I thought going mainstream was the goal. Is it not?

       As right as you may be, I feel his delivery of information is a circus. He yells, screams, etc... The 4 commercials play every 8 minutes. His ego is larger than all of us combined. I appreciate what he's done for the movement, but I can't buy into his product.  Just not my thing.

       He is the epitome of American linguistic characteristics seen in a conversation. He interrupts, yells, &amp; mixes in emotional thought. Personally I feel all the info he has put together appears to be what's made him crazy, &amp; the fact that anyone on radio/tv becomes a character in some way. My favorite thing about him are his guest, introduced me to Max Keiser, LOVE THE KEISER REPORT!!!! He is my favorite voice in the movement.

       Annoyingly loud. Yep. So they hired far more reasonable reporters to do a good portion of the work. And lately from the sound of it, he has someone off set telling him to calm the fuck down....only turning his loud opinion loose once a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me this is a positive effort and funny as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for selling things. He skips his ad placement and plugs very often. Who does that?! Everyone who says he is a shill just or primarily for offering selected products is an idiot. Running the show costs real money. Expantion costs even more money.
       <em>
        gasp
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if he starts plugging Apple, google, Microsoft, or McDonalds I'll grant that bitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only things he does that really makes me irritated is the Self-plugging/grandstanding....but who else is going to? Every radio personality does in one way or another. And the religous stuff. But I'm sure this falls under opinon and treat it as such. Still...irks.

       Alex Jones can make some points. I'll give him that much(although, it doesn't take a genius to know that our current government is becoming more authoritarian by the day). What really upsets me is how ignorant he acts. Look up the countless anti-gay videos he has made, the video where he talks about evolution, the videos where he interviews Noam Chomsky and the Zeitgeist guy, and the other embarrassing videos he has created. I don't think he's a shill(really hate using that term) but he definitely does damage to the truth movement.
