       People need to feel they are directly effected (they already are) before they will do anything at all. They've been told again, and again and been shown without doubt they are being overseen by unimaginable, corrupt, evil people and still they do fucking nothing. There's also now a chilling effect after the recent NSA revelations and who exactly is going to want to protest or organise one when any kind of hot word like 'protest' or 'revolution' can be filtered out and processed and the people dealt with?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's already possible right now to shut down groups of people very quickly and co-opt who ever they want.

       It's kind of sad how one of the biggest scandals comes to light affecting most, if not all americans, yet no one seems to care. Everywhere else in the world you see protests (even in Hong Kong) and uprisings. Nope, not in "the land of the free".

       I'm thinking that if tens of millions of people were sending emails with small encrypted files that were mostly meaningless that it could really help to glut the NSA computer systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       How to deal with this?  Deadly humour.
      </p>
      <p>
       So imagine that every major desktop email program had a plugin that first downloaded the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0">
        RickRoll'D
       </a>
       video.  Then every email would create a small encrypted attachment that was derived from an arbitrarily small clip of the RockRoll'D video.  Some would be 0.5s and others would be 10s long.  If you listen to the lyrics of the song it is somehow stunningly appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then assume that the NSA has some badass super computer grids and some new mathematical theorems that significantly cut down on the amount of time taken to decrypt a signal.  What would they get?  Endless, fucking endlessly RickRoll'D.  It would be humerous for them at first but it time they would begin to feel terribly petty.  The best part about it is that it is with incredibly wity and with great humour.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a technical solution for a lot of these problems.  They have already increased the noise to signal ratio of our MSM to a ridiculous place.  We can do the same to them.  Run a TOR exit node.  Participate in the Dark Net.  Shine laser pointers on the protest helicopters.  Participate in a DOS attack against an undesirabe entity.  Do a whole bunch of stuff.  Hell, maybe even stop paying taxes.  Plant a fruit tree.
      </p>

       [edit] We've known each other for so long.  You're hearts been aching but you've been too shy to say it.  We know the game and we're gonna play it.  I just want to tell you how I'm feeling.  Gotta make you understand.  Never gonna give you up.  Never gonna let you down.  Never gonna run around and desert you.  Never gonna make you cry.  Never gonna say goodbye.

       The NSA stores these emails. They do not decrypt them until their predictive AI behaviour models flag you as a person of interest, such as being associated with WikiLeaks or Edward Snowden.

       Fine, make it take hours, days or to decrypt me once they are targeting me.  Multiplied out it means that they need to actually focus down on high value targets and not everyone.  The police could always stake outside of your house but it required a high amount of resource.  If the stakeout becomes near free then there is a problem.

       it's NOT the government that's too powerful, it's the Secret Government that's too powerful...In 1947 President Truman signed the National Secrurity Act which, among other things, gave birth to the CIA...the Agency from Day 1 exceeded it's charter and began to subvert U.S. and International Laws...By Dec. 22, 1963 (former) President Truman was calling for the Agency to be limited to it's original, intended function. Truman wrote an editorial calling for the CIA to be limited to intelligence functions exactly one month after JFK was sassassinated

       We have all become enamored with our own self worth. We have lives, jobs, family, things that we care about for the now, not the future. I think because of this mentality that we have become docile and compliant with the current status quo. We can not risk our family and career to protest even if we feel that the crimes our government are inexcusable and atrocious. Most feel that what ever comes comes and we can't do anything about, we just go vote whoever our 'party' affiliate is and go home.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be that many are afraid as well, afraid of what might happen if they did protest. The media has become very good at twisting every story about any civil disobedience that occurs, pointing out only trouble makers, which are most likely FBI plants to disrupt peaceful protests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our society has become too materialistic, to reliant on trinkets and not of their own hands and knowledge. Who can repair a pair of shoes, a car, a bike, plant a garden. We buying everything all the time and never consider that this sort of thing is completely unsustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't get me wrong, the government is afraid of what we are capable of, it knows that if we did rally, there would be no end, and the elite would start to loss money, and they can't have that, so they would throw anything and everything at us, tear us apart, and FEMA camps us all, if they could. We are a country divide by even the most petty things. This division is purposefully fed by everyone so we don't stand as one and tell the elite and the corrupt government workers that we have had enough. The second we can get everyone rolling, we will win. Until then, we are bickering children being monitored by Big Brother.

       Can't blame the government for poverty.  Companies would pay you $1 per hour or less if they could.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, I agree.  The government has gotten too powerful and so have the big corporations, Wall Street and the banks.  LIBOR isn't being talked about enough.  There's corruption from every direction.
