<p>That depends on how you define &quot;we&quot;.  In the upper most circles of the people who actually run the world country distinctions don&#39;t matter. What seems to matter is that there are two classes of people: us and them. &quot;Us&quot; being the common working folk. &quot;Them&quot; being the above mentioned controlling class. They want everything to themselves and want us to have nothing, ultimately. </p>

<p>True. I suspect this is as a result of the upper class having access to resources and control of these resources that facilitate suppression of discussion and/or information. Also, a lot of people are afraid to lose what little they have with little or no hope of any viable alternative. This would seem to have the effect of keeping the volume to a mild roar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is another class as well. This class is the wealthy (at least by working class standards) and comfortable upper middle class that thinks they are part of the ruling elite. In reality they aren&#39;t, and most of the jobs that put them in that position are paid so much because their daily work contributes to keeping the people down. </p>

<p>These people, who think they are part of the ruling class, are going to have a real shock when the game comes to an end. Which it will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we let them do a fly-over scan of Canada last year, we invited them to NORAD and their special-ops guys have been training with our guys for a while.  </p>

<p>It seems pretty obvious to me that once Syria boils over and the world is pulled into chaos, the American military and police force will be called in to restore/keep order. Once they have fulfilled their role, they will be disposed of, enabling the foreign forces of the NWO to implement agenda 21 and to place the UN in control as the world police.  That&#39;s my take at least, who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the excuse to go train overseas on the taxpayer dime (work plus some down time aka semi vacation), thats got to be desirable for US and Russian FEMA type peoples.</p>

<p>Ask any working person, would they go for weeks or month on an exchange training program, most would to alleviate the normal boring work schedule.</p>
