       It's rare that I am shocked these days by something new I learn about history but I was surprised to learn of the clearly exposed links to British corproate agents in these presidential assassinations. It isn't highlighted in US history classes!
      </p>
      <p>
       To save you some time I have highlighted the important 30 second parts of the 58 minute documentary and if that peeks your interest you might want to watch the whole thing from the beginning. Watch these parts however for about 30 second each to get the jist of it.

       President Mckinley explains in a speech his direct support of Protectionism and stands against the British world exploitation plan and draws British spies against him who would later assassinate him.

       lots more at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       When FDR died however the british corporat eman Wilson again worked for corporate Free trade and the suppression of individual national self development.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say this documentary is rather staggering and explains a lot of otherwise unexplained assasinations and a pattern of planned divisions and insurrections around the world whenever the British East India world wide corporate hegemony is challenged by leaders who prefer their own countries self development under protection from cheap foreingn goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       (rememeber even first President George Washington who afterall directly literally fought Britain installed protectionist trade barriers to ensure the USA woudl grow it's own industries and not be a sefrvant of worldwide British corporate oligopolies.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have to say that while this is put together by someone who has always seemed like a nutcase to me - Linden LaRouche - it is hard to argue with the direct quotes from the historical individuals and the named conspirators inthe assasinations that he presents here. Perhaps Larouche has finally hit on a real story worth telling.

       Wow that is something very new. I look forward to reading on this (you gave a lot of links). I knew about their hand with a large mercenary army controlling the Asia trade. Like enslaving for coffee plantations, Tea plantations and Opium. Then causing a war in China over such. Then enslaving Polynesians for copra.

       Pretty much an evil empire.

       LaRouche is crazy, but it's intersting that everyone who goes down that rabbit hole comes to the same conclusion.

       I wish this was true, it would be nice to think of ourselves as running the world instead of being an over-crowded clapped out country. But it's a fantasy, a long held fantasy of perfidious Albion that has been trotted out for 200 years and is merely picked up by nuts like LaRouche. He's behind the game though. The real fun about Britain lies in Icke's Reptilians. Long live Her Majesty!

       The East India company is the antithesis of free trade. Free trade means me and you being able to ship each other stuff from around the world without violent interference by gangs or governments. Don't blame my freedom for the tyranny of the East India company, you are playing into their hand. Learn some economics before espousing collectivist rhetoric without even knowing it.

       OP's post is Larouche/Tarpley bullshit. The British system of corporatism and government privelages to the one percent is the system Larouchies support. America fought to free itself from this system, and jeffersonian anti federalists clashed with hamiltonian corporatists who wanted it in place. Lincoln's war was underwritten by crony capitalist banksters like the Cookes. American imperialism does not advance genuine free trade, but neoliberal mercantilism, where the US dumps subsidized goods on countries and bombs other nations to access natural resources. FDR, hamilton, and lincoln were all corporatists who sought to establish a centralized state. The new deal was written and supported by one percent corporatist oligarchs like Gerald Swope and the brain trust. The NRA cartelized industry and was favored by big business. The 1933 coup was an attempt to make FDR dictator, not overthrow him. Read fact based conspiracy theorists, not disinformation shills.
