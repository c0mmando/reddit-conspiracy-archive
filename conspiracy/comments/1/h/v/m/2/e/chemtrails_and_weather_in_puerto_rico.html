    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because the cold front that&#39;s causing the impending weather system is making the vapour trails from the aircraft flying overhead more visible.</p>

<p>What you are seeing it water vapor, the same stuff that makes clouds. When an aircraft burns fuel the byproducts include carbon dioxide and water, just like with a car. If you took a car to 33,000 feet and looked at the tailpipe, you&#39;d see exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>There is no evidence for the existence of chemtrails, it&#39;s just a theory  invented by those who wish to label all conspiracy theorists as wacko&#39;s.  It&#39;s a shame so many people believe it. It&#39;s nothing more than an experiment to see how far people will go with a crazy idea and a sense of injustice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pointfive is neither insane nor blind. Chemtrails do not exist. Simple physics says they cannot exist. What you see in the sky are contrails, pure and simple. A huge contrail stretching from horizon to horizon contains thousands  of tons of ice - far more material than any aircraft could ever carry to that altitude. Contrails are a product of burning hydrocarbon fuel in a cold wet atmosphere and they can be predicted with complete accuracy simply by looking at a weather forecast. They have been happening ever since aircraft flew high enough to create them - the first one was reported in 1922.
The idea that these contrails are part of a conspiracy is speculation and the conspiracy theorists themselves cannot even agree which conspiracy theory they are part of. Is it depopulation? Mind control? Weather control? Earthquakes on demand? All of these bizarre theories can be debunked quite easily because they are simply conjecture without any evidence to support them. Yet people still promote them. Why is that?
One possibility is that &#39;chemtrail theory&#39; is part of a disinformation campaign to take the focus off geo-engineering by trivialising it. Some chemtrail believers insist on using the words &#39;chemtrail&#39; and &#39;geo-engineering&#39; interchangeably, as if they are the same thing. Are they the real government shills? They conflate the very real issue of geo-engineering with the bullshit surrounding chemtrails and their alleged doomsday uses.  As a result, geo-engineering gets rubbished as just another woowoo fantasy for the tinfoil hat brigade.  Some aspects of geo-engineering are very troubling - who knows what the long-term effects of filling the upper atmosphere with chemicals could be? What better way of diverting public attention than by pointing to annoying but harmless contrails coming off commercial airliners and saying &quot;that&#39;s geo-engineering&quot;,  while the real dirty work is done by specially modified military aircraft at night.</p>

All I said you are being willfully naive and the video shows that. Is is one of these short bursts of what you claim are contrails. Bursts on. Bursts off. The trail starts and ends quickly. Sometimes it comes back on. Sometimes it&#39;s just a burst. The conclusion would be, if you deniers are right, that pilots are up there flipping the engines on and off. The denying just kills me.

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever seen mackerel clouds? The ones with hundreds of densely packed bands of cloud? That banding happens at all scales, like a fractal. If the aircraft flies through alternating bands of moist and dry air it will leave an intermittent contrail.
By the way, calling somebody is shill is a personal attack. It&#39;s an attempt to discredit my argument by insinuating I have an ulterior motive. It is a cheap and dishonest way of conducting a debate.</p>

<p>I could argue that in fact God put them there, since you have no way of proving he didn&#39;t. As you are arguing, &#39;they are chemtrails and there&#39;s no way you can prove to me they aren&#39;t&#39;.</p>

<p>I admire your persistence, and salute you for trying to uncover injustice, or whatever your motives may be. I believe they are good. However, chemtrails are a dead end.

Financial and government corruption for example, the real geopolitical reasons behind the war in Syria, the mysterious case of Michael Hastings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your accusation of wilful naivety is your opinion presented as fact. Just like the claims that chemtrails exist. Just like I could say, the whole chemtrail conspiracy is a CIA psyop designed to misdirect and distract truth seekers, keeping a whole bunch of people occupied, who might otherwise be using their energy to uncover real secrets and real facts. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my opinion, it&#39;s by no means a fact, I have no evidence to back it up so it&#39;s just my opinion. </p>

<p>For example, the 911 truthers, while being painted by the mainstream media as nutjobs have gone a long way to presenting scientific fact (melting points of steel) and hard visual proof (building 7) that backs up their claim that the towers were bought down and didn&#39;t fall down of their own accord. They have some very well respected scientists fighting their corner, and I for one am with them. </p>

<p>Chemtrails however are simply science fiction. I have yet to see any facts presented that can not be debunked by science. Pointing a camera at the sky and saying &#39;I see it, therefore it exists&#39; is not a fact. It&#39;s the same level of reasoning that had us believe the world is flat and the earth is at the centre of the solar system.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to be proven wrong if you want to show me some. A lot of what I&#39;ve seen presented as evidence can be easily disproved if you have either knowledge of how weather works, or a good knowledge of commercial aviation. </p>

<p>If you have hard facts to back up the claim the chemtrails exist I&#39;m still open minded. I strongly believe 911 was an inside job based on the evidence I&#39;ve seen so I&#39;m by no means a closed minded skeptic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In answer to both those points:</p>

<p>Under certain atmospheric conditions, water vapour from contrails condenses and spreads to form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_cloud#Contrails">cirrus clouds</a>. This explains why contrails linger in certain areas and do not dissipate.</p>

<p>To answer your point about grids. The skies above our heads are broken up into what are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_(aviation">airways</a>). These highways in the sky are vital to keeping commercial air traffic on course and separated by safe distances. If you were to look at the locations of grid contrails and overlay a map of airways, it&#39;s extremely probable you&#39;d see a correlation between the two. Therefore both those points can be easily explained. </p>

<p>Now, having said all that, I&#39;m definitely not discounting the theory that things like cloud seeding experiments don&#39;t take place, as this has been proven as fact by several sources. </p>

<p>But, the idea that a secret global cabal has access to a giant fleet of unmarked tanker planes that spray the earths population with mind altering substances is a work of pure science fiction with no hard facts that I&#39;ve seen to back up any chemtrail claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>That is a myth which gets repeated so often that some people believe it is true. Long persistent contrails have been <a href="http://depletedcranium.com/the-realities-of-contrails">observed and photographed</a>  since at least WWII. How long a contrail persists depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. If the upper atmosphere is cold and wet then the contrails will stretch from horizon to horizon. If it&#39;s dry they will be short lived. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why are there planes flying in a distinct pattern</p>

<p>The check pattern is simply due to two different flight paths crossing at different altitudes. One pilot will never fly directly in the contrail of the aircraft in front because of the loss of visibility and the wake of turbulence. There is always at least five minutes separation between aircraft on the same flight path, so often the contrail will be blown to one side before the next aircraft comes through, which can often lead to dozens of visible trails in an apparent parallel formation.</p>

<p>Too bad its only 1 plane doing this, not several. Also, how big are these trails so they have to move several hundred feet in another direction to avoid them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k7PtRlMuz0">or you can sit there and try to explain to me how you can turn contrails on and off</a></p>

<p>Or look at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wshBhDlI1dY">pilot</a> who admitted he doesnt know what hes spraying, or the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFG2y_Mxl3Q">doctor</a></p>

<p>Also, that blog you linked to is weak and has been passed around more than a college freshman. Considering how the pictures on the blog themselves contradict his explanations, i dont know why youd pick it as a credible source.</p>

<p>Sorry, but saying chemtrails dont exist is like saying the sun doesnt rise and set. Everything you and that blog listed can be proven wrong with a simple look up to the sky. There is a 30 year pilot in the cubicle next to me and even he laughed when i asked if contrails linger in the sky for hours and block out the sun.</p>

<p>No they don&#39;t, and this is exactly the point that I&#39;m trying to make. Geo-engineering is real but chemtrails are not. All the while that you and other chemtrail believers spend telling the rest of us to &quot;look up&quot; etc at harmless contrails is time that you could spend worrying about something real. There are plenty of threats out there which have been proven, such as the idiot dumping iron into the ocean in Queen Charlotte Sound, without needing to make stuff up. One day, a few years ago, a conspiracy theorist looked up at a contrail and decided it was part of a plot to take over the world. They had absolutely no proof then, and there is still no proof now. But the idea gained traction and now there is a whole army of people repeating it, and &#39;proving&#39; it by quoting other conspiracy theorists in an enormous circle jerk. It&#39;s got so ridiculous that now we have a sub conspiracy going with people thinking they can disperse contrails by spraying vinegar into the air. Have you ever heard of anything quite so ridiculous? People actually stand in the garden spraying vinegar into the air believing it will have an immediate effect on a cloud of ice crystals seven miles up in the atmosphere. The word &#39;delusional&#39; just does not do it justice.
I challenge you to find one single commercial airline pilot who will go on record and say they believe in chemtrails. You won&#39;t. Any real pilot you speak to will tell you the same as I am saying: chemtrails don&#39;t exist and the white trails in the sky are simply ice crystals.
There is a simple scientific explanation for contrails which explains them completely without any need for any conspiracy, chemicals, or cover-ups. Why is it so hard for you to accept?</p>

<p>Collecting samples with high levels of barium simply proves that somebody is seeding barium into the atmosphere. It is no secret that governments are using these techniques for weather control. It does not logically follow that this barium is coming from chemtrails and there is no evidence to say that it is. Established Geo-engineering techniques involve modified aircraft, artillery, and rockets, can adequately account for unusual levels of barium in the atmosphere.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I completely agree with you. The way governments are tinkering with the ecological balance of the planet is frightening. Raised levels of silver iodide, barium, and nano particles of who knows what in the atmosphere means we are breathing in a cloud of poison with every breath. I don&#39;t think anyone is deliberately out to poison us, I just think they are oblivious, in their arrogance, to the long-term effects of what they are doing.</p>

<p>But chemtrails are just a red herring. There is no evidence to link airborne pollution with the white trails in the sky. There is, on the other hand, plenty of evidence to show that these contrails are a natural phenomena.</p>

<p>Which came from...a plane! So that makes it...a chemtrail! now were moving somewhere.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Modifying an aircraft to disperse dry ice or silver iodine doesnt require an introduction of a new chemical, but rather simply strapping a tank and a dispenser.</p>

<p>Rockets MIGHT use barium nitrate for its fuel, but unless there are rockets being shot off all over the city (where someone is bound to notice) they cant account for the high levels of Barium. The only real option left is that theyre pumping it out of generators on the ground, but then the chemicals in the air would be concentrated, rather than distributed evenly across an area </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just think they are oblivious, in their arrogance, to the long-term effects of what they are doing.</p>

<p>Then why Barium? why Aluminum? these pose no real use in geoengineering. And why the secrecy (as in that pilot video)? rule of thumb: if the government is hiding something, it bears investigation. This is simple poisoning of the people. Barium breaks down your immune system, Aluminum shreds your brain and theres 5 or 6 other chemicals off the top of my head, each of which has detrimental effects on health. </p>

<p>Id also like to say these high levels are only found in places with lots of chem-trails present.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Which came from...a plane! So that makes it...a chemtrail!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t make that connection. Chemtrail believers cite a number of factors which distinguish between chemtrails and ordinary contrails. One is that contrails are short lived while chemtrails are persistent and spread. Another is that if there are more than one or two contrails in the sky then they are chemtrails, especially if they form a grid pattern.</p>

<p>My answer to the first is that the persistence of a contrail depends on temperature, humidity, and pressure, and nothing else. The persistence of contrails can be predicted by consulting a weather forecast.</p>

<p>My answer to the second is that parallel contrails are due to the number of aircraft now flying. 30 years ago the skies were nearly empty and contrails were quite rare. Now the skies are clogged with aircraft and many routes are often at capacity (which also accounts for the U-turn contrails – planes now have to fly around in circuits to wait for a place in the landing queue). A pilot following the aircraft in front will fly to one side of its flight path to avoid the contrail and turbulence. If the contrails are persistent then they will appear as parallel lines.</p>

<p>Modifying existing commercial aircraft to carry small quantities of chemicals is feasible, but anything more than 50 to 100 gallons is going to be very difficult to hide, and even if the actual release is remotely controlled the flight crew are going to notice the sudden change in weight and/or centre of gravity. Also, that small quantity of chemicals cannot account for a 20 mile long, mile wide plume coming out of the back of the aircraft.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why there are raised levels of barium, aluminium and so on in the atmosphere. I would guess it is part of some geo-engineering project. I just don&#39;t believe that chemtrails are the delivery vector for it. If the government was spraying something to have a direct effect on us humans than it would make much more sense to do it at low altitude and at night, not at 30,000 feet in broad daylight where everyone within 50 miles can see it. Chemtrails just don&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A man who collected high levels of Barium, although the lab reports check out, is still anecdotal since we are not shown how or where he collected them. Thats a HUGE gap in this &#39;proof&#39; which needs filling.</p>

<p>A pilot who says he was spraying something and didn&#39;t know what it was is simply conjecture. He said, she said. How can you prove it is something if you can&#39;t prove it isn&#39;t something? Just because he didn&#39;t know what he was spraying doesn&#39;t mean you can make up an answer.</p>

<p>The visual data you presented can easily be explained by science, and has been for many decades.</p>

<p>However, you then try and add weight to your argument and validate it by saying; &#39;because our food is poisoned&#39; (yes, we all agree, pesticides are real) and because your water is poisoned (yes water is polluted and there&#39;s a giant vortex of plastic floating around in the middle of the pacific) &#39;our air is poisoned&#39;.</p>

<p>Yes, I would agree, our air is poisoned, by car fumes, by factories, even the fuel burned by aircraft produces polution. But that in no way means chemtrails exist. It&#39;s like saying, God exists because its his word in the bible, and the bible clearly states that God exists, therefore proof! It proves nothing.</p>

<p>until one day i looked up and i saw two planes only minutes apart. One plane had a contrail that dissipated within minutes.</p>

<p>The other plane left out a nice thin line of white smoke, i watched it and the thin line got bigger and bigger and slowly spread out and lingered there. It struck a chord with me because i saw the plane coming with no trail behind it, then suddenly a trail appeared, and then the trail disappeared as it fly off in the other direction.</p>

<p>It could very easily be argued that these planes were flying at different altitudes where the air temperature is different, therefore one produced contrails that disappeared where the other&#39;s, which was flying through colder air, turned to ice crystals and formed cirrus clouds which spread out and hung around, just like cirrus clouds do.</p>

<p>And finally, you don&#39;t find the truth just by &#39;looking&#39;. Truth comes from long and thorough investigation, through formulating theories based on evidence and then testing those theories under rigours controlled conditions, analysing the results and determining if your theories are true.</p>

<p>We should be allowed to question these theories, otherwise we&#39;re in danger of adopting a theocratic way of thinking. I have been lucky enough to have an eduction where critical thinking has been held in high regard as a way for seeking out and proving the truth. Critical thinking and the scientific method are the best ways we have found so far to explain the world we live in and to identify fact from fiction. It&#39;s critical thinking which lead to the enlightenment, the industrial revolution, the secularisation of society and the decline of religious doctrine as a way of explaining the world. It&#39;s critical thinking which uncovers the holes in the chemtrails theory and points to established fact that proves the theory to exactly what it is, nothing more than a theory. The overwhelming amount of evidence presented to the contrary that I have seen, and believe me I&#39;m happy to see as much as you can provide me, is simply conjecture, anecdotal or theoretical. None of it is fact.</p>

<p>As soon as chemtrails are proved to be real, I&#39;ll happily reverse my view, since this is the way science works, if it&#39;s proven beyond all reasonable doubt, then I&#39;ll accept the theory as fact. Just like those that believe in God. If he turns up one day and it&#39;s proven beyond all doubt he&#39;s been sitting in the sky, growing a beard and judging us all this time, I&#39;ll admit I was wrong.</p>

Our food is poisoned, our water is poisoned, but how dare we say our air is poisoned too?  Happenstance and coincidence is all you presented as evidence, and its a sad day when the conspirators can bring the more solid evidence to the table. </p>
