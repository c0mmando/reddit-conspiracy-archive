       Hello, I apologize if this post shouldn't be here, I didn't know where else to post. I'm a Texan watching my senate duke it out over abortion bills today as I have the last couple weeks, and I don't really understand the Republican angle considering how un-pro-life they are with tons of other legislation. I realized, someone's got to be benefiting from the cost of abortion tripling from $400 to $1200. Perhaps the owners of ambulatory surgical centers, the only kind of center that will be allowed to perform abortions, even pill-induced ones which will now require 4 visits instead of 2? And it just so happens that the sister of our governor Perry is vice president of government relations at United Surgical Partners International.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/obamacare-jags-rick-perrys-lobbyist-sister/">
        Here's the article
       </a>
       that links Milla Perry to the lucrative ASC business - but I haven't really linked that to offering abortions. Can any of you help me do some digging?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'd like to offer written testimony
       <em>
        today
       </em>
       to the Senate hearing that covers the financial motivations behind this legislation. Today is the Senate hearing of the bill.
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/08/us-usa-abortion-texas-idUSBRE9670BC20130708">

        Another article

      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://vine.co/v/h7qlaOu25rU">
        This was the line
       </a>
       an hour ago, just to sign a card registering opposition/support of the bill - estimated at 1,000 and growing, and it's not even 10AM on a Monday morning yet. This is really huge, especially considering voter apathy in Texas. Mike Huckabee is getting shipped in for a rally tonight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd really like to submit the written testimony to document this connection, as well as provide it to both sides of this divisive issue. Both sides have been blinded by the emotional arguments, and it's been encouraged by the politicians. It's time to uncover the real motivations behind this.

       The Republican politicians are merely giving lip-service. They don't care about babies or fetuses, they're fine with abortions. Its the Republican voters, the religious folk, that are against abortions; and the Neoconservative leadership is merely giving them a show. At the end of the day, the Neocons will always be one and the same with the Progressives; pro-Zionist, pro-war, pro-corporatism, and pro-Nanny-state. You can already see the two most outspoken Zionist Neocons – John McCain and Lindsey Graham – supporting immigration amnesty.

       Republicans LOVE abortion. Its their golden ticket issue. They get to pretend to be sooo against it, and rally all the pro-lifers around them. While at the same time do nothing to ever end it.

       Democrats love it just as much, if not more.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only 5 or 6 things the democrats and republicans really disagree on, to keep the facade of their "opposition" perpetuated
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         gay marriage

         guns
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       They both talk back and forth about these two/three issues as well, but in the end it will end up as a "compromise"- mandated change by the government, with legislation written by big business interests for big business interests.

       I applaud you for bringing an issue like this here but good luck getting momentum. Knowing this crowd, you're going to need it!
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest starting something tangible like an open letter to your local paper, inviting the student community to participate in some sort of rally or simply by distributing pamphlets.

      <p>
       You can always use these online avenues as a supplement to your real word actions.

       See my above edit. Everyone in the state is talking about this, never mind the country. Last week's rally had an estimated 6,000 in attendance. There's rallies for both sides tonight. There's already at least 1,000 people in the Capitol itself right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for real world actions - I've already spent over 40 hours at the Capitol last week. I was in the gallery for the "

       They can't wait to kill before birth? I believe pro-choice people just believe women should have the choice. They would think it's horrible to force an abortion. Their point is they don't consider a fetus in early stages of development as a full human. Science backs up that it is different but cannot prove the moral ground. This is a horrible example of a straw man if I ever saw one.
