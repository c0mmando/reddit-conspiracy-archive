        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to be a huge Alex Jones fan and protested with him a few times in Austin. I gave out tons of his DVDs and suffered massive negative karma on alt accounts on Reddit and in real life spreading the word.</p>

<p>After listening to him for years, I was finally shown the secret to the guy which I will tell you all. I always wondered why he treated his callers so bad, where his negative intensity comes from, and the reason for the weird doublespeak voice he uses to taunt callers with in a seemingly joking manner. </p>

<p>The truth is not disinfo, I&#39;m not a government agent or paid by them, but this is what is really behind this whole infowar: I was shown that Alex is possessed by one of the nastiest demons. Here is its description from the old grimoires: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is a Mighty, Strong Duke, and appeareth in the Form of an hurtful Angel riding on an Infernal Beast like a Dragon, and carrying in his right hand a Viper. Thou must in no wise let him approach too near unto thee, lest he do thee damage by his Noisome Breath. Wherefore the Magician must hold the Magical Ring near his face, and that will defend him. He giveth true answers of things Past, Present, and to Come, and can discover all Secrets. He will declare wittingly how the Spirits fell, if desired, and the reason of his own fall. He can make men wonderfully knowing in all Liberal Sciences. He ruleth 40 Legions of Spirits.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Alex appears as angel as he &quot;fights&quot; the NWO. </p></li>
<li><p>The beast it rides is the bad news he reports on, basically the stuff the demons are doing on Earth. This demon has many others that serve it. </p></li>
<li><p>The viper is the microphone he holds or the dvd he sells you. </p></li>
<li><p>The noisome breath is in reference to the way he talks, the content, and how its loud and violently delivered. </p></li>
<li><p>The parts about the &quot;how the spirits fell&quot; is what this demon is all about: The bad news it spreads is meant to lower YOUR spirits, to make you lose hope and fall. It misdirects you into thinking guns and the constitution are going to save you. This is not the case, only God can fix this and things are nowhere near as bad as it says. Its job is to depress you and its <em>very</em> bewitching. We all probably learned how the towers fell from this thing. </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;all secrets&quot; are in reference to the true secrets it tells, but they&#39;re all to lower your spirits further and to lose hope. Don&#39;t! Its what this things job is. </p></li>
<li><p>You can see how dangerous its noisome breath is to all the other radio show hosts that have gotten close to him. He always gets them kicked off after a matter of time. </p></li>
<li><p>Rhetoric, or persuasive language, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education">liberal science/art</a> and he taught me how to protest effectively in the &quot;infowar&quot; using it.</p></li>
<li><p>This demon&#39;s element is earth, and it loves oil. Its the same demon the Rockefeller family serves. Alex&#39;s family is big into oil as evidenced from his interview with Rothschild around 2007.</p></li>
<li><p>This demon is mentioned by name in the Bible and also as &quot;The Whore of Babylon.&quot; If you listen to this thing during its radio show, you&#39;ll be bombarded by all the selling out this thing does. </p></li>
<li><p>The 911 prediction before it happened is its demonic prophecy, or &quot;answers of things to come.&quot; Thank God so many of its predictions are wrong. Demonic prophecy comes to its prophets often as normal thoughts, and theres often not a way of differentiating it from other thoughts. Many of its minor prophecies are self fulfilling using the law of attraction:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This things biggest danger is tricking you into using your mind to build the New World Order. The Law of Attraction is what this thing exploits. <a href="http://www.goodnewsguardian.com/angels-and-demons-of-the-law-of-attraction-the-philosophy-and-the-key-to-heavens-gates/">Here</a> is how the law of attraction works in explicit detail, even naming the spirits. Reiyel is #29 and info about his demon shadow is in the same section. This is true Illuminati stuff, and I was told face to face by Alex&#39;s old producer Kevin Smith that Alex was Illuminati. Kevin is another one that got destroyed by its &quot;noisome breath,&quot; but he is a scumbag himself. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want anyone else to be hurt like I was by this thing. Its non-corporeal, but its very real and its one of the strongest demons. Its countered only with God and the good angel Reiyel who you should invite to help you after saying his psalm, 9:11 that has his name encoded in the Hebrew: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sing praises to Yahweh who reigns in Zion. Tell the world about his unforgettable deeds.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://demoncompany.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-not-so-beautiful-angel-of-prison.html">Here</a> is more information on what Alex really is. </p>

<p>Good luck to you all. If you are a fan of Alex you need to break its bewitchment with Reiyel&#39;s help - its impossible without God in your life. Pray for God to break its bewitchment. Don&#39;t let the spirit lowering bad news be addictive. I was lead to Alex right after I lost faith after 9/11. Atheism is a trap and the demon of Alex filled the void right after I rejected God. Corrupt governments serve this same demon, and another of its names is Columbia, as in the district. I hope this makes it clearer to you why 9/11 happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its &quot;liberal arts&quot; in two grimoires and rhetoric is a liberal art. Here is more information about liberal arts in the time that description from the grimoire was written:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>grammar, (grammar can be seen in his articles on infowars about how you&#39;re going to die)</p></li>
<li><p>logic, (the DHS is buying ammo, thus you are going to die, blah)</p></li>
<li><p>rhetoric, (already explained this one)</p></li>
<li><p>arithmetic (free fall speed of the WTC for example)</p></li>
<li><p>geometry (the shape of the NWO for example)</p></li>
<li><p>music </p></li>
<li><p>astronomy, often called astrology; both modern senses were covered</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these still apply in modern times, but modern liberal arts also include: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Visual Arts (his documentaries)</p></li>
<li><p>Great Books (he sells tons of &quot;great books&quot; that all tell you how you&#39;re going to die so you lose hope)</p></li>
<li><p>History (history of false flag terrorism and how you&#39;re going to die)</p></li>
<li><p>Languages </p></li>
<li><p>Linguistics</p></li>
<li><p>Literature</p></li>
<li><p>Mathematics</p></li>
<li><p>Music</p></li>
<li><p>Philosophy</p></li>
<li><p>Political science (this one is obvious)</p></li>
<li><p>Psychology (Alex went to college for this regarding the criminal mind, he teaches his listeners about the mindset of the NWO minions all the time)</p></li>
<li><p>Religious studies </p></li>
<li><p>Natural Science </p></li>
<li><p>Social Science</p></li>
<li><p>Performing arts</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Its active in all of these areas in ways that aren&#39;t good for mankind. It does have to keep up appearances though, and since it appears as an Angel it wants to look like a hero. Its not, its just as bad as the corrupt demons it covers in its news stories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent intention. The MASSES are enraptured/seduced by the facade (material/phsyical world) and some of us need to take responsibility to pull back the veil. And especially amongst the so called &quot;awake&quot;...being partly awake is not enough. </p>

<p>I recommend reading Rudolf Steiner as he pulled back the veil over 100 years ago and people still don&#39;t realize how critical and vital the information that he revealed is today. Start here...<a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GateSpiSci/GateSS_index.html">http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GateSpiSci/GateSS_index.html</a>. </p>

<p>That website does contain practically ALL of his work (not quite ALL but enough!) but At The Gates contains basic info and a fairly complete overview of the vital information we need to know. Steiner spoke about secret societies being in existence 100 years ago. Steiner was completely aware of the nature of evil (Lucifer-Christ-Ahriman trinity) and the necessity to bring this understanding to humanity. We are awash in Ahrimanic evil at this point in history and very few people are consciously aware of the nature of these evil times...it is technocracy and physical science that the evil is manifesting in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the awesome reply. Steiner was certainly informed. I&#39;ve read a lot of his stuff and found it very interesting. I got a bit confused about his astral body descriptions with the different sections like the ego and emotional bodies. </p>

<p>What book did he speak about this trinity? It seems Christ is outnumbered :( </p>

<p>The whole concept of nearly everyone being anonymous on the Internet, the rise in online theft via piracy,  and the worshiping of deceivers in Hollywood is certainly something that needs to be turned around. </p>

<p>Psalm 9:11 is the good angel Reiyel&#39;s psalm. There is nothing wrong with Zion. Its another word for Heaven and its also synonymous with Jerusalem. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-11.htm">Here are other translations of the awesome psalm from the Hebrew</a>, I highly recommend inviting Reiyel in before you ever listen or watch anything Alex does. Here is more info about Reiyel: <a href="http://ucm.ca/en/angels/29-reiyel.html">http://ucm.ca/en/angels/29-reiyel.html</a></p>

<p>Alex is not an angel, thats what I&#39;m trying to explain. He looks like a good guy, but hes just keeping up appearances. This demon possessing him has the appearance of an Angel, looking like someone like Alex is its modus operandi. He uses his listeners as legions to build the NWO with the law of attraction. </p>

<p>Isaiah 45:7
1599 Geneva Bible (GNV)
7 I form the [a]light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.
EDIT <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+45%3A7&amp;amp;version=GNV">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+45%3A7&amp;amp;version=GNV</a> Link </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My translations is from the NLT, which is a modern translation of the bible from the original Hebrew and Greek done by a team of 90 experts and not one done by Bacon, a demonic sorcerer that formed this New Atlantis of America. Bacon translated the King James Version which is not understandable. </p>

<p>God brings bad times to those that reject him, all he has to do is leave them. God is a constant shield around us. Read the <a href="http://biblehub.com/nlt/job/1.htm">Book of Job</a> to see how this works. Your argument is why you should fear God and follow His perfect rules.</p>

<p>Demons can also be thought of as tools God uses to purify us. When I rejected God this happened to me. God&#39;s decisions are always right, there is no better judge. Hes righteous and his discipline is a blessing. Read through the bible again with a modern translation, you&#39;ll quickly learn that God is supremely good. </p>
