       It's been a lot cooler in here over the past couple months.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti-Semitism has cooled off a lot and the level of research seems to have jumped up too. Even the newbs themselves seem much more able to cope with some of the Debby-Dwoner stuff in such a way that there are far fewer post ending in CapsLock "wake up sheeple" style language.

       I haven't been looking out for it recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time I remember it rearing its head was some months ago. I called out
       <a href="/u/tttt0tttt">
        /u/tttt0tttt
       </a>
       and he got really quiet afterward. There was another guy that went by something like 'humblebumblebug' or something. He also grew quiet. They were the two most vocal.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for right now - I haven't noticed too much other than a the normal rumblings that you'd expect. I'm very sure I've seen some recently, I just don't bother responding unless it's extra fucked up. You can't really waste your time on idiots and so I try not to allow myself to get upset by them.

       Ashkenazi is a genetic set / racial set.

      <p>
       Judaism is a religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionism is a secular political movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a logic point of view:
      </p>
      <p>
       1A.) Not all Jews are Zionists.

       An example of a non-Jewish Zionist: anyone on TBN. An example of a non-Ashkenazi Jew: Ethiopia, anyone? Iran? (Hint: "Sephardic") An example of a non-Jewish Ashkenazi: most of the Ashkenazi people I know don't give two shits about religion. An example of a Jew who is not a Zionist: there was a big thing about this posted right here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       a day or two ago that featured literally thousands on Jews who were specifically against Zionism.

       Look at it from a logic point of view and it makes more sense.

       Do or did you support the invasion of Iraq, the occupation of Afghanistan or the arming of rebels in Syria? Do you think lobbyists should dictate our foreign policy and do you have a problem with our politicians holding dual citizenship to another country?

       I've never supported occupation, protracted wars or the initiation of actions that will clearly negatively impact people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lobbyists should be held on charges of bribery and corruption. The politicians who take bribes should be prosecuted for accepting bribes and corruption. I do believe that there are cliques and that FreeMasonry and Luciferian cults exist, but they're more window dressing to me. The real deal is to fucking prosecute these pricks like the common criminals they are. No blood, no violence, no great bang for them. They do not get a glorious death. They get a pathetic death behind bars. Humiliated for the rest of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your questions are those one would ask of someone who still believes in 'the system.' I haven't believed in 'the system' since late 2003; and even that was a thin belief. Since then I've decided that the government that exists now is essentially Robert Anton Wilson's
       <em>
        Tsarist Occupation Government
       </em>
       . They believe they're above the law and I think they ought to be held accountable. I want to see that sly young lawyer in every freaking Grisham novel take on an actual issue. People are suffering and dying at the whims of stock-holders. This is unconscionable and I find it baffling that this is still regarded as 'acceptable normality.'
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point I can't help but think that people will figure out that they're paying the government to spy on them and commit mass murder. When people figure this out (it only took me thirty years) they'll wonder why they're paying for corporate well-fare and new Bentleys for already rich bankers.

       Not at all. We've quickly found middle ground with that last post. You're upset with the bankers, the military industrial complex and the lobbyists and corporations. So is everyone else on

       If you are truly sincere with your last post I encourage you to read up on PNAC and the IMF. It should help you understand why we went to war in the middle east.

       This is not an ideological or religious or racial problem. You can't just say "all people under X heading are evil" without persecuting innocents. Are you aware that this leads to killing innocent people who would otherwise help you? Do you understand that this makes you a douche?

       I never brought up judaism. This is a discussion about secular zionism and globalist zionists. Charging an entire race or culture with an ambiguous crime is myopic and intellectually lazy. People that are unable to discern between judaism and zionism are not sufficiently educated on the subject to bother debating with and you're making me hesitant to even continue this conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can at least admit that it is a very fine line to walk, but I'm willing to take that path because I won't let your ignorance or feelings get in the way of my objectivity. Humor me if you would. Who do you think runs 'the system'? Masons? Devil worshipers? Lizard people?

       While I agree that this discussion had been limited to Zionism you used phrasing that suggested that you tought anti-Semitism would be acceptable. Which means you're no longer talking about Zionism; you're talking about the Ashkenazi. While there is overlap you must remember articles [2A - 3B]. I would say that you're confusing the subject by mixing these groups as though they're consistent and identical sets.

       Anti-Semitism has always been low. Unless of course, you are one of those guys who consider anyone opposing Zionism and Jewish-cronyism to be anti-Semites. Its Zionism and racial-Cronyism that's racist, not those opposing it.

       If any of you are truly interested in beginning to unravel the real history of our world I would suggest:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Carrol Quigley's "Tragedy and Hope"
       </li>
       <li>
        Bernay's "Propaganda"
       </li>
       <li>
        Billington's "Fire in the Minds of Men" (Advanced Reading)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       My personal favorite starting point:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQiW_l848t8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, no one is going to give you the answers anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to use your own reason and discernment to separate fact from fiction from now on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just know, when you get started there is no going back.

       Really don't get why there's such hate here for the left-hand path. Not all left handed paths are that of satanism and the pursuit of the self as the ultimate goal.

       Satan is a title. Not a name. Lucifer is a title; not a name.

       Lack of understanding and information. The Modern American is built to identify and indiscriminately loathe a monolithic enemy without question, it's inevitable some of that would seep in to conspiracy circles.

       Suggestion.   Just like YouTube offers insights into users posted videos, giving detailed analytics of where traffic enters (ie, Organic Search, link referral from Twitter, etc) I feel that a similar glimpse into links posted here on Redditt would help users who post links understand, and maximize inbound traffic to help grow this community (and all communities here) insightfully.
      </p>

       What tactics or strategies draw the largest hits.  This is extremely valuable information to have on YouTube,  and I think it would work here as well.

       False. You will simply commodotize the users and find yourself ignoring the truth in favor of what 'sells'. It's verbatim the Fox News business model. This sub should be above that kind of tripe.

       Just finished watching your video. What's up with the Christian bullshit? The whole religion is built off the notion of slavery and subservience to "the lord" and "his" proxies.

       I haven't been looking out for it recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time I remember it rearing its head was some months ago. I called out
       <a href="/u/tttt0tttt">
        /u/tttt0tttt
       </a>
       and he got really quiet afterward. There was another guy that went by something like 'humblebumblebug' or something. He also grew quiet. They were the two most vocal.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for right now - I haven't noticed too much other than a the normal rumblings that you'd expect. I'm very sure I've seen some recently, I just don't bother responding unless it's extra fucked up. You can't really waste your time on idiots and so I try not to allow myself to get upset by them.
