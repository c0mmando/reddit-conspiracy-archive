       Wait. that's not funny. Banks have the power to both grow and destroy an economy. I'm not sure why you dispute that. Same goes for Government. If you think our government isn't destroying our freedoms and international banks aren't participating in economic warfare then you are mistaken.

       What proceeds to blow my mind the most is the majority of the time i see posts securing attention to the USA on this sub-reddit. The main thing that blows my mind is how many british people come onto this sub-reddit and complain and focus on the USA but are so reluctant to try anything back here in the UK. It absolutely blows my mind how british people think that the USA is so bad but they forget the part in which the UK in so many ways is worse than the US.

       I agree with that.

       Its clear that this is a international conspiracy, they are trying to enforce the same policies all over the world.

       The USA is just the most obvious controlled country by the elite and open about their tyranny.

       It's not a conspiracy. It's something that is simple to see if you just look around. Remember, if anyone and I mean anyone calls you a 'crazy person' or a 'conspiracy theorist' just subtly remind them with this sentence "There's a difference between a conspiracy theorist and someone who pays attention".

       well it is a conspiracy in my opinon.

      <ol>
       <li>

       Seems pretty accurate to me.

       Even when the term "conspiracy theorist" is completly discreted in public, i don't really mind using the word conspiracy.

       What blows my mind the most, is that we live on a rock. A grain of sand in the vastness of the universe, and yet we haven't even been outside the solar system. But we can destroy each other and continue to act like we are the only species to have intelligience in the universe. Weve made no attempt at going back to the moon, but we attempted to go back to iraq. It just blows my mind our species focuses on controlling others and not getting off this rock.

       Amazing video and it makes me wonder I recently took an unusually high dose of psychedelics I could feel the vibrations of the universe as well as the same time see creation of some sort archiving entity.   The pattern on that place while not the same they similar in the geometry and design.  I believe take psychedelics open ourselves up the true essence of the universe vibrations and frequencies.

       I remember a buzzing in my brain like the vibrations you're talking about, and I also saw so many geometric patterns. I had no idea what was going on, I did them as a dumb teenager. I've learned more 10 years later about what I was seeing. I would like to try it again sometime and just take it all in without the fear aspect.

       I don't know what kind of truth there is to this (obviously) but while reading Behold a Pale Horse, William Cooper mentions the driver of JFK's limo is the one that shot him. Having seen the Zapruder Film dozens of times myself, I immediately called bullshit. But just to see what ground he had to stand on making claims like that, I googled the Zapruder Film and found an HD version that shows several different speeds and zooms. What I found was disturbing. It really does look like after being shot in the neck from elsewhere, that the driver turns around and finishes him off with a second shot to the head. It was kind of incredible at the time. I've watched it hundreds of times since then, and I still can't shake the image of the driver turning around and raising his arm (as if aiming a pistol) just as JFK's head explodes all over the rear of the limo.
      </p>

       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL1qSGk8oMQ">
        Here
       </a>
       is a video breakdown similar to the one I'm talking about. What appears to be a pistol in his hand is actually a reflection off his passenger's head. But that aside, it still seems strange that he lifts his arm with his elbow cocked back while turning around to see, right at the same instant as JFK being shot the second time.

       Yes, the grainy natural of the film (close up and all) might make it seem that way. But the kill shot, the one that splattered his brains all over the car, came from directly in front. This is clearly evident. So the driver did not shoot the President, What
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       he doing ? Likely reacting to the kill shot. After all, he was sitting right there, and would have head the gun shot. This is also proof that Oswald didn't shoot JFK, either.

       Hahahahhahahahahahahahahahaha, Good one. While ill agree in a few hundred, maybe even a thousand years, there won't be any white people, its not because there is some mass conspiracy to kill us off. Its because interracial breeding will pretty much kill off all the races, turning into one race. Like a gooback.

       So will every other race. If everybody is fucking everybody, there won't be any race to hate. Plus I don't think blacks are aggresive to whites. I'm white, grew up in a racist part of texas, and learned that humans are humans no matter what. I have plenty of black friends and know of plenty of balcks that are friendly towards whites. Race and color should never be an issue, and it won't be in a few hundred years, when all races interbreed.
