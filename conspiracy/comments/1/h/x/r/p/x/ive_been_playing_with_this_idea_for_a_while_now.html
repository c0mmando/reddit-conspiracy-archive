        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: I&#39;m starting the PowerPoint right now.  Meet me at this link for a new discussion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1hytxb/so_about_that_powerpointim_starting_it_right_now/">Let&#39;s do this shit, you guys</a></p>

<p>Obviously the world is a complete shit storm right now, especially in regard to the recent &quot;revelations&quot; here in the US.  With this in mind, I think we would all like a way to make a difference.  <strong>&quot;How can an average joe make a considerable difference?&quot;</strong> has been the thought on my mind for months.  Well, I think I may have come up with a pretty interesting plan.  What if <em>(hear me out)</em> we combined all of our knowledge and <strong>reliable</strong> resources to create the <em>perfect</em> presentation.  A presentation that could be shown to police departments and other authorities around the nation.  This presentation would last for about 30 minutes to an hour, and it would cover the basics of corruption in government and why the police should consider themselves on &quot;our side&quot; rather than taking the side of people who want nothing but to harm us.  Imagine if shtf and because of these presentations, some police departments decided to side with the people.  Not only would having police on &quot;our side&quot; increase our credibility, but it would increase our ability to defend ourselves against unlawful shows of force in a time of national unrest.</p>

<p><strong>This is the basic idea.  I&#39;m sorry if there&#39;s gaps and questions that I didn&#39;t answer, but I just wanted to present this skeleton of a plan before pursuing it.  Please share your thoughts and thank you for reading this far.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a student at a major US institution, I assure you that my each of my sources will be peer-reviewed or at the very least, from a source that is considered reputable. Just as important though, it needs to be void of bias, &quot;fluff&quot;, &quot;conspiracy&quot;, and major emotional motives. Ideally, I&#39;d like to let the viewers guide the presentation. I want to lead them to the conclusion, but not take them directly to it. As in, I&#39;d prefer if they formed their own conclusions without me shoving it down their throats. I&#39;ll give you the wood and matches, but you guys need to make the fire. Know what I mean? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have the right idea, since it&#39;s all about <em>presentation</em> (completely lacked by most &quot;awake&quot; people).</p>

<p>To add to your ideas, I think the presentation would ideally be interactive. This would allow people to go down the path that interests them most (ie. environmental terrorism/monsanto, false flags, assassinations, etc.).  Though, as many of us know, most paths lead toward the same sources of corruption.</p>

<p>Further, an interactive format would be...well...a well-designed website and/or mobile app, with a clean interface and usability.</p>

<p>If you put together the presentation, (along with the various &quot;paths&quot; of info)  I or countless other ordinary Joe&#39;s (with coding skills) could help create it in interactive format.</p>

<p>Please keep up the great work, and add me to your list of people to contact when you get rolling !</p>
