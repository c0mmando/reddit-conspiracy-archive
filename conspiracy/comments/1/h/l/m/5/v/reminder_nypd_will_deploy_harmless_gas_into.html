       I live in NYC and this is awful. I really dont understand why they have to do this. And how harmless is it?! I would like to know exactly what they are spraying on us. 112 bucks a month for crappy service and now Im gonna get gassed. Awesome.

       Did you read any of the articles? It says right there in the 2nd paragraph of the first source
       <em>
        "The plan, to be enacted in July, will investigate New Yorkâ€™s readiness to handle a chemical terrorist attack"
       </em>
       .

      <p>
       If the city is concerned about a chemical attack, testing how chemicals flow through the station makes sense... Does it not?

       Possibly because simulations don't compare to the real thing. There's all kinds of variables to take into account, which may be difficult to correctly predict with a simulation.

       It could mean that they're testing to see how gases behave in a congested tunnel... How quickly and how far it spreads, how long it takes to disperse, the effects of ventilation etc.

       Probably, but simulations are not as great as a practical test.

       If simulations were so great, firefighters wouldn't need to practice with or study real fire situations, they'd just play a video game, use theory and watch simulation videos instead of the real thing.

       If this is true why did the government rely on complex simulations from NIST to explain 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       While I agree that simulations are not the same as doing something in the physical world, they are far more cost effective.  In a time when all governments are running massive debts, you would think this would be a consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree however that there is no replacement for a live action drill or exercise, it just seems silly.  Also I've heard that the gas they are using is not exactly inert, and could hang around in the area and seep into the ground and stay there for some time.

       Which ones? And do they have a similar design to the ones that are used frequently? Also, wouldn't airflow through an abandoned station be different than one that is in use?

       Using simulations to explain an event that already occurred is very different than using simulations to predict what would occur.

       Hell, maybe simulations have already been run, and the public wasn't told. But I try to avoid too much blind speculation.

       That should be of no surprise, most types of gases are not inert. You're breathing non-inert gases right now, namely oxygen.

       Knowing how long that lasts for would be handy to know - Thus the live drills.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all depends whether or not the gas is actually harmful. But that would be nigh suicidal of the government to poison such a large amount of people with a declared live drill with recent events harming government trust in the public eye.

       I agree that it would be stupid in this instance for some alphabet agency to supply real gas instead of the supposed non-harmful stuff.  Especially since this story has picked up a bit here and there.  I think it is good that these drills are being pointed out though in light of the pattern of events and coinciding drills.

       so basically when we see a bunch of interns and boxes we've never seen before in the subways... get outta there. I think its funny all the comments on gizmodo seem like they would belong on r/conspiracy/. Its sad no one trusts the nypd but it's their fault.
