<p>Did you read any of the articles? It says right there in the 2nd paragraph of the first source <em>&quot;The plan, to be enacted in July, will investigate New Yorkâ€™s readiness to handle a chemical terrorist attack&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>If the city is concerned about a chemical attack, testing how chemicals flow through the station makes sense... Does it not? </p>

<p>Can you name a single subway that isn&#39;t used by people on a daily basis, which has a similar design to ones that are used frequently? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Possibly because simulations don&#39;t compare to the real thing. There&#39;s all kinds of variables to take into account, which may be difficult to correctly predict with a simulation. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It could mean that they&#39;re testing to see how gases behave in a congested tunnel... How quickly and how far it spreads, how long it takes to disperse, the effects of ventilation etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t we have people that are already specially trained to handle these types of situation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably, but simulations are not as great as a practical test. </p>

<p>If simulations were so great, firefighters wouldn&#39;t need to practice with or study real fire situations, they&#39;d just play a video game, use theory and watch simulation videos instead of the real thing. </p>

<p>There are lots of abandoned subway stations and lines that aren&#39;t in use in NY</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If this is true why did the government rely on complex simulations from NIST to explain 9/11?</p>

<p>While I agree that simulations are not the same as doing something in the physical world, they are far more cost effective.  In a time when all governments are running massive debts, you would think this would be a consideration.</p>

<p>I agree however that there is no replacement for a live action drill or exercise, it just seems silly.  Also I&#39;ve heard that the gas they are using is not exactly inert, and could hang around in the area and seep into the ground and stay there for some time.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Which ones? And do they have a similar design to the ones that are used frequently? Also, wouldn&#39;t airflow through an abandoned station be different than one that is in use? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Using simulations to explain an event that already occurred is very different than using simulations to predict what would occur. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a time when all governments are running massive debts, you would think this would be a consideration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who says it wasn&#39;t? </p>

<p>Hell, maybe simulations have already been run, and the public wasn&#39;t told. But I try to avoid too much blind speculation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also I&#39;ve heard that the gas they are using is not exactly inert</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That should be of no surprise, most types of gases are not inert. You&#39;re breathing non-inert gases right now, namely oxygen. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and could hang around in the area and seep into the ground and stay there for some time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing how long that lasts for would be handy to know - Thus the live drills. </p>

<p>It all depends whether or not the gas is actually harmful. But that would be nigh suicidal of the government to poison such a large amount of people with a declared live drill with recent events harming government trust in the public eye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it would be stupid in this instance for some alphabet agency to supply real gas instead of the supposed non-harmful stuff.  Especially since this story has picked up a bit here and there.  I think it is good that these drills are being pointed out though in light of the pattern of events and coinciding drills.</p>
