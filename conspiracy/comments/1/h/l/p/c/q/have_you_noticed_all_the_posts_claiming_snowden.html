       If it is a psyop, which was also claimed about Anonymous, Assange, and probably even Bradley Manning at some point in time, then I have to say, it is the stupidest psyop I've ever heard of. Mostly because the American people and the world are now so infuriated, that revolution seems imminent. At first I was afraid that they had the military force to stand up against the civilians no matter what we did, but after seeing the Egyptian military turn on Morsi I have a feeling our military will have a similar response. The powers that be are losing their grip and fast. The Snowden psyop seed is a desperate attempt at damage control. I haven't seen a shred of evidence more than, "his power point presentations were too good" or his PR presence is too professional. To that I say, of course, don't you think the wikileaks team who I assume has been helping quietly and Greenwald know how to help him properly disseminate his message?

       plot twist: The controllers actually WANT us to violently revolt.... when it happens, we destroy eachother, and they run to their super-bunkers with all their assets. Emerging to retake control easily. We can't let it come to that. They win during chaos OR order.... the only way we can win is to acknowledge they exist. Illuminate the shadowy figures for all to see.

       We've all considered the idea that they want a violent revolt. We aren't going to destroy each other though right? We would destroy the mechanisms that hold us down I would hope.

       I have been reading reddit for years and it has changed significantly since Digg collapsed.

       There are now many shills and spooks gaming the submissions and comment sections.

       Solution? Read as many different sources on the web as possible, mainstream, alternative , news bloggers, columnists. Get as much diversity as possible, use an RSS feed to efficiently get through it all.

       You haven't stopped to think that they
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to bring about an "American Spring"?  Snowden is too public and talked about to be anything for real.  If he was for real they would ignore it.   This story was GIVEN to us.  I have been saying since day 1 that this was a psyop.  I'm no shill.

       I have stopped to think about that. Many times. I do find it strange that the media has picked up his story so strongly in the same fashion they did Assange but I think that's only because there were those that knew the potency of the information he had planned to release beyond what we know already. So those that were gearing up for it, Hastings, Greenwald, made sure it was known that
       <em>
        this guy is very important
       </em>
       for potentially for reasons yet to be revealed to us. That is just a hunch.

       Yes, and to me Psyop or not, what came of it was for the greater good. Cut the man some slack. He woke up 10's of thousands of people yet you still claim he's the bad guy.

       Despite this being an op, that doesn't necessarily make Snowden the bad guy.  As has been discussed elsewhere, he could have easily be put in the position he was in
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       someone knew based on his personality type that he would blow the whistle.  This works very well because then Snowden doesn't have to lie, he is a genuine whistleblower, and yet the establishment still gets the results they want, whether that be cowing the public into self-censorship or rising up in rebellion.

       Agreed OP. The authorities will try a number of ways of discrediting a whistleblower. First they will try to complete ignore him/her - pretend they
       <em>
        a non-person
       </em>
       . If that fails, they will
       <em>
        deny
       </em>
       the information, accusing him of being
       <em>
        a liar
       </em>
       . If the evidence is too strong, they will accuse the whistleblower of being
       <em>
        a traitor
       </em>
       , and if they can unearth any dirt on the individual he will be labelled
       <em>
        a criminal
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If these strategies don't work, they will accuse him of being
       <em>
        a self-publicist, an attention-seeker and profiteer
       </em>
       . Finally, as with Snowden, where none of these accusations held any water, they will try to the partial hangout, and say he is
       <em>
        still an active asset
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe any of these are true as regards Snowden.

       If you think the psyop was ineffective, I don't think you understood many of the points within the 'Snowden is a psyop' posts.

       The surveillance state must reveal itself. What sort of revolution do you think will occur that will prevent the state from being able to clamp down?

       I understand all of the points within the snowden was a psyop posts. But I think they are all flimsy and I also realize that the police state/surveillance state must reveal itself, but if Snowden was a psyop don't you think Assange would be aware? Or do you think he is being played as well?

       I've considered this.
       <strong>
        We're ALL making assumptions
       </strong>
       because we don't have accurate intel so we have no choice but to assume, but we all draw the line at different points of where we are willing to believe the psyop fabricated story ends and reality begins. I say, if there is a conspiracy, there would be a point where it would grow so large that whistleblowers would naturally be produced as shown in the past. That is all. I think they got lazy and fucked up.

       That's an assumption you are trying to make. I'm sure there are more but that is all that I am currently aware of.

       How about you do some research on whistleblowers? They are an integral part of our history and as far as I know, there hasn't yet been a psyop whistleblower historically speaking. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's not recorded that way.

       It's not an assumption I've

       <strong>
        isn't

       is an

       How about you tell me what you mean so I don't have to act like some sort of mind reader. As far as

       Other than me, I know of no other person who is concerned or has ever once mentioned snowden, assange, etc.   it is off the radar.  I also just don't believe in being a follower, so wherever these guys are leading, I am not interested in following.  These guys will only be paid attention to if someone progressive rolls their concerns into a political platform, like one that unites Ron Paulers with progressives.
