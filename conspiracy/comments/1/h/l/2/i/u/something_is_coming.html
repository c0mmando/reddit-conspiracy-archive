But even in my very small town of maybe 2000 we have tripled the police force since the first of the year. We had 5 officers now we 16. They already drive around and just sit in random parking lots along the main street. There is no need for these extra cops. They have even stated themselves that it is pointless  So why is the city spending this money? When it could be used to save the broken education system or the pothole filled backroads. Hell it would be better used on anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And honestly I dont belive but a few of them went through any sort of police academy. I work at a restaurant and have become friends with most of them. Being a small town there are not many places to eat so I have had a chance to talk in depth with them. From what I have surmised they hire locals and have them do sort of an internship. By internship I mean ride around with current police officers for about two weeks then they are given a vehicle, sworn in, and all such. This practice is being largely ignored and the citizens dont care that there has been a huge increase in the police force. Their reason for not caring has been and I quote &quot; it doesnt concern us to question&quot; I have been told that by multiple people. This nonchalant population is terrifyingly oblivious to the fact that it is our duty to question.</p>

its a 100 to 1 ratio thing, esp when a lot of these new LEOs are imported into an area, it might be different if they were locals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is all they do. Sit and observe. Instill fear in your subjects. They have to deal with all of us. They want us to be as submissive as possible. You don&#39;t want your subjects to be wise and strong and knowledgeable. You see what happen in Ukraine? People went into the police station and arrested the raper cop. You wont see that happen here. People are too demoralized for such a strong willed action with cause and for future protection.</p>
