        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Preface:</p>

<p>First off I want to say: I am probably one of the least qualified people to do this kind of research but due to the absolute lack of this discussion I felt it was necessarily to at least <em>attempt</em> to do some decent research and report my findings. If any one out there who is into this kind of work and/or skilled at it, please do not hesitate to spring board off of this post and conduct further research. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I honestly am really confused that this idea isn’t even getting postulated, almost at all, and that very few are even <em>looking</em> to see if things <em>potentially</em> don’t match up. I understand that a lot of new people have joined into this sub as a result of the Snowden story, and that some old-timers are on the <em>I told you so</em> train, while others are seeing this as a beacon of hope, and some are even truly caught up in the game of “Catch The Spy” drama series the mainstream has turned this into, but come on guys! We, as a collective, are more or less <em>always</em> on top of digging to see if there is more than meets the eye with the stories that encompass the mainstream, but it seems with Snowden that skepticism has disappeared. Not that I don’t understand the various reasons which make this one a little different than others, but we still need to keep our thinking caps (or as some would call them, tin foil hats) on! </p>

<p>So, to start it off, I recommend taking a look at a few (or all) of these articles/videos regarding things that are suspicious regarding the Snowden case. The first link alone should lead one to being skeptical (if you weren&#39;t already):</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the fact that <em>everything</em> Snowden has said has been leaked before, and the media has <em>never</em> jumped on it. </p>

<p>Now, let’s consider that none of these other leakers, or in fact <em>any</em> leaker regarding <em>anything</em> has received this kind of attention, or persecution (at least that I can think of; excluding the Assange/Manning case). In fact, <strong>Russ Tice</strong>, is currently <em>still</em> talking about this stuff, and to my knowledge safely avoiding persecution while still  in the states. Even <em>more</em> important is what he is saying, and that it is <em>much, much</em> more revealing than what Snowden is saying (and is actually new information). </p>

<p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/interview-685-russ-tice-reveals-the-truth-about-nsa-spying/">Interview With Russ Tice</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3esnkqM7E">Corbett Interview With Sibel Edmonds Regarding What Tice Is Talking about</a></p>

<p>For those who don’t have time to listen to the whole interview, <strong>the most important part of what he says is that Congress and other politicians are <em>all</em> being heavily monitored, Including Obama long before he was president. I can’t remember if Tice explicitly states in the interview (however Corbett does in another video of his) that this could easily be used (and are most assuredly used) to blackmail Congress and other officials to do their bidding.</strong> </p>

<p>Now let’s consider just some of the huge news which is being swept under the rug by the Snowden case:</p>

<p>This story has drifted in and out for years, but it is finally at the precipice. And I haven’t seen 1 post about it in the past month. I recall seeing that it passed in the house a few days ago. Serious shit guys. </p>

<p>We are literally on the <a href="http://youtu.be/HP7L8bw5QF4">precipice of WW3</a> (granted, we have been creeping our way there for the last decade), and it’s not being discussed nearly to the level it should be. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Next, Let’s consider that this was not planned <em>at all</em>—including either a completely legitimate leak that was simply <em>allowed</em> to happen, or even one that slipped by under the radar (the latter being highly doubtful through my understanding of how things work) :</p>

<p><strong>Do you really think that TPTB would waste such a great opportunity to keep everyone, even the communities who generally pay very close attention, distracted?</strong></p>

<p>These guys are smart. Really smart. And they have more education in propaganda, psychology, and whatever else than all of us. <em>Even if</em> they had nothing to do with Snowden, they would <em>never</em> let a crisis go to waste. Remember how Aurora happened the day of (or maybe the day before or after) the first big release of all the HSBC stuff? And then how Sandy Hook happened right at the time of the second release? How during the Boston Bombing CISPA and the gun control bill almost slipped by under the radar (seems with each major event more and more is getting released, potentially to utilize the media black out as long as possible)? While there is no proof that these were false flags, we almost immediately came to our senses and started talking about what was slipping by under our noses, and the oddities with the cases. With this one, it’s literally been a month and still almost no one is even <em>considering</em> that something fishy is going on. </p>

<hr/>

<p>So please guys, yes let’s keep up on the Snowden case, but let’s stay skeptical, and, more importantly, not get sidetracked when there is all of this other crazy shit going on. If you agree with this message <em>please</em>:</p>

<p>-Downvote reposts about Snowden or other stuff which is not contributing to discussion.</p>

<p>-Go into the new/controversial tab or a couple pages deep and upvote the good posts who are getting downvoted/not getting attention.</p>

<p>-Repost any of the links listed here (or of any other topic) which you think require more attention that they are getting.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: In further studies, I was watching the newest piece from the Corbett Report (One of the best alt-media out there, so I highly recommend him if you haven&#39;t heard of him before), <a href="http://youtu.be/r_T9H32I5D8?t=6m50s">specifically the part about Snowden in this video (6:50 - 10:30)</a> and I do fully agree that we shouldn&#39;t be focusing <em>too much</em> on the rabbit hole of whether Snowden is a psyop, however it&#39;s important to not to get too enveloped by &quot;Catch The Spy&quot; either. The only way to beat the game is not to play. And it&#39;s important to note that often we <em>are</em> playing the game: by getting overly caught up in the &#39;whose at the very top&#39; and &#39;was this a false flag?&#39; kind of questions—not that they&#39;re not important questions to postulate but that we sometimes dwell on them <em>too</em> heavily—instead of getting out there and showing people the stuff we <em>can</em> prove to wake them up and even mobilize them to try and change things. </p>

<p>Now is our time to start putting ourselves out there and exposing people to this information—These recent scandals <em>are</em> shaking people from their trance. I personally think that the <em>plan</em> is being accelerated for various reason and thus carelessness is acceptable and, without proper outlets, could lead to making people even <em>more</em> scared and docile but it could also lead to the momentum we need to actually have a chance at changing this shit—There will be a massive wave of something and whether that&#39;s stagnating fear or eye-opening-change us up to those of us who are already awake to provide the outlets and the resources for people. Don&#39;t waste your time on those who refuse to be open and focus your efforts on those who are asking questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t read all of the above, but I can say that I have been suspicious of him from the beginning.  It seems nothing these days it was it appears to be, so why should snowmen be any different.  I think the timing of his revelations is telling.  He has sat on this info for how long before disclosing it? He still claims he has more to tell, what&#39;s with the &quot;more after a word from our sponsors&quot; approach?  I also think his interview sounded scripted and rehearsed.  His quotes since as well, which aren&#39;t proof of anything, but very curious nonetheless.  If he&#39;s real, they&#39;re definitely using spin to manipulate the public interest, if he&#39;s fake, they&#39;re still using him to sway public interest.  Either way it won&#39;t be long and it&#39;ll get slurped down the memory hole in favor of someone&#39;s nip slip, or racial slur, or terrorist attack attempt... whatever will shut the dummys up and move them on to the next big story to cover up the next big Washington nation rape.  </p>

<p>Even Putin said that he would accept Snowden into Russia as long as he didn&#39;t continue to try to damage the US with more leaks.  </p>

<p>Maybe the intent was to go there, leak fake info to Russia, and rally the media into saying Russia is our enemy (since they&#39;re helping Assad of Syria).  </p>

<p>On top of that, people are now scared to say anything against the government both online and on the phone.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe there is a concerted effort by the powers that be to provoke the American public and incite a domestic disturbance to justify martial law. I believe the publicity around the Zimmerman trial, immigration reform and harassment of families (shooting dogs, tasing people, arresting kids for silly comments, etc.) can also be added to the evidence above to support this. The DHS purchases of weapons and vehicles also supports my theory. I expect some incident to happen in the near future to further these ends. I would stay away from big events with scheduled drills in the near future. I am seeing a pattern there like many others are. Reddit also seems to be flooded with users shouldn&#39;t be where they are if they truly believed as they do. Interesting they should take time out of their busy day to compose a lengthy diatribe against free thinkers, and a dramatic shift from the common and obvious trolls I have seen in the past.</p>

Jones wasn&#39;t bringing over enough pissed off people.  </p>

<p>This could easily be the spark slowly winding its way down a massive fuse on a large ordinance &quot;American Spring&quot; weapon used to bring down the Republic and allow the UN to come in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It assuredly is possible–anything is possible– but imo unlikely. The fact that I or anyone else questions Snowden does not mean we do not support what he did. It just means we are suspicious of whether this is going to be used in the government/shadow government&#39;s favor. When 90% of the public doesn&#39;t pay attention at all, 9% even took the time to understand the Snowden story, 1% of that have Any context to put it in and 0.001% are probing to see if it&#39;s a limited hang out, it wouldn&#39;t be an effective use of resources to from them to try and confuse that 0.001%. And most of soures of the articles I&#39;ve linked above I have been scrutinizing for a decent amount of time and have no reason to believe they are controlled-opposition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its definitely worth entertaining–it crossed my mind when this first came up–but of the understanding i have, so far anyway, of how things work and such, it seems that it very unlikely that, in this instance, it goes another layer deeper. I think its probably a 50/50 on whether Snowden is legit and trustworthy but i think, other than being on guard for any manipulations of this, we should treat it as if he is the real deal. If things start to get fishy with all this stuff, then we can re evaluate this, but otherwise lets just take this gift we have been given use it to &#39;wake people up&#39; so to speak. </p>
