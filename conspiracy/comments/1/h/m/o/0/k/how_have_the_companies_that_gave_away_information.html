       Even more than the companies that gave away information to the NSA, are the companies that did the digging/spying for the NSA: "Narus" and "Verint", two Israeli intelligence companies.

       It sounds as if Narus and Verint may be legitimate skunkworks defense contractors. The problem is Google, Yahoo, Internet backbone
runners, allowing agents with, apparently, weak justification for needing access to private communications see the communications.

       If there was a well-protected database somewhere, and I were confident the authorities could and would go into it only because they thought they were pursuing WMD-level terrorists, with serious checks and balances: that's a little creepy, but in a normal Cold War spy novel way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the Snowden disclosures make it sound as if any guy with a Madonna fetish can probably secretly listen to her phone calls, or turn on her cell phone camera and watch her as long as he feels like it, without any serious possibility that a real judge is going to stop that.

       Any NSA monitor who's into blackmail or identity theft seems to have unfettered ability to enjoy those hobbies.

       Most companies are run by slaves like us, tossed scraps and given a modicum of power over the others, but still beholden to the state. IMHO, while they are indeed a few rungs above us, it's the state, the ones with the guns/whips/mechanisms of law, who are truly at fault.

        Why did it take an NSA whistleblower to kick it all off?

      <p>
       Not trying to justify it, but if I was able to work out some kind of living out of the state, I can see that it would be hard to want to risk it. I mean, look at how ambivalent the people around you are toward the NSA spying. If you ran Google/whatever, would it be worth risking it all given how little people seem to care?

       Bullshit.  The government constantly holds an axe over corp heads.  Remember the Microsoft lawsuit?  You got the puppet and the puppet master confused... They've been working for years to accomplish that.

       If the companies don't comply they throw their CEOs in prison or sue them in court. It is "free" for the government to sue you for records (because they take the money from the people) but it costs the companies to fight it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the guy they threw in jail:

       There are 175,000 pages of Federal Law. You can have 20 different CPAs do your company's taxes and get 20 different answers. Every company is in violation of a large amount of unknowable felonies at any given time, and the justice department isn't big enough to prosecute everyone one so they only prosecute those that don't comply.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad thing is, everything I've said isn't even a conspiracy. It is out in the open, but people don't ever think to fight for corporate "rights" because they are too short sighted to see how it will effect them.
