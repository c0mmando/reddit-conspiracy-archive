<p>I have this feeling man, &#39;cause you know, it&#39;s just a handful of people who run everything, you know … that&#39;s true, it&#39;s provable. It&#39;s not … I&#39;m not a fucking conspiracy nut, it&#39;s provable. A handful, a very small elite, run and own these corporations, which include the mainstream media. I have this feeling that whoever is elected president, like Clinton was, no matter what you promise on the campaign trail – blah, blah, blah – when you win, you go into this smoke-filled room with the twelve industrialist capitalist scum-fucks who got you in there. And you&#39;re in this smoky room, and this little film screen comes down … and a big guy with a cigar goes, &quot;Roll the film.&quot; And it&#39;s a shot of the Kennedy assassination from an angle you&#39;ve never seen before … that looks suspiciously like it&#39;s from the grassy knoll. And then the screen goes up and the lights come up, and they go to the new president, &quot;Any questions?&quot; &quot;Er, just what my agenda is.&quot; &quot;First we bomb Baghdad.&quot; &quot;You got it …&quot; </p>

He is following orders from the same people that helped to put him into power. He is a complete puppet and always was.</p>

I kept walking inside and after a few feet I stopped dead in my tracks with a chill down my spine.  I heard the charismatic cult following of Hitler.  A 50 year old woman was absolutely swooning in her chair saying &quot;oh my god, oh, oh&quot;.</p>

<p>I knew that we were fucked.</p>

<p>I listened to try to have that reaction again but it never quite hit me like that again.  That is the kind of stuff that I pay attention to in myself beyond intellectual knowledge.  I voraciously feed my intellect and then I let my subconcious brain do the heavy lifting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read that most of the high levels of government have been involved in scandalous activities so deeply that they cannot go against the flow or else risk losing not only their position, but their family. (eg; prostitution, secret sex rings, murder, etc.) If the government was wiretapping people so hard, it isn&#39;t a far leap to say that they were doing that to their own in order to manipulate them. Remember that hotel room that was discovered in Texas that looked like a sex dungeon and had a picture of the banker on the wall and a one way mirror. I theorize that it was used to videotape politicians having scandalous relations and the evidence is used as blackmail. Just a crazy theory though.</p>

<p>But as the Thespian says... ACTING!</p>

<p>Edit:  Honestly, I think part of this is we all don&#39;t want to admit that we were fooled so badly.  So Obama MUST have been serious, right?  Also, the parasites-that-be were counting on a lot of us to get really addicted to patting ourselves on the back for voting for the First Black President.  Sad, but IMO true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Constitution is designed to limit federal government power by precluding it from acting (presumably) unless they have the power to do so expressly enumerated in the Constitution.  Conversely, the Constitution is the exact opposite when it comes to fundamental rights of the citizens, which is proven by the Ninth Amendment that states:</p>

<p>&quot;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&quot;</p>

<p>The truth is that most people that work for the federal government are frustrated by the fact that the Constitution is designed to hinder federal power in order to prevent tyranny.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think its POSSIBLE that a powerful demonic being possesses each president and acts out its own agenda. While being smart about it and keeping with the limits of their personality and not changing things so drastically as to ruin the idea of a president.</p>

<p>Its just a theory, but think about it. You hear of weird things happening, dead serious ghost stories from you friends, and demonic possession isnt unheard of. Try telling those that have been through it that it didnt happen. You&#39;d be the only one in the dark about the topic. Demonic possession has occurred throughout all history and still happens today.</p>

<p>So from a demon&#39;s stand point, if you could possess one person in the world, who would it be? One of the top choices is the US president. My question is, why not? Again, its just a theory. But I believe that is very possible.</p>

He&#39;s a fascist. And the fact that Democrats have either looked the other way or endorsed him is proof that most Democrats are the fascists they accuse Republicans of being. 
Five years of spying on the public - from snail mail to email to gaming forums to social media - and the so called libertines see nothing wrong. From Pelosi to Obama to Schumer - they had to know, and they allowed it or actively encouraged it.
