      </p>
      <p>

      <p>

       B) There is no encryption that the NSA cannot easily crack, with a few major exceptions that are difficult to pull off, and completely impractical for your average computer user (governments excluded)

       I've studied encryption and I don't believe that they can break it in a meaningfully small amount of time.  The weaknesses are in authentication, hacking and obtaining the private key from physical access to the server by subpoena or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with private communication through encryption is that you need to know that first of all you are talking to the right person.  So imagine that David Icke's reptilian aliens are wearing the skin of your friend.  You see your friend and you begin your little game and then nobody else can intercept your communication.  But wholy fuck, its not your friend in fact so what does it matter if nobody else can see what you are saying.  So always you need a trusted source to vouch for someone and that is the problem.  What if the reptiles got to everyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as hacking goes I'm sure that the NSA has invested crazy amounts in static analyzers for assembly and source code.  I remember a number of years ago when
       <a href="http://scan.coverity.com/">
        coverty
       </a>
       started scanning major open source projects they discovered a shit load of possible bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] I think that article is total crap.  There is an assumption in it that you cannot repeat characters and I think that is crap.  Personally I think that the article reads like cryptographic humor for people who know the very basics more than anything.  I will agree on a few things though and that is that we need better random number generators and that we should be using 256 bit encryption (because why not?).
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] I'm actually pretty damn sure that not being able to reuse any characters would offer far less randomness than the (uhm) normal situation that we have now.  Yes, the article is crap or kind of funny depending on how the author meant it.

       There is no bank vault that cannot be cracked. There is no cat made that cannot be broken into. There is no house built that cannot be burgled. There is no sunscreen that blocks all radiation.

       It's folly to equate lack of perfect protection with no protection at all. It may be possible to crack most types of encryption, but it's expensive. It takes lots of CPU time.  And that, like your pitiful car locks, does offer a fair amount of protection.

       The connection. Sure, everything posted by danceswithself can be readily cross indexed, there's no ready way to see who exactly that is. With UN encrypted connections a simple packet sniffer reveals this. That's why encrypted https social media is useful in a third world revolt.

       SSL is crusty and old.  TLS 1.0 is what is being commonly used now with soon to be TLS 1.1.  I was posted

        this

       .  Considering the bumped up timeline I'll give it 1.5 years before this is fairly common.  With PFS you can ensure that they can not retroactively decrypt your communications, which I find to be the much more likely threat.  Additionally, if they are able to decrypt one sesison then they would need to do it all over again for another session, say the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you manually enter the public key of a web server into your browser then you will not have authentication problems.  Firefox should get some more flak for making it look so damn ugly doing it.  They do a disservice by presenting the certificate agencies as the supreme panacea.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are doing the tricks that they talk about in your second article then they are already on to you TODAY and you are a bit fucked in so many other ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to do the shit that they are talking about they would not only need to forge certificates but also somehow control your DNS server or the actual Internet traffic itself on the way to the destination.  Certainly the military, NSA, etc control the backbones but they don't always control the path to the server.  So there are a lot of IFs.  Then what if some packets travel a different route across the Internet?  This is a very normal thing.  Then everything would get all fucked up.  So I suppose that I stand that this is not some casual thing that they do willy nilly.  I think that this is like them pulling out the F-22 Raptors for some big shit.

       This is bullshit.  So someone hacked a custom web server product, big deal. That is why you use major products like Apache that have been beat on forever.  Also this web server product was written in .NET which is closed source.  Why would anyone trust that?  In college I wrote a very basic TCP/IP system with dedicated application servers and a custom name server in .NET and I never expected any of it to be secure.  A state sponsored team?  That is so ridiculous.  It doesn't take Stuxnet level skills to do that.  People decompile and hack video game protections in 15 minutes.  There are tons of badass fuckers out there and some of them live in countries where $500 a month gets them laid in the shade.

       No one is guaranteeing failure. The government has backdoors into every computer anyways, using some kiddie encryption that simply doesn't work against all but the most inept fools isn't "having a chance at success". It's downright foolish.

       Encryption (done right) protects you from the NSA, FBI, CIA, PRISM, ECHELON, TRM (Russian Mafia) and too many other organizations to name. Just because it might not protect you in some scenarios doesn't mean that it doesn't protect you from a great deal many more...

       Your requests to and responses from the server may be encrypted with ssl, but your comments are still plainly visible to anyone (reddit even has
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/dev/api">
        APIs
       </a>
       for them). I agree that reddit should get with it and implement ssl already, but your comment history probably is much more damning than anything they could only collect by snooping on your requests.

       This is patently false. The NSA can literally crack any encryption on the planet, with the exception of true random encryption with a key being based on the wind from a windmill or water from a waterfall, etc.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I have also stated that there is no encryption America cannot break, and it was also published today that there was a grand total of FOUR (4) encrypted communications America failed to break in the last 10 years. This is because people doing the encryption fail to realize one of several factors, including the fact that all processors inevitably follow patterns that you cannot program around, and that even if you get a truthfully random encryption algorithm generated by a random source - such as the wind, once you encode a language with that encryption the language itself puts patterns into the data that can be extracted with brute force.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only encryption that is not crackable is that which uses base 256 at a minimum, a random source such as a windmill, and an enormously long encryption key that has so many multiple representations for every single character typed that you never get a repeat across the entire span of a lengthy document. PGP is PURE B.S., I have been ridiculed for not using PGP but if you knew what I know, you would know why I don't bother with data security AT ALL, it's all a load of bunk when dealing with the types of people I am up against.

       You're dodging the question, which is ironic given your reply. There is no such thing as true random in any program or in any type of encryption as long as the encryption is based off of a processor which is running on an algorithim, there are patterns, and these patterns can be traced and eventually cracked. The only limiting factor is the amount of computing power needed to break the encryption (with the NSA, they have many more times than is needed to break anything). Therefore, the only true encryption has to be based on something outside of a computer software/processor, the method of which is detailed in the link I provided above.

       It's quite simple in all actuality. I don't see what you are failing to understand here....

       There certainly are true random numbers in computing, but they are few and far between, commonly only used to generate encryption keys as their randomness is a precious resource.

       Btw, this guy is an idiot. What matters is not the number base but the total number of bits in the key. Who gives a flying rat's ass how you encode it? They're all equivalent anyway, the only difference is the density of encoding.

       So... we encrypt the traffic between the poster and the server and then what? Reddit is still completely public. Anyone with a web browser can still make a(n encrypted) request to view the public comment threads whenever they want. That's the point. Anyone can read it. If you don't want it read, then
       <strong>
        don't post it

       I dunno, is it? If it is, it's probably because they're communicating through things that aren't completely public already. Facebook, for instance, is not completely public. I can't just go in and browse through all the posts some random person in Kansas has made. For Facebook, encryption protects the information in transit until it can be stored in the (relatively) secured servers so that random people can't read it. If you were to do that on reddit, then nobody can read your post while it's submitting. Instead they simply wait until it's finished and can read it in the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll notice that not many people are on reddit coordinating (actual) revolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, encryption would still be useful for reddit to have, but only for things like verifying
       <em>
        reddit's
       </em>
       identity on your end,
       <strong>
        not

       EDIT: Keep up the good work! Learn how the machine works! You started by learning about the packet contents, learn about the OSI model and how all the different layers work. Things like subnet masking, routing protocols, class A/B/C networks, etc. Knowing how the whole thing works is a highly valuable understanding and the pay is very nice...
      </p>
      <p>
       Oooh! Somebody has seen http headers! (nerd chills) Sadly, this is
       <em>
        NOT
       </em>
       exactly how it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, this isn't the entire connection, just the packet contents. You forgot layer 3 which includes the IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your password was passed in the clear.... when you logged in. At that time the connection was made between your password and the (typical) session cookie. Thereafter, anybody using the same cookie can be assumed as having the same login/password as the original login prompt submission.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. If you don't think that the cookie is the shining green square over your head identifying who you are and threading all your activity together from the moment you logged in, it's because you don't understand the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW: I write this stuff for a living. It's amusing when somebody thinks I don't know how this stuff works... How do you think Reddit is able to thread your comments together?

       No... it wasn't. It goes through HTTPS and gives you a session cookie in return.

       If you mean tying some random incoming information with a user, it's through a session cookie like we've been talking about.

       I'm not arguing that reddit couldn't benefit from HTTPS or that HTTPS is bad. I'm just saying that your complaint that the NSA can read reddit is meaningless. Unless you specifically put it there, your comments do not contain any personally identifiable information. The fact that's it's possible to steal session cookies doesn't change that.

       Yea sure but if the NSA is here at reddit watching our posts from 15 y/o I mean, why even make a big deal out of it. If they want the information they'll get it regardless of how much security you have cause any encryption is nothing against the one at the highest level really and if you wanna do comparisons it's like fucking with a hole in the condom, it doesnt mean shit, it wont protect shit and it wont help shit. Thats my point. You will feel safe but you wont be safe.

       Na but im just saying. Everything is 'crackable', I dont think you can stop da gov from getting whatever the fuck they want the problem is that they are able to, theyre allowed to rule shit, thats the problem, not that reddit is not using hppts and if they did we would somehow be safe, hence the condom reference it might feel safe cause youre not aware of the hole but its not safe, it doesnt mean shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop the gov(yes ill say government, sick of mainstream NSA) from accessing your shit by changing their values rather than try to prevent them somehow with a broken condom just so you can feel safe, you wont be safe and youre not safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill check it out cause I got close to 0 experience in encryption but im thinking if anyone can crack any encryption its the US, they rule shit, theyre the pimps. Also im using logic to support most of my arguments.

       Found a flaw in your system, first chapter-ish
-Key is too easy to guess
-Key has to be send to bob(physical evidence)
-Deterministic
-Prone to frequency analysis

       And that's where you are wrong. Sadly, with this defeatist attitude, you are ensuring that it's true.
       <strong>
        Don't confuse crackable with easily cracked. They are not the same!

       A safe and an envelope are both crackable ways to secure your money. Guess which one does a better job? Yes, any form of encryption can be ultimately brute-forced. But even standard HTTPS takes thousands of CPU YEARS to crack. Even with the NSA's resources, that's nontrivial to crack.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't confuse a simple concept introduction with the state of the art. Are you able to distinguish shades of grey at all?!?

       Youre sitting here in your wizardoutfit preaching and talking about it like religion so I guess encryption or computer coding shit is kinda close to you since you're narrowminded and emotional when you talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check some conspiracy work/theories and learn what the gov is capable off, even if you gonna protect your internet history with https I mean, whats the point, they'll just go to your internet provider or whatever since whatever company etc is connected to anything is just a step up the ladder so who controls them? I really doubt that you can do anything to keep them away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw your comparisons with money in safe and driving a care are really horrible, boring and repetetive

       What do you know about the NSA and why are you only refering to NSA? Do you really think we know everything? Do you think they let us know first? Like "hey we're here to serve humans check this out like no dude, get real, you dont know shit, i dont know shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you talking about this like religion? Did you get molested by your dad who was an safe cracker or whats the problem jesus christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyhow cba anymore, you know more than me about keeping money in envelopes and safes sure but I dont think you understand the power of the gov really.

       HTTPS is a form of PKI. Tor obfuscates the originator of a  connection. Setting up my own Reddit clone doesn't help much when nobody shows up to the party..

       EDIT: Keep up the good work! Learn how the machine works! You started by learning about the packet contents, learn about the OSI model and how all the different layers work. Things like subnet masking, routing protocols, class A/B/C networks, etc. Knowing how the whole thing works is a highly valuable understanding and the pay is very nice...
      </p>
      <p>
       Oooh! Somebody has seen http headers! (nerd chills) Sadly, this is
       <em>
        NOT
       </em>
       exactly how it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, this isn't the entire connection, just the packet contents. You forgot layer 3 which includes the IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your password was passed in the clear.... when you logged in. At that time the connection was made between your password and the (typical) session cookie. Thereafter, anybody using the same cookie can be assumed as having the same login/password as the original login prompt submission.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. If you don't think that the cookie is the shining green square over your head identifying who you are and threading all your activity together from the moment you logged in, it's because you don't understand the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW: I write this stuff for a living. It's amusing when somebody thinks I don't know how this stuff works... How do you think Reddit is able to thread your comments together?
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: LOL server name '; DROP TABLE servertypes; -- Reddit attempts a SQL injection attack in their http response headers?!? Ha ha There a story in there someplace....
