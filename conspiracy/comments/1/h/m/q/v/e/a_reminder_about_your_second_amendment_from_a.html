        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live in a country in the northern Europe (Sweden) where its citizens have absolutely no means to protect themselves in case of a crime. The only thing is to cry &quot;police&quot; and hope for the best. And our police are just as indoctrinated and brutal as yours and most people knows better then to call them in times of need. </p>

<p>My country has roughly a million more people then the population of New York City. Internationally our politicians are loudmouths but everybody knows they sit in their masters laps. And it&#39;s made so by design and have been so for a long time. There is not much to do about it I&#39;m afraid. </p>

<p>Many people are looking over to USA to see if you are going to fall or not. We&#39;re not looking at it as some kind of last bastion of freedom, because lets face it that ship is long gone. Now it&#39;s down to If the people of your nation are going to wake up and reclaim your land or fall and take the rest of the &quot;free&quot; world with them. If America is plunged into chaos, Europe has like two weeks before we&#39;re mincemeat. </p>

<p>So how about it America, wtf are you going to do? I&#39;m not hoping for a civil war but I am hoping for more whistle blowers, more sheriffs taking a stand, a little civil disobedience (protests) and above all that you start to take your Second Amendment very seriously. Because the moment it is gone, it&#39;s game over. This is the only real power you&#39;ve got as a citizen against your government, it&#39;s the power to defend yourself in the face of oppression or tyranny. </p>

<p>Perhaps think about what this guy has to say for a moment: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpAUJhxK4so">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpAUJhxK4so</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics#Sweden">Gun ownership requires license and is regulated by the weapon law, Vapenlagen.  The law doesn&#39;t ban any specific firearms or weapons, it merely states the requirements to own one. Everything from pepperspray to full-automatic machine guns are technically legal, and license to civilians can be given in &#39;special&#39; cases. <strong>Like the other Nordic countries Sweden has a high rate of gun ownership, due to the popularity of hunting.</strong></a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d just like to take an opportunity to point out how overused the word &quot;shill&quot; is in this community.  Contrary to popular belief, a shill is not simply any person who disagrees with you.  A shill is a person whose opinion is partial to the whims of another&#39;s authority, likely because they are in that authority&#39;s employ.  The likelihood of that user&#39;s comment being the result of corporate sponsorship is less likely even than his being serious -- which is already pretty clearly tenuous.  Additionally, I&#39;d like to point out that if anyone has the resources to sway public opinion in this debate, it&#39;s arms manufacturers.  There isn&#39;t actually a lot of money to be made in convincing people not to buy guns -- much less question a Swede&#39;s heritage on reddit.  The healthy thing for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> right now is to differentiate between a conspiracy and a stiff breeze.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From wiktionary.org:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>n. 1. A person paid to endorse a product favourably, while pretending to be impartial.
2.  An accomplice at a confidence trick during an auction or gambling game.</p>

<p>v. 1.  To promote or endorse in return for payment, especially dishonestly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From wikipedia.org:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...is a person who publicly helps a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization.</p>

<p>&quot;Shill&quot; typically refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers the impression that they are an enthusiastic independent customer of a seller (or marketer of ideas) for whom they are secretly working. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The etymology of the word is admittedly a little murky, but there&#39;s a general consensus that the meaning derives from their work alongside a decoy, auctioneer, or circus performer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a non-swede living in Sweden, and I can confirm that people have a right to own weapons IF they take a full hunting exam, or if they&#39;re a member Of a shooting club.  I&#39;m not even allowed to shoot s fucking rabbit without training and proof that I&#39;m good enough with a rifle to take down a moving wild boar or moose. </p>

<p>Sure. People here own guns, but it&#39;s a long LONG way from the way it is in the USA. You can&#39;t simply own a 9mm handgun for the hell of it or for &quot;home security&quot;, and there&#39;s no way you&#39;d get stuff like &quot;open a bank account here and get a free gun&quot; happening. </p>

<p>As for OPs &quot;nothing you can do&quot; though, that&#39;s knackers. 
Sure, I&#39;ve witnessed a load of swedes stand around and twiddle their thumbs as shit goes down, but some get stuck in. </p>

<p>As för me, My house is my castle, and I have an axe and I know how to throw it. So long as my assailant is standing 2,4,6 or 8 meters away, they&#39;re <em>fucked</em>. 
Closer than 2 and I won&#39;t need to buy meat for a while. </p>

<p>Besides, guns here are kept in safes. Not in your bedside table where the kids can get&#39;em. That&#39;s just stupid. 
And people don&#39;t just carry them around when they&#39;re in town. That&#39;s daft too. </p>

<p>Axes. If everyone had axes instead of guns, there&#39;d be a lot less death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No small arms, no matter how much you fire it, will do shit against a tank besides maybe destroying a periscope or camera on the outside. And to do that you need a carefully aimed semi auto shot. Full auto would just waste bullets and maybe scratch the paint if you are lucky</p>

<p>The way to take down tanks is by flanking them, taking out infantry support, and then moving up to put explosives on the top where the armor is thinest. Tanks are meant for attacking fortified locations, they have no use against a guerrilla force.  </p>

That&#39;s why soldiers fire small &quot;bursts&quot; of accurate semi auto fire, maybe one shot a second or so unless they are just laying down covering fire, then they might fire a little faster. </p>

<p>And if you were paying attention I never said I could fire 10 times a second, realistically I could fire about 3-4 times a second. And I could aim just as good as anyone else could while firing anything that fast, which is not at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is completely untrue.</p>

<p>It depends on the gun you&#39;re using, as if you&#39;ve ever watched any youtube videos of guys dual wielding P90s full auto, you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s very accurate.</p>

<p>So imagine using a proper firing stance and grip while using only one P90 on full-auto and you have yourself a very accurate death machine right there.</p>

<p>The G36 is also very accurate on full-auto.</p>

<p>Like I said, depends on the gun and the firing position you&#39;re in, as an M-247 on a bipod in the prone position is pretty damn accurate on full auto.</p>

<p>Really though there aren&#39;t many practical situations in which to use full-auto, which is why it&#39;s mainly used as a suppressant so as to advance ones position on the enemy by keeping them pinned.</p>

Here is a story about 30 marines taking on over 200 insurgents: <a href="http://www.captainsjournal.com/2008/11/24/kill-ratio-fifty-zero/">http://www.captainsjournal.com/2008/11/24/kill-ratio-fifty-zero/</a></p>

<p>Your statement sounds good, but it is flawed.  Marines are trained to follow orders, yes, some will question authority, no doubt.  But, their superiors would turn any civilian uprisings into a domestic terrorism story, dispatch the marines, they dispatch you, and game over for you.  You might think &#39;any mortal can be killed&#39; but these people are trained to counter death and get the job done.  A group of software developers and liquor store owners brandishing their 2nd amendment rights will barely get the cartridge loaded before being taken out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>US corruption with police means that they ticket and process you for terribly trivial infractions.  This all goes through the proper channels and the police get their kick back on the backside with higher wages, benefits and retirements.  In other countries police are paid little and make their money more on commission, if you will.  The US people call this <em>&quot;corruption&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>So say that you are driving your car and you get a minor traffic infraction.  You are then technically under arrest.  At this point the police are now extorting money out of you by being able to impound your car and cost you $1000-2000 to get it back and to haul you into jail.  Then when you sign their piece of paper you are literally making &quot;bail&quot;.  So you get to go on your merry way to mail them the check.  Don&#39;t forget to say &quot;thank you&quot; to the cop after he extorts you.  This money goes into the system and the &quot;law enforcement&quot; is paid out of that money.  Not corrupt or dishonest at all.</p>

<p>I think that most Americans confuse residual wealth with freedom.  As the residual wealth bleeds out Americans will only be left with their desperately difficult to maintain illusions.</p>

<p>fall : to become less or lower; become of a lower level, degree, amount, quality, value, number, etc.; decline. Yes you&#39;re right. It depends on oil. The dollar is worthless unless we have the power to point a gun at anyone who threatens it. It was supposed to be 35 dollars for an ounce of gold when it was made world currency. Money now doesn&#39;t represent anything but debt to a 3rd party (federal reserve) that can&#39;t be paid for. If you don&#39;t believe me, just read the words on paper money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a major reason (real) conservatives desire small government. You can manage local elections, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Athens_%281946%29">or if things get out of hand you can actually force change in corrupt politicians.</a>. When you have an overarching, bloated, unmanageable government, you end up with too much lobbyist style gang members who sit around like Ebenezer Scrooge hoarding money while oppressing those &quot;under him&quot;.</p>

<p>I actually admire what Democrats want to accomplish, however government is made of people, and the ones attracted to the power of government are almost never the ones that will do what&#39;s best for the people, they do what is best for themselves under the guise of being for the people.</p>

<p>This is why Libertarianism is growing and why there was such a push for Ron Paul last election. He was the ONLY candidate who was fighting for the rights of the people. (This is not an endorsement, of Paul, just an explanation)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me like the majority of the American public has no idea what their government is really up to. I find that too many people are oblivious to the real reasons for the NSA spying, the Egypt protests, the Syrian conflict, and other issues. The ugly side of the American government is now revealing its true nature, and we&#39;re living during a crucial time where we must let others know about the level of corruption that is present in our political and economical systems.</p>

<p>People need to wake up from their lives of distraction and begin thinking about their future from a greater perspective. Our future is not what we think it will be. Our technologies have been shaping our culture and will continue to do so in an accelerated rate. It won&#39;t be a future for the individual. It will be a future for the collective. Most, if not all problems, can be fixed if we all act on it. But each of us has to put our hearts and minds to it. We&#39;re living in a society that is more connected than ever, and we have more power than we can comprehend. I don&#39;t know about you, but I really don&#39;t want corrupted, selfish, power-hungry, out-dated individuals to decide the future of our planet. I feel it&#39;s time for some real change. And this change will only begin by spreading awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It certainly defies the reputation. But then again, I&#39;m Canadian. Within the last five-odd years our police have beaten peaceful protesters in Toronto, accidentally tazed an unarmed man to death in Vancouver, beaten a man nearly to death in Medicine Hat and sexually assaulted female RCMP officers across the country, yet we have a fantastic reputation. If OP is legit, it might just be a case of paranoia: buddy focuses on the handful of crazy cops even though 99% of Swedish police are kind, level-headed and respectable.</p>

<p>Buddy may also be a radical gun nut, upset about the fact that you may be charged with use of unnecessary force if you shoot someone whom you think poses a threat.</p>

<p>FWIW I feel safe around Canadian police, but I also don&#39;t hold any beliefs my government deems &quot;dangerous.&quot;</p>

To say that our police force is as brutal and corrupt as the Americans is just plain wrong, simple as that. Sure, there are some cases where a criminal might have been punched a few times in the face for no good reason, but that policeman got heavily penalized. There&#39;s not as much &#39;going around the system&#39;, as Swedish court-laws are very different from American.  </p>

People here don&#39;t have the same affection to guns as the Americans do.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re forgetting the reason for my post. I&#39;m saying to US: &quot;Keep your guns or face the obvious threat of tyranny and oppression.&quot; </p>

<p>But what you are saying is that you think its acceptable having someone else protecting you, i.e the police. And perhaps you do not feel like I do when I say that the police have become very brutal and in a very high degree they simply follow orders. Which to me is no better then being guards in a prison camp. </p>

<p>One might argue that the police in Sweden are simply following the laws. But the laws have become corrupt and doesn&#39;t protect or help the people anymore. The US constitution doesn&#39;t allow laws to come in its place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution, are null and void.&quot; Chief Justice Marshall, Marbury v. Madison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the point with my post. If the American people doesn&#39;t take their Second Amendment very seriously. You&#39;ll end up like Sweden or Finland where the laws can be bent and twisted into whatever they like. And people regard guns as something scary or for sports and hunting. And in the process they become easy pray to a government who oppresses the people.</p>

<p>Its sad. Thankfully more and more people up here are waking up to this fact everyday. But it takes time since indoctrination have come a looong way.</p>

<p>The almighty dollar would collapse and there is nothing to take its place. Markets would quickly collapse and Europe which is as stable as a two legged dog, would have just enough time to enjoy one last time out on the pub before happy hour is permanently over.</p>

Just like to remind everyone the most important thing associated with the practice of carrying will always be...Safety! After the training from a CCW class a greater understanding of carrying a gun takes hold, it teaches you to become more aware of your surroundings, &amp; most off teaches you that your first line of defense is your mind, &amp; choosing to remove yourself from a situation or environment that may have threatening aspects associated with it.

    <div class="md"><p>The second amendment is not what&#39;s keeping this country from falling apart.  Obama is not lying awake at night worried about a pistol in a night stand.  The second amendment was never about protecting the people from its own government, no matter how hard the NRA tries to remake history.</p>

<p>The second amendment was created in a time when someone really good with a gun could get off three aimed shots in a minute with a musket.  It was created in a time when the United States had no standing army to defend its citizens.  The amendment&#39;s purpose was akin to Switzerland&#39;s laws.  When called upon to defend your state or your country, you would have the tools to do so.  A gun in every house was a national defense strategy and, for the time, the only viable one.</p>

<p>Everyone is doing the whole hand-wringing thing about the United States.  It&#39;s actually kind of cute.  However, this country was founded with a strong constitution and a long tradition of the rule of law.  In times of crisis in the past we cruelly bent the constitution out of shape.  We did horrible things to it.  Worse things than we could EVER imagine doing now.  Abraham Lincoln basically pissed on the first amendment and made it seditious to criticize his government.  We interred tens of thousands of citizens because they happened to be of Japanese descent in WW2.  We were complicit in the deaths of hundreds of black men to do a science experiment in STDs.  We had a president (Nixon) who actively terrorized his political opponents and tried to blackmail the press into silence.</p>

<p>Even people who whine about Fox News don&#39;t get it.  William Randolph Hearst had more media power than Rupert Murdoch could ever even in his wildest dreams have.  Hearst also used his huge empire to actually try to gain office.  It can even be argued that he started a war simply by using that empire to rabble-rouse with false articles.  Fox News has only a fraction of Hearst&#39;s power in his heyday.</p>

<p>And if it appears that our two-party system is fundamentally broken, I point out that there were many times in our history where congress froze and were at each other&#39;s throats.  Sometimes literally.  Even our &quot;Citizens United&quot; ruling, as dumb as it is, pales in comparison to bought and paid for elections of the late 1800s and early 1900s.  Tammany Hall, anyone?</p>

<p>The reason our system works, and the reason why there is (comparatively) little corruption is that both parties HATE each other and want to win congressional districts.  There&#39;s no better way to unseat an opponent than to accuse him/her of corruption or criminal behavior.  And if there are facts to back that up, so much the better.  (Though having said that, politics by definition is corruption, so there will always be that element to any government.)</p>

<p>So relax.  Put down that gun.  There&#39;s no need to go and join a militia group somewhere in Montana.  The United States is not in the best place right now.  We&#39;re struggling with some issues.  But we are, by NO means, in a place where we&#39;re about to shatter as a country.</p>

<p>If I were you, I&#39;d look more to the EU.  The only thing holding Europe together is Germany because they weren&#39;t stupid with their economy.  Greece, Spain, France, and to a smaller extent Italy are all going through what in any OTHER era be called a &quot;depression&quot;.  There&#39;s not enough money in the German economy to staunch the flow of deficits.  I&#39;m sitting in the United States wondering when the EU is going to fall to pieces.  I&#39;m wondering what effect that&#39;ll have on US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Bill of Rights isn&#39;t about protecting people from the government.  It&#39;s about enshrining a set of expectations about how people are treated.  On the one hand you could call that &quot;protection from&quot;.  I, however, choose to call it &quot;declaration of rights that the government protects&quot;.  I think my interpretation holds a bit more water, since the Supreme Court is part of the government you say the Bill of Rights is protecting us from, and yet the Supreme Court acts as a (sometimes flawed) arbiter of such rights.</p>

<p>If we take your argument as a rule, then the Supreme Court has no real function.  Indeed, the base of all oaths of public service is to defend and protect the constitution, which the Bill of Rights (by way of the amendment process) is part.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m very nonchalant about corruption.  And extracting wealth from the populous to give to the rich has a long and storied history.  Ever hear of the rail barons?  The pre-Union corporate indentured servitude?  &quot;Company Store&quot;?  We&#39;ve gone through a couple of periods where the rich ran roughshod over the populace.  These things go in cycles.</p>

<p>As I said in my previous post, we are going through a rough patch.  What I argue against is the concept that we&#39;re somehow in danger of an immanent collapse.  And moreover I argue with the notion that the second amendment is all that is saving us from that collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What real purpose do oaths of public service have when the people taking the oaths are corrupt? As the populous, it is our responsibility to enforce those oaths that were taken. Whether it be by voting, protesting, or simply disobeying. It&#39;s is the populous&#39; who enforces the law of the land when the elite become corrupt. This is the way it is throughout all of nature. It always has been this way and always will be. Megalomaniacal leaders believe they can defeat nature. The amount of corruption going on in the world today is going to force people to find truth on their own. The cause of the collapse of America will not be our laws being taken away, it will be from a populous who looks to the corrupt government for direction. </p>

<p>Collapse may not be <strong>imminent</strong>, but it&#39;s certainly within two or three generations. This is sad for our children because we can actually do something about it now.</p>

<p>&quot;Let a regular army [equipped with muskets], fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger.&quot;</p>

<p>Even so, I&#39;d like to make a point here.  I&#39;m still technically correct in my view, since at the time states were considered to be much more independent than they are today (the Civil War changed that).</p>

<p>He&#39;s still talking about a government defending itself from foreign invaders.  It&#39;s just that, in his case, he&#39;s talking about state governments protecting themselves against a foreign invader (in his case, the federal government).  Again, this was kinda settled in the Civil War.  But in any case, it&#39;s still a GOVERNMENTAL context, not your next-door-neighbor Bob stocking up on rifles because &quot;the gub&#39;ment is coming to take away mah raights&quot;.</p>

<p>This thread, to me, is not about the second amendment.  It&#39;s not about defending it or opposing it.  My entire point in this thread is that the second amendment is NOT what is keeping us from disintegrating as a country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Civil War did lead to some constitutional amendments, but they served to further restrict the federal and state governments. In no way did they somehow transform the federal government from &quot;foreign&quot; to &quot;domestic&quot;. The federal government was never foreign.</p>

<p>I can agree that pistols and hunting rifles aren&#39;t keeping the country from disintegrating any more than they prevented all of the unconstitutional encroachments in the name of the drug war, terror war, banking sector, etc.</p>

<p>What is preventing total disintegration is that some people in power still do value the rule of law and the concept of a limited and accountable government. So, for example, in a system governed by law, those who believe the 2nd Amendment is obsolete will follow the constitutionally valid procedure to repeal the amendment.</p>

<p>Disintegration is occurring because too many people consider the law of the land to be an inconvenient obstacle to their &quot;jobs&quot; (or what they perceive as their jobs), preferring instead to slither around it and hope the Supreme Court or the people in general don&#39;t wake up and act in time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Implying that 100% of American soldiers would comply with slaughtering their own people.</p>

<p>Insurgent tactics can fuck the hell out out of a standard military.  We certainly wouldn&#39;t be able to out gun them, but I&#39;m sure as hell that the many seasoned vets out here wouldn&#39;t have a terrible time taking a few good chunks out of whatever pimply faced kids they have just coming out of boot.</p>

<p>To effectively slaughter people without losing your head you have to be under the impression that you&#39;re protecting something.  My money would be on an armed populace protecting their families than troops protecting their buddies while slaughtering their countrymen.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s always the drones....  Honestly those worry me the most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on that going into a armed conflict with the (any) government is not a good idea. That should be the absolute last option. And let&#39;s not mistake &quot;government&quot; for something abstract. The people you would be facing would be your own countrymen. The guys in charge will most certainly not be running around killing people, they would be safely hidden inside some bunker somewhere like the cowards they are.</p>

<p>What I meant was that the thing that&#39;s keeping governments in check: Is that the people is armed. And can defend themselves if necessary against oppression and tyranny.</p>

<p>And I already said what I came up with that I think people can do: </p>

<p>*&quot;So how about it America, wtf are you going to do? I&#39;m not hoping for a civil war but I am hoping for more whistle blowers, more sheriffs taking a stand, a little civil disobedience (protests) and above all that you start to take your Second Amendment very seriously. Because the moment it is gone, it&#39;s game over. This is the only real power you&#39;ve got as a citizen against your government, it&#39;s the power to defend yourself in the face of oppression or tyranny.&quot; *</p>

<p>And my first post was really just meant as my own reflections to the problems in the world. I don&#39;t say that I absolutely know the solution to this mess and the NWO.  But what you have in America with the Second Amendment is really important. Without it, the world would be in a lot more trouble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s right though. Maybe from over there in Sweden you don&#39;t realize this, but America is in no danger of being disarmed. Not even remotely.</p>

<p>There are estimated to be over 300 million guns in America - that&#39;s about one for each man, woman and child in the country. Even if the government decided to ban all guns tomorrow, there would be no practical way to actually disarm everyone. Even the most hardcore gun control advocates acknowledge this, which is why they focus on other ways to stop violence.</p>

<p>And the government is nowhere close to passing even the mildest restriction on guns. The NRA is one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington and will fund campaign ads against anyone in Congress who votes for gun control.</p>

<p>So yeah, we face a lot of problems here in the States, but the idea that the Second Amendment is in danger is the complete opposite of the actual reality. It also suggests that widespread gun ownership doesn&#39;t really protect you from a slowly advancing, oppressive government as much as people would like to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not nitpicking. Your entire premise is off. Gun rights are under no threat here. We&#39;ve just had a rash of shootings and not a single law has been passed and none are likely to be. And we&#39;re hardly in danger of falling. I can&#39;t even tell from your post whether you want the US to fall. Fall to what, exactly? You claim that the &quot;moment is gone&quot;, implying that the Second Amendment has failed when it&#39;s stronger that it has ever been.</p>

<p>And, lastly and most importantly, the claim that guns are the only &quot;real power&quot; we have as citizens is total bunk. We have the power to vote, locally and nationally. We have the power to speak and to broadcast and organize (which you, yourself suggest) and the power of our wallets.</p>

<p>Maybe rephrase your post to make some more coherent points and I can address them individually, but as it stands, it&#39;s close to incoherent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the fundamental problem isn&#39;t &quot;money in politics&quot; or any other pseudo solution that the mainstream media will ever mention. Obviously they aren&#39;t going to tell you how to dismantle their control system over the government. So I will.</p>

<p>Congress is 51% lawyers (liars) despite the fact that America itself is &lt;1% lawyers. (The recurring &lt;1% vs 99%+ theme here is relevant too.)</p>

<p>Congress is ~40% millionaires (including some of the lawyers), despite the fact that America&#39;s constituency is &lt;4% millionaires.</p>

<p>So how do we use this information to dismantle the control system in place?</p>

<p>Vote out all the rich and all the lawyers, with no regard whatsoever for professed political party, because anyone with open eyes can see that there is just one dominant political party in the United States: the Authoritarian Plutarchy party and unwholesome host of lying red &amp; blue members in Congress.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:  Vote out the rich/lawyers and we can take back America without violence in a single election cycle. Neat huh?</strong></p>

The fact that you talk about like &quot;hey, you guys, the us, remember the Second Amendment, you dont know how important that is&quot; thats a retarded statement and not only that but you used it in your topic then you didnt even talk about the Second Amendment. :S</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So how about it America, wtf are you going to do? I&#39;m not hoping for a civil war but I am hoping for more whistle blowers, more sheriffs taking a stand</p>
</blockquote>

<p>like wow, thats how you fight a civil war or whats your point? Again, sorry for sounding like a cunt but your post is stupid. I bets its this snowden thing and now you think like &quot;whoa guys, we need to protest about this!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;whistleblowers&quot; have been known since like 70 years back, Snowden isn&#39;t the first one to leak and theres even conspiracys about the leak being an operation anyway so dont get so psyched all of sudden since its really really really known, its only the dubstep-mainstream-hipster-kids that find out about it in 2013.</p>

<p>What. Of course you have &quot;means&quot; to protect yourself. Do you have a gun license feel free to fucking use it. Are you trained in martial arts or maybe you have pepper spray in your purse - use it. </p>

<p>Sweden is a democracy. Bullshit. The only democracy we have is that we vote a couple of times and then nothing. When the voting is done the politicians does not care about us, they do not embrace our ideas because they just wanted to get in bed with the voters to get elected.

Miller, 1939, unanimous decision) specifically spelled out that no individual right was to found in that amendment because that was the very well understood very well settled history of it. It wasn&#39;t until special interest groups representing gun manufacturers in the &#39;70&#39;s started pouring millions into revisionist history to sell guns uninhibited that an activist Supreme Court (narrow 5-4 decision, all Republicans in majority of course) that an individual right suddenly appears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Britain used it&#39;s standing royal army to undermine the sovereignty of the colonies and the fear was that if the United States had a standing federal army it would undermine that of the states. So it was figured that the defense of the country would come from state militias, which is what the 2nd Amendment authorizes. Now obviously a patchwork of state militias is a terrible method of defense so by the time the War of 1812 ends we moved to a national defense model making that Amendment, like the 3rd largely a relic of the time in which it was written. That&#39;s what that Amendment was to the people who made it. They could&#39;ve used the very well understood language of British common law of private gun ownership like the first Pennsylvania and Vermont state Constitutions did, but they explicitly did not. The &quot;right of the people to keep and bear arms&quot; was necessary for a &quot;well-regulated militia&quot;, and often men would be mandated to purchase firearms where they would then be stored in local armories; a privately held gun wouldn&#39;t do much good for a militia effort. It&#39;s not for personal defense, not to fight government tyranny (why would the people who just shed blood to create a country put it in their Constitution that the people can raise a violent revolution against it, no country would be so self-defeating. Diffusion of power among the branches and local, state and federal governments was Madison&#39;s built-in defense against tyranny, not violence). </p>

<p>And every country on planet Earth is capitalistic, there is no socialism. Some have a more well regulated form of it as Europeans typically do, but they&#39;re still market economies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Broader definition and extensive registration</p>

<p>Firstly, in Sweden there is a noticeably broad definition of what constitutes rape. This means that more acts in Sweden are regarded and registered as rape than in the majority of other countries. Secondly, in Sweden a lot of effort is made to register all cases that can be suspected to be rape. As this is done at a very early stage of the process, cases are included that later turn out to be some other sex crime, or even no crime at all. In addition to this, all individual acts are registered — not just the latest occasion or the main crime. In many other countries cases like these are filtered out and do not show up in the statistics.</p>

<p>I suspect you&#39;re trying to nitpick every single thing as to be able and point towards one little thing and then say with a loud voice: &quot;Look I&#39;ve completely shredded this argument, then the rest must also be equally false&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a non-swede living in Sweden, and I can confirm that people have a right to own weapons IF they take a full hunting exam, or if they&#39;re a member Of a shooting club.  I&#39;m not even allowed to shoot s fucking rabbit without training and proof that I&#39;m good enough with a rifle to take down a moving wild boar or moose. </p>

<p>Sure. People here own guns, but it&#39;s a long LONG way from the way it is in the USA. You can&#39;t simply own a 9mm handgun for the hell of it or for &quot;home security&quot;, and there&#39;s no way you&#39;d get stuff like &quot;open a bank account here and get a free gun&quot; happening. </p>

<p>As for OPs &quot;nothing you can do&quot; though, that&#39;s knackers. 
Sure, I&#39;ve witnessed a load of swedes stand around and twiddle their thumbs as shit goes down, but some get stuck in. </p>

<p>As för me, My house is my castle, and I have an axe and I know how to throw it. So long as my assailant is standing 2,4,6 or 8 meters away, they&#39;re <em>fucked</em>. 
Closer than 2 and I won&#39;t need to buy meat for a while. </p>

<p>Besides, guns here are kept in safes. Not in your bedside table where the kids can get&#39;em. That&#39;s just stupid. 
And people don&#39;t just carry them around when they&#39;re in town. That&#39;s daft too. </p>

<p>Axes. If everyone had axes instead of guns, there&#39;d be a lot less death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m from Sweden and have lived in different parts of the country. To say that our police force is as brutal and corrupt as the Americans is just plain wrong, simple as that. Sure, there are some cases where a criminal might have been punched a few times in the face for no good reason, but that policeman got heavily penalized. There&#39;s not as much &#39;going around the system&#39;, as Swedish court-laws are very different from American.  </p>

Then you came in and pointed out that they don&#39;t sell stingers at Walmart.  I knew you were joking, but who cares?  I was making a distinction between &quot;publicly available&quot; and &quot;legal&quot;, apparently you do not.  Marijuana is not legal (in my state) but it most certainly is &quot;publicly available&quot;.</p>
