    <div class="md"><p>This.  Any other sub people would downvote the shit out of you, and comment &quot;But our government does a great job keeping us safe, and if something happens I have no problem giving them whatever they need to give us that safety.&quot;  It&#39;s pretty sickening, considering in all seriousness the biggest threat to the American people as a whole is our own government.  Like, do they honestly want us to believe China, or Russia, or Al Qaeda is going to invade the United States to take us over?  Or North Korea who can&#39;t feed it&#39;s own population can get a nuke over here?  Meanwhile we have the NDAA, politicians on corporate and bank payroll, and now the shit with the NSA, the IRS, etc.  The government is looking out for itself, it doesn&#39;t give a shit about the people or our rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been having dreams about nuclear explosions in a city full of people and my dreams usually don&#39;t make that much sense.  The foreshadowing in popular culture seems to be there again, like it was prior to 9-11 I just can&#39;t seem to work out all the details.  Outside of abstract thinking, I look at current events and I see the Arab Spring starting again in full force, tons of geopolitical scandals along with upheaval, and the beginning of another financial crisis starting with Europe and China.  We&#39;re also seeing massive weather fluctuations, a mass species die off, radiation spread everywhere from Fukushima, and chemtrails becoming more prevalent.   The timing for a distraction or an event that could lead to a major war seems frighteningly perfect. :\</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had similar nightmares in 2010 of air raid sirens and nuclear devastation. That&#39;s actually what alerted me to start paying attention to world events. The weird thing is that prior to those nightmares I never watched many &quot;end times&quot; videos or worried much about world events. They were so vivid and haunting that they would wake me up in the middle of the night. I couldn&#39;t even bare to hear the train blast its horn in my town. It was almost like PTSD, but of a memory that hasn&#39;t happened. (yet)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why people down-vote like that, but I&#39;d guess it was the comparison of your post-dream reactions to PTSD. I have it and can see how others could be sensitive about such a comparison, but some nightmares can really shake you up so I understand what you mean.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve also had some vivid apocalypse nightmares lately, which is an unusual theme for me. The last scenario was of a meteor hitting the earth, but it could&#39;ve doubled as a nuclear bomb. My family and I watched as it approached and appeared to bounce off the surface of the ocean. Suddenly everything went white, and I stood in nothingness- presumably dead- for a moment before waking up.</p>

<li><p>the normalization of leaks, </p></li>
<li><p>the fundamental loss of any faith amongst the non-proletariat in their goverments&#39; protection of their privacy, </p></li>
<li><p>the complete derrigation (that&#39;s prob. incorrect spelling) of the legally and technically empower-eds&#39; concepts (even) of the public&#39;s privacy, </p></li>
<li><p>the almost complete absence of any discourse, at all, of moral imperfection attached to privacy violations - coupled with the acceptance of these violations</p></li>
<li><p>the free availablity of high tech encryptions systems for those who can and wish to use them </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, I was asking the perfectly reasonable question of: &quot;what makes you feel that?&quot;</p>
