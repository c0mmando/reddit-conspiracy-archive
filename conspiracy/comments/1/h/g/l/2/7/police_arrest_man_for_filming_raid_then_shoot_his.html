    <div class="md"><p>This is probably my biggest &quot;fear&quot;. It is why I certified my dog as a service dog. He has an official  service dog harness and is protected under state and federal laws.</p>

<p>Conducting yourself in a lawful manner when police are around is very crucial. This is why if a cop approached me around my dog, I would immediate ID my dog first-declaring him as a service dog and informing the officer that my dog is protected by law. I would then delegate myself, in accordance to the law, in a way that will diffuse the situation as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>My protocol when dealing with the police:</p>

<ol>
<li>Film everything.</li>
<li>Declare and ID my service dog.</li>
<li>Do not answer any questions. Willingly inform the officer that I will not answer any questions. </li>
<li>Ask if I am being detained or if I am free to go.</li>
<li>Rinse, repeat</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, in the event that I am pulled over, I have a different protocol:</p>

<ol>
<li>Film everything.</li>
<li>ID and declare my service dog.</li>
<li>Require the officer ID himself.</li>
<li>Require the officer to inform on what reasons I have been pulled over and what crime I am being ACCUSED of.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t answer any questions. Willingly inform the officer that I will not answer any questions.</li>
<li>Next step depends on if the cop states that I have committed a crime or not.  Notice, I still have not ID&#39;d myself or given any information. If I have been unlawfully pulled over and not committed a crime, I will then begin &quot;am I being detained or am I free to go&quot;. If I have been accused of a crime, I will then begin the delegation process of interacting with a corporate policy enforcer who is accusing me of a corporate crime. Thats next level law term speak and I feel that I have already strayed from the point:</li>
</ol>

<p>anyone hurts my dog, IM TAKIN&#39; EM DOWN</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, my dog goes wherever I go. Hotels, hospitals, on the plane with me (big perk, most of the time they make the dog fly with luggage but service dogs can board with you), into the grocery store, the library.....</p>

<p>I actually decided to certify him because someone called the cops on me when we left him in the car, parked in the shade, windows rolled down, with some water in 72 degree weather for 10 minutes (I timed how long we were gone, cuz Im a good pet owner).</p>

<p>I figure the best way to avoid any future event like that is to have him certified and in his official service dog uniform when we are in public. I have cards I can hand out to people who question it (the cards just state the laws that protect the dog and basically informs the person they can&#39;t ask me to leave or state my disability because its a violation of my rights etc). </p>

<p>Really though, I find that the majority of people are very welcoming . A lot of people stop by to greet my dog, which is great! Its a wonderful way to interact with people, IMO. :)</p>

<p>Anyways, you should definitely look into your state laws and requirements for certifying your dog. Most states are very lax and allow the owner to train the dog (you don&#39;t have to pay for specific training schools or anything). All in all it cost me $110 which included his harness, 2 stickers for my vehicle, 2 photo IDs, and 150 hand out cards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, the only time you will ever need to state or &#39;prove&#39; your disability is in the court of law. Nobody, not even a cop, can ask you to what your disability is (protected by the Americans disability act) They can only lawfully ask what service the dog provides. </p>

<p>My dog is a stress therapy dog. He is very sensitive to peoples emotions and stress levels. If he senses anxiety, anger,  stress or sadness he will approach you and comfort you by leaning/loving on you. He has done this to complete strangers.</p>

<p>In my state, there is no special requirement for certifying your dog UNLESS its a seeing eye dog. Do I have a disability that needs a service dog?</p>

<p>My logic is that no Dr will ever rule that a dog is bad for ones health which makes stress therapy service dogs the most reasonable approach :).</p>

<p>My dog weighs 40 lbs. He is half basset hound, half rottweiler. Here are some pix:

<p>I think it is because Reddit has grown too big to not be reigned in by the <em>powers that be</em> and a lot of the things that don&#39;t mesh with their agenda are being edited in one way or another.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>would it have been ok to shoot a cop during the slavery period in US history? Or during the period when blacks were not regarded as equals to whites? </p></li>
<li><p>would it have been OK to shoot a cop during the japanese internment area of US history, you know, then the US basically opened concentration camps for the japanese poipulation?</p></li>
<li><p>would it have been ok to shoot a cop during the time of the vietnam protests?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You know, it is very easy to point the fingers at other people, but it becomes kind of challenging to look at his own people, and go, actually, we did something wrong as well. </p>

<p>Or would you say that snoop dogg was wise enough to recognise that the cops most likely give him less hsit because they know him, and was wise enough to recognise that any testimony he could give would be tainted by the fact that he prolly lights his doobies with hundred dollar bills, while the average black person on the streets has it a hundred times worse?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>3 questions: </p>

<p>Question number one: why do you use the word socialism and fascism when you have never ever even talked with someone who lived under it? Because, let me assure you, the US is still millions of miles away from being anything like that. Just ask any german, who had family members living under both systems. </p>

<p>Question number two: Why do you not use the word, organizing a lynchmob, when describing what you do by &quot;doxxing?&quot; Did that hurt you? did you instincitively go, wait a second, I know what organizing a lynchmob really means, after all, I had more then enough black history month, martin luther king days, and so forth. This person is in germany, what does he know about the proper horrors of United states racism, plus, why does he directly implicate me as a racist? 
Well, now you know, turned around of course, how I as a german feel everytime an american of dubious qualifications uses the word &quot;fascism&quot; or &quot;socialism&quot;. </p>

<p>Question number three: Would you like it, if reddit gets taken down under the strict DMCA, PRISM, PATRIOT and so forth laws, and its entire server logs studied? More over, would you like it if I had made snapshots of the entire thing, and then released the names of the people who &quot;brought reddit down&quot;, complete with a paragraph of how they were paid gouvernment shills trying to act as agents provocateurs and how they were directly bought by the gouvernment to post inflammatory comments allowing the government to shut reddit down, complete with street address, names and telephone numbers? Would you love it if a mob of redditors showed up at your doorstep, and forced you to explain why your right to free speech and expression trumps their right to access reddit?</p>

<p>So, yes. I do not condone a police officer shooting dogs willy nilly, I do not condone a forum doxxing &quot;potentially involved&quot; people when I know that anonymous does it twenty times better and more organised (bet you had the same idea, but wondered if anons would want to be your personal army and act on your revenge fantasies, or would turn on you...), and I do not condone people just acting a fool for the sake of it. </p>

<p>If it is really that important to you, consider doing something, instead of posting it for other people to do something. 
But dragging Reddit into the fight with you is uncalled for, and then complaining when reddit mods do what they are hired for, what you knew they would do, is the top of the audacity. </p>
