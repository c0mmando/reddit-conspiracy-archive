    <div class="md"><p>Not only did I cancel my cable from Comcast, I also cancelled my internet with them as well (in favor of a company less likely to share my info).  I have to say, I do not miss it at all.  Any information I want can be found online, and from a variety of perspectives (unlike the controlled MSM).  </p>

<p>I urge everyone to do the same.  You will find (like I did) that you simply don&#39;t need it .  Get apple TV or Netflix, and watch what you want, when you want.  You&#39;ll save a shit load of money, and send a message that we are done with them.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to add that you should consider closing your bank account in favor of a Credit Union.  I&#39;ve never been happier.  Better service, and NO FEES!  I wish I had made the switch years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate TV and NEVER watch it.</p>

<p>The problem with doing what OP suggests, though, is that the VAST majority of us with high-speed connections are limited to ONE provider...in my case it&#39;s Comcast. In order for me to get my Blast circuit for $75/mo I must subscribe to basic cable (at least) also.</p>

<p>One thing that I can recommend for people who are in the service area is a WiMAX connection through a company like Clear (NOT a plug; not an employee). They provide service through the massively overloaded Sprint network I believe, but their service is inexpensive ($35-40/mo) and fast (12-17mbps) depending on the time of day and the load on your home tower. It&#39;s a pretty good alternative to Comcast/TW/WoW and the like--meaning the cable oligopily. </p>

<p>If anybody else has a suggestion to get Comcast-like speeds without paying Comcast (and not hijacking a Comcast customer&#39;s WiFi AP, hehe) please let me know; I&#39;m all ears.</p>
