       <p>
        So what’s the problem?
        <strong>
         Well, if the solar wind was completely gone, galactic cosmic rays should be streaming in from all directions. Instead, Voyager found them coming preferentially from one direction
        </strong>
        . Furthermore, even though the solar particles had dropped off, the probe hasn’t measured any real change in the magnetic fields around it. That’s hard to explain because the galaxy’s magnetic field is thought to be inclined 60 degrees from the sun’s field.
       </p>

        If we are living in such a program, there could be telltale evidence for the underlying lattice used in modeling the space-time continuum, say the researchers. This signature could show up as a limitation in the energy of cosmic rays.
        <strong>
         They would travel diagonally across the model universe and not interact equally in all directions

        , as they otherwise would be expected to do according to present cosmology.

       Of course, but this discovery seems to be what the proposers of that theory state would be possible evidence for it.

       I hope you're not right though, because the people who ran possible simulations like this probably stop running them if the occupants become aware of it!

       Personally, I'd opt for the "we've never been there before and we probably don't understand it very well yet" explanation before the "simulation" one. As the next paragraph in the Discovery News article says, we still need to rule out all possible natural explanations before we even begin to seriously consider the simulation possibility. Not like it matters to us puny humans anyway though.

       This is just me talking here, so don't mistake me for somebody with an opinion that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Ive always wondered what the purpose of 'measurement' and how it effects particles etc.  I mean, there is a reason why if particles are not directly observed you instead indirectly observe the result of the interaction of a probability wave.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would kind of make sense that if we were living inside a very robust simulation that measuring precisely where and how quickly a very large number particles move and interact would bog the system down.  Say every particle that makes up all the matter in a galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead you have probability.  This allows the universe to function within the system, all the while not bogging down that system with too much computation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if that's the case, would it be possible to bog the system down by simply running too many computations?  Or in the case of the universe making too many precise measurements at the same moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, just a thought I had once.

       Strange thought isn't it? I don't understand the details of the physics in question, but I still think it's neat.

       I've sent an email to the paper's author. Perhaps he'll write back.

       I remember watching a documentary on BBC horizon (2012-2011) about time travel and that if it was impossible to travel to past, could we make a computer simulation to emulate it? We could, but we would need to create people in the simulation to make it realistic. The problem being these people would also need to think they are real for us to interact with, they would need to be convinced they are alive and be programmed with emotions such as fear, love, compassion and humor. It got the scientists thinking, what if we are just a big emulation in some programmers world, they somehow ran a statistical analysis of this theory and found it is more likely than not that we are a simulation.
I have no idea how they went about to conclude it but it is an interesting concept none the less

       I haven't seen it, but I would imagine the argument goes something like, given enough time, we should have computers and programming good enough to simulate reality completely. We can already do it on a very tiny level. If that's the case, given enough time, that simulation should develop powerful enough computers to make their own simulation. And then that simulation makes its own, and so on. since there are an infinite number of regresses possible, it's more probable that we're one of the simulations than that we're the original?

       exactly, kind of like the matrix, when they realize that the real world they are fighting for is just another matrix within another matrix and so fourth, it went 6 levels deep I think. An interesting concept none the less

       IMO Billions of stars, billions of galaxies and to anyone thinking there is not billions of universes is foolish. One on top of another colliding and just missing each other. There is no beginning and there is no end to them. Ex-Nihilo is false as something comes from something. Big Bang  occurred, but it had resources to draw upon in creating this universe we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just another thing to explore and consider in our lives here. It may very well be that our intelligence my pass from this universe to another one and experience a different reality. Of course that's my opinion and not been factually replicated, so don't get fussy about the cosmological assertion.

       Oh for sure. The multiverse hypothesis has much validity in my opinion. I don't think any scientist honest with themselves really believes a strict ex-nihilo scenario. At the very least one must accept a scenario simpler than the multiverse: that the big bang was the result of a total collapse of an ancestor universe. There's really no reason to accept that there was ever a "time" when there was no space or time at all. Aside from the singular moment of the big bang, of course.

       The simulation and multiverse ideas are just as ridiculous as the Big Bang creation myth and not worth any serious consideration. Anything that doesn't build from Plasma Cosmology is a waste of time.

       If the cosmic rays are mostly moving
       <strong>
        towards from the sun
       </strong>
       I think it's too soon to tell if this is what Voyager is seeing. If that is not the preferred direction, it could be a confirmation. I think rays moving mostly towards the sun would be expected at this point since rays moving away from the sun would have to have crossed through or solar system to get to Voyager.

       I came to a similar conclusion from a completely different angle. Working as a software engineer and seeing how code is designed, the fact we haven't already blown ourselves up a thousand times over is evidence of a higher power at work. My brother has done a lot of defense contract work, so I know they have similar messes to corporate America. Interacting with a lot of super religious folks, and seeing how they block out reality to retain their beliefs has convinced me that that higher power is not god. More like an exception handler.
