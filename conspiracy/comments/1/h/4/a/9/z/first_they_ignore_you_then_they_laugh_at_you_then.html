    <div class="md"><p>Self-defence by Violence</p>

<p>I have been repeating over and over again that he who cannot protect himself or his nearest and dearest or their honour by nonviolently facing death may and ought to do so by violently dealing with the oppressor. He who can do neither of the two is a burden. He has no business to be the head of a family. He must either hide himself, or must rest content to live for ever in helplessness and be prepared to crawl like a worm at the bidding of a bully. (YI, 11-10-1928, p342)</p>

<p>The strength to kill is not essential for self-defence; one ought to have the strength to die. When a man is fully ready to die, he will not even desire to offer violence. Indeed, I may put it down as a self-evident proposition that the desire to kill is in inverse proportion to the desire to die. And history is replete with instances of men who, by dying with courage and compassion on their lips, converted the hearts of their violent opponents. (YI, 21-1-1930, p27)</p>

<p>Nonviolence cannot be taught to a person who fears to die and has no power of resistance. A helpless mouse is not non-violent because he is always eaten by pussy. He would gladly eat the murderess if he could, but he ever tries to flee from her. We do not call him a coward, because he is made by nature to behave no better than he does.</p>

<p>But a man who, when faced by danger, behaves like a mouse, is rightly called a coward. He harbours violence and hatred in his heart and would kill his enemy if he could without hurting himself. He is a stranger to nonviolence. All sermonizing on it will be lost on him. Bravery is foreign to his nature. Before he can understand nonviolence, he has to be taught to stand his ground and even suffer death, in the attempt to defend himself against the aggressor who bids fair to overwhelm him. To do otherwise would be to confirm his cowardice and take him further away from nonviolence.</p>

<p>Whilst I may not actually help anyone to retaliate, I must not let a coward seek shelter behind nonviolence so-called. Not knowing the stuff of which nonviolence is made, many have honestly believed that running away from danger every time was a virtue compared to offering resistance, especially when it was fraught with danger to one&#39;s life. As a teacher of nonviolence I must, so far as it is possible for me, guard against such an unmanly belief. (H, 20-7-1935, pp180-1)
Self-defence....is the only honourable course where there is unreadiness for self-immolation. (ibid, p181)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I should have consulted you first as you seem to know exactly how a revolution should start. How many revolutions have you been a part of?  And why does the word fight have to mean instigating violence. I mean fight as a people, not with weapons and violence. Your last sentence shows the cowardice in your stance on revolution. If you want one, you must want make it happen, and be willing to to start the fight for it. I want you to stay at home when the revolution starts.</p>

<p>Btw you apologizing shows that you&#39;re not a dick you&#39;re just passionate about what you believe in and I appreciate that. Tbh that passion shows that you can make whatever you want happen, and you&#39;d be surprised at the support you&#39;d receive  </p>
