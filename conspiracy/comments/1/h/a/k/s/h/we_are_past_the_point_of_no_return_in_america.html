        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, this is going to be a word wall and cover a bit of things, but whatever, it needs to be said.</p>

<p>My issue is that I keep seeing things like &quot;2nd Amendment&quot; rights being brought up as a way to keep our ability to fight back.  In addition, people crying for revolution and for the &#39;sleepers&#39; to wake up and take on the fight.  &#39;Stop watching TV and do something&#39; etc.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem... we are way past the point of no return.  There is no fight, we&#39;re losing and we&#39;re losing real bad.  There is zero chance of the collective (non-military) 2nd amendment freedom fighters taking this country back.  There is zero chance of protesters making radical and meaningful change to our woefully corrupt government.  It isn&#39;t going to happen.</p>

<p>Every &#39;win&#39; we get will be overshadowed by piles of corruption to make things worse behind the scenes.  We are trying to stay on it, trying to mobilize and stop them, but it isn&#39;t possible.  We are trying to stop a tank with a stick and it isn&#39;t going to work.</p>

<p>We would have had to rise against the government well before WWI to have had some kind of chance of doing what people want to do now.  For every bit of NSA leak we know about there are thousands others that we don&#39;t know about that are stacked against us.</p>

<p>So, what?  You might ask, what should we do, just bend over and take it?  Well, no.  But talking about brandishing your handgun and taking down the government if they come after your privacy isn&#39;t going to do shit.  Instead, we need to be smart about it, we need to use what they are using to fight back.  Fight fire with fire.</p>

<p>Now, it is easy to bitch and complain, but harder to have a plan to fix it.  I don&#39;t know if this is a fool proof solution, but it is at least a thought.  Why not make a corporation where the stakeholders are citizens, like us, that want to change the way things work.  We could funnel our money in, utilize tax shelters and loopholes to manipulate the system.  Once the corporation is large enough, we work as one unit.  The corporation does the purchasing for its stakeholders (us) and we do it only from other corporations/businesses that aren&#39;t the enemy.  Our purchasing power will be gigantic and will effectively dictate which businesses make money and which don&#39;t.</p>

<p>We, the stake holders would provide services to its members at ridiculously reduced rates, thus giving us more power.  For example, some of us may be lawyers, so when banks come after a stakeholder with some garbage robo-signing issue, we have a team of lawyers ready to fight back and defend them.  This levels the playing field.</p>

<p>We can then use the &#39;corporations are people&#39; clause of evil to our advantage and manipulate the system into our favor, just like everyone else did, except for good and freedom.  </p>

<p>This leaves two possible scenarios, that I can see.  Either our government is forced to rewrite and fix the corporation loopholes, which would, effectively shutdown at least a good portion of the corruption.  Or, we succeed and effectively shutdown at least a good portion of the corruption.</p>

<p>There&#39;s my outside of the box thought on how to fix this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there is a risk, indeed.  That is why we would need people of all backgrounds.  That way, when the attacks come, we could fight back, legally of course.  The Koch brothers et al didn&#39;t build their corporate empire overnight and managed to create something, even with all the resistance they get.  I think its doable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the history of corrupt systems.  They eventually crash and burn on their own.  There is no fixing a complex machine while it&#39;s running.  </p>

<p>After the crash, the banks come in, buy all the assets cheap, and install a new ruling class.  </p>

<p>Given the size of the US, we may end up in a dystopic surveillance state with a conscription based military for a while.  </p>

<p>The collapse of the US will probably be deliberate to merge it into the globalized economy of exploitation.  </p>

<p>To have true globalization, richer countries will be forced to lower their standards of living while poorer countries increase theirs.  This happens when the world is steered towards a global common living standard. (lowest common denominator)</p>

<p>Who will be at the helm?  Probably groups like the Bilderbergs, CFR, WTO, Trilateral Commission, World Bank and IMF.   Look at things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership which is supposedly worse than NAFTA.  </p>

<p>The corporate loopholes that you&#39;re speaking of along with deregulation were due to lobbyists.  They&#39;ll pay off politicians or slander those who won&#39;t play ball. </p>

<p>Libertarians think that making the government even more ineffective against corporations will cause big business to lose power and self regulate.  This way of thinking is actually propagated by the ultra rich who are tricking the naive middle class into accepting it.  When things like the EPA are gone (a libertarian wet dream), who will stand up to lawless and ultra powerful big businesses?  Do they think Monsanto will give up Blackwater or make health their top priority?  Why would polluters pollute less if there were no monetary consequences?  Why wouldn&#39;t there be price fixing across all industries?  The use of force by government (a primary libertarian talking point) will simply change hands to corporations by way of private, lawless armies.  </p>

<p>There needs to be severe penalties for corruption or the misanthopic sociopaths who run the world will always get their way.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree fully.  Problem is, there is no way to get these penalties in place now.  It is impossible.  Even if we did, the top dogs would just pay to sidestep any legal ramifications anyway.</p>

<p>That is why I say we have to play their game.  It is the only way to win.  Imagine a gladiator.  You can&#39;t go against their rules and win, you will simply be killed and that will be it.  No, you need to play and win at their game, keeping your main focus always in your mind.  Then, when you are big enough, you play your hands and change the game from the inside and the top.</p>

<p>As for libertarians....yeah, I agree.  These &#39;regulations&#39; only got in place because businesses didn&#39;t self regulate and people got sick or died, so we had to fight, tooth and nail, to get some regulations in place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but they already have the advantage anyway.  Playing their game gives us an advantage too.  We can use their loopholes and plays against them.  They either let us play ball or are forced to close those loopholes.  Its a win win either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll admit, my concept is idealistic, but I see it as the only available route: play their game.  In baseball, a team won&#39;t abolish a home run if the other team scores, they only get mad once they actually lose.  That is my thought anyway.</p>

<p>As for the mountain hideout... I would have agreed with you ten years ago...but now they have drones....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This idea has already been tried.  The &quot;big corporation that represents average consumers and only invests in good ideas&quot; was called the &quot;Federal Reserve&quot;.  It, along with the network of similarly-well-intentioned charitable trusts set up by bankers and industrialists, and managed by &quot;progressive&quot; lawyers and economists, is primarily responsible for the mess we are currently in, by having subsidized entire generations of short-sighted, irresponsible jackasses with cheap loans and self-destructive hand-outs.  And all the while, none dared call it &quot;conspiracy,&quot; not even a &quot;fatal conceit.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our purchasing power will be gigantic and will effectively dictate which businesses make money and which don&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure Ben Bernanke is reading this right now, waiting in breathless anticipation of you telling us all what comes next, after this.  So what is it?  What&#39;s the magical, silver bullet that makes centralized economic planning effective and moral?  &quot;Don&#39;t be evil?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I get your point.  You are right.  And, honestly this idea sent perfect, it WILL fall to corruption, eventually.  But that will always occur, the cycle will always continue as long as the human race is in power.  The solution has to be short sighted as there is no &quot;perfect long term fix&quot;, it doesn&#39;t exist.  The founding fathers had the Revolution and tried to make a fix... It worked for awhile, but, as things do, it fell to corruption.  </p>

<p>The corporation is our current age musket.  It is our weapon against the corruption.  But, it will eventually fall to corruption over time, because that is what happens.  When it does, the people of that generation will have to devise an idea that meets the needs of the times.</p>

<p>My main point is that we are not going to win this war by force or freedom fighters, that time is past.  The only viable solution, I see, is a citizen run corporation that rests on the true meaning of democracy and freedom, while utilizing the advantages of the enemy to overcome them.  In the small grace of a golden time we replace the politicians and rules with what we believe a democracy should be.  Just like the big evil corps do now, but with actual people that believe in freedom and democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, to that end you are correct.  But that is how it works.  A majority of people are getting screwed, that majority rises up and does something to stop it.  Repeat step 1.  That is the cycle of humanity.  In our rise up, we will be screwing someone else over, it is inevitable.  But, as in most cases in Nature, the good of the majority is the most important aspect for the survival of the species.</p>
