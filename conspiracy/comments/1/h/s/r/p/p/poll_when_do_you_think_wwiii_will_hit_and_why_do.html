       Yes it most certainly was. But that wasn't the question the OP asked. I assume that the OP meant Global Thermonuclear War. Your thoughts on that ?

       Technically you are correct, but given the context of the question I disagree. The question is "When do you think WWIII will hit, an why do you think so". I, as you might have surmised, interpreted that to mean a world wide one-off apocalyptic event, which in that context can only be Thermonuclear War. It is the word "hit" that defines the context.

       That's a pretty big stretch.  There's no reason to expect a global thermonuclear war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever.
      </p>

       There's only ever been one country with bad enough manners to actually use an atomic bomb.  Sadly and embarrassingly, it was my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're involved in WWIII right now.  And it did "hit" with a shock and awe campaign -- and I expect it to continue for many years.

       Then why is the question asking for a future tense event, as in "
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       hit ? Implying that the event is yet to come. You are saying the event has already happened, which would make the OP's question moot. I don't disagree that we are in a world war like time. But all the war events seem to be centered around the middle east, which is not the whole world.

       Global Thermonuclear War is so poisonous to Corporate aspirations, I don't think you'll see a true intercontinental exchange. Dirty nukes, sure, and possibly have already been deployed, but a hot war with ICBM's? Too detrimental to the already fragile profit stream, and would destroy entire crops of slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you will see is a steady increase in Corporate funded terrorists and mercenaries to fight one another. The better to destabilize actual resistance and dispose of leaders who are perpendicular to the agenda.  This is playing out right now in the news, and is backed up by the few economic hitmen clever enough to get out of their positions and survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer: World War Three is already underway, and has been for some time. You do yourself and the world a disservice by waiting for a ring of fire to kick off the battle that's already waging all around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       World War Three is a battle for the mind of humanity.

       I admire your optimism. Are you suggesting that your description of events will withstand the implosion of the Banking system, and by extension the economy ? Does your description also make allowances for countries that have the means and will (Nuclear War notwithstanding) to disobey and resist American Hegemony ? What I'm suggesting is that certain parties are going to tell the US to shove it and have the means to do so. Russia and China come to mind. Just curious on you factor that into things.

       Good points. I think Russia and China are shrewd enough to wait until America is in the midsts of implosion (at the stage where its publicly undeniable, as opposed to the 'everything is still great' stage we are in now) to tell America to shove it. At that point America will have very little in the way of response because it will be too busy trying to contain the food riots at home.

       WWIII may happen in 2015. We are already making up shit to go into Syria and we have the Allies backing on it. All they need is to get Iran on their side and all other surrounding countries will end up joining in at some other point in time. I feel all of this will come to realization in 2015

       With the first official meet of the International Elite (Bilderberg), they effectively and quietly declared war on the people of the world by making out plans for the New World Order.

       The Cold War was a hot war that was WW3. After the USSR fell in 1991, they have tried to incorporate Eastern Europe into NATO. They have also tried to weaken Israel's enemies and destabilize the ME to gain better control of the oil. There might be a war over control of the ME oil or natural gas, but I doubt it would be WW4. Most likely will be a war against China to try to keep it as weak as it is now or make it weaker, but it would not be much of a war unless Russia gets involved.

       The events taking place are all leading up to it, I would say we have another two years at most. The Middle East and northern Africa are in turmoil, Europe is a huge mess, and more and more people are disliking the US. Once war is declared on us, our puppet countries in the EU will have to join us at our sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia and China will be the next Germany/Japan, not in the context of the atrocities they will commit, but rather the two countries to lead the other side of the war.

A lot of the intellectual elite located on the Atlantic and Pacific seaboard, with a high concentration of Jews in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. The illuminati hate Abrahamic Jews.

       The party that shots first in a Global Thermonuclear War has to know that there will nothing left to conquer. Nothing anywhere. It will be a "Global killer". So why would anyone be so crazy as to do this ? Out of stubborn spite. Who ever feels that the current agenda is not going to happen will be tempted to just say "fuck it" and the world ends 2 hours later.

       When ? I give it no later then 2016. This is because Obama's "reign" comes to an end. The current administration doesn't want to risk losing the power and glory they currently enjoy with the prospect of a new administration changing everything. Why mention Obama ? Because Israel currently has him as there trump card. Israel is the party that wants to have everything its way. That, of course, isn't about to happen any time soon. And I think they know that. Israel has the famous "Samson option" which basically says that if attacked with nukes they will respond ten fold...then all bets are off, permanently. However, Israel may not wait to
       <em>

       attacked.
