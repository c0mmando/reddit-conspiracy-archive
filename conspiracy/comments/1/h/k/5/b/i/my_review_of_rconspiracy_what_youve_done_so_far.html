<hr/>

<p>Right now is an interesting time as I am seeing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>informative critical posts on Obama </p></li>
<li><p>critical posts on NSA &amp; spying</p></li>
<li><p>critical posts of the US government</p></li>
<li><p>critical posts of other governments </p></li>
<li><p>on common popular subreddits</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Two years, or even a few months ago - this was uncommon for Reddit. For the most part, Snowden&#39;s leaks are to credit for this. </p>

<p>Please appreciate the seriousness of this statement; we really like this. Having the general population know about this and to be talking about this is a great thing. The potential for change and improvement are always going to be &#39;mass population&#39; focused. Meaning, we&#39;re going to be able to achieve the best things when the public are behind us. Petitions, pressure from the population toward the administration, pressure on technology companies, websites and a huge boom in anti tracking measures are all here and real now - due in part to the population knowing about the leaks. </p>

<p>However, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> knew about this - for a longer time. In fact, it was taken for granted that anything that could be tracked - was. Please join me in stressing that <strong>this is a tragic</strong> example of our community being isolated from the general public. The fact that we&#39;ve known to such a huge degree, for such a long time about the idea of NSA spying and the general public - not so. Is a big deal.</p>

<p>Also, I believe the progress we&#39;ve made as a subreddit has for the most part been single users going from here to other subreddits and posting infomative comments. Which unfortunately means all our progress and work is not done as a &#39;collective&#39; subreddit - but done by specific users - suers who take the time to post sources and provoke other subreddits. I really, really idolise those individuals and am thankful they exist, but let&#39;s not also forget our &#39;collective power&#39;. </p>

<p>So, why are we failing to interface with the general public. Well I&#39;m pretty sure you all generally know why and it&#39;s an interesting discussion - but not one I am going to focus on. This post is about reddit. So, why is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> failing to be taken seriously by other subreddits?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is not, an informative place to find out about conspiracies. (as rarely good sources are used)</p></li>
<li><p>It is <strong>not a new-user friendly place</strong>. If someone asks a obvious science question in &#39;askscience&#39; the community will jump at the chance to talk to someone who&#39;s interested in science and usually post a great response with sources and backup. Here, new users asking about obvious theories are usually given <em>very little</em> evidence and it&#39;s not always pleasantly presented to them. (try to think of an example you&#39;ve seen recently). </p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s no formal knowledge base. If I go to <a href="/r/Supplements">/r/Supplements</a> they have a kind of formal knowledge base in their &#39;FAQ&#39; and a website they use a lot &#39;examine.com&#39;. Here, they have different supplements with <strong>studies</strong> and a marvellous pedantic human matrix on how certain supplements effect people with scientific backup. Likewise, <a href="/r/BuildAPC">/r/BuildAPC</a> have a benchmark and evidence focus on reviews and tests on hardware that they discuss. <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> do not have this, a lot of the &#39;general&#39; knowledge is peoples opinions like &#39;yeah 9-11 was an inside job&#39; or &#39;this politician is corrupt&#39; etc. We don&#39;t have sources. (I will come back to this).</p></li>
<li><p>Bad comments. Some of the comments here are really bad, they are very discouraging for new people. </p></li>
<li><p>Defeated attitude. If someone posts a article saying that <em>&#39;cars are intentionally un economic so oil companies can milk us&#39;</em> for example. Comments would surface about how people always knew this, how it&#39;s already known, how the corporate elite are pinning us down and sometimes people may even go on the attack &quot;only idiots didn&#39;t already know this&quot;. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>For every point I&#39;ve made above I have a proposed solution that I think is realistic and - requires minimal mod intervention. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Knowledge base - we need somehow to have a facility to store information and evidence so that we can reference it in discussions inside and outside of this subreddit. I have tried to create this in <a href="/r/Vetting">/r/Vetting</a> - the idea was, that someone makes a thread about &#39;Oil Spill x&#39; - then people can comment with articles and sources for both sides of this. E.g. If a whistleblower who worked for an oil company has an interview and says it is being suppressed then that would be linked. Likewise, skeptics and vetters - if they found evidence it wasn&#39;t being suppressed - they could post their sources too. What we end up with, is a thread entirely about a potential conspiracy with sources for both sides of an argument. This could be used to reference when discussing that conspiracy in this sub reddit, or in worldnews for example. This is just my attempt and my idea, but other users are making new subreddits and have their own ideas (e.g. <a href="/r/yrugay">/r/yrugay</a>). I suggest we try to prioritise finding one that we like.</p></li>
<li><p>We focus comments on being either &#39;critical&#39;, &#39;complimentary&#39; and &#39;questioning&#39; to posts. So, if someone posts a article saying a x-employee says &#39;company a&#39; has been dumping waste into &#39;town x&#39; water supply and that town has had sick people. Comments could focus on complimenting that post by linking other articles or evidence - or they could be critical and linking to the whistleblower being a bad source for example. Also questioning comments like &#39;why does waste cause bad health?&#39; then people can answer with sources if they want. This makes our discussion a lot more informative and userfriendly. </p></li>
<li><p>If we tried the above two points, we&#39;d have a substancially less defeated attitude, a vastly more informative community and hugely better comments. But to put the icing on the cake, we should treat every new user or unknowing person with respect and empathy. It takes balls to sub to this subreddit and you all know <strong>VERY WELL</strong> how hard the journey is from &#39;unknowing&#39; to &#39;informed&#39; it is. Think of all the late nights you&#39;ve had watching documentaries, looking at papers, connecting dots, all the misinformation you&#39;ve been bombarded with, all of the skeptics you&#39;ve battled and all of the prejudice you&#39;ve faced from friends, family and strangers. <strong>Empathise</strong> with new users and uninformed people and give them the hand you didn&#39;t have when you were in their shoes. But be caution not to spoon feed, it is the journey we&#39;ve taken that makes us informed, not the conspiracies that we believe. Teaching others how to self inform is <strong>vital</strong> to our cause. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>On a lasting note, I want to say that I made this post here because despite the issues, this place has huge potential. Because at this moment, we have more potential than ever - and that of all of the critical subreddits I know of - this has one of the biggest sub-base. </p>

<p><strong>TL:DR</strong> Think of yourselves as &#39;servants&#39;. Unappreciated selfless slaves to a cause to inform the masses and improve humanity, bend over, get on your knees and beg for people to listen - because it will be worth it for and your generations to come. And you can reflect on your life and say &#39;I didn&#39;t rescue anyone from a burning house, I didn&#39;t take a bullet for a stranger.. but I tried my hardest to inform people and help make the world better - I am proud of myself&#39;. </p>

<p>Perhaps a wiki type site that can be but in the sidebar. How it works: break down categories: 911 (click on that) &#39;individual buildings&#39;, NORAD drill, Prior knowledge, al-quata, ect (click on one of those) breaks down further if applicable </p>

<p>Are there resources of some kind that will &quot;teach us&quot;? im sure during elections petition signers and such are trained on how to speak with people to &quot;convince&quot; them.</p>

<p>i read up on PUA stuff some years ago and it helped me understand the minds of women slightly more. if there is material that could be applied more generally and doesnt involve methods that attept to bed them, ti would be VERY important. With all these protests going on, America should join in aswell</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not have a good tutorial for you, but what I&#39;ve found to be the most successful is to know what im talking about and have atleast one source to provide them(i don&#39;t mean carry around a stack of newspapers to a dinner party, just off the top of your head usually works well). Acknowledging what they say and talking up to them in an agreeing tone while discussing something that may contradict what they are saying usually leaves them more open to consider what you are saying. Most importantly, let them ask questions and answer as honestly as you can. If you don&#39;t know the answer to a question tell them. I usually say something along the lines of &#39;to be honest, I don&#39;t really know but I can find out&#39;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if any of that is helpful, but a stereotype often attempted to be pushed on us is that we&#39;re disconnected and ignore the &#39;truth&#39;, information-deniers, or delusional. I found that acting in that manner introduces them to the idea that they may have been mistaken about those assumptions. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought about this before - maybe you can comment on my opinion. While manipulating people (even for the better) is controversial. I imagine the example of a Buddhist monk or any other &#39;wise-archetype&#39; with a young apprentice.</p>

<p>They manipulate the young apprentice by making them learn lessons, they shape the lessons for them to learn (much like karate kid) and let them play that lesson out and learn first hand. However - they are usually cautious not to impress any dogmas or forced opinions on them. They simply do their best to subtly teach that person. I think that&#39;s a responsible approach. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to manipulate people into what I believe, planting a seed of doubt on their stance is better than anything. Don&#39;t tell people they might be wrong on something, nobody likes to be told they are wrong. Leave them some information, ask them if they&#39;d like more and point them to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where they can find more information and ask more questions.</p>

<p>And also, don&#39;t refer to people as sheep. It&#39;s sounds derogatory and looks as if you have a mightier than thou complex where your information bests others and you have access to something other don&#39;t. Everyone here at one time swallowed the bullshit so you were in those shoes. Be nice to people and don&#39;t shove anything down their throat. That&#39;s the best way I&#39;ve found to show other people information they wouldn&#39;t consider before and obviously, with recent light on the NSA leaks and such, people will be more curious.</p>

<p>It sounds like a good idea. I don&#39;t know about allowing it to be open-editable like wikipedia is. But it might be worth having week/monthly threads which stack up sources for certain things and have requests for next weeks/months updates? Then after the thread is done the site admin or mod then updates the website with the threads sources. </p>

<p>There could also be a &#39;submit study/evidence&#39; button which allows people to submit stuff and someone can vet/review it before it hits the official page?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the post. The most important thing you mentioned is sources. Whenever I&#39;m debating on here I make sure either to give links with real sources or to provide them myself. I think what you should also realize is that there are hasbara shills that come here as well as trolls from places like <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. This adds to the shitty level of posting</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not like the idea of conspiratard vs conspiracy. I prefer to think of it as informed serious individuals vs ignorant individuals. Where there is ignorance in both subreddits and perhaps informed serious people in both subreddits.</p>

<p>In any case, the suggestions I&#39;ve made should help the the serious individuals from both. Where people for or against conspiracies can now to battle with links and sources .. Rather than memes and jokes which in an open free internet - they are free to do (so long as they keep it in the respective subreddits and within their sidebar rules of course) </p>

<p>So basically, instead of specifically tackling the &#39;shill issue&#39; - if you try to improve the subreddit then hopefully the &#39;shill issue&#39; will tackle itself. </p>

<p>It has its upsets, especially during and after big incidents, where intentional disinformation gets rampant, but that still doesn&#39;t have detrimental impacts on this subreddit. Why? Because there is no real cohesion to this place other than openmindedness. </p>

<p>Follow the very liberal rules, and upvote or downvote the posts you want. It&#39;s what makes this place the best subreddit there is. Everything else will sort itself out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t think of anything you are disagreeing with - looking at your reasons unless you completely misread the post.</p>

<p>Just to clarify. I am exploring the reasons why this subreddit isn&#39;t taking seriously by others, and possible solutions to those that. </p>

<p>Perhaps you can point out where in my post it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>attempt to label <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gave the impression this wasn&#39;t true:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This place has grown because of its very broad limitations, allowing almost everything and anything.
Most of the users here are people who are fed up with the lies and dilution of truth and truth seeking. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>clashes with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has its upsets, especially during and after big incidents, where intentional disinformation gets rampant, but that still doesn&#39;t have detrimental impacts on this subreddit. Why? Because there is no real cohesion to this place other than openmindedness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Follow the very liberal rules, and upvote or downvote the posts you want. It&#39;s what makes this place the best subreddit there is. Everything else will sort itself out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>aimed at me or people reading? </p>

<hr/>

<p>Please note the post was within the scope of exploring the &#39;potential&#39; to interface with others easier and get stuff done such as awareness spreading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though it can be flattering to read your main post for those who are regulars here, you have to understand that many of the good effects this subreddit has had, have been side effects from extreme vagueness, variety, and openness. </p>

<p>If you really have been frequenting this place for a long while, you would understand that many &quot;predictions&quot; and unveilings have been small pebbles of gold in a monumentally large quagmire. A place void of political agenda, unity, and leaders. You know what happens when a group has very clear goals like &quot;informative critical posts on Obama&quot;? They become an easy target and are manipulated down towards the edge of a cliff.</p>

<p>This place is a shithole for those who can&#39;t think for themselves and need others to tell them what to do, but it is a goldmine for those who have been through a few major paradigm shifts in their life, where they don&#39;t trust e.g. authority or other people in general. Lets keep it that way. No agenda other than absolute scepticism. If you want to overturn someone, and receive recognition for doing so, please don&#39;t make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a blatant and public catalyst for it.</p>

<p>If this subreddit disappears, there is no better alternative online. </p>

<p>Edit: words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to manipulate people into what I believe, planting a seed of doubt on their stance is better than anything. Don&#39;t tell people they might be wrong on something, nobody likes to be told they are wrong. Leave them some information, ask them if they&#39;d like more and point them to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where they can find more information and ask more questions.</p>

<p>And also, don&#39;t refer to people as sheep. It&#39;s sounds derogatory and looks as if you have a mightier than thou complex where your information bests others and you have access to something other don&#39;t. Everyone here at one time swallowed the bullshit so you were in those shoes. Be nice to people and don&#39;t shove anything down their throat. That&#39;s the best way I&#39;ve found to show other people information they wouldn&#39;t consider before and obviously, with recent light on the NSA leaks and such, people will be more curious.</p>
