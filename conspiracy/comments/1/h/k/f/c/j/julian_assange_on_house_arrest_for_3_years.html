       Well I mean what good is all that money if you can't buy yourself some power? I don't know that we could ever have a healthy society when you've got such a massive wealth gap. I'm not necessarily calling for socialism or communism but honestly, when you've got people who are doing their best to live off of $11,000 dollars a year and then you've also got people who have so much money that the entire concept has lost all value.

       In the television show "Star Trek: The Next Generation" money doesn't exist, at all. People in that universe are not tainted with the need for monetary gain. This is how society
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be. Money is not what life is about. Money is a means to enslave and control others, and by accounts is quite effective. Money should be a means to power. Power should be in the hands, always temporarily, of those who use it as it is meant to be used...for the benefit of society. Is this Idealistic ? Maybe. But more importantly it is a stinging commentary on our current society.

       Yeah, Star Trek is "post scarcity" but what I think is fantastic is that most of the world economy is being held up by artificial scarcity, we already have the ability to provide enough food for every single person living on earth. I know a lot of these ideas are coming from the Zeitgeist series but seriously, the world economy is not an economy at all, everything is based off of consumption and wasting resources. I feel like everyone has had to grow up in live in the system in which we exist and therefore doesn't really spend a whole lot of time thinking about how ludicrous the entire thing is. We have the resources and the technology to make the world a substantially happier place but we have a self-perpetuating system that prevents it.

       Everyone can have everything, there's no obstacles. But people recoil at even the thought of it because they have been trained to believe we have to fight each other for our little piece of the world. People don't understand that we already are at a point where we can provide everything everyone wants to anyone who wants it, money is just a tool to put one person above another. Rich people don't even buy things to use them, they are just symbols of power and their superior place in the hierarchy.

       Wealth-hoarding is a disorder, just like regular hoarding.  These people get off on having MORE than others, not just enough.  It's like micro-penis syndrome on a massive scale.  Power and control are as addictive as money and possessions.  This is part of the reason for corporate lobbying and the buying of political candidates.

       But that is just the point. We
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be insisting an a high moral stance. Way higher. The society as it exists today is fucked up beyond all description.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I compare the world I grew up in (early 1970s) and the world today, its as if those are two completely different planets. Yes, out technology is stunning and awesome, but the rest of the society is just as bad, or worse, then George Orwell's 1984.

       Agreed. Right now the need to make money outweighs the need to support the human condition so much that the human condition is suffering, which I find bizarre. Health care is so obsessed with profit that millions of people aren't receiving any care, how anyone can tell me that that is intentional and the best way it can work is beyond me, because yeah, it's making profit, but it's not covering millions of people! It completely fails at what it's supposed to be doing, namely provide health care for as many people as possible!
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many more examples, like how the FDA basically changed the food pyramid to suggest we should stuff ourselves with BREAD before we even bother with meats and veggies, which after doing some research, it's apparently the worst idea ever! Again, because profit was more important than people and now people are suffering, but hey, it's okay, right? As long as a select few are earning EXTRAORDINARY amounts of money that they do NOTHING with to improve the human condition than it's all good, right? RIGHT?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the Koch brothers alone could send EVERYONE in this country to college several times over whereas the average American can't even afford to send him or herself and NO ONE bats an eye about this imbalance? Charity really isn't even that expensive compared to the amount of money we piss away on defense and military, shit, even the bailouts for the banks were probably enough to end global starvation, but instead our society thought it more important to give money to businesses that deal in money and already have enough money.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how much it would cost to provide clean drinking water to the planet? I've heard around 2 billion dollars (don't quote me on that). I don't know if that's true, but that is SHOCKINGLY affordable! Insultingly so, because instead of doing that, we expect to make a profit off of warfare. So yeah, I totally agree that we must insist on a higher moral stance.

       All I'm saying really is that things have an intended purpose. Our republic was supposed to enable good living conditions for as many people as possible as opposed to the feudal system which largely existed before hand, but what we're seeing right now is more and more wealth being consolidated in the hands of the few. Add never ending debt, poor working conditions and some bizarre individual and wealth worship mentality and you'll notice that not much changed since the middle ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our republic isn't doing what it was intended to do, what we have right now is closer to feudalism.

       Agreed. History does seem to be repeating itself, sadly, only with a slight twist. Now we have weapons capable of destroying our entire civilization that didn't exist before. Where does it end ? Or
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       it end ?

       Well, I hope it doesn't end, or we'll end up with what I like to call the "Bond villain fallacy!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically the rich and powerful are destroying the planet... that they
       <em>
        live
       </em>
       on!
      </p>
      <p>
       I call it the bond villain fallacy because it's like they didn't think it through:
      </p>
      <p>
       "MUAHAHAHA, soon I'll destroy the world and then I'll RULE IT! HAHAHAH!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "The world!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yes, the world! What's your problem!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "You're going to destroy the world!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yeah!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "The one you're living on, standing on right now!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Y...yeah... wait... what are you getting at!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well, first of all, YOU LIVE HERE and second of all if you destroy it what are you going to rule over?"
      </p>
      <p>
       See, that's the problem, the rich want to feel indispensable, but if they went "Galt", no one would give a shit, someone would just fill in the power-void and besides, where would they go Galt to? They need a society for their wealth to be meaningful. They'd like to think that their wealth is self-earned and that they live in vacuum where all education, social structure and infrastructure has been created by them for themselves, but really, individual worship is dumb, because it's ALWAYS a collective of shared and previous experiences and knowledge that drives mankind. It wasn't Henry Ford that built cars, it was the entire Ford factory, but who do we worship? Henry!
      </p>
      <p>
       So really, the 1% would do well to realize this and to support the rest of us a little more than barely at all. After all, we all know what happens when you disenfranchise millions of people, it has happened before and it will happen again unless people remember their history and try not to repeat it. I personally am going to wash my hands of the whole matter, people absolutely know better so there is no excuse and I don't want any violence, but it's not up to me anymore, now is it. If the Koch brothers keep pissing off the angry mob and they end up getting lynched all I can say is: Told you so!

       I completely agree with you, however this will never happen. In order for this to come to fruition, we must, as a whole, both the citizenry and the corporations (or at least a portion of them) come together and force this change. The sad thing is, this is ultimately a One world Government, of a sorts. So you will have a decent sized portion of the global citizenry upset and indignant about a unified planet, needing to have a multi-nation approach to global government, with one country (theirs) with the biggest stick, another group will be about corporations e spewing about profits/loss, and how that would be detrimental to society as a whole, and other groups just wanting to watch it all burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need as a catalyst is to have free
       <em>
        insert basic need here
       </em>
       . And by basic i mean either food, water, energy, shelter, or healthcare. One of those 5, but 2 would be better, if they were free to the entire population. That would enable people to free themselves from the shackles that they don't know exist. This would, i believe, allow us to create a meritocracy. How it is to be done, I have not the slightest. But someone must be willing to step to the plate and make that stand to give something away for all. And the ones that are willing, are not in a position to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of you are talking about how great the Star Trek Universe would be, but honestly, give the the Mass Effect version with the Turians. They have it right. Only the best get promoted, forcing everyone to do their best, everything done is for the collective and individual. Its both selfish and selfless. its equal with out being conformist.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, no one will really see that, they will see conformity and unity and perceive it to be communism, to be intrusive and oppressive. They want to be different, which ultimately is a great thing, as diversity breeds strength. But to some, or a lot maybe, equality breeds stagnation.

       It's either that or forceful education. Both are not very desirable. I do think we just need a mentality shift, most people are aware of the world's problems, but not the solutions, they're kind of stuck in the world they grew up in, which is largely artificial actually. Education is the solution, getting everyone up to a decent level of knowledge will trigger a mentality shift, which is why a higher intelligence quotient is associated with more liberal beliefs (and other studies, it's bizarre really!). But that is definitely easier said than done.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, I don't get the mine is mine mentality. That's just stupid really, it never has been everybody for themselves, otherwise Henry Ford would be the only guy driving a car ever, this is how mankind works, someone does the work, the rest of us benefit. Sorry, if that seems unfair, but not all of us are super-geniuses, or even physically fit to do everything, it's naive to think everyone can pull their own weight, mankind's strength has always been in our collective power, never in the individuals. Cooperation is what really creates marvels, not competition, although that can be healthy, too, but we've been focusing on that too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       And besides, one person can't do everything or know everything. One person's weakness is another person's strength, that's how cooperation works. Collectively we can become one powerful organization, individually we're stranded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I did have a little to add! But really, we're preaching to the choir here :D

       Although 16 year old me would be upset at the idea of forced education, in a way so does 36 year old me. It can be a scary and very slippery road, the concept of forced education. But as long as its science, math and literature based, and less on philosophy and other humanities, I think the idea would work wonders. If the average human of tomorrow knew as much as the smartest human of today, I think we would live in a much simpler and benevolent society.

       This is my attitude to it all. I very much doubt we'll see a society based on these principles within my lifetime, but it's good to see that a lot of people
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       we have the potential to achieve it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If i knew this was the best we could do - you know what - i'd be fine with it. It's not. We can do
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       fucking better than this, we just need to show other people there is a different way of doing things. Unfortunately a lot of these ideas get met with immediate shouting about communism and the "free market" (another complete joke).

       Very little. If you acquire everything you needed and most of what you wanted then you would be self sufficient. You could then put your energies into real education and ways you better your self as a member of the human race, rather than having to slave just to eat.

       Yes, there will always be members of a society who will be seen as superior. Some by crime and some by merit. But it wouldn't be nearly to the disparate degree that we witness today.

       Who cares, besides you, I mean. I am criticizing our society. I am using a popular television show for
       <em>
        contrast
       </em>
       . The details of the show itself don't matter. The message as it regards our societies gross misuse of money is what matters. If you got your nickers in a twist about a sticky little detail regarding Star Trek, then have your meaning less victory if it makes you happy, ok ?

       Yeah, WHY is HSBC still a thing? If I had any power, I'd dissolve that company on the spot. You don't launder money for drug cartels and continue doing business, they've clearly violated everyone's trust, they either go to extensive troubles to regain that trust, or seize to exist.

       Not to mention racketeering laws make it so if you work with criminal conspiracies, you are liable for their actions. So if theyve laundered trillions for the cartels, that means we could charge them with idk 40,000 murders?

       Damn, yeah, seems fair. Again, if the punishment is too extreme, why were you laundering money in the first place? It's easy: don't break the law, don't get punished! Everyone else lives by those rules, why not the corporations? They should consider themselves lucky we can't actually treat them like people, because we can only dissolve a corporation, we can't kill it!

       Well I mean its not the bankers who should go to jail, I mean your average CEO is trying to make money in any way possible. They are not responsible, its the government who is, with the federal reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean having some low level CEO go to jail or even say one bank brought down won't change anything, its the system that is fraudulent. Fractional reserve banking, private central bank, controlled interest rates, big government, regulations, high taxes, picking winners and losers, etc... these are the core problems, not bank CEO's.

       I do not agree with that model. Kaynes style economics got us here in the first place, insisting that stupid bank corporations need to be saved because of reasons instead of trimming the fat that needs to be trimmed. Yes, the government isn't helping, but if we actually made them realize they have real consequences to attain for rather than a wag of the finger followed by buckets of cash to save a bank that fucked us over in the first place. These bankers hold the world's money, which in the current world economy means everything. If the people that hold our financial stability in check aren't regulated and kept in check by us, then they'll pull another magnificent market crash after filling their pockets. Companies that produce creative and competitive products don't need that regulation because they are each other's regulation; the minute a better alternative shows up and the word is spread, people flock to that alternative. Banks hold our livelihood. You don't fucking toy with people's lives.

       Yeah but the regulations are written by the major banks and businesses to prevent competition. So all regulations do is make it more difficult for small banks to compete and for new ones to open, same with any sort of business and that means less competition, less jobs, more corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to reduce the power that government has which has put in place this system of fraud and to convince people that small, limited government with lots of checks and balances leads to more wealth and prosperity.

       I disagree, mainly because there is no accountability left. If everyone in a company was running the risk of being punished for one asshole breaking the law, maybe ALL of them will take better care not to fuck the rest of us. It may seem unfair, but at this point I think a zero tolerance policy is the only thing that can scare the banks enough into behaving.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh, what's that HSBC? You laundered money for the cartels? Well, you're dissolved now and all your assets are going to charities!"

       "But, that wasn't me, it was the OTHER CEO!"

      <p>
       "Don't care! If a corporation is considered a person than all employees are part of that person and that person made a poor choice and must now face the consequences! Bummer, I know, but on the other hand, you didn't have to go and fuck the rest of us now, did you?"
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no excuse when the right thing to do is apathy. If not breaking the law is actually easier than breaking the law, there is no excuse.

       But if you were to pursue justice in regards to individual executives who commit crimes as part of their job, you would send a signal to everyone in that position that wealth and power do not exempt you from the law. This in itself would have an effect in making these people think twice about shameless lawbreaking, even without structural change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, I suppose, that without structural change the government will never get serious about prosecuting these people. In other words, they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       beyond the reach of law because they have too much influence with government.

       You limit it, that's how you do it. Maybe a maximum wage isn't that bad an idea. Or a higher tax rate for the rich. Money is quantified power after all.

       Um, instituting a maximum wage puts GIGANTIC power in the hands of whoever sets the wage.  Same with taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is severe mental dissonance-- you say limit power... but raising taxes/setting a maximum wage requires bureaucrats and stormtroopers.  You want to limit power by giving a small group of people the power to invent "crimes" and do all the prosecutions involved therein?

       Well that's basically what the government should already be doing. The checks and balances aren't working currently. We need a non-profit thing that is independent that ensures trades take place fairly. That used to be the government until it became the unofficial extended enforcement branch of corporate America. The maximum wage comment was kind of facetious, but I do think that the wealth gap has reached ridiculous levels, like to the point where employees can barely participate in the economy AT ALL whereas employers could quite literally BUY entire nations. So they're still asking us to pay for our own education and health care, but with what? Without wealth redistribution nothing will move again. I'd like to think that the "job-creators" would do something, but they're not. Most of them are not investing in infrastructure, welfare, employment or anything really, so sadly, we need someone to step in, take that wealth and use it for MOST people instead of just a few. Yeah, that requires a ridiculous amount of power, but you gotta be able to separate power created through money, which is just supposed to be a representation of value for actual products instead of a product itself (which is kind of has become). It may seem unfair, but when most people on the planet are starving because some asshole is hoarding wealth, then, yeah, we're going to re-appropriate that. Personal freedom ends where someone else's begins, tough titty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it's a matter of holding things to their intended purpose. Our society is supposed to provide for as many people as possible, but currently it's only enriching an increasingly smaller portion of the population. That's feudalism. Time to go back to a republic and have an enforcement agency that has good checks and balances and does what it's supposed to do, namely serve the public, not the corporations. Don't bring me any libertarian crap, you're basically advocating anarchy then which isn't a thing, but the lack thereof and then you might as well just accept feudalism, because without a constitution and checks and balances, the most powerful entity will seize power, which will most likely be corporate or fascist. Power can also be split, you know, but your argument leaves no room for that.

       small group of people who have at their discretion the ability to invent crimes and cage people for them.

       If that's your thing, then we just have a difference of opinion.  I responded earlier to your call for limiting power by making a small group with 50x the power.

       I heard a crazy thing about Madolf's kids who turned him in. They didn't do that out of the goodness in their hearts, they did it because Madolf realized he was going to get caught and his kids would have been implicated if they didn't turn him in.

       Also, keep in mind Madolf is in the most minimum security prison there is and his wife still has most of the money he stole.

       It may not be Leavenworth but it is still federal prison that he will be incarcerated in for the rest of his life. FCI Butner isnt a day camp. More importantly, there have been at least three reports of separate attacks, with some pretty serious injuries, against him since he first arrived.
