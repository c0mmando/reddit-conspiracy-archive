Although tasing the dog would have caused less harm he had no time to switch between gun and taser. As the video clearly shows the dog is being aggressive towards the officer, almost biting him. But ask yourself, if you were the officer, would you have let the dog bite you? I think not.</p>

<p>I dont condone the arrest of unarmed civilians taping law inforcement at all and this whole fiasco could have been avoided by letting the man record like the 15 other people on the side of the street.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those people saying the Cop did nothing wrong, what if This was you, and your Pet? The dude was playing Music, and Recording Public Activity, nothing thats against the law.</p>

<p>He shouldn&#39;t have been detained in the first place.  They even said he was resisting when they first started cuffing him which he wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The cop who shot the dog, came over with his gun drawn.  He was already going to shoot the dog, why else would you have your gun drawn?</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t reach for the leash, he went for the dogs collar.  the owner was already trying to calm down his dog, and had already  said &quot;Max, No!.&quot; the dog then backed up, because he listened.</p>

<p>This only happened because of the police.  Arresting someone for doing nothing illegal at all.</p>

<p>The PD then has the balls to lie in their Press Release, despite there being a video of the whole thing.</p>

<p>I hope the owner puts the cop on the street.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Harassing? He&#39;s recording public activity, just like the person who shot the entire video was doing.</p>

<p>The owner had it under control, until the 3rd cop came over.  He reached for the Dogs Collar, hence why the dog lunged.  The dog felt thretenned because not only was his owner being detained, but one of the men detaining his owner was trying to grab him.</p>

<p>The police are at fault for un-lawfully detaining a man, that&#39;s recording public activity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding of the situation as followed.
-Police show up to a scene and negotiations are taking place to deescalate an armed robbery scene or some high tension situation.
-Man shows up with blaring music.
-Cops ask him to turn it down
- From the video and the sound it sounds like he may of turned it down a little bit but not much.
-He starts pacing in the video(as an officer this sends of alarms)
-Then he starts yelling at the officers asking racially charged statements such as &quot;why arnt there no black cops&quot;.
-Man puts dog away no doubt knowing his dog could possibly harm someone or be violent.(officer red flag)
-Cops DETAIN him. There is a difference between detain and arrest. 
-Dog jumps out of window. Mind you this dog the owner put away in the car while noticing officers approaching him. 
-Officer draws weapon 
- Officer tries to gain control of animal with a few failed attempts.
-Dog lunges and officer fires a few rounds into the animal with caution and firearm control.
Now from the video and the limited amount of time of the situation being filmed i can see how many people can come to the conclusion that this is an infringement of rights but like others have said there was quite a few people recording the event. 
The officer was ensuring officer safety. The officer has every right to use lethal force when it comes to animals. From the previous red flags displayed by the man in question who was DETAINED and his actions with the dog the officer felt it was necessary to draw his firearm. 
Also i wanted to point out with the situation going on and the officers trying to do their job what about the possible victims of that situation this man was taking away from?
From the short video and watching this i personally find the officers actions justified.
Now saying this there are ALOT of injustices done by the current police forces and thos are not to be excused. I do believe in filming the police for this reason. Video analysis.
 I do not condone animal cruelty and i wish this played out differently.
I just find everyone freaking out on this video a tad weird honestly. If you think this is violent than clearly you have not seen some of the more important videos that encompass a conspiracy factists stance on many issues that we converse and read about on this subreddit ie. Baghdad airstrike video</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What right do they have to arrest him at all? He was behind the barricade. There was no music playing.  Theres people all the time that get arrested for video taping police.  It&#39;s completely legal, but the police think they are above the law.</p>

<p>Again, they have no legitimate claims to arrest him at all.  I guarantee if he was to Sue, and this went to court the PD would be found guilty of unlawful detainment, among other things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, the Dude was behind the Barricade, recording. They had no right to even Approach him in the first place.</p>

<p>Again, the 3rd Cop came around with his weapon already drawn.</p>

<p>Again, that same cop went for the Dogs Collar, and only tried to get &quot;Control&quot; of Max Twice.  The dog was trained, and listened to his owner.  When he said &quot;Max No!&quot; the dog stepped back, and only stepped forward when the 3rd officer came in.</p>

<p>I guarantee if that 3rd officer didn&#39;t come in, or didn&#39;t have such a happy trigger Finger, nothing would have happened.</p>

<p>I even showed the Video to my Neighbor, whos been a cop for 15 years.  Even he says the Police had no right detain the man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are we more upset about the dog or the detainment of person? As far as I can tell the dog was the product of the detainment and the detainment was because person was interfering with an ongoing call. An armed robber for that matter? What if he was assailants friend and was trying to amp up the person who was robbing in the original call? There are so many factors that go into a call especially when dealing with public. The dude should of kept dog in car, kept his mouth shut, stayed calm and , video recorded the ongoing incident as an onlooker. Not become a participant. I think a good basic rule is to observe and document injustices but keep you damn mouth shut. Whether you like it or agree with it a cop has certain powers to detain and make decisions based upon the situation that he will have to be held accountable for upon review. Like I said, I&#39;ll be first one to place it on the cops IF the cops are solely to blame. Moral of story, if it doesn&#39;t involve you keep your damn mouth shut, observe and report. Once you get involved the game changes. There is a line of not taking shit from the police and being cooperative. Keep recording everyone and keep holding cops and others involved accountable but in the end this dude got his dog shot in my opinion. </p>

<p>You have no grounds to say that the Man and/or his dog are at fault, because these Police had no reason to detain the man in the first place.  The cops went to him.  The man was behind the barricade, he was doing nothing wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So standing behind the baracade and yelling statements to the cop isn&#39;t interfering? Guess I&#39;m delusional. Just looking at it objectively without taking sides and if they did detain him solely on the grounds of video recording why weren&#39;t other detained? There&#39;s more to this than the conclusion you and even I want to jump to. I just can&#39;t based upon this video to completely put the blame on the cops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. While this is sad, it shows just how little regard for human life some people on here have. People are killed daily and no one says anything but once a dog dies, everyone freaks out.</p>

<p>Going along with your last statement, I really don&#39;t think they arrested him for just recording because there were others there who were obviously recording. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hawthorne Police Lt Scott Swain said that officers were warning Rosby to turn down the music in his car.
&#39;It&#39;s distracting the officers. It&#39;s interfering with what they are able to hear,&#39; Lt Swain said. &#39;It&#39;s not just a party call. It&#39;s an armed robbery call. The officers need to hear what&#39;s going on with the people being called out of the residence. That music in his car is bleeding over and it&#39;s distracting them.&#39;&quot;</p>
