       Kennedy was in fact the last (maybe) real elected president, and moving that power away from the people led to the American Democratic process to be stalled? something like this?

       First of all I wasn't talking about evolution in the Darwinian sense (which I think is crazy anyway)-- I said social evolution, something intrinsically regulated by human whims and foibles and not some objective physical principle, and is therefore subject to waxing and waning.  One example of what I mean is that Kennedy wanted to end the Cold war, and had he done so this would have been an advancement in social evolution.  With Kennedy killed the cold war kept on for another 25 years, and concomitantly our social evolution was held back by at least the same number of years through this alone.

       There's only only one type of evolution and that is the natural and only one, everything always changes forever, nothing ever remains the same given enough time. Social evolution was maybe guided by human whim, but it continued to progress it wasn't stalled. But, that is just a wording to what you are trying to convey, you are saying that Kennedy wanted to end the cold war and that was good for social evolution, well, I don't know about that, IMO communism is a fucking horrible thing, so I don't see how ending the attempt to stop the spread of communism as a good thing. Unless ofcourse that Kennedy would've succeeded in stoping the spread of communism via a diplomatic way or something. But saying that this was good or that was bad is too absolute, how can you say that "stalling" or "guiding" the social evolution of America was a bad thing? we don't really know, what if in the long run it was actually very beneficial because out of all the technologies developed via DARPA the internet came out. That is a good thing in a way. But again for every good thing created, there is a en equally bad thing created, you should understand this if you say that you don't believe in Darwinistic Evolution, meaning that you believe in creationism, which in turn takes you to believe the that hand of God (gods) played a role in the guiding of the social evolution of America regardless of the advancement or ending of the cold war, and surely, God (gods) can't be wrong.

       I know plenty about the crusades. 
That wasn't what caused the Dark Ages, besides, those didn't happen in the places where the population was, this being, Spain, AEgypt, Greece, and the Eastern Roman Empire. The places that where affected by these "dark ages" where mostly england that got cut-out of trade from the east, but no one cared about England anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The technology didn't stop the Haia Sophia was built in the year 600 in SIX years, that is a mayor feat of technological advancement. Right in the middle of these "Dark Ages." Constantinople kept on advancing technologically and culturally up to when it was captured in the last cursades by the chirstians, and the Latin Empire was established, then the Ottomans in the 1450's captured it and all the culture that the Byzantines accumulated for 1000 years fled to Italy and guess what that caused the Renaissance. There was no "Dark Ages" not in the places that matter at least, Cordoba Spain and Constantinople, the rest of Europe didn't matter to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously you are the one who hasn't read about the crusades and the "dark ages".

       Wow that blog is pretty bias blaming Christianity for the Dark Ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, the argument itself of the Dark Ages is very narrow minded point of view, it's not taking into consideration the advancement of the rest of all peoples. It's pretty exclusively western-European centers. There was nothing in Western Europe that was worth as much culturally or economically to anyone in the developed world, this being Eastern Europe and the Levant/Middle East, and Northen Africa. This was always the developed world. That is why the Roman Elite themselves moved out to Byzantion; there was nothing of real worth for anyone in Western Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only places of Western Europe that had anything going for them was Andalucian Spain and somewhat Rome, the rest of WesternEurope compared to the rest of the Mediterranean cultures was underdeveloped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Culturally Byzantium was the Euopean capital of culture and wealth read about it. It was for 1000 after the fall of RomeThat is why it got sacked by the crusaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Syria was booming, Iran was booming, AEgypt was booming Greece was doing pretty well, Spain was killing it, Carthage was doing great. Only those places like England an the British isles, Northen France, the lower countries, and the German city states where having a rough time, but they had always been underdeveloped compared to the rest of the Mediterranean.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that we follow the history line that was brought over by the British to America, and to them the dark ages where pretty bad, but not to the rest of the Mediterranean cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now of course If we talk about China, India and the Mayans well, then definitely there was no dark ages and social evolution was (and does today) continually advancing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You look at things very westernly, you took to heart everything that your teacher told you in high school; educate yourself.

       "Syria was booming, Iran was booming, AEgypt was booming Greece was doing pretty well, Spain was killing it, Carthage was doing great." read that again and tell what happened to them? im pretty sure the middle east (not greece) is in a huge religious war which obviously is holding  back their social and technological advances i understand Iran , Saudi Arabia and israel are wealthy and have a strong social class but where do you think they would be technology wise and socially if they didnt have religion? and obviously they dont follow christian beliefs (if they do those people are killed) and for the record i didnt take to heart what my high school teacher told me in high school cant really see how once again thats relevant to anything but if you makes you feel better then by all means say what you want. i dont need to educate my self maybe you do you try to sound smart but fail, do you know what JFK stood for? if you did this circle jerk wouldn't be happening and the USA would be a much more stable country and there would be less corruption but once again ill go hit the books and re educate my self.

       So this is about religion now?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Middle East is not behind culturally because of religion. The where the first culture to accept Freedom of religion, they taxed you for not being Muslim  but they where the first ever to legalize freedom of practice by LAW.
      </p>
      <p>
       You completely misunderstand the Middle East and Western and Eastern Europe, and their culture and how they're intertwined.
      </p>
      <p>
       They underdeveloped by constant western interference by the west since the end of WWI, and the fall of the Ottoman Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       WWI was caused by the attempt of connecting a railroad from Berlin to Bagdad for oil, excluding the need of the Suez Canal to ship oil to Europe, this was a thread to the British Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then continuos western interference in the region has kept the Middle East underdeveloped, or so the TV says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously get some real history going man, cut through the propaganda. Because so far you've been wrong about the dark ages, and now the Middle East, and you wanna talk about what Kennedy stood for?
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK was a pill addict son,  he wasn't such a great president he didn't get shot because of wanting to end the Cold War he got shot because he wanted to end the fed, and bring back the greenbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, on religion, you do understand he was a catholic right?
      </p>
      <p>
       He was on meds half of the time. 
He was handled by his father. 
He was a sex addict.

       Where would we be if Kennedy hadn't been killed? Hopefully he would have stopped a lot of the CIAs power, maybe communism would've spread far beyond China and Vietnam, maybe into India then possibly Bolivia and Argentina. Maybe His brother Robert would've also been president and the maybe the Berlin Wall would still be there and Eastern Europe would still be communist. Maybe the expansion of communism would've undermined the economical developments we witnessed in the 80-90s and capitalism would've given way to fascism in America.

       We just don't know, but what I do know is that it didn't happen, and we got the internet and mobile tech out of DARPA, communism failed everywhere except China and Cuba, and now naturally what we have is communism In China a becoming more capitalist and the west more totalitarian because there always has to be a balance in nature.

       Go down to the bottom of that page and prepare to have your worldview shattered. JFK made the 'legal' preparations to put the US under marital law.
