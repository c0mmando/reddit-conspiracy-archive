<p>Quite a number of users have multiple sockpuppet accounts to cheerlead themselves. Probably many more have silent sockpuppet accounts to upvote themselves and downvote those they disagree with.</p>

<p>Then we have to count the conspiratard and skeptic trolls who have nothing better to do with their time.</p>

<p>We also have to discount dormant or lapsed accounts, even some dead users (it&#39;s alright, I&#39;m not going there).</p>

<p>I have no clue. Anyway, it&#39;s an important milestone.</p>

<p>EDIT: Can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t specifically mention THE SHILLS - the bane of this subreddit! To be honest, I think these are the people who really go to town with the multiple sockpuppet accounts to downvote stories that they have been told to neutralise. They&#39;re smart enough to know they don&#39;t have to push any story into negative - it will die from lack of oxygen at 0 or 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, because I&#39;ve been &quot;outed&quot; as a shill in regards to GMO foods (and fluoride, and chemtrails, and the list goes on). The simple fact is, though, that I just disagree with the conspiracist assertion that GMOs are dangerous. <a href="/r/shill">/r/shill</a> just looks like it calls out trolls (<a href="/u/eastindiacomp">/u/eastindiacomp</a> is a clear troll), and mis-identifies skeptics (like <a href="/u/firemylasers">/u/firemylasers</a>) as shills. I&#39;ve often spent time here arguing against ideas like Sovereign Citizen legal interpretations. Does that make me a shill? Or does it reflect the fact that I&#39;m an attorney and happen to enjoy setting people straight when they start going down the primrose path to legal nonsense?</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ll also point out that you&#39;ve not yet provided evidence that anyone involved in this is getting paid, which is a requirement for shillery. Do you have any evidence of that, or are you just supposing they&#39;re getting paid because they disagree with you vocally? How can I be sure <em>you&#39;re</em> not being paid by various conspiracy peddlers, like Alex Jones or the 911 Truth folks?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t that then imply the sites that were banned did not provide kickbacks? A Quid pro quo? You surely have evidence of that. Otherwise you&#39;re just a rabblerouser who&#39;s pissed that your garbage marxist propaganda tools were given the heave-ho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly a number of these.  Over the years I have been able to group these <em>shills</em> into a few separate groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>The debunkers - these guys crop up when inconvenient facts appear (regarding 9/11 or any other false flag/major event).  They are armed with a playbook of rebuttals which play out the same every time, many are conspiratards.</li>
<li>The shit disturbers - these fellas usually promote violence as a solution in order to make &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; appear reckless.  They appear in the bad cop threads and sometimes just post nonsense.</li>
<li>The polluters - Look for anyone posting predictions (especially with dates), most often these guys will appear to be &#39;in the inside&#39; with military ties.  Their aim is to simply stir up fear and also discredit any material here.</li>
<li>And of course, special interest groups.  Talk about Israel, GMO, Bad science or any other golden egg you will rouse these folks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course there are just plain ordinary indoctrinated people who will defend their paradigms nail and tooth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. At the end of the day, I&#39;m only interested in the truth, which is why you will almost never see me in the political conspiracy threads. Although I don&#39;t agree with them all 100%, I think there&#39;s more accurate there than inaccurate, and therefore <em>slim pickings to debunk</em>.</p>

<p>If you see me laying into a subject, it&#39;s usually because the supporting evidence is really, really weak.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a lazy person at heart, so if I appear you can be sure you have a poor argument, or there&#39;s something inaccurate that stands out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>I also find conspiracy theories / theorists fascinating (I was very into UFOs back in the 70s). So there&#39;s that too.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s ridiculous when people deny the holocaust, and I think conspiracy theorists are nutcases. I do not remember pushing any zionist propaganda, unless you&#39;re saying wikipedia is zionist. All I have said is that you are anti-semitic and because of your anti-semitism you just assumed I have some connections to Jews. But I really don&#39;t. And why would a zionist state waste good shill money to argue with a nutter who is already considered (Apparently) one of the more anti-semitic guys on here? You are a very paranoid person.</p>

<p>I&#39;m bored and I dislike nazi propaganda and historical revisionism. By the same logic, you spend almost your entire life talking about zionism and jews. If I&#39;m a zionist shill just for defending the historical validity of the holocaust a few times, you must be a raging anti-semite.</p>

<p>But no, if I was being paid for this I&#39;d probably post nearly as much as you do (nearly, do you ever sleep?). Not a few times a day, and as you&#39;ve seen, occasionally on old posts. That&#39;s not shill behaviour.</p>

<p>Nice paranoia based on your anti-semitism though. And I still don&#39;t understand what this &quot;black propaganda trolling&quot; you refer to occasionally is. It&#39;s not as racist as it sounds is it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, Wikipedia and the ADL refer to the IHR as anti-semitic so it must be true!</p>

<p>Bullocks.  </p>

<p>The IHR does research about WW II and they are one of the few places to publish German sources and there is nothing wrong with this.  It&#39;s a good thing.  We need to see both sides of a conflict to better understand a conflict.  What other area of history do people insist only one side&#39;s evidence be shown?  Why shouldn&#39;t they review German literature from that time?  Or record German officer&#39;s statements?  Etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd that in many countries simply presenting this evidence is illegal.  For instance the author who conducted scientific forensic research into the gas chambers that I was citing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germar Rudolf had completed his doctoral dissertation in chemistry while working at the renowned Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart, when publication of his forensic study of the alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz caused university authorities to forbid him from completing the doctorate. In 1995 Rudolf was sentenced to fourteen months in jail for authoring the Rudolf Report; in the same year all available copies of Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte, a collection of up-to-date research on the Holocaust problem, were seized and destroyed by court order (the English-language version, Dissecting the Holocaust, can be purchased from IHR). Rudolf edits the revisionist quarterly Vierteljahreshefte für freie Geschichtsforschung, and is currently seeking political asylum in the United States. He has submitted a lengthy affidavit in support of David Irving&#39;s appeal of the adverse ruling in the Lipstadt trial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You show your true intentions here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s ridiculous when people deny the holocaust, and I think conspiracy theorists are nutcases. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You once again use terms that I reject and most revisionists reject.  Questioning the scope of crimes committed against Jews is not denying that crimes occurred.  If I questioned how many Armenians died at the hands of the Turks would I be a denialist?  It&#39;s just a buzzword you use to shut down debate (which you learned from the ADL).</p>

<p>Also, your hostility to conspiracy theorists and description of them as &quot;nutcases&quot; indicates why you should be banned from here.  All you do is troll here.  That&#39;s your only purpose.  </p>

<p>And I love the feigned ignorance about black propaganda trolling as if you don&#39;t know that Bipolar_Bear, your conspiratard troll friend, and others, post anti Jewish cartoons and slurs here so they can claim this sub is anti Jewish.  </p>

<p>And again, I am not anti-semitic.  I like and respect Jewish people.  I simply don&#39;t think a Zionist state should have been created, I&#39;m critical of Israel&#39;s actions, and I think Jews are overrepresented in U.S. foreign policies and power, and I question the official story about WW II.  This does not make me racist or anti Jewish.</p>

<p>Right but when you belong to an anti-semitic organisation that spends all it&#39;s time trying to revise elements of the holocaust so that it altogether seems like it was less bad for the Jews, including saying the camps weren&#39;t for extermination or that the gas chambers weren&#39;t used etc. You don&#39;t have to DENY the holocaust to be a denialist.</p>

<p>based on information gathered by anti-semites. Hmm. I guess you are just not self-aware to see that when all you do is yell about jews and zionists, and make claims that the holocaust wasn&#39;t as bad as it seemed repeatedly, then you really are the definition of an anti-semite.</p>

<p>No, revisionists are not anti-semites.  If an article is anti-semitic, talking about how Jews are inferior or something, then I will discount it.

The articles I&#39;ve read there cite the closing argument of the American lawyer defending a German in his war crime trial, for instance, or the forensic report about the chemical tests done at Auschwitz. These are legitimate articles by legitimate sources and you&#39;re trying to tar them as &quot;anti-semitic&quot; so you don&#39;t have to deal with them.</p>

<p>So what if you&#39;ve seen the inside of a KZ?  Americans had concentration camps too.  Does that mean they had a  policy of exterminating Japanese Americans? Hell, Americans probably incinerated more Japanese by bombing that Jews were incinerated by Germans.</p>

<p>And you do realize the Soviets built mock ups of the alleged gas chambers, no?  Complete with fake chimneys not even attached to anything?  </p>

<p>Watch David Cole visiting Auschwitz to get an example of the lies that are told on the tours of these alleged extermination camps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t invent the conspitaratard sub or it&#39;s name and I&#39;ve posted there maybe 10 times. I don&#39;t think you guys are literally retarded although you definitely suffer from some paranoid delusions about zionists and propaganda. I&#39;m going to move our conversation about you being a holocaust denier to here because I can only post once per ten minutes due to downvote based censorship. Here we go!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The head historian at Auschwitz admits the one standing gas chamber at Auschwitz is a Soviet era mock up and you go on a rant about Nazis. I know you are smart enough to know this is conclusive proof the Soviets did this yet you try to avoid this fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really says a lot about you that you think 1 guy saying 1 thing is proof. What about all the people who said that the holocaust did happen? all the people in the camps who said it happened, all the guards? All those stories are fake I guess, but this 1 guy must be completely right. And you think that there not being gas chambers at a single concentration camp, one of many proves what ? It doesn&#39;t prove your sources other asssertions that the camps were not for extermination, or that hitler did not plan to kill the jews but to release them/move them to their own land. This doesn&#39;t prove that you can&#39;t stack bodies and cremate them (how much experience do you have with cremation?).</p>

<p>You just see what you want to see and what you want to see is that Jews are everywhere and the holocaust wasn&#39;t that big of a deal.</p>

<p>I wonder if you will respond after reading this letter where Dr Piper condemns David Cole&#39;s methods and calls him a fraud and a liar?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/p/piper.franciszek/press/daily.texan.1093">http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/p/piper.franciszek/press/daily.texan.1093</a></p>

<p>Obviously the Zionist propaganda artists put a gun to his head too?</p>

<p>You are an anti-semite who does not bother to google his own sources because you are just so sure of the zionist conspiracy that you literally deny any information that is not nazi propaganda. David Cole really has not done anything that could be considered &quot;conclusive&quot;, except maybe be a fraud and then one day admit he was a fraud.</p>

<p>Some choice quotes from Dr Piper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his advertisement he introduces me as a &quot;Head of
Auschwitz Archives at the Auschwitz State Museum&quot;.  This is
untruth.  I am not and I have been neither a head of Auschwitz Archives nor a director of Auschwitz Musum, as Cole maintains in
other propaganda leaflets.  The purpose of such manipulation
with of facts is clear - to attract potential purchasers of his
&quot;Interview&quot; video tape. </p>

<p>In spite of the fact that
such secondary restoration works had to be done there is an
undisputable reality that the gas chamber in question is housed in the same
building which has been existed from prewar times till now. </p>

<p>The fact that the Nazi murderers used gas chambers (in
Birkenau you can see the ruins of the other 5 gas chambers) for
mass annihilation of innocent men, women and children, mostly
Jews, has been proved by thousands of memoires and depositions of
eyewitnesses as well as by German official documents and plans. 
It is obvious fact for everybody who wants to approach the
problem, to contact still living witnesses and to study historical
sources. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm ... and his thoughts on cole in general (translated from polish so mind the grammar):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his
ingenuousness he decided to halt the part of the murderers
instead of their innocent victims - different every
honest man does. My answers on a few questions of Cole ( who
deceitfully introduced himself as a man who wanted to convince his
acquaintances in America that Auschwitz was really a place of
genocide) constitute a small proportion of this video tape.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So uh, you still going to pretend you&#39;re not an anti-semite who uses nazi propaganda sources and denies the holocaust? Or do you have a neo nazi based source that will claim that Dr Piper wrote that letter under durress?</p>

<p>Gig is up my friend, it&#39;s pretty clear what your agenda is and where your information comes from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again with the anti semite slur.  I&#39;m not biased against Jews you conspiratard troll.  You repeatedly libel me because you are an intellectual fraud.</p>

<p>And is this the best you can do?   Thank you for showing me Dr. Piper&#39;s letter.  It shows there is no rebuttal to the admissions Cole wrung out of him.</p>

<p>What proof is there that the Soviet mock up gas chamber is &quot;in the same building&quot; as the alleged original gas chamber?  This is nothing but a bald claim that we have to take his word for.  All the evidence of homicidal gas chambers, all the accoutrements of terror, are <em>literally mock ups added later by the Soviets.</em>  So this defense of his previous claims is actually quite damning.  <strong>He doesn&#39;t deny the Soviets recreated the gas chamber and he doesn&#39;t provide any further details demonstrating why we should trust their mock up as historically accurate.</strong>  Who were the Soviet set designers and what evidence did they use to &quot;recreate&quot; the chambers they said were in that building (and we simply have to take their word for it).  They only proof these were the gas chambers are literally the evidence the Soviets planted there; because there certainly isn&#39;t Prussian blue indicating cyanide poisoning.  Hoss &quot;confessed&quot; that gassings occurred in farmhouses.  These were not farmhouses so whose testimony or what evidence did the Soviet&#39;s rely upon?  Why can&#39;t he tell us?  </p>

<p>So thank you for showing us all how weak the rebuttal is to Mr. Cole&#39;s smoking gun evidence he uncovered at Auschwitz from the chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz State Museum.  Cole got Dr. Piper to admit the gas chambers are a mock up recreation.  And all you have in response is to lamely call Cole a &quot;neo nazi.&quot;  </p>

<p>And picking nits over Dr. Piper&#39;s title hardly makes your case any better.  Weak shit my man.</p>

<p>Dr. Piper claims Cole misrepresented his title by calling him &quot;Director of the Auschwitz Museum&quot; when he&#39;s actually &quot;chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz State Museum.&quot;  Big diff.  And he may not be &quot;head of Auschwitz Archives&quot; but he obviously has control over the primary evidence as he offers to show Cole evidence (the doors you asked about earlier) during his interview with him at his office at Auschwitz in 1992 (which he later reneged upon).</p>

<p>From a source you trust, for some reason, even though you don&#39;t accept videos of interviews on Youtube or articles and studies published at IHR:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Franciszek Piper (born 1941) is a Polish scholar, historian and author. Most of his work concerns the Jewish Holocaust, especially the history of the concentration camps at Auschwitz. Dr. Piper is credited as one of the historians who helped establish a more accurate number of victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau death camps. According to his research, at least 1.1 million people perished at Auschwitz-Birkenau, of whom about 960,000 were Jewish.[1] He is the author of several books and <strong>chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz State Museum.</strong></p>

Your brain is so riddled with anti-semitism you are literally incapable of viewing it from the possibility that Jews were actually gassed.

<blockquote>
<p>From a source you trust, for some reason, even though you don&#39;t accept videos of interviews on Youtube or articles and studies published at IHR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because they are not peer-review, it&#39;s pseudo-science. It doesn&#39;t matter what his wiki says if <em>he himself</em> denies it. Again, you are saying this man is a liar? He is involved in this huuuuge cover up that 1 camp had fake gas chambers installed? What is the motive? How would lying about 1 camp when there were already various other camps achieve anything?</p>

<p>Again, how does this justify your anti-semitism, your desire to read information from organisations with ties to neo-nazis, and all the constant grumbling you do about israel in a state of paranoid rage? </p>

<p>Yes, but we didn&#39;t get to see the doors did we? So again, 1 guy saying 1 thing is not compelling proof. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, what about the testimonies of everyone who survived, the depositions and eyewitnesses? They&#39;re all fake, every single person was all lying?</p>

<p>Secondly, you have no proof that they were planted there outside of 1 guy saying 1 thing in a video that he claims was a set up by a fraud who lied to him. He claims he was entirely duped by the man and that David Cole did not even tell him he is a holocaust denier (or &quot;questioner&quot;). And I don&#39;t see how this proves that no Jews were gassed in the holocaust or that somehow this means it&#39;s okay to scream about israel 24/7 and talk about how the holocaust wasn&#39;t as bad as everyone says. Even if you were right I do not see how this changes the holocaust. They were still <em>extermination camps</em> for a planned genocide of an entire group of people. Of course, all your sources (the IHR) seem to claim that they were not extermination camps and hitler was actually a pretty sweet guy who was going to move them off his land. and they were given a full breakfast every day and there was a basketball court or some dumb bullshit.</p>

<p>When are you going to admit that you&#39;re an anti-semitic troll slinging crazy theories about the holocaust to justify your hatred of Israel because you don&#39;t have the facts on your side?</p>

<p>edit: and again, I have like 10 posts ever to conspiratard, stop confirming your paranoia repeatedly.</p>

<p>Dude.  Your brain is just plain riddled.  Cole got him to admit Krema I at Auschwitz is a mock up.  In rebuttal to this fact . . . Piper changes the subject to memoires and eyewitnesses and ruins at another camp . . . so once again no concrete proof.  No pictures.  Just ruins and one mock up and some eyewitness testimony.  He doesn&#39;t describe what process the Soviets used to accurately recreate this gas chamber (and we know the Soviets are sticklers for accuracy in this regard--ha).   </p>

<p>We also know both the Soviets and other Allies faked evidence after the war to &quot;prove&quot; Nazi crimes . . . like the lampshades and soap made from Jews they would put on tables and march Germans by.  Or the &quot;showers&quot; at Dachau that were never used for killing but has been falsely used as proof of German crimes (for a while at least).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He admits they are mock ups!  He&#39;s not covering it up.   He simply changes the subject and doesn&#39;t discuss how the Soviets knew how to replicate the mock up gas chambers now being passed off as the original.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and there was a basketball court </p>

<p>No, there was a swimming pool and soccer clubs.  They had a theater and saw movies and had a canteen where they could use their prison scrips to buy cigarettes and weak beer and treats.  They could write letters.  </p>

<p>But make no mistake about it.  It was a harsh life and many died . . . mostly from disease.  It was a travesty that the Germans put Jews there simply based on their religion (just like Americans put Japanese Americans in concentration camps for their heritage).  </p>

<p>And blah blah blah, anti semitic this, anti semitic that.  You sure cheapen anti semitism by foaming at the mouth with your false accusations.  </p>

Probably around 150,000 in Auschwitz so probably around 300,000 total in the camps?  Of course this is really rough and I&#39;m just throwing an educated guess out there.  I would bet a good number were executed in places like Hungary and Poland and Russia, etc., though.  Maybe some were legitimate executions for being partisans but I bet a good number were simply under that pretext and a few other incidents were just murder without even using that pretext.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I rant about Israel much.  Also, having questions about history does not make me an anti semite.  Just like having questions about 9/11 doesn&#39;t make anyone less of a patriot.  So when you try to &quot;expose&quot; me for asking questions you&#39;re just trying to shut down legitimate historical inquiry . . . probably because the facts don&#39;t support your agenda.  </p>

<p>Your logic is flawed.  The <em>only</em> evidence is eyewitness testimony so if that&#39;s invalidated your &quot;main fact&quot; (which you simply assume) is invalidated.  </p>

<p>And why would a sonderkommando recant?  He was likely well compensated and would suffer greatly if he recanted.  Hell, for the first few years they probably had to worry the Communists would kill them or other governments would punish them.</p>

<p>Also, simply google &quot;Holocaust fraud&quot; to see the number of people that lie about being survivors to obtain money and have been charged with fraud.  See also Norman Finkelstein who points out the Holocaust Industry is motivated by huge sums of money that has been wrung out of Germany to pay anyone that alleges they were a survivor.  </p>

<p>So wrong on so many levels.</p>

<p>There is a mountain of physical evidence, paperwork, orders for Zyklon-B, blueprints for crematoria, aerial photographs of the complex, photographs of body burning pits, 15 massive furnaces at the Auschwitz camp (just what WERE they burning that they needed 15 massive furnaces?), chemical testing on the remains of the gas chambers, letters describing how many bodies can be disposed of in 24 hours, public statements made by Nazi officials at the time...</p>

<p>There is a mountain of physical evidence, paperwork,</p>

<p>Extensive paperwork showing concentration and labor camps where about 150,000 prisoners (in Auschwtiz) died mostly of Typhus.  No paperwork that shows a state policy of extermination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>orders for Zyklon-B</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For killing pests to stop the spread of Typhus.  This saved prisoners lives rather than ended prisoner lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>blueprints for crematoria</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which showed the Germans were interested in cremating bodies for the people that died of disease, etc.  If their plan was to cremate the numbers of people alleged they surely would have built better crematoria.  Plus, the blueprints show the attached building was a morgue and not a gas chamber.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>aerial photographs of the complex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which do not support mass extermination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>photographs of body burning pits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which do not prove extermination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 massive furnaces at the Auschwitz camp (just what WERE they burning that they needed 15 massive furnaces?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These were not nearly massive enough.  This was insufficient to burn the number of bodies they allegedly burned.  The sonderkommando&#39;s testimony of putting 3 or 4 bodies in each cremation chamber is not believable nor is their alleged time frame to burn the thousands of bodies per gassing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>chemical testing on the remains of the gas chambers</p>

<p>Which proves my point, not yours.  We&#39;ve already been through this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>letters describing how many bodies can be disposed of in 24 hours, public statements made by Nazi officials at the time...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were worried about the large numbers of deaths from Typhus and wanted to cremate the bodies for health reasons.  Just like the U.S. would have done.  You&#39;re saying the Nazi&#39;s made public statements acknowledging the gassing of Jews?  Prove it.</p>

<p>The Nazi guards were forced to give confessions.  These were not voluntary confessions.  And plenty of Germans denied having personal knowledge of these things.

<p>No one claims the alleged chambers were solely for &quot;delousing.&quot;  There were separate delousing chambers where clothes were deloused and this is an admitted fact even by people on your side.  There may have been some delousing in the alleged gas chabmer in Krema II, for instance, to kill any disease carrying pests, but this was probably primarily used as a morgue (since it was underground it was cool) before the bodies could be incinerated upstairs.</p>

<p>And exactly how would you stop them?  Many Nazis gave interviews to historians late in their lives, on the cusp of death.  The interviews they gave then corroborated 100% what we know about the gassings.  Not a single one of them, stained with the most hideous crime in human history, ever took the chance to say &quot;the Holocaust story is fictional.  The gas chambers were false.

<p>And yet we have REAMS of statements from Nazis who ADMITTED involvement.  They admitted to participating in selections on the train platforms, marching the Jews to certain death, locking them inside the gas chambers and disposing of the bodies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And this overrules the mountain of physical evidence and thousands of witness testimonies how?  So some people tried to falsely profiteer from Nazi atrocities, that&#39;s hardly surprising.  It&#39;s BEYOND idiotic to use a story like this as &quot;proof&quot; that the ENTIRE EVENT was fabricated.</p>

<p>Also, this does not look like a smart way to burn bodies.  You need some sort of fuel, like piles of wood.  People are not going to just burn bodies on the ground like that and then walk amongst the bodies.</p>

<p>The photo you Holocaust deniers use to &quot;prove&quot; the Auschwitz photo was doctored was actually doctored in THE OTHER DIRECTION!  The producers of <em>Ghost Advenures</em> took the famous Auschwitz photo, digitally copied parts of the scenery over and over to cover some of the bodies, and used that doctored photo as a stand in for a photo of a train accident.</p>

<p>There are actually 3 other photos taken from the same spot, shot surreptitiously from the hip by a Sonderkommando as photographing was forbidden at Auschwitz.  </p>

<p><a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/the-sonderkommando-photos/">http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/the-sonderkommando-photos/</a></p>

<p>They were shot from inside the doorway of a crematoria.  2 of them show other Sonderkommandos burning a massive pile of naked corpses, one of them shows a group of female prisoners undressing, and one is a shot of sky and trees.</p>

<p>Historians have located the actual spot the photos were snapped at Auschwitz based on the scenery visible.  Lo and behold, it matches up with the burning corpse pit seen in aerial photographs taken by the Brits.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a photo of a mass burning of what looks to be likely hundreds of naked corpses, exactly as Holocaust survivors, Nazi soldiers and Sonderkommandos described.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand how &quot;burden of proof&quot; works, so let me enlighten you.  The photos are among the most famous photos taken in human history.  There are several first generation prints available for viewing at various museums.  The spot where the photos were snapped has been located exactly where you would expect it to be.  There is not a single shred of evidence that the photos are not 100% authentic.  If you want to assert that they are NOT authentic, the burden of proof is on you.</p>

<p>This is where guys like you go from being laughable to pathetic.  The framing of the photo is very narrow.  There is likely a ton of stuff happening outside the margins that we can&#39;t see.  Typical conspiracy thinking, &quot;let&#39;s not focus on the pile of naked corpses or the massive plume of smoke indicating a fire, let&#39;s nitpick and point out the lack of wood <em>within the framing of the photo</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Again, I can see probably 2 or 3 dozen within the very narrow framing of the photo.  How many do you think are outside the framing of the photo?  How many are smoldering on the pile to create that massive cloud of smoke?</p>

<p>Why would there be a massive pile of naked corpses being burned behind the crematoria?</p>

<p>Not rock solid.  I&#39;m inclined to agree there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s a picture from Auschwitz (but I don&#39;t agree with your interpretation of what is depicted nor its significance).  </p>

<p>But we have two competing images and one is fake.  So there is fakery going on somewhere.  It&#39;s weird for a television program to doctor what you claim is one of the most important images in human history (really?).  Why would they do this?</p>

<p>The Allies admit to cropping the photos in different ways and the person taking the photo is not around to verify anything about it and we don&#39;t have the negatives and it was quickly used for propaganda at the time (whether true or false propaganda we don&#39;t know).</p>

<p>But no negatives.</p>

<p>We see a tree line and fences.  It&#39;s possible this is the same location but even the &quot;proof&quot; acknowledges that features exist there that didn&#39;t before, like trees, etc.  There does appear to be similar tree line and similar fence, although there is more of a berm now.  There is not much to verify but I agree there is some support for your claims but it&#39;s not conclusive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The framing of the photo is very narrow. There is likely a ton of stuff happening outside the margins that we can&#39;t see.</p>

<p>Or, there is likely not much.  We don&#39;t know.  I love how you accuse me of faulty logic yet you&#39;re the assuming details from things you can&#39;t see.  </p>

<p>So you see massive plumes of smoke?  I see a smoky haze in an area that the verification information indicates is a very small area.  We&#39;re talking very small &quot;pits&quot; here.  And I don&#39;t even see pits.  We are simply told there are pits.  To burn human bodies requires a great deal of heat and fuel, so how are these Sonderkommandos able to just linger right by the raging inferno necessary to burn humans?  </p>

<p>The image appears to be more consistent with Sonderkommandos burning a pile of clothes in a small area.  That makes a lot more sense actually.  They probably were Tyhpus victims and they put the victims at the edge of camp to limit the spread of the disease and made Jewish prisoners strip the dead bodies of their clothes then burned a small pile of their clothes.  I don&#39;t see huge pits nor do I see how they could fit in that area.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would there be a massive pile of naked corpses being burned behind the crematoria?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, we don&#39;t see that, do we.  We see a few inmates walking around a few dozen (at most) bodies while there is smoke in the background.  We see no corpses being burned and this is simply information supplied to us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible corpses were being burned but I would imagine the reason for this is there were more bodies from the Typhus disease than could be accommodated in the cremation furnaces.  Which goes against the extermination story, btw.  How could they not handle these few dozens (to hundreds you insist are off camera) if they were allegedly burning thousands a day?  </p>

<p>So even if we do accept your interpretation of events how does this photo prove mass homicidal extermination by gas chamber?  Even the Germans and the Red Cross claimed there were about 150,000 victims of disease and at the worst times almost 10,000 were dying in a month so of course there were lots of dead bodies there.  </p>

<p>Some &quot;Holocaust&quot; writers, apparently struck by such technical considerations, have greatly exaggerated Birkenau&#39;s crematory capacities. Citing eyewitness testimonies, such as those of Filip Müller,[note 44] they claim that the corpses of many of the alleged gassing victims were incinerated in open-air cremation pits (in the courtyard of crematory [Krema] V, and near crematories II and III, and &quot;Bunker 2&quot;). Thanks to a fortunate coincidence, Birkenau was twice photographed from the air by Allied reconnaissance aircraft on May 31, 1944,[note 45] a day when 15,000 Hungarian Jews arrived at the camp. Moreover, we are authoritatively told, some 184,000 Jews had arrived there from Hungary during the previous 14 days -- an average daily total of some 13,000. The aerial reconnaissance photographs show not the slightest trace of the alleged extermination action: <strong>No trace of pits, no lines of people in front of the crematories, no evidence of open-air burning in the areas mentioned by witnesses</strong>.</p>

<p>&quot;This photograph, taken at 11am on 23 August 1944, by 60 Squadron RAF, has never previously been published, having only recently been discovered in the Aerial Reconnaissance Archives at Keele University. At this stage in the history of Auschwitz, in the final months of the war, we know now that Hungarian Jewry was being devastated. <strong>The number of people being gassed was so high that the crematoriums were unable to burn all the corpses. Huge pits were dug for the bodies instead, and this image graphically illustrates the burning of one such pit</strong>.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they dig pits to burn human bodies?  It makes no sense.  It&#39;s a terrible way to go about it.  There&#39;s a reason that cultures that burn people stack about a cord of wood above ground (a pyre) and put the body on top.  </p>

<p>Those piles of wood could easily have been to heat the many buildings as that&#39;s how they were heated.  You&#39;re going to need <em>much more wood</em> than that to provide fuel to heat the buildings <em>and</em> incinerate tens or hundreds of thousands of people.  You need massive amounts of wood.</p>

<p>Also, the aerial pictures are inconclusive.  Maybe something was burned in that corner, but they do not show corpses being burned.  In fact, the U.S. did not use this evidence against the Germans at trial because it was not incriminating and even the CIA guys looking at the evidence acknowledge <strong>witness testimony of continuous burning is false</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Figures 8 and 8a have an extraordinary historical value. The photograph was taken by the U.S. Air Force on 25 August 1944 and then went completely unnoticed, without anything abnormal being found in it by the photo intrepretation specialists of the time. It was not until 1979, as a result of the telecast of the Holocaust series, that two specialists of the CIA, D.A. Brugioni and R.G. Poirier, rescued it from the dusty archives, interpreting it and commenting on it according to the official dogma. [1] In spite of their Exterminationist good intentions, the authors had to acknowledge that</p>

<p>&quot;even though the camp survivors remember a cloud of smoke and flames that issued continuously from the chimneys of the crematory furnaces and that was visible in a radius of some kilometers, <strong>the photographs we have studied do not offer any positive proof.</strong>&quot;[2]</p>

<p>G. Wellers comments on this grave disagreement with the official thesis as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;In short, the photos do not confirm the statements according to which the crematories and burial pits were in constant activity every day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am willing to believe that it is more a matter of an expression then a daily reality: when we say: &quot;I&#39;m dying of hunger,&quot; we are not really at the brink of death.&quot; [3]</p>

<p>The confession of Wellers is important insofar as it serves to acknowledge that it is not necessary to take the testimony of the supposed witnesses literally. It is an important concession. In order to give his argument more force, the French author remarks that on the date the photograph was taken, no convoys of Jews arrived at Auschwitz. According to Wellers,</p>

<p>&quot;this explains perfectly the absence, on the days indicated, of exceptional activity around the crematoria and of clouds of smoke issuing from the chimneys or from the incineration pits.&quot; [4]</p>

<p>As we have stated, the photograph which we reproduce is dated 25 August 1944, a date on which, according to the Kalendarium of Auschwitz, no convoy arrived at Birkenau. But the previous day, according to the same source, yielded the arrival of five convoys destined for extermination. And it is absolutely inconceivable that several thousands of people could be exterminated and incinerated in less than 24 hours without leaving the slightest trace. In the photograph, which, according to the position of the shadows, was taken in the early hours of the morning, there is not the slightest trace of smoke, open fires, or movement of crowds of people or vehicles around the crematoriums to be detected. That the five convoys slated for extermination should have vanished into thin air in less that 24 hours without leaving any traces is one of the typical physical impossibilities that characterize the Auschwitz legend.</p>

<p>So even the CIA officials trotting out these inconclusive pictures as &quot;proof&quot; have to acknowledge the &quot;hundreds of witnesses&quot; are wrong about some very critical aspects of their testimony.</p>

<p>Nice try.  Ha.  Let me guess, you weren&#39;t on the High School debate team.</p>

<p>I&#39;m arguing the most logical interpretation of how the Germans would go about incinerating human bodies.  Look how many people around the world burn bodies upon death.  Do many of them dig pits in the ground to do so?  No, they usually build above ground pyres.  This makes sense because air can more easily feed the fire.  </p>

<p>So it&#39;s not very likely the Germans would do this.  It&#39;s possible, I suppose, but not likely. </p>

<p>But your evidence fails miserably.  As even the analysts on your own side acknowledge, on days after tens of thousands of prisoners are arriving, there is no evidence of smoke from this chimneys who your &quot;HUNDREDS&quot; of witnesses claim were operating non stop.  So the very evidence you cite PROVES your witnesses are incorrect.  And these &quot;15 massive furnaces&quot; were not massive, they were normal cremation furnaces that could accommodate one person and the Sonderkommando claims about how they cremated so many people in these are fanciful.  Totally not believable.</p>

<p>You showed me an average sized pile of wood.  Especially since all those barracks had to be heated because of the snow we see in that picture.</p>

<p>Plus, they needed that pile of wood next to these open air pits.  Where is that pile of wood next to the open air pits you claim--which is necessary to incinerate the hundreds of people you claim were incinerated in these open air pits.  Especially since it&#39;s going to be much less efficient to burn people in pits rather than above ground (they altered the story at other camps claiming a grill was used). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sonderkommando photos of PILES OF NAKED FUCKING CORPSES IN FRONT OF A SMOLDERING FIRE prove you wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must not have made debate team.  First, you unwittingly concede too much when you use the word &quot;smoldering.&quot;  We need a raging fire to consume a human body not a smoldering one.  Second, just because there are people lying dead in front of a fire doesn&#39;t mean they are going to be put in the fire.  They are naked so the burning material could be their clothes.  Hell, the Ghost whatever show allegedly used this picture to imply a train accident where the ruins were smoking and people were laying beside the ruins.  So no, this photo is not &quot;proof&quot; that people were burned in open air pit fires.  </p>

<p>In fact, on days when tens of thousands of prisoners are said to have arrived, there is no evidence of these massive furnaces producing any smoke.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m arguing the most logical interpretation of how the Germans would go about incinerating human bodies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re arguing AGAINST the hundreds of witnesses that described exactly how it was done, and the photographic record.  In other words, you&#39;re inventing your own version of the truth to gloss over the version inconvenient to your anti-semitism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But your evidence fails miserably. As even the analysts on your own side acknowledge, on days after tens of thousands of prisoners are arriving, there is no evidence of smoke from this chimneys who your &quot;HUNDREDS&quot; of witnesses claim were operating non stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no smoke on that one day.  On the day the Brits flew over, there was a massive cloud of smoke.  On the day the Sonderkommando photos were taken, there was a massive cloud of smoke with a pile of naked corpses around it.  Hundreds of witnesses described the constant smell and constant haze of smoke from bodies being incinerated.  Nazi guards described burning bodies in open air pits.  Human remains are still present in the ground at Auschwitz.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is that pile of wood next to the open air pits you claim--which is necessary to incinerate the hundreds of people you claim were incinerated in these open air pits. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a massive amount of information outside the area of that photograph.  Just because you can&#39;t see a pile of wood within the narrow margins doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t wood anywhere near there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, you unwittingly concede too much when you use the word &quot;smoldering.&quot; We need a raging fire to consume a human body not a smoldering one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy fucking hell do you love playing semantics.  In your buffoonish cartoon moron fucking world, does a fire just spring into a ROARING INFERNO the second you light it?  Or does it take a few minutes of smoking and smoldering before it gets lit?</p>

<p>How about when you start dumping corpses that are 90% water on top of a fire?  Do ya think that might cause it to smolder and smoke?  Have you ever tried to burn wet wood on a campfire genius?</p>

<p>Again, there is the matter of the PILE OF NAKED CORPSES IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SMOKE!  What exactly do you think is going on there?  Were they piling bodies next to the fire for fun?  To keep them warm?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So no, this photo is not &quot;proof&quot; that people were burned in open air pit fires.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it really is.  Sorry that your &quot;holohoax&quot; beliefs can&#39;t see that, but the hundreds of witnesses, the aerial photos and the photos of naked corpses in front of a fire all point to one inevitable conclusion.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;ll never concede it, but you know how ridiculous you sound.  That&#39;s what&#39;s important.  To believe your version, we have to believe the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All the Sonderkommandos were lying.</p></li>
<li><p>The majority of surviving Jews were either lying or completely ignorant.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the captured Auschwitz guards with knowledge of the extermination process were intimidated.</p></li>
<li><p>The photos of naked corpses in front of a fire show something completely innocent.  Nazis were in the habit of stacking corpses beside fires to keep them warm I guess.  Oh, you&#39;ll try to sell the &quot;typhoid victims and a burning pile of clothes&quot; bullshit, despite the fact that not a single witness statement corroborates it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You&#39;ve shown your stripes.  You don&#39;t care about the evidence.  You don&#39;t care about the thousands of statements, the photos, the human remains still in the ground at multiple camps.  You&#39;ll attempt to hand wave all of this away because you&#39;re a horrible anti-semetic racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>No, the photographic evidence contradicts the witness testimony as even the CIA analysts on your own side admit!</strong>  So you are falsely claiming the photographic and eyewitness testimony supports your side when it is contradictory.</p>

<p>The aerial photos do not show smoke from the crematoria when there were tens of thousands of humans allegedly being exterminated and at a time some witnesses claim they were running these &quot;massive furnaces&quot; around the clock.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of witnesses described the constant smell and constant haze of smoke from bodies being incinerated. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except you just admit it wasn&#39;t &quot;constant&quot; as on some days when Allies flew over there was no smoke from crematoria chimneys but smoke near these alleged &quot;pits.&quot;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nazi guards described burning bodies in open air pits. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, evidence obtained through torture and coercion is real convincing.  Especially when that information contradicts other evidence in critical ways that demonstrates they were making it up to please their torturers.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Human remains are still present in the ground at Auschwitz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some small fragments were found, which is not surprising, but no massive pits or burial grounds were found as the eyewitness testimony indicates should be there.  The forensic tests of the grounds show an amazing <em>lack</em> of physical evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about when you start dumping corpses that are 90% water on top of a fire? Do ya think that might cause it to smolder and smoke? Have you ever tried to burn wet wood on a campfire genius?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent questions.  Now you&#39;re starting to wrap your head around the improbability of the Germans burning tens of thousands of inmates in open air pits.  The testimony from witnesses describing throwing humans on the fire like logs and having their fat provide the fuel is a fantasy and there are lots of other improbable claims like the testimony.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, there is the matter of the PILE OF NAKED CORPSES IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SMOKE! What exactly do you think is going on there? Were they piling bodies next to the fire for fun?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know (assuming the picture is real).  I already gave a plausible scenario.  They were keeping the bodies away from the buildings because they may have been infected with lice and so they had the prisoners take their clothes off and burn them.  </p>

<p>Also, where are the implements one would think were necessary for conducting this cremation?  They didn&#39;t have long poles?  What, did they just swing the bodies into this &quot;pit&quot; that we can&#39;t see and are told to assume is behind that smoke?</p>

<p>Also, yes, we should see stacks of wood right next to the fires.  They&#39;ve stacked the bodies right next to the fires under your scenario.  Why would they have the wood stacked in a different location?  They would need an easily accessible pile.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve shown your stripes. You don&#39;t care about the evidence. You don&#39;t care about the thousands of statements, the photos, the human remains still in the ground at multiple camps. You&#39;ll attempt to hand wave all of this away because you&#39;re a horrible anti-semetic racist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do care about the evidence.  That&#39;s why I&#39;ve taken the time to examine it.  I used to simply accept all these claims as true.  But then I became more skeptical of official claims and skeptical of people who want to literally put people in prison for questioning facts.  So the evidence has led me here.</p>

<p>And I am far from a racist and I am not anti semitic.  I actually respect Jews enough to think they can handle the truth.  The truth is bad enough.  They were horribly mistreated by the Germans. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t rely on the evidence so you have to engage in libel.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Name 1 other event you are as skeptical of that you also post about for at least a few hours per day.</p>

<p>Labelling me a troll is just your way to continue denying your anti-semitism. It&#39;s understandable. Your mods do in fact ban people for trolling and for posting in other subs that don&#39;t agree with yours, but that was the Flytape style of moderation. We&#39;ll see if that continues. Banning people who dare to say that the holocaust actually happened as the history books says is a pretty bold move to restrict free speech though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where&#39;s the documentation of Hitler&#39;s plan? Hitler definitely was anti Jewish and he wanted to expel the Jews from Germany. This is why he partnered with the Zionists to force Jews to emigrate to Palestine until Hitler stopped cooperating with the Zionists in the early 1940s. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>proof? It seems like he built a lot of extermination camps, rounded them up and attempted to murder them. Not having an explicit order from Hitler does not change his views or what happened. Are you saying that the number of Jews who died in the holocaust is not what was reported? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any evidence the mock up the Soviets built is accurate? You prove the ventilation they allege is feasible. You do know they built a chimney that isn&#39;t even connected to the gas chamber? As in totally fake? I don&#39;t need a degree in physics to know this is no proof of a homicidal gas chamber.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof? And not from a webiste that has ties to neo-nazis? I&#39;m not sure how this makes it okay to hate jews and talk about them negatively constantly but i&#39;d still like to see proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve repeatedly denied your false allegations that I&#39;m anti Jewish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, it&#39;s pretty tough when all you do is talk about how awful Jews are and how the holocaust barely even happened. I think you should just be more open. You&#39;re better than amos_quito but still in complete denial about your irrational hatred for an entire group of people you have likely had very little interaction with.</p>

<p>I merely label holocaust-denying, relying on nazi propaganda and rambling hatred of jews disguised as hatred of &quot;zionism&quot; as anti-semitic.

</blockquote>

<p>You posted a single anecdotal piece of evidence from an interview with a notable holocaust denier, David Cole. You might as well have posted something by David Irving, another blatant holocaust denier. Your argument that the gas chambers are fake is nothing more than evidence that your anti-semitism drives you to try to say &quot;look! look! the holocaust wasn&#39;t that bad!&quot; There was no part of that video that actually showed evidence that the gas chambers were fake. It was just a video of some guy saying that they were. This is not conclusive justification for your anti-semitism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(is David Cole a &quot;neo nazi&quot;? and does it even matter who the interviewer is if the interviewee admits something?).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An anti-semite holocaust denier, yes. Neo Nazi? Not sure, but I imagine he has some connections to them. Should we take the interviewer into question? Yes, of course. You woulld not trust ANYTHING about the holocaust where the interviewer was JEwish, in fact you would probably lose your shit if i attempted to present such evidence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All information is biased, period.  Even witnessing an incident first hand is subject to your brains interpretation of senses.  Finding truth is a matter of deciding what enters your reality, but respect that everyone has their own interpretations.  Trusting someone to boil down events is fine, but recognize there are infinite vantage points (thus infinite truths).  A most basic example would be <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Spinning_Dancer.gif">this image</a>.

<p>They couldn&#39;t charge him with a hate crime since they both belonged to the same church so they used an old arcane law to charge him with conspiracy/interstate transportation for a weapon used in a crime.</p>

<p>So, uh, are you saying there should have been a post here about the amish dude&#39;s conspiracy to cut the other amish dude&#39;s beard?</p>

<p>Because I think when we talk about &quot;conspiracies&quot; we mean something a little more specific...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Logged in to second this.  OWNtheNWO, based on numbers and behavior, is someone who gets paid to drive traffic, pure and simple.  He drives content on this sub by constantly submitting and obviously he has many +friends and is making some serious $$ - however it works.</p>

<p>Is he simply the Mr.BabyMan of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  If he were, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much honestly.  But the quality of the sub has deteriorated due to wanton submissions of the &quot;They found Atlantis!&quot; variety and really a lack of filter on what is considered relevant.</p>

<p>This sub began as political discussion and has been turned into Fringe/X-Files/Lone Gunman and it fucking sucks, IMHO.  Personally I don&#39;t think OtN is some nefarious operator.  What&#39;s important is that his significant impact on the nature of submissions has driven down the intelligence of the sub while obliterating its focus - political awakening.</p>

<p>Is being a mod just a numbers game?  Do any mods have financial interest in plugging particular sites?  I don&#39;t know the answers, but I appeal to the mods to apply some better filters for whatever passes as information on this sub, and curb the influence of shills and &quot;power users&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The xfiles stuff is to deliberately distract us and make us look foolish.</p>

<p>Straight out of a gentleperson&#39;s guide to forum spies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a ‘RESOURCE BURN.’ By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a ‘gossip mode.’ In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to ‘drive in the wedge.’</p>

<p>This will give you a good idea of the type of people that make up this sub. There are 1 or 2 comments that are actually relevant and are posted by someone who can understand the big picture. Every other comment is complete garbage. Literally no one has pointed out that this is just a social manipulation tactic to get the public to accept the militarization of domestic airspace. And this is the top conspiracy-related post in this sub.</p>

<p>We need to find someplace else to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  The place has literally been overrun by shills and trolls.  Half decent moderation of banning people from the troll sub <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> would help a bit.</p>

<p>There are obviously a good number of people who are super dedicated to trolling this sub.  Look how much time they spend mocking this sub on conspiratard and then they are allowed to come over here and disrupt!  Obviously these are the people that are motivated enough to use multiple accounts and engage in vote brigading.</p>

<p>It stinks because it would be nice to have discussions without the constant harassment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, Wikipedia and the ADL refer to the IHR as anti-semitic so it must be true!</p>

<p>Bullocks.  </p>

<p>The IHR does research about WW II and they are one of the few places to publish German sources and there is nothing wrong with this.  It&#39;s a good thing.  We need to see both sides of a conflict to better understand a conflict.  What other area of history do people insist only one side&#39;s evidence be shown?  Why shouldn&#39;t they review German literature from that time?  Or record German officer&#39;s statements?  Etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd that in many countries simply presenting this evidence is illegal.  For instance the author who conducted scientific forensic research into the gas chambers that I was citing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germar Rudolf had completed his doctoral dissertation in chemistry while working at the renowned Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart, when publication of his forensic study of the alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz caused university authorities to forbid him from completing the doctorate. In 1995 Rudolf was sentenced to fourteen months in jail for authoring the Rudolf Report; in the same year all available copies of Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte, a collection of up-to-date research on the Holocaust problem, were seized and destroyed by court order (the English-language version, Dissecting the Holocaust, can be purchased from IHR). Rudolf edits the revisionist quarterly Vierteljahreshefte für freie Geschichtsforschung, and is currently seeking political asylum in the United States. He has submitted a lengthy affidavit in support of David Irving&#39;s appeal of the adverse ruling in the Lipstadt trial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You show your true intentions here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s ridiculous when people deny the holocaust, and I think conspiracy theorists are nutcases. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You once again use terms that I reject and most revisionists reject.  Questioning the scope of crimes committed against Jews is not denying that crimes occurred.  If I questioned how many Armenians died at the hands of the Turks would I be a denialist?  It&#39;s just a buzzword you use to shut down debate (which you learned from the ADL).</p>

<p>Also, your hostility to conspiracy theorists and description of them as &quot;nutcases&quot; indicates why you should be banned from here.  All you do is troll here.  That&#39;s your only purpose.  </p>

<p>And I love the feigned ignorance about black propaganda trolling as if you don&#39;t know that Bipolar_Bear, your conspiratard troll friend, and others, post anti Jewish cartoons and slurs here so they can claim this sub is anti Jewish.  </p>

<p>And again, I am not anti-semitic.  I like and respect Jewish people.  I simply don&#39;t think a Zionist state should have been created, I&#39;m critical of Israel&#39;s actions, and I think Jews are overrepresented in U.S. foreign policies and power, and I question the official story about WW II.  This does not make me racist or anti Jewish.</p>

<p>My skepticism of the official WW II story is not based on animus toward Jews--I&#39;m skeptical of lots of events because I like history and I want to pursue the truth and I enjoy pursuing alternative histories that one finds on places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Name 1 other event you are as skeptical of that you also post about for at least a few hours per day.</p>

<p>Labelling me a troll is just your way to continue denying your anti-semitism. It&#39;s understandable. Your mods do in fact ban people for trolling and for posting in other subs that don&#39;t agree with yours, but that was the Flytape style of moderation. We&#39;ll see if that continues. Banning people who dare to say that the holocaust actually happened as the history books says is a pretty bold move to restrict free speech though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where&#39;s the documentation of Hitler&#39;s plan? Hitler definitely was anti Jewish and he wanted to expel the Jews from Germany. This is why he partnered with the Zionists to force Jews to emigrate to Palestine until Hitler stopped cooperating with the Zionists in the early 1940s. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>proof? It seems like he built a lot of extermination camps, rounded them up and attempted to murder them. Not having an explicit order from Hitler does not change his views or what happened. Are you saying that the number of Jews who died in the holocaust is not what was reported? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any evidence the mock up the Soviets built is accurate? You prove the ventilation they allege is feasible. You do know they built a chimney that isn&#39;t even connected to the gas chamber? As in totally fake? I don&#39;t need a degree in physics to know this is no proof of a homicidal gas chamber.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof? And not from a webiste that has ties to neo-nazis? I&#39;m not sure how this makes it okay to hate jews and talk about them negatively constantly but i&#39;d still like to see proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve repeatedly denied your false allegations that I&#39;m anti Jewish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, it&#39;s pretty tough when all you do is talk about how awful Jews are and how the holocaust barely even happened. I think you should just be more open. You&#39;re better than amos_quito but still in complete denial about your irrational hatred for an entire group of people you have likely had very little interaction with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again with the anti semite slur.  I&#39;m not biased against Jews you conspiratard troll.  You repeatedly libel me because you are an intellectual fraud.</p>

<p>And is this the best you can do?   Thank you for showing me Dr. Piper&#39;s letter.  It shows there is no rebuttal to the admissions Cole wrung out of him.</p>

<p>What proof is there that the Soviet mock up gas chamber is &quot;in the same building&quot; as the alleged original gas chamber?  This is nothing but a bald claim that we have to take his word for.  All the evidence of homicidal gas chambers, all the accoutrements of terror, are <em>literally mock ups added later by the Soviets.</em>  So this defense of his previous claims is actually quite damning.  <strong>He doesn&#39;t deny the Soviets recreated the gas chamber and he doesn&#39;t provide any further details demonstrating why we should trust their mock up as historically accurate.</strong>  Who were the Soviet set designers and what evidence did they use to &quot;recreate&quot; the chambers they said were in that building (and we simply have to take their word for it).  They only proof these were the gas chambers are literally the evidence the Soviets planted there; because there certainly isn&#39;t Prussian blue indicating cyanide poisoning.  Hoss &quot;confessed&quot; that gassings occurred in farmhouses.  These were not farmhouses so whose testimony or what evidence did the Soviet&#39;s rely upon?  Why can&#39;t he tell us?  </p>

<p>So thank you for showing us all how weak the rebuttal is to Mr. Cole&#39;s smoking gun evidence he uncovered at Auschwitz from the chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz State Museum.  Cole got Dr. Piper to admit the gas chambers are a mock up recreation.  And all you have in response is to lamely call Cole a &quot;neo nazi.&quot;  </p>

<p>And picking nits over Dr. Piper&#39;s title hardly makes your case any better.  Weak shit my man.</p>

<p>Dr. Piper claims Cole misrepresented his title by calling him &quot;Director of the Auschwitz Museum&quot; when he&#39;s actually &quot;chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz State Museum.&quot;  Big diff.  And he may not be &quot;head of Auschwitz Archives&quot; but he obviously has control over the primary evidence as he offers to show Cole evidence (the doors you asked about earlier) during his interview with him at his office at Auschwitz in 1992 (which he later reneged upon).</p>

<p>From a source you trust, for some reason, even though you don&#39;t accept videos of interviews on Youtube or articles and studies published at IHR:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Franciszek Piper (born 1941) is a Polish scholar, historian and author. Most of his work concerns the Jewish Holocaust, especially the history of the concentration camps at Auschwitz. Dr. Piper is credited as one of the historians who helped establish a more accurate number of victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau death camps. According to his research, at least 1.1 million people perished at Auschwitz-Birkenau, of whom about 960,000 were Jewish.[1] He is the author of several books and <strong>chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz State Museum.</strong></p>

<p>When are you going to admit you&#39;re a conspiratard troll slinging libelous accusations of anti semitism because you don&#39;t have the truth on your side?  When are you going to admit you&#39;re nothing but a pathetic propagandist troll?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they dig pits to burn human bodies?  It makes no sense.  It&#39;s a terrible way to go about it.  There&#39;s a reason that cultures that burn people stack about a cord of wood above ground (a pyre) and put the body on top.  </p>

<p>Those piles of wood could easily have been to heat the many buildings as that&#39;s how they were heated.  You&#39;re going to need <em>much more wood</em> than that to provide fuel to heat the buildings <em>and</em> incinerate tens or hundreds of thousands of people.  You need massive amounts of wood.</p>

<p>Also, the aerial pictures are inconclusive.  Maybe something was burned in that corner, but they do not show corpses being burned.  In fact, the U.S. did not use this evidence against the Germans at trial because it was not incriminating and even the CIA guys looking at the evidence acknowledge <strong>witness testimony of continuous burning is false</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Figures 8 and 8a have an extraordinary historical value. The photograph was taken by the U.S. Air Force on 25 August 1944 and then went completely unnoticed, without anything abnormal being found in it by the photo intrepretation specialists of the time. It was not until 1979, as a result of the telecast of the Holocaust series, that two specialists of the CIA, D.A. Brugioni and R.G. Poirier, rescued it from the dusty archives, interpreting it and commenting on it according to the official dogma. [1] In spite of their Exterminationist good intentions, the authors had to acknowledge that</p>

<p>&quot;even though the camp survivors remember a cloud of smoke and flames that issued continuously from the chimneys of the crematory furnaces and that was visible in a radius of some kilometers, <strong>the photographs we have studied do not offer any positive proof.</strong>&quot;[2]</p>

<p>G. Wellers comments on this grave disagreement with the official thesis as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;In short, the photos do not confirm the statements according to which the crematories and burial pits were in constant activity every day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am willing to believe that it is more a matter of an expression then a daily reality: when we say: &quot;I&#39;m dying of hunger,&quot; we are not really at the brink of death.&quot; [3]</p>

<p>The confession of Wellers is important insofar as it serves to acknowledge that it is not necessary to take the testimony of the supposed witnesses literally. It is an important concession. In order to give his argument more force, the French author remarks that on the date the photograph was taken, no convoys of Jews arrived at Auschwitz. According to Wellers,</p>

<p>&quot;this explains perfectly the absence, on the days indicated, of exceptional activity around the crematoria and of clouds of smoke issuing from the chimneys or from the incineration pits.&quot; [4]</p>

<p>As we have stated, the photograph which we reproduce is dated 25 August 1944, a date on which, according to the Kalendarium of Auschwitz, no convoy arrived at Birkenau. But the previous day, according to the same source, yielded the arrival of five convoys destined for extermination. And it is absolutely inconceivable that several thousands of people could be exterminated and incinerated in less than 24 hours without leaving the slightest trace. In the photograph, which, according to the position of the shadows, was taken in the early hours of the morning, there is not the slightest trace of smoke, open fires, or movement of crowds of people or vehicles around the crematoriums to be detected. That the five convoys slated for extermination should have vanished into thin air in less that 24 hours without leaving any traces is one of the typical physical impossibilities that characterize the Auschwitz legend.</p>

<p>So even the CIA officials trotting out these inconclusive pictures as &quot;proof&quot; have to acknowledge the &quot;hundreds of witnesses&quot; are wrong about some very critical aspects of their testimony.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Argument from incredulity. Massive logical fallacy. Just because YOU can&#39;t imagine why they would do it doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice try.  Ha.  Let me guess, you weren&#39;t on the High School debate team.</p>

<p>I&#39;m arguing the most logical interpretation of how the Germans would go about incinerating human bodies.  Look how many people around the world burn bodies upon death.  Do many of them dig pits in the ground to do so?  No, they usually build above ground pyres.  This makes sense because air can more easily feed the fire.  </p>

<p>So it&#39;s not very likely the Germans would do this.  It&#39;s possible, I suppose, but not likely. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The aerial photos combined with the HUNDREDS of witness testimonies combined with the Sonderkommando photos are anything but inconclusive. Got it? Every piece of evidence is there. In summer of 1944, the Nazis were gassing more Jews daily than they could dispose of in 15 massive furnaces, necessitating the burning of corpses in open air pits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But your evidence fails miserably.  As even the analysts on your own side acknowledge, on days after tens of thousands of prisoners are arriving, there is no evidence of smoke from this chimneys who your &quot;HUNDREDS&quot; of witnesses claim were operating non stop.  So the very evidence you cite PROVES your witnesses are incorrect.  And these &quot;15 massive furnaces&quot; were not massive, they were normal cremation furnaces that could accommodate one person and the Sonderkommando claims about how they cremated so many people in these are fanciful.  Totally not believable.</p>

<p>You showed me an average sized pile of wood.  Especially since all those barracks had to be heated because of the snow we see in that picture.</p>

<p>Plus, they needed that pile of wood next to these open air pits.  Where is that pile of wood next to the open air pits you claim--which is necessary to incinerate the hundreds of people you claim were incinerated in these open air pits.  Especially since it&#39;s going to be much less efficient to burn people in pits rather than above ground (they altered the story at other camps claiming a grill was used). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sonderkommando photos of PILES OF NAKED FUCKING CORPSES IN FRONT OF A SMOLDERING FIRE prove you wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must not have made debate team.  First, you unwittingly concede too much when you use the word &quot;smoldering.&quot;  We need a raging fire to consume a human body not a smoldering one.  Second, just because there are people lying dead in front of a fire doesn&#39;t mean they are going to be put in the fire.  They are naked so the burning material could be their clothes.  Hell, the Ghost whatever show allegedly used this picture to imply a train accident where the ruins were smoking and people were laying beside the ruins.  So no, this photo is not &quot;proof&quot; that people were burned in open air pit fires.  </p>

<p>In fact, on days when tens of thousands of prisoners are said to have arrived, there is no evidence of these massive furnaces producing any smoke.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re arguing AGAINST the hundreds of witnesses that described exactly how it was done, and the photographic record.  In other words, you&#39;re inventing your own version of the truth to gloss over the version inconvenient to your anti-semitism.</p>

<p>There was no smoke on that one day.  On the day the Brits flew over, there was a massive cloud of smoke.  On the day the Sonderkommando photos were taken, there was a massive cloud of smoke with a pile of naked corpses around it.  Hundreds of witnesses described the constant smell and constant haze of smoke from bodies being incinerated.  Nazi guards described burning bodies in open air pits.  Human remains are still present in the ground at Auschwitz.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is that pile of wood next to the open air pits you claim--which is necessary to incinerate the hundreds of people you claim were incinerated in these open air pits. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a massive amount of information outside the area of that photograph.  Just because you can&#39;t see a pile of wood within the narrow margins doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t wood anywhere near there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, you unwittingly concede too much when you use the word &quot;smoldering.&quot; We need a raging fire to consume a human body not a smoldering one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy fucking hell do you love playing semantics.  In your buffoonish cartoon moron fucking world, does a fire just spring into a ROARING INFERNO the second you light it?  Or does it take a few minutes of smoking and smoldering before it gets lit?</p>

<p>How about when you start dumping corpses that are 90% water on top of a fire?  Do ya think that might cause it to smolder and smoke?  Have you ever tried to burn wet wood on a campfire genius?</p>

<p>Again, there is the matter of the PILE OF NAKED CORPSES IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SMOKE!  What exactly do you think is going on there?  Were they piling bodies next to the fire for fun?  To keep them warm?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So no, this photo is not &quot;proof&quot; that people were burned in open air pit fires.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it really is.  Sorry that your &quot;holohoax&quot; beliefs can&#39;t see that, but the hundreds of witnesses, the aerial photos and the photos of naked corpses in front of a fire all point to one inevitable conclusion.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;ll never concede it, but you know how ridiculous you sound.  That&#39;s what&#39;s important.  To believe your version, we have to believe the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All the Sonderkommandos were lying.</p></li>
<li><p>The majority of surviving Jews were either lying or completely ignorant.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the captured Auschwitz guards with knowledge of the extermination process were intimidated.</p></li>
<li><p>The photos of naked corpses in front of a fire show something completely innocent.  Nazis were in the habit of stacking corpses beside fires to keep them warm I guess.  Oh, you&#39;ll try to sell the &quot;typhoid victims and a burning pile of clothes&quot; bullshit, despite the fact that not a single witness statement corroborates it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You&#39;ve shown your stripes.  You don&#39;t care about the evidence.  You don&#39;t care about the thousands of statements, the photos, the human remains still in the ground at multiple camps.  You&#39;ll attempt to hand wave all of this away because you&#39;re a horrible anti-semetic racist.</p>
