As I&#39;m sure you have too, his car looks completely destroyed. Police come out and say &quot;speed probably a factor,&quot; yeah, no shit. Then the report comes out that police believe they were driving roughly 45 mph around 15 mph turn. This doesn&#39;t make sense. The car would not be in half if that were the case. If anyone can find me a video or picture of a car running into a concrete pole and being completely annihilated, I will concede myself incorrect. Do it. Now, with the phillipines. <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/philippines-vaccination-20131126/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/philippines-vaccination-20131126/en/</a> world health delivers vaccine that causes 45,000+ of paralysis after vaccination in India. <a href="http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/pdfs/202co114.html.pdf">http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/pdfs/202co114.html.pdf</a> this is a real document, it&#39;s not natural news or anything like that, no infowars. This is a legitimate document recording this problem. Now, these are the statistics for the polio problems in the phillipines : <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/no-polio-in-the-philippines-since-1993-but-mass-polio-vaccination-program-started-among-500000-typhoon-victims/">http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/no-polio-in-the-philippines-since-1993-but-mass-polio-vaccination-program-started-among-500000-typhoon-victims/</a> . These things being said, something is not right. I can&#39;t find anything relating to his relief efforts aside from him &quot;tweeting about it,&quot; and I would love some info showing that his efforts made it to the phillipines. I understand it sounds crazy, but his car did not explode going 40-45 mph. The video donesnt show any face of bystanders at crash, and is very short considering what was happening. Family guy conspiracies being talked down to, who cares about family guy references? When the microwave causing storms video came it, the media actually went out of its way to disprove it, and they lied about being able to manipulate the weather even slightly. It&#39;s all coming together, and Filipino officials are telling the US that their days of occupation must end. Prove anything wrong, please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your case is disjointed and confusing.</p>

<p>Your subject talks about Paul Walker. Your text links to information about vaccinations in the Philippines and India and talks about weather control. But it never links any of that back to Paul Walker.</p>

<p>From CNN:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Walker was in the passenger seat of a <strong>2005 Porsche Carrera GT</strong>, driven by a racing team partner...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Carrera_GT#Performance">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stock, that car does 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.8 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Notable technology includes a pure carbon fiber monocoque and subframe...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This isn&#39;t a Ford Taurus or a Volvo or a minivan. It&#39;s not a car that is designed with emphasis on protecting its passengers in a crash. It is a $300,000+ supercar designed to accelerate, brake, and turn. Hell, I can&#39;t even find crash test ratings on that car.</p>

<p>The car was driven by Roger Rodas. Roger was a former race car driver and the CEO of Always Evolving Performance Motors, a professional automotive body shop. It is not inconceivable to imagine that the car was modified - enhanced to perform even better than stock.</p>

<p>Anyway, to get back on point, where&#39;s the conspiracy? Who would want Paul Walker dead? Why / how would they benefit from it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at it this way, he is part of the relief effort of the typhoon. They are giving out a vaccine to hundreds of thousands of people. This vaccine is the reason why 45,000 youths in India IN 2012 ALONE were paralyzed. If me or paul walker were to go to the media to speak about the vaccination of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people with a vaccine that CAUSES PARALYSIS in a country with less than 4,000 (I didn&#39;t add, but its not more than 6,000) cases of polio in the past 4 years who do you think would be taken seriously? This is an effort LED BY THE RED CROSS OF AMERICA. The car is made for protection, its made with a roll cage in it. It&#39;s a RACING CAR, there isn&#39;t any other reason why it was made other than speed, and with speed you have to have safety, otherwise you WILL BE SUED AFTER EVERY CRASH. Again, he is INSIDE the world of relief efforts, RAPID RELIEF. The reports that the police are giving after e investigation are that they were traveling &quot;40-45 mph around a turn&quot; and you and I both know that THE CAR HAD TO HAVE BEEN TRAVELING FASTER THAN THAT FOR THE CAR TO TAKE THAT KIND OF DAMAGE. It&#39;s common sense, even if you exclude the conspiracy theory. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m correct, but the fact that his car looks like the aftermath of a drone strike in a car, or a car bomb, shows me that something isn&#39;t being talked about. They better release security camera footage, they showed me people jumping out of the World Trade Center to ther deaths, why can&#39;t I see the tsarnaev brothers drop the back pack? I don&#39;t want to see deaths, just the seconds leading up. Why can&#39;t I see Adam Lanza walking into the school? I don&#39;t want to see children being slaughtered, I just want to see him walk in. You don&#39;t find it odd that ey will show you people committing suicide out of fear during 9/11 but won&#39;t show you the video of the plane running into the pentagon accounting office the day after Donald Rumsfeld said they are trying to locate 2.3 trillion dollars that went missing? It just doesn&#39;t make sense how the stories are told, and what evidence is chosen to show the public. Wo did the video recording of the aftermath for the crash? Why was it so short? Why didn&#39;t I see a single persons face? No one will ask that, because no one will question a person who played a racer dying in a racer accident in real life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking that speed estimate is a wild ass guess. I wouldn&#39;t doubt that car can do a sharp 90 degree turn at 45mph without flinching. But police stupidity doesn&#39;t mean conspiracy to kill Paul Walker.</p>

<p>You&#39;re all over the map on different theories and it makes it really hard to follow the Paul Walker theory, especially with the lack of [Enter] key, but I&#39;m trying.</p>

<p>I highly doubt drone strike. We&#39;re talking LA, a highly populated area, not some backwoods bunghole with 7 inbred, alcoholic farmers. Someone would have seen that and said something. A lot of someones.</p>

<p>Bomb, ok, maybe. Distract from Sandy Hook or the other things? I doubt it. Here are the questions:</p>

<p>1) If the goal was to distract from <em>insert event here</em>, then why did they fuck up the timing so badly?</p>

<p>2) How did they know (assuming bomb and Paul not Roger was the target) that Paul would get into that car?</p>

<p>3) Was it just happy coincidence for the conspirators that Roger decided to do donuts / figure-8&#39;s and hit a light post immediately before the conspirators triggered the bomb?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last week if it were to type in &quot;fast and furious&quot; into google two types of results came up. The ATF operation of &quot;fast and furious&quot; which centered around &quot;Brian&quot; Terry, and the fast and furious franchise featuring Brian played by paul walker. Google pulls up search results based on popularity of terms searched and hits. In the past 4 days articles that all contain the words &quot;fast and furious&quot; &quot;Brian&quot; have been on top, and will now remain that way. Think of how many hits the articles have gotten, I know you can see specifically how many articles were clicked, I just don&#39;t know how to see that information. 
Yeah I&#39;m all over the place, I not have a tablet with me right now, so it&#39;s hard to explain efficiently and quickly.
Could this have been a way to make sure that he didn&#39;t come forward to talk about the vaccines that are going to give children in another country paralysis? Again, this drug is proven to give paralysis, its not a matter of &quot;if&quot; it&#39;s a matter of &quot;how many&quot; are going to be paralyzed from the treatment. Could this have been the perfect opportunity for the federal government to bury the story of guns being given to cartels that slaughter thousands of people every year? Sounds like a case of two two birds with one stone. Again, if he was doing donuts and figure 8s I can accept that, but doing those things in the road and immediately slamming into a tree completely destroying the ENTIRE car is not possible. I saw the skid marks during the video release, and they were shown going in a direction opposite if the tree. I have no problem admitting I&#39;m wrong, I just want to see the video of the crash. Industrial parks have millions of dollars of equipment in them, there are security cameras that saw the crash. That&#39;s all I ask, proof, and then I will throw all the information that seems relevant to the crash out the window. Something tells me we won&#39;t see the videos, but only because there&#39;s things that weren&#39;t meant to be seen.</p>

<p>Depends on the car, speed, etc.</p>

<p>Seems awfully convenient that they were doing those things, then hit something, and right at that moment some conspirator somewhere triggered a bomb in a car to kill a guy who didn&#39;t own that car and maybe wasn&#39;t even to be certain to be in it that afternoon.</p>

<p>The actions and timing leading up to and during the crash are too random for me to buy into any conspiracy just yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are security cameras that saw the crash</p>

<p>Probably.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If videos are out there, their owners are negotiating with media outlets now for top dollar and they will be seen.</p>

I just can&#39;t get passed the fact that it could be the perfect cover up of search results that link United States government to supplying weapons to groups that kill thousands every year and that they are distributing vaccinations that WILL paralyze people in an area where the reason to get the vaccine isn&#39;t actually relevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A distraction? No. That&#39;s a reach.</p>

<p>A celeb who could likely have some heavy knowledge regarding the vaccines that his organization has been involved in giving out- that&#39;s not an unreasonable theory. That could ruin the entire vaccine industry. The govt is in bed with the medical industry. They&#39;ll do what they&#39;re paid to do. Obviously it&#39;s still a reach but much less so than calling it a media distraction</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t give a shit about sandy hook. The only thing I care about is seeing a video of Adam Lanza walking into the front door of the school holding a gun.

The fact that they won&#39;t show me that he even walked in the school shows me there is a huge problem with the event. Columbine was shown, why can&#39;t I see Adam WALKING?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many things point to a non - existent story line. The fat guy who housed the kids changed his story about who dropped them off, and what happened at that time (he wasn&#39;t aware what was happening at the school, just what the &quot;bus driver told him&quot; so he wasn&#39;t going crazy panicking not collecting the information around him. The fact that this was happening at the exact same time, on the exact same day for the exact reason they were there for : <a href="http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/eventDetail_page.asp?date_ID=CAC9C6C9CD83CDC9C7">http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/eventDetail_page.asp?date_ID=CAC9C6C9CD83CDC9C7</a> 
The videos of people walking around in circles through doors at the schools, paramedics and helpers just standing around. The ambulances weren&#39;t directly in front of the school, they were blocked off by other cars being in the way, that is not how you handle a real situation involving hurt people. 
I can only speculate on the &quot;pictures of the Lanza house&quot; his bed looks like his body never touched it. If he had slept in it the night before I can only guess that he woke up, made his bed, didn&#39;t clean anything else up, killed his mother and then killed children at a school? The photo of his I&#39;d card....I live and grew up with photoshop, anyone who is familiar with photoshop can immediately see that the picture of his ID next to his glasses (though he didn&#39;t wear glasses) is completely fake. They showed the video games he played, they showed all the retro ones he had, 360 games, but there wasn&#39;t a Xbox 360 anywhere in the pictures (I acknowledge they could have excluded the Xbox, but why show the games and his cupboard full of other consoles?) The picture of his gun safe, the things around it look completely random, and they could be, but just look at what the items were. Planters peanuts opened container, almost like he sat down and enjoyed some protein staring at his guns before he decided which one he would use. The drawer full of clips? Doesn&#39;t seem right, but it could be, who am I to know where people keep their magazines?
Then of course there are the videos of the father at the podium in which he is laughing walking up, turns and says &quot;are we ready now?&quot; (Not exact quote, but it was that basic question) and then stage cries, you can&#39;t honestly look yourself in the mirror and tell me he didn&#39;t force himself to have tears in his eyes. It could be real, but the push for gun control immediately after tops the cake for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was in an industrial park, meaning that there are definitely videos from security cameras on that road. I don&#39;t care about the fire, those things happen. I have a problem with the body of the car being split in half from 40-45 mph speeds. The physics don&#39;t add up. This is a sports car designed to handle high speeds and crashes. I, myself, am willing to drive a Porsche into a tree at 45 mph to show that it isn&#39;t a valid statement. I will go on national news and drive a Porsche into a tree. And it will not look like that car. I&#39;m perfectly fine with admitting that car crashes happen, some people drive crazy and that things happen that are bad all the time. But the crash itself doesn&#39;t add up to the investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Car fires can melt some metals. I had a car burn on me. It gets really fucking hot.</p>

<p>The car would catch fire if the fuel tank were ruptured. The fuel tank in the car, as near as I can tell from my research, is located behind the seats and in front of the engine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 trained drivers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was only one driver, and yes he was a former race car driver. Was he stone cold sober? Was there a mechanical problem with the car? Was he fooling around in a spot maybe he shouldn&#39;t have been and over-corrected to avoid an issue?</p>

<p>Better questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Who benefits from the death of either of these men?</p></li>
<li><p>How do they benefit?</p></li>
<li><p>Do they have the power to pull off this type of murder?</p></li>
<li><p>If the target was Paul Walker and not Roger Rodas, how did they know Paul would be in the car?</p></li>
<li><p>Why and how would they be able to pull off that murder in a car, exactly at the time that the two men were coming home from a charity event, when the driver was doing figure-8&#39;s instead of in some other, less flashy way?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The Carerra GT they were driving is known for being wildly sketchy in terms of control. The previous owner, currently an Indy Car racer, talked about how the &quot;traction control&quot; on this car wouldn&#39;t even be enough to save you from spinning out. The car world is pretty much all in agreement that this car is wild, and hard to keep in control.</p>

<p>The gas tank for this car is positioned between the seats, and engine. Placing the gas directly behind the occupants. Which would be very easy to ignite with its close proximity to the engine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the information about what happened after the crash don&#39;t add up either. The video comes out of the fire, the video just turns off, there&#39;s no identification of the people who took the video, or of anyone you can hear talking. Again, the video just turns off even though everything was still happening, up for grabs as to why you would just stop, regardless of knowing of a celebrity was inside. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2516403/Paul-Walker-STREET-RACE-died-fireball-crash.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2516403/Paul-Walker-STREET-RACE-died-fireball-crash.html</a> this and many many many articles claim that the 8 year old son of walker jumped over a fence (I&#39;d like to see the fence) and tried to pull his father out. The car was a fireball, the child would be burned, of course that&#39;s up for debate as well, but if firemen were there they wouldn&#39;t have let him near the the blaze. then the articles take another turn that I can scrutinize. They claim that people ran up to the car with fire extinguishers (they name who, I just can&#39;t remember, seems irrelevant) but firemen were there and and kept people back. So there are two points that say that his son ran to the car and tried to pull him out, and that people came with fire extinguishers but were held back. I feel safe saying at this point the 8 year old running to a fire ball of a car wreck and trying to save his father by pulling him out is a complete lie. He would have been burned, because that fire shown was blazing. Where are those reports? He miraculously wasn&#39;t harmed by the fire. But the fire was still blazing when the firemen got there, enough to hold people back from running close to it. How do these things make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The kid wasn&#39;t Paul Walkers. It was the drivers son. The story I read made it sound like this happened before the fire dept got there, because the event was so close to the crash site. I highly doubt the son actually got to the car itself, but tried and was also stopped. It was within running distance of the event apparently. </p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re taking the mainstream media versions of all of this, they always contradict themselves, and different outlets report different facts. </p>

<p>Theres honestly nothing right now that shows this is malicious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t have any interest in these crack pot death conspiracies. It seems as though any time any celebrity dies, people in here come  up with nutty conspiracy theories to tie in the government, the CIA, and God knows who else. It&#39;s retarded. This actor died because he got into a car accident. He was a fucking actor. Nobody cares about actors. They aren&#39;t important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he was an actor. And a relief effort worker in a country that is giving out vaccines that WILL paralyze people who it is given to, a vaccine that solves a medical problem in a country that doesn&#39;t have the listed medical problem. In the last 5 years there have been less than 5,000 cases of Polio in the Philippines, now they are vaccinating the entire country? If not hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of people? With a vaccine that DID cause paralysis in 45,000+ people in India in 2012 ALONE? That&#39;s a violation if human rights. In 1993 government documents were leaked that showed the Philippian governement was sterilizing women through vaccinations. This also happened in America. Why would they stop, because people got &quot;mad?&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t pan out to me.  You don&#39;t need to kill a Paul Walker.  He really has no credibility as far as science goes.  Not to mention he is already a public figure so killing him is going to get major headlines so it would be rather risky to pull off.  He has a non-profit because pretty much every millionaire celebrity has a non-profit for public relations purposes and for tax sheltering purposes.  I really don&#39;t think he was going to/trying to blow the lid off of anything.  I&#39;d be surprised if he even really paid attention to the day-to-day of his organization.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Five days ago if you googled &quot;fast and furious&quot; &quot;Brian&quot; in any order you would get a mix of results between Brian terry in the ATF operation fast and furious and Brian in fast and furious series played by paul walker.
Google runs off keyword popularity and amount of hits per page to bring searches to the top of its list. All articles after paul walker deaths now have keywords of &quot;Brian&quot; &quot;death&quot; &quot;fast and furious,&quot; and now have millions of hits, putting fast and furious with ATF at the bottom of search results. Throw in that he was going to inform the public that he found out through his RELIEF CHARITY that the unnecessary, poven dangerous polio vaccines were being forced onto survivors of the typhoons, a method headed by the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION and THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. They can&#39;t be exposed as being a dangerous group, so why not kill paul take care of two problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who has proven that he was going to expose anything?  If he was &quot;going to&quot; why didn&#39;t he do it already?  People are trying to turn everything into a conspiracy and that just isn&#39;t the case.  The guy died in a car accident.  This is the same car that Ryan Dunn died driving when it ripped in half and burst into flames.  These cars aren&#39;t built for safety.  They are built for speed.  When you wreck them you are in big trouble because there isn&#39;t much to protect you and they are so compact that a front end or rear end collision is going to expose your gas tank.  And as far as the google search thing changing, who goes and searches random words without knowing what they are looking for?  If you are looking for the ATF fast and furious you will just refine your search until it comes up.</p>
