<p>The user is <a href="/u/doggy_styles">/u/doggy_styles</a>, the censored comments are still in their comment history. As you can see they broke no rules and were polite. </p>

<p>The user was <strong>banned</strong> by the warmonger bigot <a href="/u/Herkimer">/u/Herkimer</a> after he angrily demanded <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/8d3hc/the_rachel_corrie_pancake_breakfast/c08wreq">a link to him making jokes about Rachel Corrie&#39;s murder in r/funny.</a> Once the proof was provided he first censored the comment with the evidence he demanded, then banned the user in a fit of cowardice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So. Many. Screenshots.</p>

<p>It looks like the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> don&#39;t give a flying fuck about your concerns and are taking the piss out of your &quot;concern.&quot;</p>

<p>Your logic seems to be:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> has mods</p>

<p>Some of whom are bigots</p>

<p>Who mod a different sub</p>

<p>That laughs at a pro-Palestinian US activist</p>

<p>Killed 10+ years ago in disputed circumstances</p>

<p>And this fact &quot;harms the reputation of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>&quot; and &quot;impacts the legitimacy and dignity of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>&quot; and someone actually thought <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> &quot;claims the moral high ground over <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Do I have that correct? Please correct it if I missed something.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Rick Santorum is rightly viewed as an obsessed homophobic extremist driven by a dogmatic bronze age morality because homosexuality is largely--and increasingly--accepted by progressive societies.</p>

<p>By your logic, someone who is indignant at people who make tasteless jokes about a Palestinian activist crushed by a bulldozer operated by an Israli soldier (under any circumstances), is similarly extreme and obsessed, because joking about activists being crushed by bulldozers operated by soldiers is also accepted by progressive societies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that joking about Rachel Corrie is contemptible. I think that someone who does that is probably an extremist and a bigot.</p>

<p>There are extemists and bigots in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> .</p>

<p>There are also extremists and bigots in <a href="/r/AdviceAnimals">/r/AdviceAnimals</a> ...and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ...and probably many of the larger subs.</p>

<p>What I think is false is your &quot;concern&quot; about the &quot;reputation of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>&quot; - a sub devoted to laughing at the more fringe amongst conspiracists, including the ones here.</p>

I thought <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> was populated with people possessed with the capacity to reason having a laugh at those that do not, which admittedly is morally questionable at best, and expressing outrage at the paranoid racism held by the lunatic fringe (which is where I must&#39;ve assumed some moral superiority).

    <div class="md"><p>Where does <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a> &quot;proclaim themselves to be warriors of morality in their crusade against this subreddit.&quot; ?</p>

<p>I just checked their sidebar, they don&#39;t mention <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> at all.</p>

<p>Their top posts right now are FB, FB, FB, truthernews.wordpress.com, YouTube, self post about <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, self post about RT.com, therundownlive.com, sfweekly.com and ...in 10th place, a np.reddit.com link to a <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rtkc7/study_proves_vaccines_are_behind_whooping_cough/cdqrznb">single anti-vax comment</a> here.</p>

<p>They seem spread a bit thin if they are crusading against FB, YouTube, <a href="/r/Worldnews">/r/Worldnews</a>, the Russian Federal Ministry of Information and Communications, various blogs ...as well as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>All I seem from you guys is attacking BipolarBear regularly (a jew), attacking communities that expose or link to anti-semitism (conspiratard), and defending holocaust deniers (grandinquisitor, amos_quio who is a famous anti-semite from fark.com). </p>

<p>This is a common tactic used by White supremacist pretending to be Jewish.

<p>Wait so you posted bigoted comments to rustle jimmies? When Bear did that, he revealed he was an anti-semitic JIDF warrior. So I guess that means you actually hate disabled people? I like that you pretended it was a faked screenshot and now you&#39;re admitting it. You are a weasel.</p>

<p>No no he&#39;s actually Jewish. You are mistaken. </p>

<p>But you posted stuff about &quot;tards&quot; and it&#39;s all there in that screenshot, and then later deleted your comments and even admitted it. So by your logic, he&#39;s as much an anti-semite as you hate disabled people. Also, why would an anti-semite go around banning people for denying the holocaust?</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m rubber you&#39;re glue&quot; doesn&#39;t really work when you guys are defending Amos_Quito, a holocaust denier who spends all his time posting about israel, you have Grandest in your ranks, a holocaust denying neonazi, and GhostofDusty has sent me several links to random anti israeli articles trying to get a reaction.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the very definition of anti-semitic troll,s and I think it&#39;s cute that you still are trying to use peoples arguments word-for-word against them as if it isn&#39;t plainly obvious what you and the NLW are all about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dusty is on a Jihad.  r/conspiratard was created as a place to point out stupid shit people actually believe.  I don&#39;t care how balls deep into the conspiracy world you are, at least a handful of daily r/conspiracy submissions are absolutely nuts.  Some of the creators of the sub really get a kick out of either making fun of or annoying conspiracy theorist which is where the Rachel Corrie stuff comes from.  Dusty has some kind of serious fascination with her and the group of mods know this and exploit it.</p>

<p>Somehow this has morphed into everyone who either views or subscribes to the sub being &quot;paid Mossad/JIDF shills&quot; sent here by either the NWO or some other Jews to make r/conspiracy look bad.  Most of us having a sense of humor we like to joke about getting paychecks or going to the annual shilling conference, this only feeds the anger from Dusty that much more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before you dismiss my comments as conspiratard trolling, as the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> mods have done, I invite you to review my comment history and judge for yourself my capacity for reasonable, decent thinking, and my position on conspiracy theories (and theorists). I submit that if what you say is true, then the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> mods best case defense of their actions is that there is no depth to which they will not sink in order to troll the conspiratards. Whether they are extremist bigots, or merely unscrupulous trolls, by making obscene jokes  about  a Palestinian activist&#39;s gruesome and atrocious death (and possibly a deliberate murder) under the tracks of a bulldozer driven by an Israeli soldier &quot;for the lulz&quot; is obscene and utterly contemptible. That is the <em>best</em> defense that can be made them.  </p>

<p>Buy why go to such absurd, indecent lengths to troll Dusty? Trolling conspiratards doesn&#39;t take that much effort. Also why would they post those jokes in nonconspiratard subreddits like <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> and <a href="/r/offbeat">/r/offbeat</a>? Why ban me, erase my comment history in that thread, then the entire thread itself? It&#39;s completely bewildering to me. I cannot think of an answer that you could give me that would redeem them from being either ideologically driven extremist  idiots, are at best just unthinking, unscrupulous extremist idiot trolls. Their actions are detestable, in my view, whatever the reason.</p>
