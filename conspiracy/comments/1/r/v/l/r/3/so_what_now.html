<p>They are probably not going to attack you by breaking down your door and killing you and raping your wife and daughter (although they may), the more probable form of attack will be taxes and legislation. So, you should try to increase income and decrease outflow esp. in the form of taxes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. My father died young and the insurance money was the only thing that kept our family afloat. But, YMMV. </p>

<p>Many employers actually take payroll tax out of your paycheck before you even see it..</p>

<p>There is a certain amount of unknowns to life. I don&#39;t think that you need to be afraid of them, but you may be killed by a drunk driver tomorrow. If you have children, you may want to provide for them even if you die. Thus, insurance. Some companies don&#39;t pay out. Those are the lies. You have to do your research. That is true.</p>

<p>Slaves in the system have to pay tax. If you do not, the IRS may come after you. The IRS is illegal. But that fact will not prevent them from taking your money and perhaps your home/freedom. The system is designed to extract money/work from the slaves. So, it behoves the slave to know how the system works.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Let us not forget why the american revolution started, &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;, plus the gun confiscation that lit the fuse to the powder keg...</p>

<p>I agree with this wholeheartedly. If you feel insignificant, the best thing you can do is get into shape. Learn survival techniques. The thinking here, at least for me, is that a huge part of the american population is obese or overweight. Whether you want to believe sugars and fats and gmos are designed to make us fat and be addictive in order to further enslave us all by making us unhealthy, or whether you believe that is unrelated to TPTB, i want to make this point clear...</p>

<p>you cant do anything if you arent healthy. </p>

<p>I quit smoking cigarettes, not because i fear cancer, but because i want to be able to run when/if i need to. Ive taken it upon myself to learn basic survival skills, and practice them regularily, not onky because i think its fun, but because when/if i need to use that knowledge, i already have it. </p>

<p>I want to make another point here, big pharma is huge.  If you havent read the time magazine articke called &quot;the bitter pill&quot; id recommend it. Big pharma is easily one of the biggest influences in legislation. They have all the money they need to control people who have power. I believe they want americans to be unhealthy, because you cant make money off of healthy people. </p>

<p>For this single reason, the very best thing you can do is to take control of your own health, stop smoking, get into shape, stop binging on chocolates and alcohol, work out, lose weight, eat right, avoid fats and sugars, and be fiscally responsible. This is the way to relinquish the chains of enslavement that you (the OP) have pointed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well here&#39;s the thing, all those people who you are seeing as &quot;in control&quot; ARE just &quot;normal people&quot;, they aren&#39;t aliens, they are just human beings like you or me, you can do anything that they can do other than control entire markets with slush funds made out of federal credit.</p>

<p>the thing is this system can only go on reigning supreme for as long as &quot;the normal people&quot; say so and allow it to/have anything to do with supporting it and propping it up, change yourself/your own mindset and the people around you/your direct and larger community and stop being so self-centered, become more selfless and realize life could be about other things than getting your new Audi and things will become better for us all this way.</p>

<p>sooner or later with the internet the massive awakening to things other than self-oriented egotistical bullshit will have to happen, and it already is happening, wider awareness of the way the world really functions(see Katherine Austin Fitts or Karen Hudes, respectively former Secretary of HUD under Bush and senior counsel for the World Bank disclosures and their experiences) will stop people from being duped and eventually a critical mass of new awareness will occur and people will move in a different direction if they so choose - first as individuals and then as a collective which will be groups of individuals moving toward a less horrible way of life.</p>

<p>things will get better, don&#39;t worry - the &quot;conspirators&quot; are just people too, unless you think they&#39;re aliens, in which case find your inner peace and just enjoy your life for what it is - they aren&#39;t superhuman, they aren&#39;t gods, they are just &quot;us&quot;, part of our species doing their thing, the species doesn&#39;t always have to go along with them but until we reach a certain point of enlightenment they will continue going along and the elite will reign supreme over us all - it&#39;s ok though - it won&#39;t be forever, they can&#39;t stop humanity from innovating and changing and evolving organically, and the internet will be a big part of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Resist any way you know how.</p>

<p>Do not cooperate with any system that hasn&#39;t <em>earned</em> your respect. Do not get into terrible debt. Do not give any more money to the government than you have to. Feed parking meters. Tell people about 9/11. Don&#39;t talk to police. Tell other people not to talk to police. Don&#39;t buy products that support death; that means everything from McDonalds to Sodastream. Do not vote for major political parties. Preferably, <a href="http://www.jbcampbellextremismonline.com/5/post/2012/10/dont-vote.html">don&#39;t vote</a> at all. Don&#39;t watch TV (or pay for it) or listen to the radio. Locate your own media and enjoy what you choose for yourself. Don&#39;t buy an Xbone. Don&#39;t use Apple products. Encrypt your electronic communications. Purchase some firearms and lots of ammo. Train your household to use them too.</p>

<p>Every day you might notice one more method use to control people. A sign, a hint, a suggestion, an implication. Once you start seeing them, you can&#39;t really stop. So, this is important...</p>

<p>Most of all, don&#39;t let them get to you. If you spend all day worrying about it, you are already their mental slave. Don&#39;t give them the power to determine <em>how you live.</em> Living your life on your own terms is the most revolutionary act one can perform, and it&#39;s the first step for everyone to eventually organize for real change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really sounds like you and I are at about the same in sense that we both feel we have, almost, hit a wall of just realization/information overload and what, at this point, becomes the point of learning one shred more if there&#39;s not something more to do...is any of this hitting home?  I know i feel better ;)</p>

<p>What I have decided to do is develop my own blog/website/experiment (i have very little experience building websites but i am trying!!!) where I will have the &quot;free speech space&quot; to build the case to prove not only that what we all believe here is real, but provide educational and informative documents to help those who are asleep wake up and also to those that are already awake to maybe become aware of something new that they hadn&#39;t thought of or heard of before.  </p>

<p>In my opinion, if everyone who is actually doing the research created one of these sites and documented their &quot;journey&quot; through researching the new world order (or whichever little slice you&#39;d care to bite off) and by doing so on one hand (as long as you don&#39;t actually break any laws or actually do offensive material) you are simply making a website on the internet from your basement (or wherever) but on the other you are actually adding to a community of information distributors and educators on, what i believe to be, the most important topic/subject of our generation.  </p>

<p>In this generation of information overload, our so called &quot;elite overloads&quot; have no chance in hiding as long as we all stand up and stand together.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sociopaths in power look at emotion as being irrelevant, however it is indeed relevant to our understanding of the world. Popular culture and the news media promote material that is void of relevant information and thin on substance.(The economic world is inherently sociopathic) When people start to accept this they become closed off, they identify and pigeon hole themselves and others into arch types. Some people buy into this bullshit some don&#39;t. Be the atmosphere that is open to change and that can change others and you will. Be positive but tell them the negative, because in order to get the answers we all need to understand the problems. Sure they still may call you a quack or whatever but in a few years your idea&#39;s and notions become reinforced when they look at the world (if your understanding has merit)
I know people that I haven&#39;t seen seen for years, and they know I like to spar philosophically. They come up to me and tell me of their new idea&#39;s on the world, it&#39;s just the shit I told them years ago. Just smile and nod.
Also never get trapped into the left/right wing debate, it&#39;s false. People are more dynamic then that, it&#39;s just a tool to separate the common people.</p>
