    <div class="md"><p>Alot of the money and influence came from his father Joseph P. Kennedy, also they were(maybe still are) a powerful and rich family with almost all his sons going into politics (Ted, Robert, John) . He wasn&#39;t all that great during his term from what I heard, but towards when the Bay of Pigs started happening, it seems like something changed him and he began to really try to implement big changes.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and his opposing republican candidate was Nixon.... talk about easy. I heard that JFK destroyed Nixon in the debates. I&#39;m betting its because of the debates, look how big of an effect the debates have to this day.</p>

<p>PS. I forgot to mention the JFK campaign always gets flack, because they would do the same underhanded tactics that all the presidential candidates do.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that he&#39;d been introduced to LSD via Mary Pinchot Meyer, who herself was apparently closely affiliated with Timothy Leary. Seems plausible to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, having experienced the bright side of acid, I can absolutely imagine it triggering a plethora of thoughts in someone already predisposed to thinking, as I imagine JFK to have been. Unlike the more contemporary &#39;presidents&#39;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very doubtful.  Just like the final years of the HRE, the emperor is not really in charge.  This in charge do so behind the scenes.  Not drawing attention to the crimes committed against us.  Instead we blame nothing more than a puppet.

<p>Misconception. To people who watched the televised debate (First ever televised presidential debate) Kennedy was the clear winner. However when people who listened to the debate on the radio were polled they incredibly ranked Nixon as the overwhelming victor of the debate. Shows how much we as a people are influenced by looks. Nixon sickly and sweating vs Kennedy debonair and smiling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very hard to convince someone to do something for money when they have had enough money for there whole life.  He probably went along with all the BS the TPTB where telling him to do.  When he got elected that is when he started making enemies big time.  Almost ended Vietnam, Was going to have peace talks with Russia and end the Cold War, Printed Debt free money, was diplomatic during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Went after the Mob, Went after Castro, was a big supporter of Civil Rights movement.  TPTB chose Lee H Oswald and they would have made it a racial thing as he was from Texas; the TPTB needed cheap labor for our fellow black friends.  But for some reason Jack Ruby needed to shut Oswald up cause he talked about not killing the president.  My guess is as good as yours, but i&#39;ll put my money on the Debt free money thing.  Nothing will get you killed faster as a president than messing with Rich people pretend play money.</p>

It wasn&#39;t until he got into office, and in particular went through the Bay of Pigs fiasco and saw the country come to the brink of nuclear war that he sobered up, realized something was seriously wrong and gradually embraced a platform of peace and disarmament.</p>
