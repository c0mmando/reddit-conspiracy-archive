        An email involving a Stratfor analyst stated that it had been determined that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency knew of Osama bin-Laden's safe house.[11] Another email indicated that Stratfor Vice President Fred Burton had knowledge of the killing of bin Laden, and that the body was not dumped at sea, but rather sent to Dover Air Force Base in the United States.[12] This further fueled doubts about the US Government's account of the killings.[13]
       </p>
       <p>
        Ynetnews reported that, according to internal emails between Stratfor employees, Israel and Russia were engaged in an exchange of information in 2008. Israel gave Russia "'data link codes' for unmanned aerial vehicles that the Jewish state sold to Georgia" and that Russia gave "the codes for Tor-M1 missile defense systems that Russia sold Iran". The emails also stated that, during the 2008 South Ossetia war, Georgia "realized that their UAVs were compromised and were looking for a replacement for the Israeli made drones".[14]
       </p>
       <p>
        International Business Times reported that Stratfor had found that several Central European countries, especially the Czech Republic, have been petitioning NATO for missile defenses and F-16s to use against Russia. The Czech Republic, according to an unknown Stratfor source, has stated that, if the talks with the US fail, then it will be breaking all ties with NATO and the US in general.[15]
       </p>
       <p>
        Business Insider reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was an intelligence source for Stratfor between 2007 and 2010. In emails, Fred Burton discussed his personal communications with Netanyahu. Burton stated by email that Netanyahu informed him of his success in consolidating power within the Likud party ahead of regaining the position of prime minister, shared thoughts regarding his distrust of US President Barack Obama, threatened assassination of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah, and declared intentions to unilaterally start a war against Iran.[16]
       </p>
       <p>
        Al Akhbar, citing internal emails from the Stratfor hack, reported former Blackwater director James F. Smith had a relationship with Stratfor and was for a time considered one of their major sources. Emails appeared to show that Smith participated in the murder of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and had more recently been assigned to aid the rebellion against the government of Bashar Assad in Syria. In relation to his assignment to Syria, Smith requested an intelligence overview of the Syrian opposition from his Stratfor briefers.[17]
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 40,000 documents related with information gathering from Venezuela including the status of the army (equipment, numbers, plans) and other sensitive information were also released. Various attempts overthrowing the government of Hugo Chavez are described from sources inside Venezuela (various names are referred like Antonio Ledezma (Caracas major), Henrique Capriles (opposition leader), Leopoldo Lopez, Rafael Poleo (Media tycoon). Many papers involve CANVAS, as one of the main strategic counsel. One of the documents is titled "how to guide to revolution". [18] [19] [20]

       I think that's pretty much the most interesting thing of the ones that have been leaked thus far.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is there are
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       better ones that haven't been leaked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Re-read, and that's more of an aggregate of all the really interesting ones, I thought it was mostly about Pakistan knowing of Bin Laden's safehouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I still think there is way more juice there that hasn't made the light of day yet.

       STRATFOR might be good for the
       <em>
        next

       one, but TBH it really doesn't get more pertinent than the 50th anniversary of perhaps the greatest conspiracy of the 20th century.

        Has /r/conspiracy heard of Judyth Vary Baker? She claims to have been Lee Harvey Oswald's lover and a cancer researcher hired to develop a bio-weapon to kill Castro. If she's telling the truth then this is the story of the century.

      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1edxmh/jack_ruby_the_guy_who_killed_lee_harvey_oswald_on/">
        Jack Ruby, the guy who killed Lee Harvey Oswald on live TV, claimed that the JFK assassination "was an act of overthrowing the government" and that he had been injected with cancer cells in prison to silence him. By 1966, Ruby was dead from galloping cancer in his liver, lungs and brain.

      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1og0bc/dorothy_kilgallen_died_under_mysterious/">
        Dorothy Kilgallen died under mysterious circumstances in 1965. She started reporting on UFOs in the 50's, was extremely critical of the US government, and interviewed Jack Ruby in private, claiming to be "about to blow the JFK case sky high."

        Looking at the state of (post-9/11) America today — the perpetual War on Terror, empire building in the name of “humanitarian regime change” of democratically elected leaders in foreign countries, the Department of Homeland Security and its Transportation Security Administration goon squad, the National Defense Authorization Act and its ability to disappear American citizens suspected of terrorism without due process of law, Obamacare, the National Security Administration’s big brother surveillance state, the militarization of our police in an ever-expanding police state, the common core, the Federal Reserve’s runaway monopoly money printer and a nation hanging on the verge of economic collapse, the crackdown on food freedom. And when revolutionaries like MICHAEL HASTINGS are assassinated like MALCOM X, MLK JR, JFK, RFK, AND TUPAC, it only strengthens the flame yearning for resistance and justice.
A former insider at the World Bank, ex-Senior Counsel Karen Hudes, says the global financial system is dominated by a small group of corrupt, power-hungry figures centered around the privately owned U.S. Federal Reserve. The network has seized control of the media to cover up its crimes, too, she explained. In an interview with The New American, Hudes said that when she tried to blow the whistle on multiple problems at the World Bank, she was fired for her efforts. Now, along with a network of fellow whistleblowers, Hudes is determined to expose and end the corruption. And she is confident of success. Citing an explosive 2011 Swiss study published in the PLOS ONE journal on the “network of global corporate control,” Hudes pointed out that a small group of entities — mostly financial institutions and especially central banks — exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” she explained, adding that the “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. “They’re being allowed to do it. - See more at:

       Since we are going to start stickying posts, can we add the previously sticked one's to the side bar? I am still looking into the US Bonds stories from the last sticky.

       Jim DiEugenio's article

        Where New JFK Evidence Points
       </a>
       gives a good overview about some of the new information regarding the JFK-assassination, but there are lots of people who haven't a firm grasp on damning old information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really like the
       <em>
        50 reasons for 50 years
       </em>
       clips from Black Op Radio. I think they provide excellent summaries about various aspects of the JFK murder.

       How about the Hollywood 10? They stood up to government bullying, and suffered for it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A group of writers, producers and directors that became known as the "Hollywood 10" were cited for contempt of Congress when they refused to cooperate at hearings about alleged Communist influence in the movie industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following their appearance in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) under Representative John Parnell Thomas (R-New Jersey), the House of Representatives voted 346-17 for the citations. All were convicted and sentenced to 6-12 months in prison. The charges were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.

       I pinky-swear this is not a spam of any kind: as a long-time subscriber to this sub-reddit I've recently become crazy-hooked on Dan Carlin's
       <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hh">
        "Hardcore History" podcasts
       </a>
       .  Personally I think it's worth a week's sticky, even though it's not technically "conspiracy" based.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're wonderfully interesting history presentations, and to my mind they show how so much of what we discuss, debate, and worry about here has been discussed, debated and worried about long before our time.  Dan has a journalists knack for sniffing out the lived-experience in his subjects, and he always presents them with an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, this is just a personal recommendation.  There are literally hours of free podcasts to check out if, like me, you're interested in the history of humans living through turbulent times of transition much more dramatic than ours today.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: OH!  I forgot to mention that his "Common Sense" podcasts on topical news is actually completely in line with what most of us are following on this sub-reddit.

       edit:  search "reddit" and it's all so interesting.  They really follow the convos here.  Thanks Alex.  Before Alex's meeting with them they said this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In general, probably not worth it. In my opion Reddit is not near the
upper crust of the social sharing, RSS feed, user-generated links sites
and certainly not compatible with paid content. If you look at their
topics, it's actually quite lowbrow. We'd probably get better mileage
out of StumbleUpon or Digg, if it's something we're thinking about
pursuing. We did a test with StumbleUpon last spring (got a free coupon
at SXSW) and it performed adequately for Free Weekly distribution, if
memory serves."

       McAdams is a disingenuous establishment hack who sticks to narrative that
       <em>
        Oswald did it alone and the Warren Commission got it right
       </em>
       . I believe we shouldn't give his website too much traffic.

       about the conduct, opinions and relations of professor McAdams.

       Instead of this short summary I recommend a video lecture of Greg Burnham about NSAM 263 and NSAM 273 (see links at the bottom of this page).

       McAdams also wrote the
       <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/judyth.htm">
        "definitive" piece
       </a>
       that supposedly debunks the
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/16pbdf/has_rconspiracy_heard_of_judyth_vary_baker_she/">
        testimony of Judyth Vary Baker
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who have actually taken the time to read Judyth's book and examine her sources, it's clear that McAdams is a hack, and for that matter Vincent Bugliosi as well.

        Looking at the state of (post-9/11) America today — the perpetual War on Terror, empire building in the name of “humanitarian regime change” of democratically elected leaders in foreign countries, the Department of Homeland Security and its Transportation Security Administration goon squad, the National Defense Authorization Act and its ability to disappear American citizens suspected of terrorism without due process of law, Obamacare, the National Security Administration’s big brother surveillance state, the militarization of our police in an ever-expanding police state, the common core, the Federal Reserve’s runaway monopoly money printer and a nation hanging on the verge of economic collapse, the crackdown on food freedom. And when revolutionaries like MICHAEL HASTINGS are assassinated like MALCOM X, MLK JR, JFK, RFK, AND TUPAC, it only strengthens the flame yearning for resistance and justice.
A former insider at the World Bank, ex-Senior Counsel Karen Hudes, says the global financial system is dominated by a small group of corrupt, power-hungry figures centered around the privately owned U.S. Federal Reserve. The network has seized control of the media to cover up its crimes, too, she explained. In an interview with The New American, Hudes said that when she tried to blow the whistle on multiple problems at the World Bank, she was fired for her efforts. Now, along with a network of fellow whistleblowers, Hudes is determined to expose and end the corruption. And she is confident of success. Citing an explosive 2011 Swiss study published in the PLOS ONE journal on the “network of global corporate control,” Hudes pointed out that a small group of entities — mostly financial institutions and especially central banks — exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” she explained, adding that the “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. “They’re being allowed to do it. - See more at:
