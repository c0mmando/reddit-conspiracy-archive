<p>On the latest Bones, they tackle GMOs, conservatives, and other food additives. However the discourse there is mostly against, even with some information from Dr. Brennan on how it&#39;s not good and should be questioned. Dr. Hodgins claims to be a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; but the show has been hostile towards this group of people in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously.  Look at polls and you&#39;ll see that Americans want pretty much exactly the opposite of what entertainment tells us.  Which tells us why &quot;entertainment&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Americans would love to see some REAL reality TV.  How about something where a band of soldiers realizes what hell they are living in Iraq and decides to do something about it.  When they try to protect and defend Iraqi civilians, they find themselves at war with the top echelons of the US army.  And then Shell Oil steps into the fray....</p>

<p>Look how popular M<em>A</em>S*H was... and even then they had to target a &quot;different&quot; war (Korea vs. Vietnam) and make the whole thing into a campy comedy.  But the edge came from the &quot;war is hell&quot; background that everybody knew was true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. As people become more and more distrustful of the government, the propaganda in media seems to be in overdrive as a form of damage control. It&#39;s pretty obvious, and pathetic but still dangerous due to some people who have no knowledge of fluoride, for example, will take the information given in those series as fact and later when opposig information comes into view, it will be automatically discarded because of those &quot;tin-foil hat wearing nuts&quot; are talking about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What everyone here is failing to understand is that even if you are consciously aware of the programming being done while you are watching TV or movies, your subconscious mind does not know the difference between reality and unreality. It just accepts whatever is presented to it. If you are sleeping with the TV on, if you are walking through a store with TV blaring, if you are going about your daily life with a TV on in the background, your subconscious mind is absorbing it all and it does affect you. The signal from a TV widens the synaptic nerve endings in your brain, slowing your thought process, allowing anything to be inserted there. You all need to be aware of this and consciously reject it. Turn your TV off. Vocally object to TV&#39;s in stores and restaurants and gas station etc. Take control of your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s break down &quot;Modern Family&quot;, the show which is supposed to epitomize what a <em>normal</em> modern family should look like, shall we:</p>

<p>Old dude is a millionaire shlub who married the hottest mexican lady possible. As a single wage earner he has a mansion, cars, pool, basically whatever he wants.</p>

<p>His daughter married a shlub of her own who is the only wage earner selling houses during a housing crash. This still lets them support three kids, several cars, an a mansion. </p>

<p>His son is gay. He lives with his partner where they have had an easy and successful adoption. He is also a single wage earner which allows him to support his partner, daughter, several cars and yes... a huge mansion. </p>

<p>The entire show&#39;s existence is to belittle and insult the majority of people who are scraping by with two wage earners who live in a one bedroom apartment and take the bus. It&#39;s there to scream at them &quot;THESE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS ARE DOING SO WELL!!!!!!!! WHAT&#39;S WRONG WITH YOU!!!!!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK - 2 things come to mind.</p>

<p>There was a Nicholas Cage movie a few years back about him being a Vegas psychic who could see 7 minutes or hours or something into the future. Some terrible crime happens and the Feds try to get him to cooperate with them by using his ability to help them catch terrorists who actually hadnÂ´t done anything yet. He refuses. The final few scenes of the movie make it glaringly obvious that if he had just cooperated with whatever invasions of his private life the government had wanted, all the evil would have been avoided.</p>

<p>That was the first time I knew for sure what was up with Hollywood.</p>

<p>Second one was that movie with the girl from the Matrix and Lawrence Fishburne. They torture some poor dude for the entire movie, to the extent of injuring or torturing his wife and children in front of him, in order to get information out of him about nuclear bombs planted in US cities. Mind you they donÂ´t really want to do it, but they just know it is the right thing to do. By the end of this extremely disgusting movie we learn one thing...</p>

<p>torture really works. Unlike everything we have seen from real world exercises of this nature, for the big screen it came together perfectly. </p>

<p>It is blatantly obvious if you look for it. </p>

In other words, her support of fluoride would in no way translate to fans of the show supporting fluoride.

<p>Come on, guys, you ever think that these issues are put into the shows because the writers think they&#39;re topical?

    <div class="md"><p>A couple years ago, in June 2011, the Homeland Security Advisory Council (HSAC) released a report titled &quot;Community Resilience Task Force Recommendations&quot;. </p>

<p>From page 21:
&quot;The CRTF also believes that a robust television, print, and social media advertising campaign is needed to promote the message of individual empowerment and self-reliance, as well as infrastructure, business, community, and national resilience. Members suggest the exploration of novel opportunities to promulgate this campaign, particularly on broadcast and cable television. Television shows and movies have long been used to foster new behavioral norms&quot;. </p>

<p>The idea of individual empowerment and self-reliance are worthy attributes to pursue; however, we should be concerned with who the message is coming from and by what means it enters our conscious/subconscious thought. This example is a drop in the bucket but it&#39;s worth mentioning. </p>

<p>On the DHS website there&#39;s a list of Community Resilience Task Force members. Towards the middle of the page is the name Howard Gordon with the following description:</p>

<p>&quot;Howard Gordon is the Writer and Producer of the television series 24. Prior to 24, Mr. Gordon was an executive producer and writer for the ground-breaking series The X-Files, and also was the producer for several episodes of Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot;
(He&#39;s also the co-creator of Homeland)</p>

<p>From page 21: 
&quot;Novel Ways to Promote Resilience: Content producers of various show could embed the resilience message in the body of their shows, reaching the specific demographic of their audience. For instance, &#39;Modern Family&#39; of &#39;The Simpsons&#39; could feature one member of the family trying to convince another family member to be prepared. A younger demographic could be reached through any of the Nickelodeon or Disney series.&quot;</p>

<p>Resilience is a wonderful trait to possess but mind the method they are considering here. While your guard is down, when you expect to be mindlessly entertained in the comfort of your home, you are actually being primed for behavioral change.  Even if their intentions are good why the underhanded method of manipulation? If they are admitting this method of behavioral priming what other methods in what other mediums are being utilized that we don&#39;t know about? </p>

<p>So yes, the &quot;Powers that be&quot; are absolutely concerned with this method of social control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>man, if you&#39;re looking at a method of social control, step back and look at the whole sitcom apparatus itself, what with the ability to binge-watch for hours at a time and ignore other pertinent issues. Mentioning fluoride AT ALL would be a dumb move if they&#39;re trying to subliminally raise support for it. Better to just do another episode about catching a raccoon, go ahead with the fluoride thing anyways, and no one gives a shit.</p>

<p>And i don&#39;t think priming works the way you think it does on like actual factual issues. Forgive me for not having sources (it was a few years ago I read the relevant studies), but as far as I can recall, priming will mostly just work on a very basic emotional level. So i GUESS they could be operating with the assumption that the average viewer, when hearing about fluoridation later, will be like &quot;Oh, lol, fluoride, yah, I remember good times with fluoride. I&#39;m down with fluoride,&quot; but that&#39;s taking very many steps relying on very inconclusive data.</p>

<p>Now obviously movies and television can and do influence mindsets (fuck those who say it&#39;s &quot;just entertainment&quot;), but the sheer volume of video content that&#39;s created on a daily basis means that not all of it can be massaged by government fingers. Now I know Parks &amp; Rec is on a major network, but (call me naÃ¯ve) I don&#39;t think a show where the CENTRAL JOKE is that government bureaucracy is a dumb structure run by dumb people is itself actually a tool in the hands of whatever-government-agency-fits-here.</p>

<p>So, I repeat, let&#39;s not get distracted by the red flags in something that may be innocuous. Look at the big guns doing far worse damage - I Am Legend transforming the subversive ending into mindless jingoism, the Dark Knight justifying unlimited surveillance, Transformers basically being a 2+ hr ad for the military because you get to work with badass gadgets. That&#39;s all. Or whatever, do what you want. We&#39;re all in a matrix run by lizard people anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally hear where you&#39;re coming from. To be fair I did say this was a &quot;drop in the bucket&quot; of social control methods.  Also, I provided sources of DHS documents that specifically reference priming techniques being used in shows like &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Modern Family&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all relevant. Yes it&#39;s a &quot;small potatoes&quot; in comparison but it&#39;s a method that&#39;s used and shouldn&#39;t be ignored. It does deserve at least some attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest you look up Operation Mockingbird. And also look a lot more into the history of the DOD, CIA, FBI, etc. Look at how shows subtly put issues on both sides of the political spectrum, sometimes trying to just placate and pacify, sometimes to inform and engage. Those three letter groups have definitely, dig around and you&#39;ll see, gone so far as to rewrite lines and rearrange phrasing of things to slip propaganda into films, tv, books, and the like. That is not something to be debated at all, specifically look up the history of the Animal Farm adaption of Orwells book and how it was funded, written, and edited.</p>

<p>Now what is more likely? That there is a totally unified conspiracy controlling all governments, companies, agencies, bent on pacifying the human race to the point of being blind cattle, or, that this is simply how refined the arts of politics and governance have become in the twenty-first century?</p>
