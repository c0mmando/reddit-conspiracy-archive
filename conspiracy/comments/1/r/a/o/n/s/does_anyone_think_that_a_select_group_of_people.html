        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m curious to hear what the predominant opinion is.  I&#39;ll give mine.  </p>

<p>Things operate too smoothly for the world to work the way they say it does.  There are no real wars.  There are wars with little countries, but not between the big countries.  This is historically unprecedented.  </p>

<p>With the advent of nuclear weapons, it became so easy for us to annihilate ourselves.  One stray nuke, and countless people could die.  And yet, this hasn&#39;t happened.  </p>

<p>Trade flows freely all over the world.  There aren’t embargoes between the big powers.  </p>

<p>There have to be people at the top pulling the strings.  This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that there aren&#39;t multiple groups that control different parts of the world.  To me, it seems like there&#39;s a power that controls the west and a power that controls the East.  For now, there&#39;s a hesitant alliance between them.  Previously though, they were unaligned and hostile to each other.  </p>

<p>The easy answer is that this is simply the tension between the US/Europe and Russia/China.  But it seems too simplistic to think it&#39;s that straight forward.  I think there&#39;s a level above government.  It&#39;s the level where the richest of the rich basically act as rulers of vast swaths of land that contain multiple countries.  </p>

<p>So who are these people?  Who are the richest of the rich?  Who are the people with the money enough to secretly own chunks of the world?  </p>

<p>My suspicion is that it&#39;s the people who profit from the printing of money and the people who control the armies.  It&#39;s bankers and mercenaries.  If I had to guess, I&#39;d say there&#39;s a cabal of these people who control North America, Europe, and South America, and I think there&#39;s a cabal that controls Asia and Africa.  I don’t think we actually live in democracies.  I think it’s all a façade to appease the masses.  </p>

<p>Does anyone else agree?  Does anyone have different, but similar theories?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that this quote kinda sums up my opinion. </p>

<p>“The art of illuminism lay in enlisting dupes as well as adepts and by encouraging dreams of honest visionaries or the schemes of fanatics; By flattering the vanity of ambitious egotists; By working on unbalanced brains or by playing such passions as greed and power to make men of totally divergent aims serve the secret purpose of the sect.</p>

<p>People with money were welcomed but kept oblivious of actual secrets. The purpose is to win power and riches. To undermine secular or religious government and attain the masters of the world.”</p>

<p>Nesta Webster &quot;</p>

<p>Who or what are the &quot;Masters of the world&quot;, and who is working to attain them? It&#39;s always been my opinion that all roads lead to Rome, for many reasons. If you look at war insignia, regardless of what part of the world, a large majority of them invoke the Maltese Cross (think Knights of Malta) <a href="http://unitednationsoffilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Maltese-Cross-Spanish-Cross-1939-Luftwaffe-Black-and-White.bmp">Nazis</a>... <a href="http://www.themasonictrowel.com/articles/history/orders_files/knights_of_malta/queen_elizabeth_malta_robe.gif">British Crown</a>... <a href="http://cgi.rumormillnews.com/pix0/Amschel_Mayer_Rothschild_-_Knight_of_Malta.jpg">Our good friend Mayer Amschel Rothschild</a>...<a href="http://www.historicaldays.com/files/images/knights-templar-cross.jpg">Templar flag</a>...<a href="http://www.soviet-power.com/pictures/OBSH-52.jpg">Soviet insignia</a>...<a href="http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r184/shanti939/ebay/cross.jpg">American insignia</a>... <a href="http://www.orderstjohn.org/nazi/muss.gif">Mussolini</a>...these are just the first few examples I&#39;ve found on google images. Symbolism is a way of telling you something without having to say it. It&#39;s just very coincidental to me that these powerful historical military figures use such a symbol, which historically means allegiance to the holy see, as a decoration of honor. But that&#39;s just one reason I think it&#39;s Rome. I could probably write an entire wall about it, but I&#39;m trying to keep it short.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting.  I&#39;ve heard the argument that the Roman Empire never really died.  England was a Roman colony, and the US was English colony.  Maybe the empire just changed it&#39;s home base over the years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it died in name only. The empire is using nation states as chess pieces, building one up and using another one of it&#39;s nation states as the antagonist. They are doing this until they have the entire concept of national sovereignty eliminated and the nations become basically what states are now, in the US. Once, states had the power. Now the Federal government does. Soon, nations will be like states and the UN will be the global &quot;Federal&quot; government. It&#39;s already happening. Kerry said UN treaties trump the constitution, Leon Panetta (accused of being a Knight of Malta) says we don&#39;t need congress to go to war, Poppy Bush (Skull and Bones) said the New World Order would be under a credible UN... Once they have each nation subverted, it&#39;s going to be just like it is now with nations as states, all neutered according to the will of the IMF, World Bank, and UN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The british royalty, the black pope in the Vatican. We&#39;re led to belive the queen has no real power and most of us never heard about the black pope(Supreme general of the society of Jesus, aka. Jesuits). There&#39;s a reason for that.</p>

<p>1/3rd of the founding fathers were freemasons. With support from the people of france and the russian Tzar, they wanted to make America the land of the free. Free from the monarchy and royalties atleast. They sacreficed their brothers to fight off the royalty, but look at them now. Much of the US practically worship the queen, prince william, and various princesses. Disney made 8 movies where the princess is the hero. And if you don&#39;t worship them, well, your kids do. And when was the last time you heard an American pick up arms to fight the crown? Yet they are robbing the american people blind!</p>

<p>Research the ciry state of london, washington DC and the vatican.
Flavians and roman emperors, who wrote themselves a book called the bible where they themselves are gods. Why does the Bible tell us Jesus said the next messiah will come 40 years, and he will conquer Jerusalem and be done with the jews. Either he&#39;s a prophet who foresaw the allmighty Emperor destroying Jerusalem exactly 40 years after his death, OR... The emperor wrote the book, pointing out Jesus himself(son of god) prophesied the next son of man would be the emperor(oh really). You could have any religion you wanted, as long as you worshipped the emperor. </p>

<p>Anyways, I have no idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s the real deal. The white pope is mostly PR, the black pope is where the power lies when it comes to the vatican.</p>

<p>Also, CIA is heavily connected to what is known as &quot;Knights of malta&quot;, which was/is basicly the millitary arm of the vatican. The vatican appears to have way more power then what we&#39;ve been led to belive. We just thought they were &quot;just dumb&quot;, you know? Turns out they figured out a long time ago the world was not run by men, but by symbols. Don&#39;t kill him with the <strong>s</strong>word, convert him with the <strong>Word</strong>.</p>

<p>The infamous so-labeled elite bloodlines are all over the place, obviously. I still don&#39;t see <em>how</em> they can effectively rule the world in a manner <em>(...) that is so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.</em>--Woodrow Wilson</p>

<p>hmm perhaps they are only the instruments of it. Either willfully or under undue coercion. You know, whatever that&#39;s all that and that can secretly pulls strings as well. Perhaps it is a defective alien machine that turned skynet aeons ago. Let&#39;s see. Perhaps that thing got itself some hot quantum magic tech action going on that can read minds and remote control a brain like a demonic possession of sorts. You know, minus the hollywood&#39;s mandatory owl spinning neck and projectile vomiting theatrics. Perhaps it&#39;s the fallen angel of Revelations. hmm. Perhaps that book prophecy, a book of things to come, tells the falling of the angel in the past tense. Perhaps I don&#39;t know shit about anything and perhaps I&#39;m not making any sense whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the Cro-magnons did not die out. But they didn&#39;t remain intact either.  Look at the wolf, then look at a Chihuahua.  Modern people are becoming domesticated like the wolves were into dogs.  All non Africans descended from Cro-magnon, and now no longer resemble them because we are as useful as a puppy is compared to wolf. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I try.<br/>
It is not a pyramid, more like a cylinder. There are different elites and some have more rim, some less. But all suck diagonally from those under them via different wealth pumps. We do not see what happens in China (they are on the other side of the geometry). We do not see what happens in Africa. But everyone on top of another layer profits massively. You are on the Internet, e.g.</p>

<p>Parts are fossil fuels and other resources that they are standing on. In earlier times it was slaves or smartly managed agricultural surplus. The bankers now just have a big chunk of the top rim for themselves, but they do not control everything. There are two modes of growth in this world: The rising rim or the expanding casing. One problem though: The part where the resources come from is rusting and collapses in a generation or two.</p>

<p>When a part collapses, the whole cylinder falls and begins rolling. Nobody knows where, nobody knows in what orientation it will be propped up. </p>

<p>One of those rollings was the 30 year war and nascent capitalism. Another one was the Boxer revolution and the ensuing civil wars. Now the cylinder goes around the whole world and the rim is very high up. The fall could be devastating for all. So they try to fix every rusty patch on the cylinder. </p>

<p>This is only the metaphor. Now the task is to find out what is supporting the casing, what the patches are and how to fill the whole in the middle.</p>
