      <ul>
       <li>

       Let's pretend that they immediately knew the call originated from a phone booth (they didn't).  In your eyes, the "logical" thing to do would be to ignore the threat solely because it came from a phone booth?  That's idiotic.  YOU are the one letting your emotion get in the way of logic.

       So because someone was seen with a gun the call said, it's time for the SWAT to arrive?  Carrying a gun is legal almost everywhere in the state, but I'm sure the school has rules against it, in which case they can look into it.  This sounds similar to pre-emptive war.

       This sort of "probable cause" is so troubling...
      </p>
      <p>
       If such a call would need to be actually documented in order to incite this sort of police action, all one would need to do is place a call. If no log is actually needed to act, then you don't even have to send the junior lieutenant down to the corner to place the call, you could just say you got one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if there will be more and more anonymous tips from phone booths and burner cell phones to the point that one needs an id to place a call at all, or have a cell phone that is connected to their identity.

       Loads and loads and loads of threats are called in from phone boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do you think they would call them in from?
      </p>
      <p>
       Their home phones? Their mobile phones? Sounds like a great way to get caught straight away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work in  Local Gov building in the UK, we have had several bomb threats (all hoaxes) over the years from disgruntled constituents called in from, you guessed it, phone boxes.

       The kind the police call in from a phone booth to try and excuse their illegal and despicable search.
