    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I&#39;ve lost the desire to engage in mainstream politics, it&#39;s an intentional distraction and the corruptive forces have bet on both sides. Every so often we&#39;re given a minor social victory, but for any of them actual change is out of the question. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking about as the 50th anniversary of the American usurpation came and passed without actual acknowledgment of the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The greatest conspiracy is that exchange value or capital rules our lives and we don&#39;t know it. Read Karl Marx and you will understand why exploitation occurs, since the only way to accumulate capital, or wealth, is through exploiting wage labour. Only labour creates the surplus needed for socalled wealth creation. And the whole system, from top to bottom, is designed to reproduce the forms of wage slavery called jobs we unwillingly have to engage in everyday. If this is not political in nature, since the whole thing can only be kept going through the threat of violence (hence police and incarceration) then I don&#39;t know what is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I meant is there are alot of people here who will automatically accuse someone of being a shill JUST for disagreeing with them. It&#39;s happened to me a few times.  I believe they are out there, I don&#39;t however believe the numbers are as great as people think in this sub. But every little stupid unfounded accusation against regular people who simply disagree will in my opinion dilute the potency of the accusations against the real deals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s important to remember that people are different than you, and they <em>will</em> have different beliefs than you when it comes to politics.  Those beliefs will ultimately alter what they think about various conspiracies presented here.  Downvoting people just because they question a conspiracy theory&#39;s merit encourages bitterness, and allows people to be divided on partisan lines.  </p>

<p>If people could behave here and not attack others just because they don&#39;t agree with you, that would go a long way to solving the problem.  You can&#39;t easily divide that which isn&#39;t already divided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There hasn&#39;t been a point in America&#39;s history where it wasn&#39;t effectively ruled by rich people. But that doesn&#39;t mean that Teddy Roosevelt wasn&#39;t the president of a democracy. He was a conservationist, an isolationist that abhorred the notion of empire. </p>

<p>Even Nixon did things that were in the interest of the people before corporations knew that they could have it all. Don&#39;t let today&#39;s bastardization of ideas cloud original intention. If today&#39;s republicans are oligarchs so are the democrats. </p>

<p>The positive changes dems fight for are the bare minimum. There&#39;s no salvation in parties. If we could rearrange elections and re-educate the people conservatism would advocate bringing troops home, an end to corporate subsidies, actual small government. Liberalism would move towards European style socialism, giving people a base quality of living to pursue betterment of society.</p>

<p>A balance between those in a working democracy would be %1000 better than what we have now. Everyone has to work together to get there. I agree that todays conservative powers are tantamount to sedition, but if you engage in &quot;they&#39;re wrong, we&#39;re right! Vote democrat!&quot; Then you&#39;re being used and no real change is evident.</p>
