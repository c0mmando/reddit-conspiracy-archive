        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been on this subreddit for 3 years, 2+ of those just lurking. I have seen posts about fluoride, stuff we put on shampoo and &#39;&#39;hygiene products&#39;&#39; in general. Also, foodstuff - Monsanto and co, and of course High Fructose Corn Syrup. </p>

<p>But on rare occasions we talk about the effects of putting HFCS in all of these products. I would like to take a moment for that now, for it is a conspiracy - the companies know. They know the detrimental effects on our health. It is well known that we eat more then we used to. More specifically, we eat more carbs then ever. And with this, we eat more sugar then ever. About 150 pounds of sugar consumption each year, per person. This is equivalent of eating a kilo of sugar each week. </p>

<p>HFCS is one part fructose, one part sucrose. It found it&#39;s way in almost every product which &#39;&#39;needs&#39;&#39; sweetening. Think sauces, McDonald&#39;s burger buns, juices. </p>

<p>Alcohol (ethanol) is fermented sugar, which metabolizes in the brain. Fructose doesn&#39;t metabolize in the brain like alcohol, do it doesn&#39;t have the buzz. But the health effects of alcohol in comparison with Fructose aren&#39;t that different. Fructose is a chronic hepatoxin, it&#39;s alcohol without the buzz - but the FDA can&#39;t and won&#39;t regulate it. Hepatic fructose metabolism leads to the manifestations of the metabolic syndrome;
- Hypertension
- de novo lipogenesis, dyslipidemia, and hepatatic steatosis
- inflammation
- hepatic insulin resistance
- obesity
- CNS leptin resistance, promoting continuous consumption</p>

<p>I hope that at least one of you reading this, will be like &#39;&#39;I should stop drinking soda&#39;&#39;&#39;- yes, you defiantly should. 
I consider this a conspiracy, because the companies know. This is the main root of the world&#39;s obesity, and probably many other neurological disorders. (according to new research, Alzheimer&#39;s might be &#39;&#39;brain diabetes&#39;&#39;)</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the fat&#39;s people! All these 0% fat products, light products - BULLSHIT. I rather have 20% fat and 1% sugar then the other way around! </p>

<p>If you have any questions, shoot. I hope I presented this well enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, you are of course correct.  What people gotta realize is that regular table sugar, aka sucrose, is just as bad for you as HFCS.  Sugar dissacharides that contain fructose, or anything that contains fructose is a poison.  Watch this lecture for more information, (OP I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen it from your post).</p>

<p>What can you do about it?  First, ignore the propaganda about eating so much damn fruit as &quot;healthy&quot;.  Fruit is evolutionarily appropriate to fatten your ass up for the long winter, which is fine if food is scarce (it isn&#39;t).  Throw out your sugar and all products with sugar and if you must use sweetener, use a <em>fructose free</em> product, such as stevia, dextrose, brown rice syrup, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Have you looked at academia lately?   How many folks in academia are going to go on record with anything that the board of directors does not want to see?  How many directors are neutral?   Seriously.   Its the wild west.   Each of us is going to have to learn how to look for ourselves.   And if you follow the money you get some good clues.   Free informed citizens maximizing the quality of their lives is not the same as maximum profitability.   There is an inherent conflict,  and the government has stepped away from this conflict giving profit maximizers free and total reign,  and has clipped the wings of citizens in order to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the issue: Not all studies control for everything they should. My argument is basically &quot;scientists need to control for fluoride dosage when performing studies on salt, blood pressure, iodine, weight gain, and thyroid.&quot; </p>

<p>If you keep that in mind, you will see the pattern that I believe is blatantly obvious. That is why there are conflicting studies on these topics. Nobody is accurately calculating the actual dosage of fluoride <em>if they even calculate it to begin with for their study</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real issue is not so much HFCS as it is fat.  High animal fat is what we need for brain function, satiety, and weight loss.  The 1970s health movement we are still being taught by our governments is a complete sham built from bad data.  The opposite of what we are taught is true.  You should eat low carbohydrates, high animal fats, nothing artificial (which means almost 100% of oils sold), medium proteins, and very little sugar (in all forms: bread, drinks, candy, etc). You can either cut out vegetables altogether (you get as many vitamins from fat and meat) or eat them if you like them (low amounts of starchy veges).  You should also cut out fruit entirely unless you have old fashioned fruit trees in which case you wouldn&#39;t want to eat too much anyway because they have high flavor and low sugar (modern fruit has been bread to increase its sugar content).</p>

<p>The erradication of animal fat from our diet may well be the cause of ADHD, and other problems in young children.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<ul>
<li>Eat Lots: animal fats and meats (this includes cheeses and dairy) - unlimited amounts</li>
<li>Eat a little: carbohydrate, fruit, vegetables</li>
<li>Avoid: vegetable oils (except extra virgin olive), sugar, salads as a meal (you just get hungry), too much exercise (this &quot;builds up an appetite&quot;)</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. No additives? No hint of soja, corn, grain or rice here and there? No bulk fodder from another farm, brought with tractors? No fish enhancement?
1984 was sometime long ago. Pure grass &quot;and what comes from the land thereof&quot; fed meat costs about 30 $ per kg around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s considerably less here.  And the answer to additives is no - much of the meat I buy and eat is from animals left grazing in the mountains or hills - we don&#39;t need to bulk feed or use additives when most of the wild land is cattle food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your input, you are correct as far as I know. You are right about fat being the bigger issue over sugar. But the replacement for animal fats and fish are mostly carbs. Which are undeniably linked to the consumption of sugar. Do you not find it funny that people still think; 1 calorie in means 1 calorie has to come out. Hilarious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps I am mistaken, but I was under the impression that the caloric content of sugar and meat are measured in the same way - complete disintegration and resulting energy created.  If I am wrong please correct me.  If I am not, why do we count those two in the same manner when the body dumps a good portion of the meat as waste product whilst not doing so with refined sugar....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As detailed on the second page <a href="http://www.nutrientdataconf.org/PastConf/NDBC18/12-1_Li.pdf">here</a>, unaltered bomb calorimetry data has not been used since the early nineties. Even so, it barely matters. Although you consider bomb calorimetry to be wildly incomparable to human digestion, enthalpy is a state function. The pathway doesn&#39;t change a single thing about the values. All you need to calculate is the heat of formation of the products and the reactants. </p>

<p>Also, I am going to need some serious, serious reference on meat being passed as mostly waste, because for any human being with normal digestion, that&#39;s absolutely false. In fact, proteins and fats stay in the stomach longer for more thorough digestion, and are absorbed as single peptides or dipeptides. Absorption of nutrients in a healthy person is extremely effective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply.  I sought out data for evidence of proteins remaining in stool and discovered (to my surprise) that it is 2-4% which, as you say, is rather effective absorption.</p>

<p>I guess ultimately the important factor in eating to maintain a healthy body as naturally as possible is to simply do what we always did (prior to the government inventing the modern &quot;healthy&quot; eating diet full of carbs and fruit) - eat plenty of fresh animal products and less processed manufactured goods. </p>

<p>Edited to say: thanks for the link - it was very interesting reading.</p>

<p>So tell me again how that extra 5% (or 8% less) of fructose is damaging your body more than regular sugar.</p>

<p>While you are at it, why not explain how the body breaks down HFCS and table sugar and how they different.  (Need a hint:  there is no difference in how they are digested)</p>

<p>Because the only thing you did is saying sugar and HFCS are not much different, which I can agree on. It&#39;s merely much cheaper which [some could argue] leads to it being in more products. </p>

<p>Where, am i singling HFCS? I think it reads Fructose, doesn&#39;t it? </p>
