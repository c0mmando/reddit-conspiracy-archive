       Uhm, not so much. The university cannot demand that you give up your fourth amendment rights as a condition of residency.

       Well, you're on their property, and you signed away that right. I don't see how it's unenforceable. In much the same way, a Non-Disclosure Agreement is a waiver of your first amendment rights.

       You don't own the property though, I would guess it is similar to how a landlord can enter your apt with a written notice ahead of time. There is nothing you can legally do to stop them from entering if they give a notice.

       The dorm is not your personal property, you agreed to stay there yourself.

       Most states allow a landlord to access the domicile to inspect it provided that they provide reasonable notice and the inspections are not overly intrusive or harassing.  For example, a landlord could request you move furniture to inspect a circuit breaker, but would not be allowed to go through your drawers or refrigerator.  A landlord also cannot waive your constitutional rights and allow the police to search the property without a warrant or your consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going room to room to perform  inspections of visible areas would probably be allowed.  Checking closets and looking for drugs/alcohol/stolen things would probably not be legal though.  There are lots of lawyers at Harvard.  I'm sure they can handle this if it becomes a problem.

       Being that it's a dorm room it's my understanding that you agree to them searching the rooms anytime they want when you signup for and accept campus housing. If you lived off campus they would need a warrant like normal.

       It has a lot to do with universities not having a landlord-tenant relationship. If you are in a normal tenant-landlord relationship you do have certain renters rights and the right to privacy is one of them. Since university housing constitutes a public housing entity it is subject to inspection. Granted those "searches" are generally limited to someone walking in, glancing at all things lying in plain sight, and if nothing illegal is sitting in plain sight leaving without issue. I'm not sure how the searches were conducted by the police here, but I'm guessing it was something akin to those university "inspections" where if it can't be seen without opening drawers or closets it's none of their business. To do a through search they'd probably need a warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we hear from someone from Yale who lives in on-campus housing about how the searches were conducted?

       Generally, RA's, GA's, and LEOs are able to look anywhere that is not a closed vessel/container owned by the occupant. They can open the closet but not your guitar case or the cardboard boxes under your bed.
      </p>

       If they have a warrant, that obviously supersedes the above.

       At MIT, these are the rules:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Q: If police officers come to my dormitory or fraternity room door and demand admittance, must I let the officers in?
       </p>
       <p>
        A: If the police officers have a search warrant or an arrest warrant for a person who resides in the room, you must let them in. You have the right to read the warrant. The officers must comply with the wording of the warrant, but if they come upon other stolen property or contraband while searching, they have the right to seize it.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the officers do not have a warrant and they inform you of their business and request your permission, you have the option of giving or not giving consent.

       So I wonder - as someone who was born, raised, and went to college in New Haven - if this is for "safety," are they going to go up into the Hil, or East Rock and check houses, or just dorms? Oh, Ok.... just dorms. Got it.... Safety.

       The goal here is to make a mark on the brain of all these students that this is the new normal. It has worked. It will work again. When I went to college I found about 80% of the people there to be no different than the sheeple I grew up with. I was not a lone voice in the wilderness but definitely a minority.

       Wait let me get this straight.. you think police should not be allowed to search for a gunman? You are telling me all said gunman would have to do is run in his room and tell the police he does not consent to a search? The police would just knock on the next door? Do you really think thats how it should be? Like i am confused on how you suggest they find this person if he just like uhh locks himself in a room and pretends to be a student? Or holding some hostage or something.. What would you do?

       There was no shooter. They should get out of their SWAT gear and apologise for the disruption. You lied about there being a shooter. And you still insist on some stupid hypothetical. You have the mentality of a stupid cop.

       Um yeah if the gunman could go in a dorm why not? Remember Virgina Tech? That shooter lived in the dorms.. like i just don't get why you don't think they should sweep the dorms if they think there is a shooter.. All a shooter would have to do is go hide in a dorm and he would be home free...

       If they had evidence of such, absolutely.  A blanket search of everyone and everything? Absolutely not.  The police are not allowed to go on fishing expeditions.  Due to the unnecessary complexity of the laws,  EVERYONE is technically a criminal.

       Um.. wait so you are telling me if their is an armed man reported on Campus you do not think the police have a right to search for him without a warrant? You are telling me that all the Virgina Tech guy had to do (assuming no one ID'd him) was go back in his room and tell the police there are no intruders in his room and they would move on? Is that what you think? Its called clearing a room, its not a fucking search. I just don't understand that logic..

       Going door to door with absolutely no evidence, yes.  This acceptance will lead to countless "gunmen" as an excuse to forego any legal protections, such as the 4th Amendment.  How foolish are you to cheer your own demise.  With a flimsy excuse of because there is an alleged gunman, the police can do whatever they please.

       What 4th Amendment? They are fucking in dorms they do not have that right like are you just a moron? Does your mommy have a right to search your room? FUCK YES, you are in her house. Just like the police can search "your" room when you are living IN SCHOOL PROPERTY. No there will not be countless "gunman" as an excuse to search as anything they "see" when they "search" CANNOT be used as any evidence what-so-ever. Read that as: IF THE SWAT TEAM SEES COCAINE DURING THEIR SEARCH THEY CAN'T DO SHIT. You have no clue how things work and spend to much time on the internet.

       Going door to door with no reasonable suspicion.  Searching the interior of private spaces.  Absolutely.  The police do not have the power to search everywhere with no knowledge of where the criminal is.  Is they saw him enter the residence, they absolutely can.  Without that evidence they are, and should be limited in what they can do.

       If no one saw him enter said property, the police require a warrant to search.  Many will give up their right, however this does not remove the right.  Age has little to do with understanding liberty.  But in your case, this is apparently an issue.  In your shallow mind, the police should have the tight to tramp anywhere.  Without evidence or proof.  It simply doesn't matter.  How sad of a human being are you?

       This is a hard one, cause you are right. It is legit, just like an apartment lease says the landlord can enter whenever they need to. It's still obviously slave training. You dont need an army to find a possible gunman. One tactical team would probably work with a couple plain clothes officers scanning the areas. Just an outsiders opinion though. I'm not the guy who has to find a gunman.

       really? in NYC they have to give at least 24 hours notice, but most people uderstand that not being a dick to your landlord is usually the best way to go in life as there is nothing saying they have to resign the lease.

       Since when did one person (possibly) committing a crime deem everyone is subject to searches.  Go back in time before 9/11 and this shit would not fly.

       You're right. Lets just use every incident of a gunman on the loose as an example for you to flex your patriot muscle.

       If no one saw him enter said property, the police require a warrant to search.  Many will give up their right, however this does not remove the right.  Age has little to do with understanding liberty.  But in your case, this is apparently an issue.  In your shallow mind, the police should have the tight to tramp anywhere.  Without evidence or proof.  It simply doesn't matter.  How sad of a human being are you?
