<ol>
<li><p>President Kennedy was exhumed in 1967 to move him 100 yards.</p></li>
<li><p>There were 3 assassination attempts on Kennedys life in November; the 3rd in Chicago (thwarted by law enforcement), 18th in Tampa - Kennedy told cuban rebels that they had the US&#39; support for all out war, and the 21st-22nd. </p></li>
<li><p>On the evening of the 21st, the secret service who was protecting the hotel Kennedy stayed at and the motorcade the next day, went out on the town for drinks.</p></li>
<li><p>On the 19th of November , Dallas newspapers published a map of the presidents route.</p></li>
<li><p>November 22nd, 12:30 pm, Dealey Plaza: a shot was fired in the vicinity of the president , and the secret service has done nothing for the president. However they covered Johnson. </p></li>
<li><p>The police officer to the back left was hit with blood and brain matter. BACK AND TO THE LEFT.  not back and to the right towards Oswald</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The magic bullet is bullshit&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>Oswald was not a good shot, and did not take the shot where he should have on Houston street - coming right towards him Oswald did not act alone.</p></li>
<li><p>The governor was shot more than 3 times. </p></li>
<li><p>J. Edgar Hoover decided the case was closed the evening of the 22nd. </p></li>
<li><p>Oswald was never interrogated and was just declared guilty, and working alone on the spot. </p></li>
<li><p>&#39;Oswald&#39; missed a shot by 100 feet</p></li>
<li><p>The 2nd and 3rd shots were rapid</p></li>
<li><p>2 shots hit Kennedy, and 3 shots hit the governor, more than 4 shots had to have been fired. </p></li>
<li><p>Look into the book Best Evidence by David Lifton/Lipton</p></li>
<li><p>The FBI altered photos, and the body itself of the president.</p></li>
<li><p>The exit wound in Kennedy&#39;s head  was bigger than a human fist. </p></li>
<li><p>During the autopsy a bullet fell out of his back. Photos were altered so it would make sense. FBI agents recorded this, and sealed it away. </p></li>
<li><p>Curtis Lamagne(FBI Agent) hated Kennedy, and he wanted to watch the autopsy. He probed the back wound and said it only went in an inch. That was supposed to be the magic bullet. However that was the 4th bullet. Therefore there <em>had</em> to be at least 2 shooters.</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusion: the Warren commission was wrong. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Random fact: Kennedy and Monroe did have sexual relations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a modern cellphone -- use the AUDIO NOTES app.</p>

<p>It can record a hell of a lot longer than video -- but be warned it needs to be close to the speaker. So if you can hide your phone under the podium - in say an unmarked backpack with a pressure cooker inside, to make people think you&#39;re just into soup... that would be great.</p>

<p>(OK OK kidding about the soup....)</p>

<p>:)</p>

<p>I had an ad-hoc meeting with people at a conference (On Tavistok, no less) and the audio record feature was fantastic!!</p>

<p>Fuck his rules. Sneak one in, anytime anyone in the government/media asks to <em>not</em> record, thats a sign that you SHOULD record because theyre about to say some stuff they dont want coming back to them.</p>

<p>Bring a camera bro, use your phone if you dont have one.  If he has a Freudian slip on something, it should be captured for the world to see, rather than having it drowned in the sea of &quot;hear-say&quot; from some guy on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are quite a lot of overtly employed former CIA-officers who teach at univiersities. For at least two and a half decade the CIA has an official Officer-in-Residence program which facilitates former CIA employees to teach at universities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cia-on-campus.org/foia/oir.html">http://www.cia-on-campus.org/foia/oir.html</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how often these former officials tow the official line, but quite a lot of former CIA officers have come to very different conclusions and don&#39;t shy away to blame elements within the CIA for various crimes like the murder of JFK.</p>

<p>The CIA has also a history to covertly sponsor intellectuals. These intellectuals propagate a certain agenda in their lectures, reports, research articles and academic books. </p>
