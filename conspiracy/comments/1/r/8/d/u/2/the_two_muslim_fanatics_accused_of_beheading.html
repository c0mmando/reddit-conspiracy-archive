<p><a href="http://www.thelawpages.com/court-hearings-lists/Central-Criminal-Court.php">http://www.thelawpages.com/court-hearings-lists/Central-Criminal-Court.php</a></p>

<p>Scroll down to Court 2 where you will see the names of the two defendants - Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. </p>

<p>There have been sketchy, unattributed reports of a &quot;delay&quot; in proceedings, but it raises the possibility that the proceedings of this trial are actually taking place in secret*. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ll rephrase because what I said has been twisted. I am not saying the fact that they are in court is a state secret - I posted a link to the court website, didn&#39;t I? I am saying there is no information whatsoever in the media about what is actually happening in this trial. </p>

<p>Edit 2: For the benefit of users moparornocar and amldell who doing their best to derail this thread. A google search will bring up a number of sites which mention that this trial was due to take place this week - I am aware of that. But none of them mention any details of what has actually transpired. Why not? Has it been delayed, and if so, why? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your homeland had been under constant oppression from the west, since Alexander the Great, you might have some animosity towards white people as well. What they did was horrible, but totally justified given their perspective. Over 250,000 people have died in Afghanistan, since the occupation started; that will make a lot of people resentful towards us. These types of revenge killings are only just the start, you can&#39;t oppress a civilization for this long and expect there to be no consequences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, they are not originally from Afghanistan, they are converts to Islam! They also had a past of thuggery and radical Islam was just a justification for what they already are. Could have been triggered by soccer, could have been a bar fight or domestic violence.</p>

<p>I sympathize with the Afghani people but violence is not the answer. Education is. They should fight their own demons. Which is radical Islam, a often backwards culture and tribalisms. Their cultures has pretty horrible aspects. What they do to women and children is horrible and needs to change. And they live in the most beautiful fertile and resource rich places on Earth. So they have that going for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying. But Muslim people in general aren&#39;t heartless monsters that need our influence to teach them how to be civilized. All through the early 1900s Middle Eastern societies flourished as a beacon for the free and equality. Look at source material from the 60s, Kabul was a mecca for the hippy culture because of how free and open it was.</p>

<p>The radicalization of the people is a byproduct of western oppression. They deserve a right to be angry. I&#39;ve been to Afghanistan (on an academic trip, not as a soldier) an the everyday person hates Taliban insurgents and the radical clerics. The west uses Edward Said&#39;s concept of Orientalism as a way of framing our interpretations of Islamic people. All cultures have aspects and traditions that would seem barbaric and evil to outsiders. Demonizing an entire culture based on the actions of a few isn&#39;t a way to make something better. You said violence isn&#39;t the answer, and I couldn&#39;t agree with you anymore, but neither is the arrogance that comes with being white. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why should I? You claimed that the media wasn&#39;t reporting about the suspects appearing in court. This is clearly false. Why don&#39;t you just admit it and instead shift the goalposts by asking for something different than what you originally claimed?</p>

<p>So, for the third time, I ask: do you stand by your claim that he media wasn&#39;t reporting about the suspects appearing in court?</p>

<p>That is what you claim in your opening post. Please answer the question, a simple yes or no will suffice.</p>

<p>Your unwillingness to give a simple answer is quite telling.</p>

<p>see how the trial was postponed</p>

<p>just like the Holmes trial is postponed indefinitely.</p>

<p>almost like the cops/DAs know they will get their asses handed to them if they try to play the farce in court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because these kinds of things are a daily occurrence, within the occupied zones. If they highlight the brutality of the attack then they&#39;re highlighting how violent the war is, and they still want us to think we&#39;re over there &#39;winning the hearts and minds&#39; of the local population. It&#39;s war propaganda, by not highlighting the extreme brutality of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. No religion is good. They are all an evil idea. They may say good things, and stating that everyone should be living a certain way to reach heaven. But, humanity has not got a single good bone in the body, hence religion is evil as it came from that evil bone in the body of a human. If I could have my way, all religions would be abolished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evils of religion are inherent in humanity, not the cause themselves. I&#39;m agnostic, but the teachings of certain religions have benefits to society. We have proven time and time again that we can&#39;t act unregulated so we need a form of structure telling us how to live our lives. The evil aspects of religion, factual or not, are all constructs of humanity, not of an omnipresent being. If we embrace the love and harmony that is preached to us and exclude the extremist interpretations and the radicalization of agendas that has been created humanity would function smoothly. Saying humanity has not a single good bone is a very naive opinion. Most of us are good, selfish, but not evil. The nature of our world, the corruption, the fighting, the racism is what tarnishes humanity. I haven&#39;t given up on this world because I know there are good people in it, I&#39;ve met those people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those things have always been there, within us. We didn&#39;t get love or affection or any other good emotion or deed from a stupid book or a priest, rabbi and what not. To say we &quot;need&quot; religion to teach us these things are just as evil as killing someone on unjustified grounds. And no, I know you didn&#39;t specifically wrote &quot;religion&quot;, but it was there, between the lines. We can have laws and regulations without religion. We can be good without religion. We know wrong from right. But a religion does not. They ALL say &quot;do this, or burn in hell&quot;, &quot;do this, and get eternal peace&quot;. They justify the killing of other people from a book. How good can a book/religion be, if it makes it okay to kill someone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I didn&#39;t say &#39;we need religion&#39; I said that evil will exist regardless of if there is religion or not. Just as there is good and bad aspects of religion, there are of humanity as well. So, my point is, religion isn&#39;t the problem, our inherent nature of being a warring species is.
