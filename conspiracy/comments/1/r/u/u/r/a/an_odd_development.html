        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All of the following literally just happened a couple hours before this typing.</p>

<p>I was awoken by a helicopter circling over my neighborhood - my building in particular - and thought little of it. The thing circled for like two hours or something (I didn&#39;t keep track of time). I found out a few moments ago that the police had blocked off my whole neighborhood and no one could go in or out. One of my neighbors said that she saw riot gear cops patrolling the alley just behind where I live. I&#39;m told that the neighborhood is now &quot;re-opened.&quot;</p>

<p>At first I was pleased that the police were finally doing something productive with their time as they had caught a group of car thieves that had been working the neighborhood. Then I realized that they&#39;d taken tens of thousands of dollars to do it, inconvenienced a lot of people and used scare tactics that will encourage little kids to fear them . . . all for car thieves? Helicopters, riot cops and blocked off neighborhoods for a bunch of guys breaking into Hondas?</p>

<p>This is that boiling frog thing happening.</p>

<p>Egad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my opinion that car thieves could be taken out by less than a riot cops that have taken over a neighborhood with all the units to block off streets and a helicopter flying around for a couple hours. </p>

<p>If all of that man-power is necessary for a couple guys with a crow-bar then either A.) the cops are total pussies and need the protection because they might damage their fresh manicures or B.) the thieves are such bad asses that we have super-villains in my neighborhood and now we need over-whelming response involving teams of riot cops cordoning off the streets to protect me from super-thugs capable of mass destruction. </p>

<p>In either case something is amiss from my point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, even with some priors that still seems like overkill. Unless they were like wanted for murder or were pretty violent in the past and known to have guns. </p>

<p>Thats really the only scenario I could think that large of a response is needed. But, I highly doubt these couple car thieves fit in to that at all, or anywhere close.</p>

<p>Kind of off topic, but I usually listen to my city police scanner before falling asleep. One night some kid was riding around on a bicycle slashing tires. They sent the police helicopter after him. I thought it was pretty overkill, but at the same time I was thinking if its in the air just doing nothing, why not. (Not saying thats how I feel about your scenario, just thought id share my police overkill story)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sort of feel as though I&#39;m becoming so distrustful that pretty much anything they do is seen by me as suspicious. God forbid an actual crime happens to me. I wouldn&#39;t know if I want to go to the police or not. I now regard them as such tools that I want nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>My cynicism is borderline out of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve kind of come to that same reaction. It&#39;s hard to have that trust with everything that has happened. </p>

<p>It would depend on the crime to me honestly. My house was broken in to last year and they got our TV, and some money. I didn&#39;t even call the cops, all they would have done was take some notes and report it in the system. Isn&#39;t worth the headache of dealing with cops to see no outcome. </p>

<p>Below the Santa Monica mountains and above LAX.</p>

<p>Essentially this event told me that they&#39;re capable of allocating resources for whatever they want where ever they want. It shouldn&#39;t be surprising, it&#39;s just that when you actualy see it up close you suddenly realize that the people in control can do what they like and if they want to they&#39;ll take you and kill you. All of that man-power could&#39;ve been used for a dissident. Think of Waco Texas. Now think of a parred down version in a major city. </p>
