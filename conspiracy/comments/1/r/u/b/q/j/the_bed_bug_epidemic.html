       TL;DR - Bedbugs are annoying little blood-sucking shits.  However they're just bugs, FFS.  I believe that the fear surrounding them is the real problem, and that their sudden resurgence is very concerning and likely a conspiracy designed to spread FUD and drain people of financial resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who's actually diagnosed with schizo, it's interesting to me how "normal" people here in USA are freaking out about bedbugs like it's the black plague.  Treating it as if it's time to go into quarantine-mode, as if these things are worthy of spreading mass paranoia on par with mosquitoes in third-world countries spreading malaria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bed bugs aren't likely to make you sick, perhaps if you're in the same bed with someone who has a blood-transmitted disease it might be worth worrying about exposure to blood, but it's not time to call the CDC.  On the other hand, it's quite easy to get allergies from saturating your living space with toxic chemicals that pest control companies are all too eager to sell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media starts scaring people into throwing away perfectly good clothes and furniture.  Making them paranoid about sleeping, when sleep deprivation is one of the easiest ways to induce psychosis, and one of the most common forms of psychosis is thinking that bugs are crawling on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also tied in with the children's poem about not letting bedbugs bite.  Which I'm sure most people in the demographic of those the bedbug conspiracy is targeting have conveniently planted in their sub-conscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like this is a form of financial control, an effort to scare people into losing money, so that they're more inclined to stay slaves to the corporate system, and are more easily manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy perpetrators likely want everyone to know of someone who is like one of the characters from the book/movie A Scanner Darkly; running around paranoid collecting non-existent (and/or real) bugs and standing in the shower for hours a day trying to wash them off.  Then people become unnecessarily paranoid and are easily manipulated and controlled into doing stupid stuff that makes the problem worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the sudden resurgence of bedbugs out of nowhere was a planned attack.  Intended to spread xenophobia and create yet another control mechanism to scare people into financial slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to live in a rural area near a swamp that had a mosquito infestation and recall one particularly bad summer where the bites were so bad that people in town thought I had chicken pox.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike bedbugs, mosquitos actually do spread disease.  And they can fly, while bedbugs can't.  Yet I doubt anyone is going to start going ape-shit over a mosquito bite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet a taxi driver found out that I at one point had bed bugs because she just so happened to overhear me talking to pest control.  She then turned around and dropped me back off at my origin point, refusing to take me to the destination, and getting pissed off at me for ruining her day (what about my day???) because now she "had to" fumigate the taxi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently now having ever had contact with one of these things has become equivalent to contracting a highly-contagious, lethal disease.  It seems like the propaganda machine sure is working well for the conspiracy perpetrators.  As if bedbugs are going to be directly responsible for ushering in the zombie apocalypse, and having ever been bit by one at some point is going to "turn" you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, bed bugs are annoying.  But they're just bugs.  Let's treat them as such, the way we do with cockroaches or drain flies or whatever.  Severe infestations only happen when people are uneducated and being purposefully manipulated into spreading the problem through piling on unnecessary FUD, or being dismissive about them until they become a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the perpetrator's agenda is to bring back DDT, but that shit causes all sorts of health problems, and I would rather suffer thru getting rid of a minor infestation than be getting exposed to any more harsh chemicals than are absolutely necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chemicals they're already using used to eradicate the bugs are harsh enough to where my expensive bed set sheets and some areas of my high-end mattress are now literally ripping at the seams; the chemicals seem to have actually weakened the stitching to such a degree as to cause the threads holding things together to loosen and easily come apart.  Not to mention giving me allergies on par with the bug bites.
      </p>
      <p>
       However it honestly feels like a big scam to try to milk money out of people and keep them in a state of fear.  I sleep soundly enough in spite of whatever bugs might be lurking, but what keeps me up at night is the idea that this "epidemic" is likely an intentional control mechanism to divert people's resources away from other pressing issues in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a scale of 1 to 10, bedbugs probably rank like 6 on the scale of annoyances that cause me stress in life.  I'm frankly more stressed out by other people's overreaction to the bugs; by the attempts to drain me of financial resources to deal with it, or project enough fear on me to attempt to induce a paranoid episode.
      </p>
      <p>
       I frankly think that having had psychotic breaks from the schizo where paranoia ran rampant it has given me a unique perspective on this type of crap to where I have clarity on what things are actually worthy of paranoia vs. what fears those perpetrating conspiracies like this are trying to induce in people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have actually been victimized by MK-ULTRA type crap from shadowy black ops types in the past, so when I see MK-ULTRA type experiments going on (which I believe the bedbug "epidemic" to be) I feel like I have to say something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that bedbugs aren't a big deal, but the fear surrounding them is a much larger problem then the bugs themselves are.  They aren't brown recluse spiders.  They aren't even mosquitoes.  Let's try to keep things in perspective.

       Because bed bugs will live and lay eggs in this furniture, and are really hard to clean to get rid of. Easiest way is to just throw out a couch or mattress instead of failing multiple times to rid them out of said furniture.

       i guess if you let the infestation get completely out of control that could be one way of dealing with it, but to me $12 for a plastic encasement for my mattress made a lot more sense than throwing away the mattress i paid ~$1600 for ~5 years ago and can't afford to replace.

       Yeah, it def needs to get bad. But I certainly don't think there is some conspiracy behind it to get people to buy more furniture. That is honestly one of the farther reaching theories i've seen on here.

      <p>
       perhaps i should clarify; i didn't actually believe that it had anything to do with
       <em>
        making
       </em>
       money off of it, rather i saw it as a power play to scare people into acting irrationally and being more easily manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       part of said tactic was
       <em>
        costing
       </em>
       people money; the people who could do this sort of thing make more money from indirectly feeding on people's fears and paranoias than they ever would selling furniture or pest control services.
      </p>
      <p>
       now, i wouldn't go so far as to call it a theory, more like a concern.  if the taxi driver is just being an idiot then that makes me feel a lot better than if a bunch of people here started reporting similar experiences of public hysteria, which would be more indicative of an actual conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean i knew someone who had H1N1 and that scare hardly seemed worthy of the degree of fear it generated.
      </p>
      <p>
       and i probably was just over-reacting to the taxi driver's temper tantrum, and i was cranky because i was in a lot of physical pain yesterday and my sheets tore at the seam (as has part of my mattress) so i wasn't sure if the pain i was experiencing may have had something to do with the chemical treatment of the mattress, if that's what caused the threading to start to deteriorate for no apparent reason.  i mean my mattress is like 5 or 6 years old (bought brand new) and has a 20 year warranty, and i never had any problems with threading on my mattress or sheets until they sprayed for bugs and fumigated my apartment.
      </p>
      <p>
       seeing as i'm somewhat sensitive to subtle environmental changes, it didn't seem like a big stretch to consider that the chemical treatments played a role in feeling bad physically.  which kind of pissed me off.  and then knowing that bedbugs are just some children's rhyme and then actual critters suddenly pop up out of nowhere to be an "epidemic", combined with the idea that sleep deprivation causes hallucinations and bugs-on-skin is one of the most common hallucinations, it didn't seem like a huge stretch that someone could be purposefully trying to induce psychosis in people.
      </p>
      <p>
       so that is where i'm coming from, i've had first hands experience with the kinds of people who would easily be capable of such things.  sadly it's human nature to manipulate and control others to gain power over them, and this seemed a bit too weird to me to be some random coincidence.

       Lol. You lost me at bed bug conspiracy. They're just bugs as you Said.  I had an infestation once. I changed my sheets, went Rambo on any and all bugs in my bed and surrounding area and washed everything else.  I was at that time a single very slobbish man but with a little cleanliness and effort I got rid of the infestation without chemicals.  PS.  Nice rant.

       Well I'm not a slob; I'm very clean.  I'm just living in a cheap apartment building because I'm more committed to the idea of freedom than I am to the idea of working a day job to afford a higher standard of living.

       The

       I've seen plenty of evidence that people in power are quick to find ways to siphon money out of others.  I've seen a lot of evidence that the media is quick to turn molehills into mountains and scare people into thinking things in the world are a lot worse than they really are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe i'm overreacting but it does concern me when people like that taxi driver start freaking out over what amounts to an annoyance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then I also think it's stupid for people to rack up credit card debt and to work second jobs to buy material junk they don't really need and don't have time to enjoy because they're too busy working, but that's just me.

       As for all the other people "keeping up with the Jones's" ...
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       don't need to be like them!  IMO too many people are rushing to get somewhere 'other' than where they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       ... hoping to 'find happiness' externally, when
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       we do,
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       we 'feel' are from our thoughts ... that's why people are 'put to sleep' for operations, if you don't know about it, you can't
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       about it, and if you can't 'think' about it, well, you will never 'feel' anything about 'it'!
      </p>
      <p>
       Matey, I don't know how severe your schiz is, but at the end of the day, it's
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       who decide "how to think" ...sadly many people have been 'taught' badly, given the 'wrong' data as children e.g told to "believe" in things like god, santa et al ... which carries into their delusional adulthood,
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       they aren't aware of their 'madness'
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I have a simple life, and try hard to
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       think what I
       <em>
        choose
       </em>
       to think ... it's not easy
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       bit by bit it gets easier, until one day something shit happens
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       you
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       freak out/worry/panic/cry .. no, you
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       and then choose what you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to think!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think sad things you'll be sad, but if you can think of 'happy' or even neutral things, you'll be ok
      </p>
      <p>
       the easiest way I found to do this, was by 'giving it away' ... I believe you 'get what you give, just not necesarily where you gave it' ... so (it sounds cliche, but is the simplest way to put it) "be the change you want to see in the world" .... and remember, all you
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       is, enough to eat, somewhere to sleep, and someone to talk with, in a satisfying way. You don't need to 'please'
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       else, and you
       <em>
        cant
       </em>
       live up to other people's expectations, shit it's hard enough to live up to your own!
      </p>
      <p>
       just keep yourself happy and remember, "the 2 things you can give away and never lose, are what you know and how you feel' ... if you are happy you can make others happy, but misery loves company and will drag you down, just as a miserable you, will drag others down ... try not to do this!
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep practicing, it's worth it .... took me 40+years, but these days I'm stress free 98% of the time!
      </p>
      <p>
       sorry for the weird post, it just kinda took on a life of its own and grew!
      </p>
      <p>
       take it easy internet friend, pm me if you ever want to chat, if I can, I will, but don't take it personally of I dont as sometimes I dont get online to reddit for weeks, whereas other times, like now, I can spend all day here!

       But why are you scared?  I'm thinking that one can get rid of them without spending exorbitant amounts of money and exposing themselves to toxic chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know what scares me a lot more than bedbugs?  Having ulnar nerve issues that are triggering raynaud's phenomenon, which may very well be related to being exposed to these pesticides.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking that I should have just taken care of the problem myself instead of getting pest control involved.  Isolating the bed, getting dust mite covers, and steam cleaning the area probably would have plenty sufficient.

       As in why they exist in general in the USA, after being mostly eradicated here?  Probably because of the illuminati or similar shadowy group planted them.

       As to why they showed up in my apartment?  Probably because they snuck in from a neighbor's apartment.

       i'm not entirely sure what they used actually.  i think they wrote it down on the slip of paper they gave me for the first treatment, but that was a few months ago and i would have to dig it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm hoping the ulnar thing is as simple as me getting a krink in my neck from not sleeping so well for a couple days?  right now it feels like i fell on top of my left elbow with full body weight (like hitting the "funny bone"), and a couple days ago my right hand was all messed up to where my pinky and ring fingers were cold and numb, which was triggering raynaud's symptoms, so i'm not sure what the issue is but i'm hoping to get to the bottom of it soon.

       ouch that sounds very uncomfortable
      </p>
      <p>
       If you use pesticides,
       <em>
        make sure
       </em>
       it is PYRETHRIN ... which is harmless to mammals AFAIK
      </p>
      <p>
       I am quite sensitive to pesticides but not this stuff pyrethrin, and it works very well
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think any neurological issues caused by pesticides would be 'systemic', that is, your whole body would be affected, so maybe you have injured you elbow somehow without knowing ... it does happen and you'll be scratching your head trying to find 'causes' when the
       <em>
        real cause
       </em>
       you might not have noticed!
      </p>
      <p>
       Injuries of this nature often occur when you are 'warmed up' .... and they are common in atheletes who don't notice anything 'wrong' until they a least 'cool down' and even then it can sometimes take days to manifest .... however these guys usually have coaches and trainers and physiotherapists and drs on tap, and so can ask them if such a thing is happening
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope you find out what it is, I had something similar in my right arm recently, a nasty sharp, kinda shooting pain that  came and went several times over a week or so ... I would have thought I was having a heart attack if it had been in my left!  It seems to have gone now but I have no idea what caused it!

       my pillow case and the side of my bedspread, as well as one of the seams on the mattress came undone though, and the only logical explaination I can think of for that is that the chemicals being used must have weakened the stitching somehow.  and if it can do that to textile thread then it's not implausible that exposure could cause some health issue, although i only ever noticed allergies before.
      </p>
      <p>
       so you make a really good point.  i did change up my workout routine a few days ago and i did too heavy of a weight on one of my exercises so it seems like the origin could be pulling something in my back/shoulders/neck and having that pinch the nerves or something.  it's just that the issue on my left arm is what i had in my right arm for a couple days and it's it switched sides of the body.  i did these ulnar stretches i found on youtube on my right arm for a couple days and then it went away there so perhaps i should have been doing the stretches on both sides, so i'll try that next.  it doesn't help though when i'm tossing and turning trying to get to sleep.  so i hope i can heal, i'm really trying to get back to 100%, and have had more than my fair share of injuries this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes i get these sharp burning arthritis pains in my feet for about 10 or 15 seconds that are bad enough to cause me to jump out of bed in the middle of the night from excruciating pain, but it comes and goes so fast it's really hard to pinpoint the cause of that.  this only happens occasionally like every six weeks or so, and my best guess is that it's some kind of arthritis.  so i'm not really sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't think anyone's screwing with me now, but i do have some traumatic memories of being experimented on, like some MI-LABS / MK-ULTRA type crap.  i guess because i have some level of awareness that others don't that is exploitable in some way?

       i was literally put under anesthesia on 9/10/01, and it seemed really weird to me how circumstances seemed to coalesce to ensure that i was in the hospital for surgery on that particular date.  as if those involved in causing the 9/11 stuff needed me "offline" for some reason.  i mean maybe it's a coincidence that i just happened to be out on that day, but it sure doesn't feel like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       i know that two years ago i got "chipped" by some human doing a bad job of convincing me they were a "gray" alien, who implanted something in my left bicep.  i had help from a friend of a friend in a secret society i used to be in, who came by and extracted the chip from me in exchange for keeping it.  i suspect he was NSA or CIA, but he wouldn't tell me, just i felt like he was one of the "good" guys fighting the assholes who chipped me.   i was left with a huge black bruise on my entire bicep that took a good six weeks to heal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I do think it's quite possible that the various tests I have been subjected to have left me with some residual issues, like having extreme temperature sensitivity that was badly triggered by the sudden recent drop in temperature over the last week or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD is pretty wonderful but i do think those shadowy groups are monitoring people who use it.  i don't know your history and haven't read a bunch of your posts, but it's possible that the pain you experienced was related to something those guys did.  posting with that username in places like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is fairly likely to get you on someone's radar. :P
      </p>
      <p>
       i have been rather vocal lately about some disputes i've had with those secret society guys that i had a falling out with, but i honestly doubt they'd do anything to explicitly cause me problems.  and the NSA is supposed to be keeping the dangerous shadowy people off my back in exchange for some work i did for them around 3 years ago.  (had the secret society people not helped me with the chip i would have talked to them next)
      </p>
      <p>
       So i'm not prepared to think that these health issues i've been dealing with over the past couple weeks are an attack.  i think it's just life, a bit of bad luck, if it becomes chronic i'll be concerned but for now i'm just venting.  i do think that the issues could on some level be related to some of the crap that was done to me in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apologies for being so long-winded.  lately i've been venting a lot, but being in pain will do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think i also just find that talking to people helps; as schizo as i may sound in certain forum posts, i honestly don't end up with hallucinations and delusions and stuff by allowing myself to openly vent online and have people challenge me in areas where i may be falling victim to incorrect thinking, instead of just isolating myself and letting that stuff build up in my subconscious.  kind of like how a really pissed off person might choose to play a lot of violent video games to blow off steam, rather than allowing it to fester and manifest into real-world violence.

       I think you are being a tad paranoid there matey,

       The easiest way to get out of your own headspace/feelings is by changing your
       <em>
        actions
       </em>
       , by talking to people, listening to music
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       doing things ... it's amazing how quickly one's headspace/feelings can change when one's actions change

       Sitting in a chair feeling bad?  Go and wash the dishes/dog, go shopping/walking,, just DO something different, and you'd be surprised how much better things get

       i haven't actually read this book, but i did scan thru the contents and skim enough of it to where i feel like she did a fairly good job of explaining the types of experiments these shadowy types are doing.  i honestly didn't feel like reading it verbatim because it started triggering memories i'd rather forget:

       I downloaded the PDF and am looking forward to reading it. This is a most interesting post but without researching it, I think there is evidence of there being a lot of bed bugs in New York City. It's funny that you posted this, because I said something similar to my girlfriend the other day (that did not have this much intensity) when we were talking about some of her friends making a career out of running away from bed bugs. I said "but are there really bed bugs? I mean, really, are there more bed bugs or is it just a media mind control thing?" and she said like, no really, because I know some people that really have some problems. That'd be funny if the reason that the person or two she mentioned that are habitually moving to run away from bed bugs were under a delusion. I would not even be that surprised.

       well i do think that belief literally creates reality at an atomic level to some extent, the "observer" effect, like from quantum physics (if you've ever read about the "double slit" experiment).
      </p>
      <p>
       but yeah i thought that bed bugs were like, monsters under the bed, you know, just some stuff kids were scared of that parents told them didn't really exist, or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       i didn't honestly believe they were real until i saw some youtube video about it like 4 or 5 years ago.

       I would suggest you try to do that yourself. Most people are grossed out by the idea of any kind of bugs crawling all over them while they're asleep. I know I am. And I know I would want to gas the little bastards if I had an infestation, regardless of how harmful they are.

       perhaps i'm overreacting from my experience with the taxi driver, which really pissed me off.  but try reading a few things online about bedbugs and tell me that people aren't blowing it out of proportion when the forums are full of "burn all your furniture and move" mentality.

       really? i was under the impression that the whole "bugs under skin/things crawling on me" was one of the most common hallucinations/delusions out there.  the bedbug thing does seem localized to certain areas and i'd say that most people aren't even aware they exist, just once you find one biting you in the middle of the night a few google searches and suddenly the FUD starts making it seem like some huge deal.  i never thought much about it until the taxi driver incident though, because i figure that FUD is common on the net, hell reading this subreddit one can easily drum up plenty of examples of FUD.
