    <div class="md"><p>Is my current understanding pretty accurate? I&#39;m not anti-Semitic, I just need to explain my understanding somehow.</p>

<p><strong>There&#39;s a few people (mostly <em>Zionist</em> Jews) who have been in control of a lot for a while, and in 1948, they finally established Israel as their own sovereign and respected nation on the global stage. Of course, with these few Zionist Jewish individuals being in power, they want to increase their influence behind the scenes.  So, they do business with the US and heavily influence almost every aspect of life for people in America, and around the world.  In the end, from my understanding, it seems like the goal is to establish a one-world government controlled by the same Zionists who have pulled the strings for, what some believe to be, for centuries.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very wealthy Zionist Jews who owned banks and other financial institutions manipulated the British into agreeing to create a Jewish country in the Palestine, by promising them to help finance the First World War, when it appeared there was a danger of the German&#39;s winning. Google Balfour Declaration.</p>

<p>At the same time, to apply pressure to the British, who ruled Palestine during this period, the wealthy banker Jews employed other more radical Zionist Jews to commit acts of terrorism against the British. They bombed hotels and such like. This the other Jews did.</p>

<p>Funny story ... many of these terrorist Jews ended up later running Israel. Ha, ha, ha, right?</p>

<p>Once Israel was formed, the Israeli Jews immediately set about stealing land from the Palestinians, because they wanted Israel to be larger than it had been mandated to be.</p>

<p>They provoked the Arabs, and when it look as if the Arab states surrounding Israel <em>might</em> attack, the Israelis attacked first, driving back the unprepared Arabs, and -- guess what? -- they stole more Arab land! This happened several times, and in between the wars, the Israelis continued to -- guess -- that&#39;s correct! They continued to  steal Arab land, mostly from the Palestinians, who were driven out of their own villages and houses by Israeli goons, and had to watch their wells being poisoned and their olive trees being cut down, to insure that they would not try to come back to <em>their own land</em>. Oh, and I should mention that they were also <em>murdered</em> in large numbers by the Israelis. Whole towns were murdered.</p>

<p>Well, you get the general picture. It works this way. First, the Israelis provoke the Arabs to anger. Then, they wait for the Arabs to do something. It doesn&#39;t need to be much, just any minor act of defiance of Israeli&#39;s tyranny. Then, the Israelis strike at the Arabs with all the modern weapons given to them by Uncle Sam, and then they .... wait for it .... they steal more Arab land!</p>

<p>Some of the conspiracies on this sub are actually quite compelling, until you have one piece of viable evidence, no reasonable person is going to believe the world is run by the jews/illumnati/lizard people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Jimmy Carter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For the last 30 years, I have witnessed and experienced the severe restraints on any free and balanced discussion of the facts. This reluctance to criticize any policies of the Israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the American-Israel Political Action Committee and the absence of any significant contrary voices.</p>

<p>“It would be almost politically suicidal for members of Congress to espouse a balanced position between Israel and Palestine, to suggest that Israel comply with international law or to speak in defense of justice or human rights for Palestinians.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t have to believe in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to see, that the corrosive influence of the Israel-lobby threatens the integrity and independence of politicians. </p>

<p>On the surface the goals of the lobby (Iraq war, demonizing of Palestinians, Islamophobia, Iran sanctions and perhaps even war, foreign aid for Israel) are bad enough, but it gets worse if you look at what kind of politicians are groomed through this influence.</p>

<p>If only people can make a career in politics who are willing to discard their moral convictions because they want to get more campaign contributions or fear the retribution of public relations efforts, you will get a bunch crooks as leaders who are available for purchase by the highest bidder. Politicians who will look out for their personal interest and not for the interest of the nation.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t the kind of leaders you want to have in the most powerful nation of the world.</p>
