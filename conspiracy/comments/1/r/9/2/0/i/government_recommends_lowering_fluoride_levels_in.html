       People just can't accept that shit. I tell people the proof of fluoride being bad for you is undeniable and they act like I'm the aliens guy on the history channel.

      <p>
       A month ago reddit had some post "what can a person say that automaticly makes you assume they're stupid" (something like that) - one of the highest rated comments was about nay-saying fluoride. It included no fact or rhetoric, just massive upvotes. Maybe an offhanded "its good because the FDA said said so and they love me."
      </p>
      <p>
       You can post this shit a million times and people will still think you must be a stuck up rich brat if you don't drink tap water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Small groups of people have known the truth for decades. I remember some rasta dreadlocked guy in a black and white flim telling his pupils to not drink much tap water. He didn't even defend it. It was just a matter of fact reminder to them.

       The evidence that fluoride is bad is not undeniable though. Crappy sources abound, it's a common conspiracy problem, but reliable sources are inconclusive one way or another. If anything they lean towards it being a positive thing in general.

       Even if fluoride was good for you, which it isn't, its totally unacceptable to use a municipal water supply to drug people, rather the drugs are good or bad. If you want fluoride, you have that option available to you in toothpaste and other forms. If I choose to not use fluoride, well, there really is only one water supply in town... Ireland is moving to remove fluoride in their water supply. Now there is only 8 countries left that force feed drugs with the entire public water supply. Out of almost 2oo nations only 8 do this.

       Did you even read the article? It was about areas with naturally occurring fluoride, many many times over what is added to water supplies. You misconstrued the whole article. Also, It's not a drug, it's a mineral that can benefit (in measured doses, like added to water) or can harm the population (like a lot of places in China with naturally high levels, hence the research all being chinese) . Is forcing bakeries to use iodised salt drugging the population? Enough with the emotive language, look at the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do so few countries fluoridate water: look at the reasons given, don't infer them. It's extremely complicated and expensive to fluoridate water, but even more so to repair increased tooth decay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoridated water is a numbers game, if the population gets enough fluoride from natural water, tooth brushing, or other dental care, then don't waste money putting it into the water. As the general global standard of dental care increases, the need to fluoridate decreases.

       Certain sub-populations within the US receive doses equivalent to what Harvard considers detrimental to the brain. I probably get less than 1 or 2 milligrams per day, but a tea drinker who uses tap water and eats foods with excessive cryolite and sulfuryl-fluoride residues might receive 10 milligrams or more. So the real argument here is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to sacrifice the IQ of some people to save the teeth of others because some of the water that people drink happens to brush across their teeth to harden them. If you really cared about people's teeth, you would advocate something like a high fat/low sugar diet or hand out fliers about brushing your teeth. The pro-fluoride community just want to pretend that the science is on their side. The 1-4 ppm water will push some populations of people over the threshold where the fluoride starts affecting their body in other ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like a country with a chapped lip problem adding chap-stick to the water supply because some of the chap-stick ends up on their lips. This is ridiculous.

       Which sub populations? Do they have fluoride added to their water? What other sources of fluoride are contributing to their higher levels?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatives to fluoride are nowhere near as cost effective, and their effectiveness is questionable. I'm not pro fluoride, I'm anti-pseudoscience. Science is on the side of the truth, and the truth is fluoride was very effective at lowering public expenditure on dentistry, and it's utility is now falling with rising standards of living and dental care.
      </p>
      <p>
       This research is looking at far higher doses, and has so far only revealed a correlation, not a causative link between fluoride and IQ development. Nor does it thoroughly address the inadequacy of IQ has a brain development metric. I'm not advocating the fluoridation of everybodies water, I'm just trying to say it's not the apocalyptic conspiracy fluoridation is made out to be 99 percent of the time by people against it.

       Here is Israel's stance on the issue: In 2013 the new Minister of Health Yael German has signed a new regulation setting water quality and not requiring fluoridation, that will take effect in the following year. She has insisted that it was better to provide fluoride in other ways to “target audiences” such as poor children, who were unlikely to brush their teeth regularly with fluoride toothpaste. “It must be known to you that fluoridation can cause harm to the health of the chronically ill and pregnant women,” German wrote in the letter. She argued that only 2% of water is used for drinking by the population, with the rest used for dishwashing, bathing, industry and other uses."

       Now add all of the links together. A guy who drinks tea made with fluoridated water and eats raisins, dill pickles, a few pills, 8 glasses of 4ppm water, and finishes the day off with two glasses of wine is getting a dose of fluoride much higher than recommended. All of this has been measured. Some people are getting between 5-10 mg per day of fluoride which is a prescription dose. You think some people should be getting a prescription dose for their thyroid so that a few kids can have hard teeth?

      <p>
       I think you're in denial. Somebody a long time ago said the fluoride people are pseudo-scientific, so you're just going to stick to that. You think the poisonings don't matter and the people getting prescription doses of fluoride don't matter because a few kids can have nice teeth.

       I have never once said it's for a few kids to have nice teeth. That is a straw man argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, you did give me the sub populations, and it shot your argument: they had nothing to do with water fluoridation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You argue that a man who does all those things will be receiving a "prescription dose" of fluoride, but what does that mean? Is that the threshold for harm? Because according to all the literature, there is nothing to indicate it will do anything to him at all.
      </p>

       (The following is from wikipedia)
Pseudoscience is a claim, belief, or practice which is presented as scientific, but does not adhere to a valid scientific method, lacks supporting evidence or plausibility, cannot be reliably tested, or otherwise lacks scientific status.
      </p>
      <p>
       This perfectly matches your condemnation of the fluoridation of water. You have not presented any evidence or facts that demonstrates that the fluoridation of water will cause harm, anything you have presented has either been supportive of fluoridated water not being harmful, inconclusive, or irrelevant. It is therefore unscientific to conclude that it is harmful. That is pseudoscience.

       ABSTRACT: Prolonged administration of a daily dose of 5-10 mg. of fluoride to patients with hyperthyroidism may cause clinical improvement together with a significant fall in the level of plasma protein-bound iodine and a reduction in the basal metabolic rate. Studies with radioactive fluorine failed to demonstrate any important accumulation of fluorine within the thyroid in vivo. Thyroidal, blood and urinary radioiodine studies suggest that fluorine inhibits the thyroid iodide-concentrating mechanism. Fluorine does not impair the capacity of the gland to synthesize thyroid hormone when there is an abundance of iodide in the blood. However, inhibition of the thyroidal concentrating capacity when the total iodide pool is low will impose a critical limitation of hormonal synthesis, and may explain the therapeutic effect.

       Do you understand what that article is saying?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's saying that 5-10mg of fluorine per day over a long period of time has a positive benefit to people with hyperthyroidism. They also said multiple authors investigated the effects of fluorine on the thyroid, and couldn't find any activity. Hyperactive thyroids are far more sensitive than normally functioning thyroids, and so that is why they tested fluorines impact on hyperactive ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       No where in the article does it say that 5-10mg of fluorine is harmful to anybody. The article actually states in multiple places that no toxicity was observed at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, even then, the sample size is very small, so it's not a fantastic bit of research anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, the article does not say what you think it does, if anything it states that fluoride is of benefit, and even then it was a very short and inconclusive study.

       My argument was never that we should add fluoride to areas that are already getting enough to prevent cavities, just that fluoride has traditionally been used in a cost effective way to cut down on cavities (which are a public health liability) in populations who were not getting enough.

      <p>
       Fluoride's use as a medication is irrelevant, it's an emotive term that adds nothing to your logical arguments.

       Is it ethical to do this? My argument is that yes, it is ethical for the majority of it's implementations, as it has reduced public and private expenditure on a dental problems, and has therefore improved quality of life in the population.

       So that's your whole point? That fluoride has effects beyond that of dental protection? Because I agree, it does, and I told you it does. It helps people with hyperthyroidism. But just because it influences very sensitive thyroids (in a positive way), doesn't mean it causes harm, and isn't cause to believe it will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've refuted nearly every one of your points, and you have not refuted a single one of mine. My points stand: Fluoride at low levels in our drinking water has reduced the cost of dental procedures and improved quality of life around the world. It's importance and benefit is being diminished by improving dental standards, and so the recommended levels are falling.

        Fluoride in paroxetine is not like the fluoride in water. The fluoride in water is a salt, meaning that the fluorine has stolen an electron from a metal nearby, and they form large crystal structures due to charge attraction. The fluorine in paroxetine is bound to a carbon, meaning they are merely sharing an electron, and this sharing of the electron causes the fluorine to stay with the carbon chain, and thus fluoride salts and alkyl fluorides to have completely different properties. I do not believe paroxetine is dangerous because of the fluorine, as it is akin to saying tryptophan is harmful because it contains a benzene ring. That however, is not to say it isn't dangerous, but frankly, despite the generally negative mood changes, I have never noticed cognitive deficits in its users.

       Good point but as far as I know nutmeg does not leave a residual effect in your body long after you have consumed it. Fluoride stays in your body for a very long time.

       From what I understand this is the really big issue with fluoride; IIRC the health and safety tests on fluoride content in water (and maybe toothpaste?) didn't fully acknowledge the potential long term effects from constant buildup.

       Maybe, although I'm not sure the majority would have perfectly healthy teeth if left to their own devices. The most malicious intent of the industry that I would readily call out is their strong reluctance to admit flaws in their original safety tests.

       This, it's the nature of poison to break down the system over time. Maybe fluoride by itself is manageable for the body to combat it's toxic effects. But when you start adding in all of the other toxins we are adding to our food, air and what ever else looks profitable. It starts to take it's toll on the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how you see black widows "crazy women" often kill their victims by slowly poisoning them. I'm not saying they intentionally trying to kill us, I just don't think some people care that much if they can make a profit from it.

       My comment is in response to someone else's that is basically claiming that fluoride has no purpose in the water supply - it's "so dumb." Before coming to that conclusion one should have a good background in chemistry/toxicology and should actually have legitimate reputable evidence showing such a claim.

       That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. The scientists and doctors are the ones telling us fluoride is bad to consume. It's the uneducated politicians that decided to medicate the water supply with it, based on 50 year old science!

       I agree, the commenter was uninformed. What I would ask you to consider in your future dealings with the misinformed and uninformed people of reddit is to briefly provide some of the vital info they lack. 
With the right tone, you'll find many are willing to learn. With the wrong tone, ignorance will flourish.

       Well from what I understand, the chemicals in drinking water were tested to see if there's was any serious risk, but now there's reason to believe those tests weren't thorough enough. So at the time these decisions were made, it seemed really far from poison. It has certainly proved slow and difficult to amend those mistakes, though.

       I'm not trying to make a point. I thought water was fluoridated to clean it, so I just don't know how water is treated. I'm from Louisiana where the fluoride levels are fairly low, so I haven't really been concerned with this issue.

       Yes, filters and chlorine are what is preliminary used to purify water prior to introduction into the public supply.  You thought that fluoride was used for purification?  I am honestly shocked that this belief is out there.  Fluoride is highly dangerous.  Drugs should
       <strong>
        NEVER
       </strong>
       be forced upon everyone without their consent.  If fluoride is so important, provide individual prescriptions for topical (clearly note that this is the
       <strong>
        ONLY
       </strong>
       beneficial method of treatment to tooth health, not by drinking it).  It is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       right that a person that drinks more water eàch day, or someone who weights less (skinny, children, babies) should not dicate the relative dose of fluoride poison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also do not let this slip through your mimd - the fluoride used primarily in the US is not medical issue fluoride.  It is a crude industrial waste product.  I've removed it from my diet, as much as humanly possible, and much difference has been noticed.  No third party drinks, fruit safety, short showers, and exclusive distilled water consumption.  The price is not much.  $20/month.

       Oh, okay. I knew it was dangerous I just always thought it was an outdated necessity, a bit akin to asbestos. As far as the false belief, we may be a bit out of the loop in Louisiana; I think we fall in the bottom 10 states for fluoride levels so the water isn't everybody's prime concern. That's not to say nobody here has a correct understanding, but it may have something to do with this particular fluoride justification.

       Dig a little deeper on your own. You will be shocked at what has been forced upon much of the developed world. All in the name of oral health, although the risk hardly justify the minimal benefits.  I've re!moved it altogether in my diet and positive changes were noticed after the third month.  Even if its not in your water supply, many other drinks and foods have it present.  Good luck in your quest for truth.

       Fluoride is not so easily avoided. It absorbs more readily through the skin then the gut, so you get a much bigger dose taking a shower then drinking it. And of course it's only good for your teeth when it comes in direct contact with the that tooth. But in my book every little bit you cut back on will help.

       If im not mistaken everything contains fluoride, tap,bottled,osmos,
spring.  Its natural as well, included in water. Almost impossible. 
There is a steam version of water, they sell some with added 
minerals, so you dont get hurt I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Distilled is actually made for machines for a reason. 
When a human drinks, it moochs off minerals and other
important sources from your organs, causing organ failure. 
At my university hospital, we had patients who were using distilled
water, in very poor health due to it.

       You are mistaken. Distilled is not the only type of water that is fluoride free or virtually fluoride free. If you chose distilled water, you could add minerals yourself. They are very inexpensive. For me, I usually add a lemon, or a few blueberries, or a bit of cocoa powder and cinnamon, or make the various teas that don't come from fluoride sponge plants. Also I take multi minerals.

       Consuming fluorinated pharmaceuticals is new. Spraying fluorinated pesticides and cryolite on crops is new. Fumigating food warehouses with sulfuryl fluoride is new. Adding hydrofluorosilicic acid to drinking water is new. I'm just attempting to consume food and water as it was intended. The distillation is one of the only ways to remove fluoride, so I have to add extra minerals to my diet to even things out.

       I first started researching fluoride after my dermatologist suggested switching to a herbal toothpaste to see if this had any effect on my skin problems. My perioral dermatitis (which I thought was acne for 25 years) cleared up immediately. I now only drink water that has been cleared of fluoride via reverse osmosis and have noticed a big difference, not only with my beautifully clear skin, but with my cognitive power..  I cannot believe that "advanced" western countries would allow this poison in our water supplies for so long :(

       I bought a Berkey filter about 6 months ago and I really feel like I am starting to think more clearly and understand concepts that were difficult before. Even if there were benefits from ingesting it, it's insane to deliver it to the masses and not regulate a dose. Doctors would never recommend the same dose of something for every patient without knowing anything about them.

       Im glad to know that the issue of fluoride being dangerous was brought up in my city a few years back and it was voted unanimously to discontinue fluoridation of city water in not just my city but the entire state. It seems to me it was some form of mind control. It stifles your will to fight back.

       I've been attempting to locate a specific chart that shows all major bottled water with fluoride content, but it's proving very difficult. Anyway, there are other charts online. It varries. Some waters labeled "purified" are simply bottled municipal water. Some are "spring water" that come from areas with a high background sodium fluoride problem. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your tap water, if in the US, is probably fluoridated. It's quite easy to look up the data (I'll help if needed, but I don't recommend telling me your specific city). I think around 97 percent of Europe
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       fluoridate, and something like 70 percent of the US does.

       It depends on the bottled water.  Many bottle water manufacturers simply use municipal tap water &amp; then bottle it &amp; charge 10X as much.  Some bottle water advertise having Fluoride removed, which might be good except then you also have to be concerned about the plastic the water is sitting inside.

       This is why, for example, the Nestle CEO has said water is not a fundamental human right &amp; needs a price tag.  The corporations have taken over our public water supply &amp; just do what they want to it &amp; make us pay for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, i do not personally trust any of it &amp; prefer to mechanically separate my water from anything that might be in it.  That is why I bought a distiller, which is the only way to truly ensure the majority of the bad stuff is taken out.  After water is distilled, it should not conduct electricity &amp; be a reactive molecule - Pure H20.

       Apparently, even though ~70% of the water in my state is fluoridated, most of the water supplies around me come up as unfluoridated on the CDC directory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone tried confirming the CDC data by doing a water quality test on their tap water?

       For a serious answer- there's multiple agendas in the scientific and governmental arena. Some people might legitimately want to save lives, although drugging us is clearly an insane solution.

       For a half serious answer- perhaps the populations of people who commit suicide would perform well as wage slaves if high on lithium.

       No public water in the greater nyc region has Floride, maybe some rural areas not on the main water tunnel. I've been working on projects installing the new water system for nyc for 8 years now. I've been in the distribution networks, bid on the control systems that monitor water quality. I would be the one working on the Floride system. I've installed 100 chlorine systems around here though.

       Dig a little deeper on your own. You will be shocked at what has been forced upon much of the developed world. All in the name of oral health, although the risk hardly justify the minimal benefits.  I've re!moved it altogether in my diet and positive changes were noticed after the third month.  Even if its not in your water supply, many other drinks and foods have it present.  Good luck in your quest for truth.

       The evidence that fluoride is bad is not undeniable though. Crappy sources abound, it's a common conspiracy problem, but reliable sources are inconclusive one way or another. If anything they lean towards it being a positive thing in general.

       Which sub populations? Do they have fluoride added to their water? What other sources of fluoride are contributing to their higher levels?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatives to fluoride are nowhere near as cost effective, and their effectiveness is questionable. I'm not pro fluoride, I'm anti-pseudoscience. Science is on the side of the truth, and the truth is fluoride was very effective at lowering public expenditure on dentistry, and it's utility is now falling with rising standards of living and dental care.
      </p>
      <p>
       This research is looking at far higher doses, and has so far only revealed a correlation, not a causative link between fluoride and IQ development. Nor does it thoroughly address the inadequacy of IQ has a brain development metric. I'm not advocating the fluoridation of everybodies water, I'm just trying to say it's not the apocalyptic conspiracy fluoridation is made out to be 99 percent of the time by people against it.
