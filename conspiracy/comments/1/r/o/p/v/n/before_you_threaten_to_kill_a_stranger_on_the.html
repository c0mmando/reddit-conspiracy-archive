       It's a pretty racist/ignorant thing to say in an intellectual subreddit and the mod is Jewish. For the record people make a big deal about the holocaust because it was systematic genocide of civilians, not dead soldiers. I find is shocking so many people jumped on the band wagon against this guy... research things people, especially on this subreddit.

       very clear to see that the post was saying that the only ones that get attention from the civilian deaths of WWII are the Jews, I can see in no way that
       <a href="/u/amos_quito">
        /u/amos_quito

       was denying that anything has happened.

       what if

       is Russian? and had lost ancestors in that war?
      </p>
      <p>
       would not a Romani or a Russian or an African have the same right to lament their loss and have it to be equal to the loss suffered by the Jews?

       nothing racist I can see. seems like a legitimate question.

       You do, very much so apparently. When someone points out that a certain group gets the majority of the attention you flip the fuck out and defame him as a racist who is belittling mass murder.

       I'm pointing out every death shouldn't go unnoticed. When a subreddit of what I wish was a more like mined group of people trying to uncover the truth of the man behind the curtain begin issuing death threats to a mod because some Israel obsessed weirdo gets banned from
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       ... That's where I come in to show you the other side of the argument. I agree that it's not a great reason to ban someone but I doubt it's the fucking illuminati. Front page threads like this are what discredit this sub. Plain and simple. People will look into this and deduce that we are witch hunting idiots no worse then the Boston bomber "forensic scientists" of late. I am pointing out that if you say subversive stuff online you are bound to be censored in some way, but threatening to kill someone online makes you look like you should be wearing tin foil on your head. Not saying it was you, but some unstable fuckers (who should be ashamed and take a look at their god damn lifestyle) threatened the life of a stranger over this stupid shit. Try not to be that guy and don't upvote it to the front page

       I just am showing the other side of the story, it's disturbing how many people will take a little info from one source and run with it. I have been on the other side of online harassment and it's not okay. Expecially when the only thing at stake is one screen names inability to get pretend meaningless karma points for comments in two subreddits. Oh no but what about his freedom of speech? How can he spread uninspired biased anti israeli sentiments? By taking 90 seconds to make a new account? What a inconvience!

       being Jewish is not a religion, as many Jews are atheists. and like wise was not the Romani treated worse? they were killed on contact.

       if it was religion then one would have an argument about the other religions that were targeted.

       the Nazi's tried to kill a lot of impure races, all the deaths and persecution of the impures are equal. it was hate and now if you speak out about how the systematic murder of anyone is wrong in WWII without saying that the Jews deaths are superior to the Romani deaths, or the Russian deaths.
      </p>

       the Nazi's wanted to cleanse the earth of anyone that was not Aryan. they hated everyone not Aryan. but the Jews have a higher claim to loss than anyone else, why is that?

       First of all being Jewish is a religious and cultural identity, not a race or a nationality since Jews come from all over the world. There are no Jewish atheists, just atheists that maybe were raised Jewish. I never said they were superior (what a weird way to say that anyway) just that it was particularly horrible to Jews, and that is why it is talked about more.

       I'm glad you didn't say "sytematic genocide of a race" the majority the unfortunate jewish deaths were european, ashkenazi converts from way back and not Sephardic, Semitic Jews. would be no different than saying the millions mostly catholic, Russians who were killed in WWII, was a genocide, but then again i think Russians are slavic in origin so maybe it was. here is a list of other atrocities...

      </p>
      <p>
       The German scholar Hellmuth Auerbach puts the death toll in the Hitler era at 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and 7 million other victims of the Nazis.[64] Dieter Pohl puts the total number of victims of the Nazi era at between 12 and 14 million persons, including 5.6–5.7 million Jews.[65]
      </p>
      <pre><code>Roma Most estimates of Roma (Gypsies) victims range from 130,000 to 500,000.[60][66][67] Ian Hancock, Director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, has argued in favour of a higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000 Roma dead.[68] Hancock writes that, proportionately, the death toll equaled "and almost certainly exceed[ed], that of Jewish victims".[69] In a 2010 publication, Ian Hancock stated that he agrees with the view that the number of Romanis killed has been underestimated as a result of being grouped with others in Nazi records under headings such as "remainder to be liquidated", "hangers-on" and "partisans".[70]

Handicapped persons: 200,000 to 250,000 handicapped persons were killed.[71] A 2003 report by the German Federal Archive put the total murdered during the Action T4 and Action 14f13 programs at 200,000.[72][73]

Prisoners of War: POW deaths in Nazi captivity totaled 3.1 million [74] including 2.6 to 3 million Soviet prisoners of war.[75]

Ethnic Poles: 1.8 to 1.9 million ethnic Polish civilians were victims during the German occupation (see Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles).[76]

Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians: According to Nazi ideology, Slavs were useless sub-humans. As such, their leaders, the Soviet elite, were to be killed and the remainder of the population enslaved or expelled further eastward. As a result of these racist fantasies, millions of civilians in the Soviet Union were deliberately killed, starved, or worked to death.[77] The Cambridge History of Russia puts overall civilian deaths in the Nazi occupied USSR at 13.7 million persons including 2 million Jews. There were an additional 2.6 million deaths in the interior regions of the Soviet Union.

       Do you want to know why people make a mockery of the Holocaust? Because there have been so many which have been systematically ignored just as much as this one is waved in your face. Not only that, but Jewish people have the gift of white privilege, meanwhile every brown country or person who talks about how their land and people were killed is looked at like, "Oh, stop blaming whitey."
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget: all of these wars are to separate people. Jewish people separate themselves from Palestinians while at the same time killing them and creating massive propaganda against them in the US and abroad. The European standard of beauty is held so loftily in other countries (and here) people have no appreciation for what a true example of their race/ethnicity looks like.
      </p>

       Get the fuck off the holocaust.

       No one mocks 6 million dead people. They mock the story and how that number came about. Notice no one cares about all the Russians killed, or the Italians, or Chinese, or the Native American Genocide the whites pulled over in the States (before they were) but hey, J00Z!!! Care more because they believe in a certain book! Ignore all the dead Palestinians, they're all terrorists anyway (because they're that flavor of brown or muslim, you're pick)! The Jews are the eternal victim! Why can't they just live happily?!

       Thought about it and I don't think anyone doesn't care about the deaths of those people. I hate hearing about any death from war, I don't support any military intervention of any sort anywhere ever. But I don't suggest people care less about a certain type of person because i don't like them

       Fuck you're right! All the lives lost in wars! Why are soldiers so special anymore? It's a job with benefits. But who's doing the invading? Who are soldiers fighting? Other soldiers? Are they just doing a job as well? What about the private guys that have no regulations? Civil War? WWI? WWI? Vietnam? Korea? Iraq? Kosovo? Lybia? Afghanistan? Iraq? Whom in those wars are more worthy of remembering than their foes or brothers in arms? Or everyone dying because of "conflict anywhere ever" whether soldier, contractor, or civilian?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I understand warring before the earth wasn't completely filled up but if anyone ever wants more power and land they can usually just buy it now and then populate it more rapidly than the people who live there like China is doing in Africa and elsewhere. Heavens forbid they take it by military force like they used to/sill do(?). But they do as they've always done. And it's a job to be done. Always has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is under constant attack from roving hordes anymore. But even when a kingdom built an army you know what it was to be a soldier or officer? A job with benefits. And what is that job? Send soldiers out and the soldiers kill things (people, mostly) and destroy shit. And don't forget the spoils of war! Might makes right after all, and the world's not fair, and shit suuuuucks but it's always been that way and peace would be boring. Gotta have assholes to poke and prod the masses so they don't get so complacent they stop improving themselves. The reported 6 million "jews" are just another figure on a job report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I've offended Jews AND military/governmental folks. But all lives lost through military and paramilitary means on all levels is a shitty situation that I wish people would stop engaging in. But someone will attack because... why not? Get more! Life in temporary! Do all you can! We were here first! We were here second and want it more than you do!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now how accurate is the reporting? And that's probably holocaust denial but I'm not denying a holocaust. Holocausts happen all the fucking time. What makes this holocaust special? What makes this holocaust different from every other holocaust? Yeah it happened but why is it just this one particular group is getting such attention? We've moved on from holocaust denial down to "Who the fuck cares that this group, out of the entire total of lives lost throughout that period, were Jews and why is that so god damn important?" And if they weren't even Sephardic Jews then they weren't even "real" jews anyway! They were bloody converts! Techinically you can become a jew but you're not reeeeeally a Jew but you can still give your time and money to the Synagogue, that's fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's how you get a "mockery of the death of 6 million people". It's not that they lack empathy, they just have enough to cover the rest of the slaughtered masses and not cherry pick a specific group. But hey, everyone still talks about Christians in the Roman Colosseum and black people being slaves in america like it's the only place that's ever happened and isn't still ACTIVELY HAPPENING TODAY.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR: Talkin' on Jew's bein' special and Warriors throughout time. Because a good cathartic rant makes ya feel better.

       For the record, I think we need to stop all the holocausts. People are getting murdered everywhere and have been for generations. For anyone to tote one genocide over another is the height of insanity to me and to think that people do not even consider the ramifications of such ethnic cleansing on
       <em>
        ALL FUCKING PEOPLE
       </em>
       instead of -- apparently -- Jewish (White) people, is astounding.

       The truth is no one really cares any more.  They just keep shouting about it, and just so.t let it go.  Game over, preyers of sympathy.  There will be no more.

       It appears that you made yet another mistake, you posted in the wrong sub. Here, let me direct you to the correct one

       I just found out about it yesterday and I have made the switch. This sub is almost as bad as
       <a href="/r/atheist">
        /r/atheist
       </a>
       . I just want to become a politian and opress as many people as possible with what life I have left after the past 24 hours in this sub.

       Yeah, the inexcusable act of war of questioning history while armed with fact.  Always an interesting prospect.  All subjects but one are publicly questionable.  Why is that?

       It's the only historical fact that's regularly questioned and lied about. Why is that? Anti-semites like yourself really.
