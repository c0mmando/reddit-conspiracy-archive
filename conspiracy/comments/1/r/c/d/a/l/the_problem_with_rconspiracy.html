    <div class="md"><p>Many people aren&#39;t here to search for the truth. This goes for both sides of the argument. There are people here with nothing else than an agenda to disrupt discussion. There are also people here that do nothing but cling onto out dated or dis-proven theories. </p>

<p>There are people here though that would love to discuss the topics openly and would actually like to see real evidence that disproves a theory. It bothers you at first that something you believed was wrong. That is human nature. You become better at accepting these things and understand that by ignoring the evidence you will never find the truth which is more important than your pride.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a problem with this sub in the way that you think. The problem is human nature and the messy business of piecing puzzles together which are actively being covered up by billions of dollars and millions of people. </p>

<p>I like having my theories challenged, but the debate here quickly devolves into name calling.</p>

<p>Most of the non &quot;truther&quot; people that come here demanding answers, contra OP&#39;s insinuation, are here to disrupt and ridicule, not seek answers.</p>

<p>Look how many people here cross post at Conspiratard which is set up <em>specifically</em> to troll this sub.  These people are not here in good faith to debate the truth of a matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a valid use of ad hominem . . . it&#39;s hard to debate someone who is ignorant.  </p>

<p>&quot;Ignorant&quot; is not necessarily a pejorative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to have a debate with someone who isn&#39;t knowledgeable about the basic facts of say a 9/11 conspiracy theory . . . and who is hostile toward the basic facts and have a preconceived idea the facts in support of the theory are wrong and &quot;crazy&quot; and refuse to learn anything about it.</p>

<p>This is a disruptive action rather than an enlightening action.  </p>

<p>I love being challenged on my conspiracy theories and will even change my opinion if presented with solid evidence or reasoning.  I don&#39;t like disruptive ignorant people that hijack discussions though.</p>

<p>&#39;This subreddit is a thinking ground&#39; Unless you aren&#39;t a <strong>truther</strong> or <strong>don&#39;t believe we live in a dictatorship</strong>. </p>

<p>The two terms that I emphasized in the previous quote are complete generalizations. I need you to show explicitly where <strong>only</strong> &quot;<em>truthers</em>&quot; and those who &quot;<em>don&#39;t believe we live in a dictatorship</em>&quot; are allowed free thought in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I do not fall under either category you listed yet I completely disagree with your claim.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll dissect that claim you stated as fact without citations even further.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t believe we live in a dictatorship.</p>

<p>Where are you referring to exactly? <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-worlds-enduring-dictators-hamad-bin-khalifa-al-than-qatar/">Are you aware that there a still countries with literal dictatorships in existence</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You made the claim as a statement so it is your burden to cite sources to prove it. Again, I find it likely that your claim will be a difficult one to prove. You have yet to do so in three replies.  </p>

<p>Also, how will citing downvoted comments prove your claim? I doubt that <strong>all</strong> of your downvoted comments were downvoted for <strong>&quot;solely not being a truther.&quot;</strong> That again is a complete generalization. You likely cannot prove that your comments were downvoted for one reason alone. How can you even prove the motive behind downvotes? Are you aware of the thought processes behind each individual downvoting you? How can you even be sure that a person downvoting you personally identifies as a &quot;truther&quot;?</p>

<p>I agree, often timez its hard to find said individuals. But they are out there. Ive met many redditors on this sub who were willing to conduct civil debates. You just have to find them amongst the ignorant folks. Its hard, but possible. </p>

<p>The easiest way is to make a claim, and back it up with sources, and invite civil discussion about it. Making generalizations only invites those who go looking for things to &quot;correct&quot;. Make it simple, and to the point, with as little generlizations as possible. When speculating on the claim, after you cite yoir source, admit that you are speculating and kindly invite other peoplez opinions on the matter. Dont make it sound like you are offering your speculations as fact..</p>

<p>These are some tips to sort out those who want to debate and those who wish to assert their &quot;intelligence&quot; (nice way of saying those who only want to argue...). Hope it helps..</p>
