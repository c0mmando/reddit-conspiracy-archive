       Most people who post here think that their 'conspiracies' aren't open to scrutiny or inspection. This sub would improve so much if, when asking for a source or further explanation, we don't downvote everyone and kill debate.

       Many people aren't here to search for the truth. This goes for both sides of the argument. There are people here with nothing else than an agenda to disrupt discussion. There are also people here that do nothing but cling onto out dated or dis-proven theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people here though that would love to discuss the topics openly and would actually like to see real evidence that disproves a theory. It bothers you at first that something you believed was wrong. That is human nature. You become better at accepting these things and understand that by ignoring the evidence you will never find the truth which is more important than your pride.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't a problem with this sub in the way that you think. The problem is human nature and the messy business of piecing puzzles together which are actively being covered up by billions of dollars and millions of people.

       Exactly.  Great comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like having my theories challenged, but the debate here quickly devolves into name calling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the non "truther" people that come here demanding answers, contra OP's insinuation, are here to disrupt and ridicule, not seek answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look how many people here cross post at Conspiratard which is set up
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       to troll this sub.  These people are not here in good faith to debate the truth of a matter.

       Yes, but often many people will have their theories question and immediately call shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be better to defend your theory regardless of if it's a troll or not.  If it becomes clear they're a troll then you move on.

       Which is what I do except I take the bait sometimes and engage even after I realize the person is a troll.  I give most the benefit of the doubt at first and even use trolls to explore a point.

       But trolls are very disruptive and we shouldn't make excuses for these Conspiratard assholes.

       I think they should be banned from here . . .  hell, their main goal is to troll and disrupt this sub and it would be nice to eliminate some of the distraction.

       Well there are people who investigated 9/11 for at least 7 years and they do not need to explain constantly everything and all the facts they know. When you get passed a treshold of adaptive expertise some facts are given in a certain group.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more appropriate playgrounds on reddit than this subredit for ignorant people who prefer somebody explains to them everything like to a five year old instead to make personal efforts and all the basic research by themselves.

       I have come to the conclusion that almost everyone who comes here as a tard troll, skeptic, or paid shill has numbers (either all or in part) in their usernames. I noticed this a few weeks ago. Start being cognizant of their usernames and the shit they ask/say and you start to notice it.

       This is a valid use of ad hominem . . . it's hard to debate someone who is ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Ignorant" is not necessarily a pejorative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to have a debate with someone who isn't knowledgeable about the basic facts of say a 9/11 conspiracy theory . . . and who is hostile toward the basic facts and have a preconceived idea the facts in support of the theory are wrong and "crazy" and refuse to learn anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a disruptive action rather than an enlightening action.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love being challenged on my conspiracy theories and will even change my opinion if presented with solid evidence or reasoning.  I don't like disruptive ignorant people that hijack discussions though.

       Because OP is making a claim that no source needs to be cited and no explanation is needed. Therefore, when I ask
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       would the pilots be Saudi/Egyptian/UAE when the 'intention' was to invade Afghan. i'm always met with downvotes and left without an explanation. This is always there excuse, just revert to ad hominem.

       I'll ask one more time, how does any of this support your claim that I originally quoted?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll quote it again with some added emphasis:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        'This subreddit is a thinking ground' Unless you aren't a
        <strong>
         truther
        </strong>
        or
        <strong>
         don't believe we live in a dictatorship
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The two terms that I emphasized in the previous quote are complete generalizations. I need you to show explicitly where
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       "
       <em>
        truthers
       </em>
       " and those who "
       <em>
        don't believe we live in a dictatorship
       </em>
       " are allowed free thought in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . I do not fall under either category you listed yet I completely disagree with your claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll dissect that claim you stated as fact without citations even further.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       You made the claim as a statement so it is your burden to cite sources to prove it. Again, I find it likely that your claim will be a difficult one to prove. You have yet to do so in three replies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how will citing downvoted comments prove your claim? I doubt that
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       of your downvoted comments were downvoted for
       <strong>
        "solely not being a truther."
       </strong>
       That again is a complete generalization. You likely cannot prove that your comments were downvoted for one reason alone. How can you even prove the motive behind downvotes? Are you aware of the thought processes behind each individual downvoting you? How can you even be sure that a person downvoting you personally identifies as a "truther"?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       This will likely be my last reply if you continue in failing to provide explicit proof of your claims.

       the problem is people like you who don't know shit but think you do thinking most of these topics are up for debate. many, indeed most, are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, if you actually do the work to learn the topic. the final resolution, the "fullstop" can and usually is up for debate but the basics of the conspiracy, or the question of is it or is it not a conspiracy, are not.

       It happens. We can complain about it (which changes nothing) or we can find the others on here dedicated to well conducted discussions/debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, often timez its hard to find said individuals. But they are out there. Ive met many redditors on this sub who were willing to conduct civil debates. You just have to find them amongst the ignorant folks. Its hard, but possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The easiest way is to make a claim, and back it up with sources, and invite civil discussion about it. Making generalizations only invites those who go looking for things to "correct". Make it simple, and to the point, with as little generlizations as possible. When speculating on the claim, after you cite yoir source, admit that you are speculating and kindly invite other peoplez opinions on the matter. Dont make it sound like you are offering your speculations as fact..
      </p>
      <p>
       These are some tips to sort out those who want to debate and those who wish to assert their "intelligence" (nice way of saying those who only want to argue...). Hope it helps..
