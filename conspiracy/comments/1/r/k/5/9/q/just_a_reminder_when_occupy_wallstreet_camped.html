       It's sad how people in america are rewarded for mindless consumerism, yet punished for activism. Remember kids it's better to spend money that you don't have on things that you don't need than to try to improve the standard of living for yourselves and those who'll come after you.

       I love you guys but this is a stupid comparison. The black friday shoppers are going to be gone by Friday afternoon. Occupy wallstreet was trying to occupy a public park for an indefinite amount of time. Not comparable.

       This is so true. They had to disperse the group in NYC for this reason. Along with 2 girls being raped by other occupiers in the middle of the night along with other acts of violence. It was turning unruly and they were completely trashing the park they were in.

       Did they also toss everyones garbage from tents into the park? Using your logic and what I saw with my own two eyes, we can only conclude that 90%+ of all the occupiers were also paid agitators.

       Occupy DC cost the american tax payer (that is you and me if you don't understand my point) over a million dollars. The park had just been remodeled to the sum of around 200,000 dollars. after the occupy movement left it had to be completely rebuilt which cost close to 900,000 dollars. the protesters Pulled the fixtures out of the walls in the bathrooms. Why would some one do that? They kicked the heads off the sprinklers destroyed the street lamps, the grass and other landscaping it was a total mess and because they refused to get a permit there was no way of knowing how much damage was going to be done and how to plan they just had to wait it out. permits are not there to abridge your right to protest they are there to help the people who have to clean up these assholes mess. I don't have a problem with protesting but these people didn't know what the hell they were doing and ended up making us all look bad. You have to get middle america on your side if you want any movement to work and the occupy movement made our generation look like entitled shit bags. I'm going to tweet about how bad corporations are on my iPad! sickening.

       A million dollars is literally not shit. Look how much we spend on war, or basically anything else. Look how much money we constantly give to Israel. A million dollars is nothing.

       Yeah a million dollars is nothing. a million dollars is noting to spend if you have a reason to spend it, but when there was fucking no goddamned reason other then people acting like savages then that makes it a bit of a problem in my mind. If they just had to clean up some trash, well it happens but they had to rebuild the park from the ground up. There was no reason to spend this money it could have been spent on something better. this was money set aside for our national parks it could have gone to something better but no, it went to fixing what some asshole kids broke up. This was not money taken from the military budget, or from israel this was money set aside for making our national parks better for all of us. Tax money the you and I payed. This is something i support my tax dollars going to and i feel cheated when that money is wasted on bullshit like this.

       Can you provide proof other than your claims of first hand knowledge? I went to the occupy protests in NYC and my local city and neither groups trashed the parks. Of course there is wear and tear from the unusually high number of people in the park, yet you make it sound like they took a crowbar the the park and started destroying stuff for the hell of it which I find difficult to believe.

       All I have is the figure quoted to me by my father who works for the park service. He had t go take pictures of the park after the protesters left to asses the damage so I take his word for it. He works in facilities management and saw the work orders. Most of them passed through his hands.

       Sorry, what I meant to say was that some negative consequences are greatly outweighed by the ultimate results produced. Let me elaborate for you, as I do not want to receive another angered response of misunderstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for the American public to wake the fuck up to the wanton corruption of their corporate-controlled government and many corporations themselves, awareness/education must be spread. One event that gained much attention was the OWS protest, albeit it was somewhat disorganized and dysfunctional. With OWS there were some unintended consequences, such as parks getting destroyed, but if that is what it takes to raise awareness then so be it. Again, many people used OWS as an excuse to 'fuck things up' with anti-establishment sentiments, and this I DO NOT approve of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, in order for things to get better, some things are bound to get worse. If REAL change is going to occur in this country, there is sure to be some economic turbulence and other shitshows along the way.

       Thank you for elaborating, I retract my earlier statement and i must say that for the most part i agree with you. I feel like its only going to get worse before it gets better the problem is that OWS is not the way. it is far too disjointed and lacks any real leadership. If you want any real change you HAVE to get middle america on your side and you will not accomplish this by dressing up in your worst hippy garb and acting like entitled asshats. I hate to say it but it's the truth appearance matters. The people who ran the civil rights movement knew it and they got things done. It took alot of doing but untimely it happened and that is what our generation lacks. we need the leadership. we need the unity and we need the support of middle america and we will never achieve that by sitting in parks banging on drums and shouting whoa is me. Another thing being anti-establishment doesn't mean robbing yourself, fucking up a national park does nothing but take tax payer money and squander it. We should all be telling people this anyone who wants to be part of a peaceful movement no matter how much they hate the government needs to understand that when you fucking destroy a park your picking your own pocket.

       Yes. This exactly. They were destroying park property. Droves of occupiers were showing up with no idea of the intent. Girls were harassed left and right. It was truly unruly. People walking by were constantly harassed.

       If that is the case, where most of it I disafmgree back.  You failed.  You failed by not being a fellow man.  By reminding your brothers that just like scounts, you must leave the grounds better than you found them.  As to the rape lies. I can't buy theis.  Those protesting are not those thY rape the ones closest to then.  Like doesn't work like this.

       Black Friday is a joke and anyone who participates in it is a joke aswell. Some people make the argument that the employees are kept from their families, well the counterpoint could be made that the families are camping out in front of the stores anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       black friday, in its concept is poison to a culture and a society. Stand out int he cold for hours, or even days? for what? 25% off yet
       <em>
        another
       </em>
       TV? Past instances show that people buy anything and everything just because its on sale, even if they dont need it, if they didnt want it before they do now. they will find a place in their home and life for it. Fights have broken out, people have been stabbed and beaten over things with a "SALE!" sticker on it. Everyone wants to buy things on sale, as if purchasing something on sale is empowering and fulfilling to you as a person and your function in society. And people turn savage to attain this false empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony? Black Friday saving go on for the rest of the year, in fact ive noticed things are cheaper closer to christmas time than they are during black friday. You absolutely want to buy something black friday? Get a rain check and get it on the weekend or some other time. Crazy right?
      </p>
      <p>
       i hope to drive by several stores on black friday. I hope to bullhorn the masses of idiots and break down the fact that they could get rain checks and not have to stand out in the cold OR ruin the employes holiday by keeping them form their families. That the sales extend for the rest of the year and they buying things they dont need with money they dont have.

       Good eye and good question, i always appreciate it when people are able to pick out the nuances i leave in my rantings. it lets me know whos fun to discuss things with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that Black Friday is supposed to be a sort of gunshot that starts the race till the end of the year; Thanksgiving is over and so Christmas shopping has "officially" begun. that was its "real" meaning and point, people usually got the day after thanksgiving off so familys would go shopping for Christmas.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, today Black Friday has grown into a holiday in its own, when its simply the first day of several weeks of deals of the holiday season. While its not entirely adulterated just yet, there is some bleeding of these two concepts that are mixing with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in answer to your question, None. Black Friday sales are explicit to Black Friday and they make note of that in the fine print for each item. Much like a retailer having a deal from days 10-15, you cant get rain checks on those. This is a result of Black Friday becoming a holiday in its own. But dont forget Black Friday is just the first day of the holiday season. Unlike the front page of targets weekly "deal" printout, most of the deals you see in the store arnt Black Friday exclusive and will continue to be on sale for the rest of the year and event fluctuate on how much of a % is being taken off..
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, even if the deal is a Black Friday exclusive, it will be given another deal before the end of the year, and probably for much cheaper than it was on Black Friday, especially if its closer to Christmas time. Dont trust me? ask a friend who works a manager position in retail
      </p>
      <p>
       If you or anyone else reading this participates in Black Friday, skip it this year. Look at the things you would have gotten and remember the prices. Wait a week, or even a few days i swear to you that youd be able to buy them for just as much, if not cheaper than during Black Friday before the year is out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This eliminates the idea of having to camp out in front of the store while the world laughs at us for being beoing everything negative about capitalism; as well as forcing low-paid workers from having to work that morning/day.

       For one, making it look fun isn't "praising" them.  The news is covering it because it has become a weird ritual that fascinates people (although it is usually over-covered junk news).

       They seem to be more-or-less considered a joke to most people.  People on the news usually aren't going to editorialize to the point of saying, "Hey, look at these assholes waiting in the cold to get a cheap TV!" even if that most people think.

       Never though about it like that, and now I am very sad for the country. I may have lost faith in humanity again. And don't forget how celebrated those zombies are when they line up for DAYS to buy the iPhone. They want to make sure everyone knows they will be the most easily tracked, monitored, and assimilated.

       And what is property? Some ridiculous claim that people have a right to build and destroy this land? Another materialistic view that we actually are important to the Earth, or even to the Universe? There is no property, we are just borrowing space until the world decides to clear us out of the way. We are not even a blip on the cosmic radar. We live infinitesimally small lives and life spans. We are a microscopic dot on top of a microscopic dot, against the background of infinity. Not trying to get nihilistic, just stating the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR - This land is borrowed, so we should occupy everything the elite thinks is theirs.

       You shouldn't think about it like that. The OP is well meaning, and I get the point they're trying to make, but the comparison is not a good one. Black Friday shoppers, consumer robots that they are, have every intention of dispersing after they get their cheap piece of crap on Friday. Occupy Wall Street had no intention of leaving, and were there for the long haul. Thier goal is impossible through peaceful protest, and will only be seen once CEO's heads start showing up on pikes.

       IMO OWS was demonized only because they got off-message WAY too quickly. There were a LOT of times where the message went from "Power to the People" and "Regulate Wall Street" to "Fuck tha Police" and there were all too many that went along with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, it got people talking, so at least that happened. What it needed was a group that would have been able to call out the bad apples and keep everyone on message.

       When people camp out for Black Friday it's for 6-12 hours. Maybe 24 hours. When people do it for apple events maybe 2 days. But at least in CT the occupy movement after 4 months turned into a bum city. And was just an eye sore.

       Occupy Wallstreet was literally on public property hindering business and causing hundreds and thousands of dollars in damage to public property. Black Friday campers are camping out on private, commercial property and pouring billions into the economy. That, and Black Friday campers occupy a shower every now and then, too.

       Black Friday shoppers aren't destroying private property, smashing in business windows, shitting on police cars, breaking into churches, deemed health hazards, seeking corporate sponsorship for generators, food an tents (something I always found hilarious), or setting up rape free areas.

       It is because people who camp out on Black Friday have a set mission and know what they want. The Occupy people were just bitching about how life is unfair. They had no leadership no set cause and were so unorganized they were useless. I went to one meeting and walked out. I have seen squirrels organize nuts better

       Occupy knew what they wanted: attention. Attention towards every issue that is unfair or biased in favor of the 1%. The problem was there are soooo many issues that need addressing that the task was too daunting. On top of this you had the brilliant idea of a leaderless movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Classical forms of protests no longer work because the 1% is so powerful and ruthless. They know exactly how to discredit a normal protest and destroy momentum. Occupy threw a wrench in their plans by decentralisation. Without one specific idea or person to attack the media was baffled with how to discredit the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you can't look back and say one specific form of legislation was changed because of occupy, you can say change happened. An entire generation recognized that they do have a voice and they can stand up to the tyrannical government that is bought and paid for. The many will beat the few when they band together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occupy was about reminding people exactly that. Its not the governments park. It is your park. You just pay the government for upkeep. People found their voices through occupy, and change has already started from it. Once the curtain drops (some say it already has) and the militarized police roam the streets in tanks it will be the occupy generation that meet them in the streets and become the true protectors of Americans.

       Obviously we have a different point of view of what "do anything" means. They changed the way an entire generations thinks. If you're not part of that generation I'm sorry you can't grasp the concept of a peoples finding their voice.

       The same way you purport the protestors didn't do anything; black Friday shoppers don't do anything.

       The entire idea of the 1% and the wealth gap being discussed in mainstream media comes directly from the occupy movements. That by itself discredits your statements that they did nothing. The call for financial reform was reawakened by the occupy movement. That's two. I could keep going but there is no need. Even if they only did those two things, you are incorrect to say they did nothing. Please admit it.

       then why didn't occupy do an "occupy black Friday"? They could camp out at every store and when they get in on Friday morning buy gum or something. That would send a message.

       Also don't forget that despite the Occupy Wall Street people and how they were having a passive protest. They're still very pissed off and anything could cause a riot or something else that's bad. Just look at the Bonus Army riot that happened in the late 1920s or early 1930s. It was a peaceful protest of WWI vets along for more support from the government. But then President Hoover ordered the army to escort them out. The whole occur ands ended up in the death of two policemen and two war vets. The reason they put the Occupy Wall Street protesters off the streets now is to prevent another Event like the Bonus Army one. Also they're crowding won't do anything to benefit the economy. The Black Friday shoppers are there to buy goods. The purchase of the goods will put money into circulation therefore helping the economy. Finally, the shoppers aren't there because they're angry. They're there because they know they're going to get something. 
So in conclusion, the Friday shoppers aren't a threat but the protesters could be.

       I understand what you're saying about the Black Friday shoppers spending money, but I don't think it is justified to claim the Black Friday shoppers pose a significantly lesser risk of rioting or being a threat. I would say that, judging by how Black Friday crowds have responded in the past to even the smallest instances of disruption to their shopping experience, they may well be just as likely as Occupy Wall Street crowds to become dangerous in the event they are directly confronted by the police.

       Okay I agree with you to that but the Black Friday shoppers aren't pissed off as something. And yes disruption in there shopping experience could cause them to freak out. But since they come into the event with a calm state of mind then they won't have such a low tolerance to beginning in a riot in order to get what they want

       A million dollars is literally not shit. Look how much we spend on war, or basically anything else. Look how much money we constantly give to Israel. A million dollars is nothing.

       Occupy knew what they wanted: attention. Attention towards every issue that is unfair or biased in favor of the 1%. The problem was there are soooo many issues that need addressing that the task was too daunting. On top of this you had the brilliant idea of a leaderless movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Classical forms of protests no longer work because the 1% is so powerful and ruthless. They know exactly how to discredit a normal protest and destroy momentum. Occupy threw a wrench in their plans by decentralisation. Without one specific idea or person to attack the media was baffled with how to discredit the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you can't look back and say one specific form of legislation was changed because of occupy, you can say change happened. An entire generation recognized that they do have a voice and they can stand up to the tyrannical government that is bought and paid for. The many will beat the few when they band together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occupy was about reminding people exactly that. Its not the governments park. It is your park. You just pay the government for upkeep. People found their voices through occupy, and change has already started from it. Once the curtain drops (some say it already has) and the militarized police roam the streets in tanks it will be the occupy generation that meet them in the streets and become the true protectors of Americans.

       The entire idea of the 1% and the wealth gap being discussed in mainstream media comes directly from the occupy movements. That by itself discredits your statements that they did nothing. The call for financial reform was reawakened by the occupy movement. That's two. I could keep going but there is no need. Even if they only did those two things, you are incorrect to say they did nothing. Please admit it.
