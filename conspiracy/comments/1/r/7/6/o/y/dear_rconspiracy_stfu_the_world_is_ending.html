       So we're focused on all this bullshit. From UFOs, to chemtrails, to Kennedy and Obamacare. To Syria, right on through to psyops. Whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know the world is ending, right? That's it. That's what none of you will talk about. We are a dying species on a dying planet, and we do not have as long as we wished we did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of talking about conspiracies, how about we talk about living like we'd like to die with some dignity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck it, if anyone comments it will be completely unhelpful or sarcastic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time I've posted here about just this topic no one wants to acknowledge it, so I'll say this last thing: Get your mind prepared for everything to change drastically and suddenly within the next ten years. If you do well, I'll see you on the flip side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace.

       The universe as you know it begins and ends with you, try meditating and finding out what 'you' 'is'. No fear is warranted. Dying aint the end, its just another learning process.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I feel ya bro, its just that your either scared of deaths implications or you not scared of it, either because of preperation or ignorance, and thats personal knowledge. My word of advice is love as much as you can possibly love before you think its gonna be all over here and we go our separate ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       And dont stress on r/conspiracy what else would you expect? go to r/existentialism or some esoteric philosophy subreddits. People here choose to be mad hatters, and thats just fine. Your not gonna change shit here, so dont worry bout it. Change yourself.

       We are nothing if not a resilient species. Sure, we may hurt ourselves in the long run, but enough people will survive if anything catastrophic happens (anthropogenetical catastrophy, that is) that we will rebuild once again. Just like we have in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fyi, just because the majority of people disagree with you doesnt mean they are being unhelpful. Look, times look bad right now, and id bet that you are a younger person, a millenial probably in your early twenties, or worse, in your teens. Point is, there has always been generations that claimed the world is ending. There has always been a small group of people that think the world is so disgusting that there is nothing we can do about it and it will all end terribly. One thing is for sure, though. These people, those that claim there is nothing we can do, people like you who have no faith in our species, you all have one thing in common.....

       You have done absolutely nothing to help.

      <p>
       As the adage goes, evil triumphs when good men do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are so damned sure about the world ending, get the fuck off your keyboard and do something about it and help save what we can, lest you allow it to happen.

       Sir, how about you
       <em>
        read
       </em>
       ? Does it sound like I do nothing? Do you use your intuition at all? Look at these posts. Does anyone sound like they're doing
       <em>
        nothing at all
       </em>
       in their lives about the things they care about? Does it really sound like I don't have faith in my species? Fucking no, it doesn't. You just wanted to hear that, but guess what: out of most of the people I've met in my short thirty years, very few people have the amount of faith they
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had faith in humanity, you would see this message as it is: to cast off the shackles of fear and ignorance and to rise to our maximum potential -- to exceed what we believe is possible. I do not care about death or destruction. I do not promote these things. That is the paradigm so many of you operate under and so I do not interfere with your group-think. I do not divulge my true faith in humanity because to do so would not help you. It would only make you worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find out for yourself how much there
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       is to humans and your fellow man before you go on about how much you know they do nothing.

       How does one go about dying with dignity? And how to you know the world is ending anytime soon? It will assuredly end one day but that doesn't mean we should give up doing whatever the hell we want to do even if it is bitching and moaning about our temporary existence.

       If you have been paying attention at all, you would know we do not have long. Dying with dignity means whatever dignity means to you. If it would uphold your honor to have your lover one last time, that would be great, wouldn't it? How about creating a work of art?

       Called it. You guys on here are the first people to jump and say, "So prove it" I'm
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       living a life that ostracizes me from most people, due to my morals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been traveling to different states for the past two years trying to reach out to people in physicality. It is only recently that I -- stupidly -- thought I could reach people through this medium. This is not about being burdened by the end of
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       world. The planet
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       dying, we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       dying.. but that isn't the end. I know that. There is a rebirth coming, if we can take the chance to use the suffering in the world as our catalyst.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this time I've come to r/conspiracy trying to tell of the same things, hoping to reach people through the
       <em>
        information
       </em>
       of conspiracy "theories" being fact. But I realized, it's not so much about the information as how you relate to the world. If you see the world in a materialistic way, are selfish, have no imagination, or want of courage.. if you have been born into a life where it is a privilege to talk about conspiracies, then what good is the information?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, this is about the
       <em>
        feeling
       </em>
       . Everyone is disconnected. But why? Why? Because of how we relate to ourselves in the world. In sharing my story I hope to remind people that their story IS important. That even if every last human dies, we will have all made some difference, some where. But I do not think this is The End. I believe we are at least 500 years behind where we should be and that if we do not force our own evolution, then humans -- as we know them -- will go extinct.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we will never have known our potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. This is not in the wrong place. I do not know if it is an
       <em>
        intentional long-term
       </em>
       conspiracy, but I believe this intense focus on the information, rather than what the information means for us -- where we can go -- is holding back our progress. What is the perfect ploy but to leave conspiracies behind for people to obsess over rather than move forward as a species?

       this was so buried. such important info, wow.... i've been studying up on everything i've felt is important to me spiritually to prepare for the coming shift. everything is changing around us. either we change or we die. there is not balance. one or another.

       i don't know what's wrong with the people in this thread. they're probably scared to really think about it. it was pretty overwhelming for me too. i just recently got into all this. but i think i'm ready for what's coming and all i can do is be a leader for myself and teach others to be leaders too.

       We're not a dying species. The white race is dying, (or more accurately, is being slowly exterminated) but not the human race. We may well drop back into a Dark Age of pre-technology, after the genocide of whites, but humans will remain, although they won't be as intelligent or as gifted as those who lived before the collapse. But humans will still be around, probably living like the lower classes in India in the 1920s. Maybe they'll manage to support a steam-level civilization, who knows.

       You do know diversifying the gene makes humans stronger and less prone to defect.  This is how nature works.  White breeding is like inbreeding if you look at it from a generic standpoint.
