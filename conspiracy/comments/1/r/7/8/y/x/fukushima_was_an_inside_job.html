<p>Fairewinds Chief Engineer Arnie Gundersen is a shill so not a substantial source of information. </p>

<p>Magna BSP an Israeli security firm based outta Dimona had been running security at Fukushima Daiichi.  They had a direct video uplink from the reactor room in number 4 in order to see the results of the bomb they planted.</p>

<p>The diesel backup generators were still functioning at the time of the explosion, the room did not flood from the manmade tsunami - but unfortunately Stuxnet incapacitated the main generators, and gave false readings on the Siemens system. </p>

<p>There was no 9.0 quake, or at least no damage of that magnitude.  Look at the videos.</p>

<p>Atmosphere Above Japan Heated Rapidly Before M9 Earthquake</p>

<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424033/atmosphere-above-japan-heated-rapidly-before-m9-earthquake/">http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424033/atmosphere-above-japan-heated-rapidly-before-m9-earthquake/</a></p>

<p>HAARP  is literally an atmospheric heater.</p>

<p>I think that if the high frequencies projected into the ionosphere by HAARP are used to concentrate the VLF low frequencies they propagate though the ground, at one of the ground faults, which they admit to looking for, the result could be expected to be an earthquake.</p>

<p>The Stuxnet connection</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stuxnet malware is reportedly a contributing factor to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Clue ... virtually every control system failed or reacted wrongly to emergency conditions.</p>

<p>I understand the U.S. threatened Japan&#39;s nuclear reactors a couple of years before Fukushima. I can&#39;t currently find a link to that.</p>

<p>&quot;Reactor 4 had been defueled and was undergoing replacement of it&#39;s internal stainless steel shroud, yet blew it&#39;s containment anyway. That is the FINAL smoking gun, an empty reactor is inert, and cannot produce an explosion, yet one happened at 4 that was so powerful it destroyed the structure leaving it in danger of falling over. Overheated open fuel pools cannot produce hydrogen because in an open fuel pool the water boils off at 100 Celsius, and won&#39;t be present in pressurized form at 2,000 degrees Celsius to liberate it&#39;s hydrogen by losing it&#39;s oxygen to the zircon cladding in the fuel rods. The rods will prefer the free oxygen in the air and burn long before attempting to claim the oxygen in whatever humidity there might be. Because fuel rods only contain 20 percent fissionable material, they also cannot produce the &quot;prompt criticality&quot; &quot;The most qualified nuclear engineer in the world&quot; Arnie Gundersen has spoken of.&quot;</p>

<p>Why is Japan So Anti-Israel?</p>

<p>“Significance of Japan’s March 11, 2010, statements about Israel and their-Japan’s disaster. Many it seems were very surprised by the intensity of Japan’s statements on March 11, 2010, about Jerusalem, the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) and Jewish home construction.
The Japanese statements of last year about Israel – one year later to the day. Tragedies hit Japan: earthquake, tsunami and nuclear plants and their economy is severely hurt. Coincidence?</p>

<p>Japan’s financial gifts to the Palestinians were not spoken of in the media.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The Japanese’s strong and specific words about Israel’s land:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Government of Japan is concerned about the Jerusalem municipal planning committee’s approval of a plan to build housing units for Jewish people in the Sheih Jarrah of East Jerusalem. Such act goes against the efforts by the international community to resume the negotiations. – MOFA, February 10, 2011</p></li>
<li><p>The Government of Japan does not recognize any act that prejudges the final status of the territories in the pre-1967 borders nor Israel’s annexation of East Jerusalem. Japan urges Israel to refrain from any unilateral act that changes the current situation in East Jerusalem. - MOFA, February 10, 2011</p></li>
<li><p>The Government of Japan deplores the decisions of the Government of Israel to give permission for the construction of 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem in addition to 112 units in West Bank just after the Israeli and Palestinian leadership’s acceptance of the start of indirect talks. The Government of Japan does not recognize any act that prejudges the final status of Jerusalem and the territories in the pre-1967 borders. Japan demands that the plans should not be implemented. – MOFA, March 11, 2010</p></li>
<li><p>The Government of Japan continues to request strongly that both parties will act in a way that enhances mutual confidence. Japan sincerely hopes that the indirect talks in the peace process will swiftly develop into the resumption of direct talks between the two parties. – MOFA, March 11, 2010</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no mag 9 quake. It was fabricated by the USGS. Jim Stone found the Japanese seismographs and confirmed that there were 5 simultaneous quakes inland, probably HAARP or gravity-wave induced.</p>

<p>The tsunami was most likely induced by a nuke planted on the sea floor by the deep sea mining vessel Chikyu-maru.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I logged in just to tell OP - you&#39;re a joke.</p>

<p>This is the exact reason that this sub sucks so much cock.</p>

<p>No evidence.  Wild speculation by uninformed high school kids.  Straight up dumb people making logical leaps.  HORRIBLE sources that are not verified.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying weather technology caused a tsunami that devastated Japan and killed upwards of 20,000 people, based on some vague article on Ynet News talking about uranium enrichment that hasn&#39;t even happened.</p>

<p>Please examine your logic.  I&#39;m not happy with the government of Israel but the idea that they murdered 20,000 people to somehow send a message to Tokyo that enriching Iran&#39;s nuclear fuel for them is off the table - it&#39;s fucking mental.</p>

<p>You might as well say Santa Claus did it.  </p>

<p>LOL. Stop snorting bathsalts, friend.  Your condemnation of Stalin&#39;s NKVD as &quot;Zionist&quot; or the Holodomor as having anything to do with Jews is absolutely retarded.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t deny what Israel does.  But your criticism is pure bunk.  As is the idea that Mossad made an Earthquake and Tsunami happen - just as some vague warning they can never take credit for. </p>

<p>Get a grip on history and reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey shill Bolshevism is/was Jewish.  </p>

<p>Genrikh Yagoda the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, the GPU&#39;s deputy commander and the founder and commander of the NKVD. Yagoda diligently implemented Stalin&#39;s collectivization orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. His Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system.</p>

<p>In 1934, according to published statistics, 38.5 percent of those holding the most senior posts in the Soviet security apparatuses were of Jewish origin. </p>

<p>Why is your ideology against raising consciousness shill?  I hope you are reincarnated into a worm for all the great work you do for your brothers and sisters.</p>
