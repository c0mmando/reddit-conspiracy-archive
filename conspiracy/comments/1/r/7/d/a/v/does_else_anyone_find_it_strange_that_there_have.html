<p>Are you aware that natural &quot;base levels&quot; vary by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_radiation#Natural_background_radiation">orders of magnitude</a>? </p>

<p>Going to a high mountain, flying by plane, or even walking over a thorium-rich beach are kind of mundane activities that will increase dramatically the levels of radiation that you are receiving, and there is few if any indication that increases cancer risk.</p>

<p>Actually, there is even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis">counter-hypothesis</a> that moderate radiation exposure stimulates your repair mechanisms and lowers cancer probability...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IT&#39;S NOT SAFE.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tolerable. X-Ray radiation is ALWAYS bad for you, but because you have it done rarely and for as brief amount of time possible, it does as little damage as possible.</p>

<p>It still could lead to you developing cancer.</p>

<p>There are so many different forms of radiation though that we&#39;re exposed to every day and we&#39;re fine so really it&#39;s about what kind, how much, and how it&#39;s getting into you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s a false analogy because it&#39;s not harmful whatsoever to consume small amounts of water.</p>

<p>Even at the small dose that it&#39;s at, Medical X-rays still have a chance to increase you factor to get cancer.</p>

<p>Just because a class 1 laser is safe to look at with the naked eye doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t damage your eye if you have it beaming directly at it for hours straight.</p>

<p>Of course anything in excess may be able to do you harm in some way.</p>

<p>I just trying to say it&#39;s not inherently safe, I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s fair to call it safe seeing as you have to take certain precautions with it.</p>

<p>Safety precautions don&#39;t actually make you safe. Even with a helmet on, flying off a ramp on a skateboard is still dangerous, you&#39;re just lessening your chance of serious brain damage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>/me rolls eyes.</p>

<p>Based on that argument, nothing is safe.</p>

<p>Medical x-rays might have a tiny, tiny chance of causing you cancer - but they have a much greater chance of helping to fix a problem that could kill you.</p>

<p>Taking an airplane might have a tiny tiny chance of causing cancer - but if you drove you&#39;d be far, far more likely to die in a car crash.</p>

<p>And it might be that small amounts of radiation have ZERO chance of causing cancer... it&#39;s not sure by any means that the risk is linear!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.</p>

<p>Nothing  is safe really. Riding a bike isn&#39;t safe. Using a knife isn&#39;t safe.</p>

<p>Obviously though we can lower danger levels through safety measures.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t mean that those things are safe though and that&#39;s all I was trying to say.</p>

<p>I mean when I go to the dentist and get a tooth x-ray I have to have a lead plate over my chest ( that little apron bib most all dentists use ) so I don&#39;t get exposed to that unnecessarily.</p>

<p>My dentists received training to safely operate that machine, which means it&#39;s not inherently safe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have literally been thousands of reports of constant and severe nose bleeds. The japanese doctors in the fukushima area were told not to tell theirbpatients that they are showing signs of radiation sickness, even though the doctors know that these patients have radiation sickness...</p>

<p>The problem with all this downplaying on fukushima, plausible deniability. Anybody who gets cancer in the next decade or so, you can bet they wont ascribe it to the effects of fukushima. Afterall, cancer existed beforehand. It is hard to prove a source of cancer when it takes such a long time to manifest itself. They will use this to continue their downplaying.</p>

<p>Plausible deniability--that is why there wont be many (if any at all) deaths contributed to radiation exposure of fukushima...</p>

Yes it is true that there are naturally occurring radioactive elements in the ocean and fish absorb this material in their flesh however they do have the capacity to remove the radiation slowly.  The problem is they are constantly being exposed and cannot lose the amount of radiation they take in constantly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only strategy for dealing with the three meltdowns might be to do nothing and just let them burn. The engineers are probably hoping that there is solid bedrock – no underground streams – directly under the reactors. If so it would be better to leave the radioactivity where it is than try to remove it. But if one of the cores does come into contact with an underground watercourse it will spew highly radioactive water for ever. Simply capping the reactors with concrete will do no good at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fukushima is the greatest threat humanity has ever faced. If you think the job of removing the fuel assemblies is easy and straightforward then you haven&#39;t been paying attention. The Japanese haven&#39;t &#39;let the reactor cool down&#39;. For a start, there was no fuel in reactor four – it had all been taken out for maintenance and was sitting in a pool of water on the roof. Used fuel rods are very hot, and the ones in the pool became exposed to air and overheated. They are now delicate and brittle and can easily break, and if one does it will release enough radioactive gas to make the reactor building a no go area again, or even lead to a criticality that would involve all six reactors in a nuclear explosion. Reactors 1 to 3 will never cool down. They all suffered meltdown and their fuel pods are a molten pool of redhot uranium and plutonium which is eating its way out of the bottom of the containment vessel. Nobody has a clue how to deal with this.</p>
