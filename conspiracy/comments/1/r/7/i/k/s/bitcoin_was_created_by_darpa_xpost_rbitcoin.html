        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is no way to stop what is going to happen to bitcoin. It&#39;s an issue of sociology. It&#39;s an issue of human greed. It&#39;s an issue as to WHO created bitcoin and WHY.</p>

<p>Who is the single largest holder of BTC right now? &quot;Satoshi&quot;. Who is he? I will say it again. NSA/DARPA created bitcoin under the guidance of the IMF. The IMF has been openly calling for a digital, one-world, deflationary currency for 2 decades. OPENLY. It has been discussed and promoted OPENLY at G8 and G20 summits.</p>

<p>from the early 90s-96 the NSA was OPENLY investigating cryptographic money networks.</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm</a></p>

<p>One of their researchers and investigators is a man named Tatsuaki Okamoto. When they actively started writing the code they chose the pseudonym &quot;Satoshi Nakamura&quot; to ultimately promote the idea that Tatsuaki Okamoto to any and all who investigated the source of bitcoin long enough. But Tatsuaki Okamoto is just a cog. He&#39;s not some rogue savoir out to topple centralized banks. Not at all. He is a crypto scientist who was paid by government and intelligence agencies to do research.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is an NSA/DARPA lab set into the wild. Scientific technology grants issued by government and intelligence agencies are how these labs are funded and promoted. The regulation and control of bitcoin has been actively developed alongside the development of the network. In fact, the controls, policy and regulation are WAY WAY more mature than the bitcoin protocol itself. That&#39;s why we see things like Greenlist written into law without a mention of bitcoin until recently.</p>

<p>This is not tinfoil hattish. This is just reality. No one forced ANYONE to believe the Satoshi fairytale.. The libertarian Satoshi myth has been promoted in stealth to specifically promote ADOPTION and DEVELOPMENT. It&#39;s no different than the internet and WWW itself. EXACTLY the same. That is why you see many www early adopters saying bitcoin &quot;feels&quot; the same as the early internet. I am one of those people.</p>

<p>In 94-96 the public internet was ALL about freedom of information. FREE COMMUNICATION. It was ALL about liberty and freedom. I wish i could transport some of you back in time so you could see for yourselves. The promise of free phonecalls with the freeworlddialup, free media with IUMA and the MBONE. All this freedom and liberty had people pouring their heart and soul into developing it. Now look at it. Facebook, google.. it is a GIANT SURVEILLANCE grid. And if you look for and read DARPA/NSA docs from the 80s and early 90s that was what it was always meant to be. I am not discounting all the socially great things that happen online.. But from the perspective of DARPA/NSA and control freaks.. it was created for the express purpose of control. A military purpose. A strategic purpose.</p>

<p>What is bitcoin? Bitcoin IS the one world digital currency. We all have a deterministic UUID that has been generated from our biometric data. This UUID will be related to all your datastores. This UUID is your mark. This UUID is what is used to buy and sell online and in the real world. This UUID is the primary key in your Greenlist identity.</p>

<p>Coinbase, blockchain.info and it would appear Coinsetter are inline to be the first to roll out the incoming policy and regulation. This policy and regulation is WORLD WIDE. It is CORPORATE. It is not about governments. Governments ADOPT corporate organized policies. If you think this is new than you need to investigate ACH and NACHA. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/aboutus">https://www.nacha.org/aboutus</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Earthport/nacha-payments-2013-complementary-paths-to-global-ach-earthport-federal-reserve-financial-services-hsbc">http://www.slideshare.net/Earthport/nacha-payments-2013-complementary-paths-to-global-ach-earthport-federal-reserve-financial-services-hsbc</a></p>

<p>Bitcoin is THEIR network. And for the minority early adopters that is going to be a hard pill to swallow.. But for those in the know.. Like Gavin, it&#39;s PAYDAY. Realization and monetization of their massive bitcoin holdings is being guaranteed by regulators. That is why they are all literally RUSHING to regulate.</p>

<p>Legitimization of bitcoin is all about hosted wallets. The centralization of bitcoin. Hosted wallet providers approve/dissaprove transactions before they are actually issued on the network. Greenlist enabled wallets will be the fastest. (offline transactions). Greenlist enabled wallets will be hooked directly to your bank account, ease of buying and selling. Greenlist enabled exchanges will have the largest market with the best prices. Greenlist enabled wallets will completely eliminate risk of stolen coins. No more security worries AT ALL. And this is what the masses have come to expect. And this is why it&#39;s going to happen. And Greenlisted wallets will be accepted everywhere. And in the physical world you will identify yourself and your wallet with your biometrics.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=173715.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=173715.0</a></p>

<p>TL;DR bitcoin is a global digital currency, regulation was created in tandem with development and adoption, bitcoin is not and never was meant to be a liberty promoting value exchange. There is no &quot;satoshi&quot;. The central banks are already the largest holders of bitcoin. Bitcoin IS going to the moon because of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting concept but you&#39;ve missed a few key features of bitcoin.</p>

<p>1) It&#39;s an open source project. Anyone can pull the source code and fork it or contribute to it, and due to bitcoins liberal nature as described by the white paper that Satoshi released, a lot of the early and core developers are also aligned with liberty and freedom in mind.</p>

<p>2) The early dev&#39;s have more money than they know what to do with. They could cash out and live the rest of their lives quite well but they haven&#39;t. They keep working on bitcoin because what attracted them to it initially is important to them, more important than profit. There is practically no financial incentive that could sway their minds.</p>

<p>3) The mining and validation system of transaction is decentralized and run on the basis of overall consensus. And again, the biggest miners are the guys who got in early, the guys who also adopt to free and liberal ideals. If companies want to sign up to a green list, all the miners have to do is agree to blacklist those companies and it defeats the very benefits of being on the greenlist (more trusted by users, faster transaction times).</p>

<p>The OPs point is it&#39;s &quot;THEIR&quot; network. Whoever THEY are.... (From my POV this is just childish Us vs. The Unknown-style thinking.)</p>

<p>My point is that if you don&#39;t like it, fork it, and it&#39;s suddenly YOUR network, which makes yours and the ops points both unthought and moot.</p>

<p>The whole point of the thread is <strong>completely reactionary</strong>.</p>

<p>Open Source software is public property. Free as in you can take it and rework it. I&#39;m not one of these cats who&#39;ll tell you to vet the source, I&#39;m the type to tell you to take it and modify it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the next resurgence of hippy-style DIY off-grid living will include communal power generation and commune-specific cryptocurrencies. etc. for the next couple of hundred years, cyclically, on earth, in space, on other earthlike planets, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>You/I wouldn&#39;t name the currency after your/myself because it&#39;d put people off using it, but you can create your own spinoff <em>and there&#39;s nothing to stop it taking off with your circle of friends if there&#39;s interest in the idea</em>.</p>

<p>I write <a href="http://psybernetics.org.uk/greggs/424?lang=py">open source software</a> in my free time and OPs point is it&#39;s &quot;THEIR network&quot;, and my point is that <strong>if you don&#39;t like it don&#39;t use it, or fork it</strong>.</p>

<p>Hopefully you see how this option precludes OPs &quot;THE SKY IS FALLING&quot; rambling.</p>

<p>also as an aside, I was aware of the NSAMINT doc <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1gawry/bitcoin_nsa/caij097">about half a year ago</a>, and didn&#39;t see it as nefarious then, either. Is it really that amazing that a clandestine (no such) agency which engages in corporate espionage and cryptography would be interested in cryptographically-backed currencies?</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are just an interesting concept, in theory and implementation and OPs entire point strikes me as deep curiosity mixed with a bit too much fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>Do you have any concept of what this means in the context of software development? Because it doesn&#39;t really apply to what you are talking about in regards to btc. Cash is incredibly more anonymous compared to btc which offers a trace of one&#39;s actions. The difficulty of identifying a person and their btc accounts has nothing to do with any &#39;cryptographic designs&#39; in btc. Imagine if the gov&#39;t forced any entity that converted btc to dollars to demand identifying information from their customers. Blammo - no more anonymity in btc-land.</p>

<p>If a number of large nation-states agreed to use btc as the core of a new international transaction network, do you think those nation-states are going to let their citizens trade in competing btc implementations? Do you think the businesses in those nation-states will use the gov&#39;t supported btc, or the free-btc?</p>

<p>The OP might be ridiculous, however, I was asking if anyone could, in the op&#39;s scenario, demonstrate how BTC is inherently secured against such attacks. So far you&#39;ve suggested that it&#39;s self-evident. However, I don&#39;t think that is realistic. In fact, it&#39;s damn naive. To go with an example often used by libertarian btc fans, the dollar is backed by guns. Well, I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d think the guns would suddenly disappear with any nation/state-adopted future-currency, cryptographic or otherwise.</p>

<p>Once a sophisticated adversary acquires the new projects client and gets their copy of this private versions new blockchain all they can see is amounts being transferred between addresses, and if they&#39;re able to coerce participants wallet addresses from them then it&#39;s stopped being a software problem anyway.</p>

<p>Imagine if a government forced any entity that converted cryptocurrency to hard cash, though, because it&#39;s instructive.
There would be total outrage at first, and then imaginative uses of proxies for the process, like getting gold shipped to PO boxes and redeeming that for cash at a seperate time for example.</p>

<p>Yeah because it&#39;s really enforced by the involved parties who&#39;re willing to barter with whatever they have at hand.</p>

<p>Lets say just you and I have a forked copy of bitcoin (call it privcoin for the sake of this) and we&#39;ve mined some currency and are willing to transact via two virtual private servers that are running the privcoin client. Funnily enough we&#39;ve paid for the VPS&#39; anonymously, with bitcoin, and we&#39;re coordinating the transactions by logging into one machine over ssh and connecting to an IRCd running internally, so we&#39;re also communicating via one anonymously rented machines memory on a service that&#39;s not visible from the public internet and to the NSA the traffic just looks like two SSH sessions. I sell you something you want and I accept your privcoins in return for shipping your purchase to you. All the government (any country) sees is use of the postal system, possibly even going from me to a PO box.</p>

<p>Do you really mean to tell me this hypothetical scenario is a matter of any government &quot;letting&quot; this happen? :)</p>

<p>Actually you&#39;re not asking that anywhere but it is a good point. The best defence against having your *coin address linked to you is utmost secrecy about what implementations you&#39;re using, because physical intimidation isn&#39;t normally a software issue (apart from in <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>s design).</p>

<p><em>Total outrage?</em> Maybe in BTC circles, but not in the democracies were the legislation was passed. </p>

<p>Umm - this is exactly what I&#39;m saying. That there is <em>nothing</em> stopping the gov&#39;t from going and making btc just like any other reserve currency.</p>

Truecrypt is only as secure as the tubes your transactions travel on, so I&#39;m not sure what sort of system designer you are pretending to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not asking for the vulnerabilities of the software protocol, I&#39;m asking for the vulnerabilities of the software protocol IMPLEMENTED AS <em>an international currency</em>. Unlike a paradigm where the currency is weighed upon the might of an army, btc rests upon nothing. Subsequently there is nothing that prevents it from being co-opted or squashed. Shit dude, you can counterfeit US dollars, but it&#39;s pretty stupid because you can&#39;t use them anywhere. Anytime you use a counterfeit dollar you run the risk of getting caught committing a federal crime. </p>

<p>If traditional btc is outlawed you can be sure that there would be nowhere useful to spend your bit coins. So I fail to see how an exposed block-chain is a defense against this type of &#39;attack&#39;.</p>

<p>So if you can&#39;t grasp the example of an international accord of state banks coming together, forking BTC and outlawing the previous implementation - don&#39;t bother responding. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not addressing the design of the cryptographic elements of btc (of which <em>none</em> of it is novel). </p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1r7iks/bitcoin_was_created_by_darpa_xpost_rbitcoin/cdkr0dy">here</a> is the conversation you are responding to. So that is where the question is asked. Feel free to pay attention </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t. It&#39;s the point I&#39;m making, regarding forking bitcoin into a new, private currency for groups of any size of similarly inclined people. Try to keep up.</p>

<p>Guess not.</p>

<p>If everyone moves to BTC then entire countries are BTC circles. Hopefully you get what I was responding with, now, <em>at the scale you asked it</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike a paradigm where the currency is weighed upon the might of an army, btc rests upon nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cryptocurrencies rest on the will, the volition, to use them, and their relative and mathematically assured scarcity. Relative compared to the US dollar, in that you can&#39;t just decide you&#39;re going to print a couple billion and introduce inflation.
You can counterfeit paper currency but you can&#39;t counterfeit cryptocurrency, so your point with the US dollar isn&#39;t relevant, possibly like the US dollar next century.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If traditional btc is outlawed you can be sure that there would be nowhere useful to spend your bit coins. So I fail to see how an exposed block-chain is a defense against this type of &#39;attack&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah that&#39;s because you haven&#39;t read what I&#39;m explaining, in talking about a concealed blockchain that&#39;s between private individuals, and I&#39;d like you to explain how and <strong>why</strong> this would be outlawed, because that &quot;if tradition btc is outlawed&quot; is a pretty f&#39;n big if.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d have understood that then you&#39;d have understood that what you&#39;re proposing (outlawing bitcoin or a variation of bitcoin) is unenforceable. Completely unenforceable against private parties using the methods I&#39;ve outlined.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you could if you wanted to, mate.</p>

<p>Then bitcoin loses it&#39;s anonymity if the law requires you to couple your wallets uuid with your social security info. Better start mining alternative cryptocoins if you want anonymity, and not blabbing about it.</p>

<p>You could start by forking the main bitcoin branch and working on it/using it from an <a href="https://cryptoanarchy.freed0m4all.net/wiki/Anonymous_hosting">anonymously rented vps</a>.</p>

<p>No, that is your ridiculous fantasy. I meant if the government adopted it as currency. Most people wouldn&#39;t know much about it, they&#39;d use it through their bank to buy shit just like they do with the numbers they see now.

<p>Yes, the <em>big f&#39;n if</em> is the ridiculous scenario created by the OP. And that&#39;s why I said, &#39;within the ridiculous scenario of the OP - what would happen?&#39; If the government adopted btc, it seems fairly obvious that alternative blockchains would be the equivalent of counterfeit currency and therefore <em>just as useful</em>.

<p>That&#39;s like saying you can&#39;t get caught with child pornography because it&#39;s encrypted. I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d stop acting so ridiculous. They nab cyber-criminals all the time, being smart enough to encrypt data doesn&#39;t make you dumb enough to trade it. How useful is that money if you can&#39;t trade it widely?

<p>Sure, you are entitled to your own opinion. But if you are suggesting that bitcoin is a novel cryptographic system to guarantee anonymity, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;d bother to continue to talk to you. As your own examples demonstrate that you must rely on <em>other</em> systems to hide your bitcoin identity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then bitcoin loses it&#39;s anonymity if the law requires you to couple your wallets uuid with your social security info. Better start mining alternative cryptocoins if you want anonymity, and not blabbing about it.</p>

<p>Right, and <em>very</em> few people are interested in bitcoin because of it&#39;s <em>anonymity</em>. I&#39;d say the most attractive feature of bitcoin is it&#39;s inflationary policy, which some might say &#39;beats the hell out of fed&#39;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like you can&#39;t stop jacking off to your own bitcoin-fantasy to realize you&#39;ve engaged yourself in a discussion about something more specific than whether &#39;bitcoin is totally cool or not&#39;.

<p>Like, I&#39;m sure there are anarchists <em>somewhere</em> that are willing to trade <em>anything</em> for either cheeseburgers or blow jobs, but that&#39;s an entirely different discussion from what I&#39;m having.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I asked a very specific question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not until a few posts in, and when I pointed that out you referred me to the OP, <em>who also wasn&#39;t asking it.</em></p>

<p>Bitcoin and as many forks as people want, on a global scale? Exactly the same as what we see today, and you can receive a salary and pension for helping. Governments can only regulate <em>around</em> it, not <em>through</em> the design of what exists today - its source is on too many computers to just put it back in the box, or they can curtail ordinary god-fearing joe schmuck from getting some perks from it through intimidation and brand loyalty to USGOV. So what. Fuckhim. The coward. Bitcoin as we know it isn&#39;t going into some magical legal box where we&#39;ll never see it again. That&#39;s not how distributed systems designed to be resilient against nuclear holocaust fucking work.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going to happen is more corporate entities out of silicon valley (spook R&amp;D territory <a href="http://steveblank.com/secret-history/">since WWII</a>) springing up to offer services around the Bitcoin protocol and it&#39;s nifty API. So that&#39;s even more salaries and pensions for working with the Bitcoin protocol. More on this <a href="http://startupboy.com/2013/11/07/bitcoin-the-internet-of-money/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Also, protocols evolve, networks extend into <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/ngc4921_colombari_3984.jpg">space</a>, and there&#39;s other habitable planets out there.</p>

<p>Think about other countries on other planets, their economies and periods for daylight synchronized with terran commerce (think ~800 years in future). <em>You need proof-of-work and a distributed ledger for this</em>. Which brings me back to my first point that bitcoin is a good starting point to fork from, and your enhancements can always be <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">merged</a> back into the original project, which is a safe way of ensuring only good mutations evolve in the dominant project. Cash isn&#39;t going anywhere and neither are <a href="http://gendal.wordpress.com/2013/11/24/a-simple-explanation-of-how-money-moves-around-the-banking-system/">networked currencies</a>. <strong>The money in your bank account has always only ever been a fixed point value in <a href="http://www.ibmsystemsmag.com/mainframe/casestudies/banking-finance/The-Database-Shuffle/">a database</a> somewhere.</strong></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The weight is on you to explain why the government would outlaw <em>forking a specific software project</em> (you are literally copying a directory. That&#39;s what forking is.), when there&#39;s no counterfeit coins coming out of it but a new currency entirely. What&#39;s &quot;common sense&quot; is that once you start making changes to a new project it is a new project, not a counterfeit copy of the original. Reckon the US govt made moves to outlaw the fucking euro because they&#39;re not dollars, too? Idiot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the US government currently allow any competitors to flourish in this country?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah it&#39;s awfully nice how the CIA is letting mexican cartels shift industrial quantities of coke to the US. Maybe they <em>wanted</em> the competition! Who knows?!</p>

<p>The internet isn&#39;t a country though fucktard it extends beyond borders and into space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Open Source doesn&#39;t mean jack shit. Somebody made it. It&#39;s only &quot;open source&quot; so they can get free work to fix any errors that may be in the code.</p>

<p>I believe in open source, VLC and Matroska and Linux are all proof that through cooperation and good will, we can make computer operating systems and programs free through community effort.</p>

<p>This, however, is entirely different. Bitcoin was made to &quot;free&quot; us from having to use dollars, so we could not be tracked.</p>

<p>Hmmmm, I wonder if the government would stand to benefit from a digital currency that can&#39;t be tracked and can be easily used to massively scam people...........................</p>

<p>2) I was an early adopter, I was mining back when you could make 2 coins a day. I don&#39;t have any more coins because I rode the short train to fun town and cashed out early, huge mistake financially but oh well, life happens.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t offer people any &quot;incentive&quot; to get rid of their coin because there is none, are you fucking kidding? It&#39;s like the easiest way to make money on the face of the planet if you know what you&#39;re doing, and my friend with the mining machine most definitely does, he is not cashing out any time soon.</p>

<p>Sell high, buy low, and keep on milking that cow.</p>

<p>3) Again, so what? If anything, this is more argument FOR bitcoin being made by DARPA/NSA because again, decentralized, off the books, anonymous, DO THE MATH.</p>

<p>The whole &quot;Liberal Freedom from Bankers Greed!&quot; is just a buzz phrase to get people who still have ideals to go along with it.</p>

<p>People that just want to make money off it could give a fuck less about your ideals, they just want MONEY.</p>

<p>Your &quot;few key features&quot; are not case enough to disprove this theory, which I view as one of the most credible theories on Bitcoin I have ever heard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) open source means you can see exactly what it does, how it works, how its monitorable, how secure it is, what privacy issues there may be. i&#39;d say that&#39;s a lot of &quot;shit&quot; and not jack shit. Used to massively scam people? LOL. Here&#39;s a hint: don&#39;t get scammed? Credit cards/paypal are vastly more scammable due to chargebacks. bitcoin has no &quot;take backsies&quot; on transactions. no takebacks means less customer support needed at banks, which leads to lower fees. lower fees on bitcoin means vendors who accept it can offer products cheaper, or profit more to innovate or buy hookers who cares.</p>

<p>2) 2 coins a day isn&#39;t &quot;early adopter&quot; i mean, anyone adopting it before now is earlier. I would say early bitcoin adopters are those who could cash out (ignoring ramifications of doing such) and never need to worry about money again, aka, mining 50 every few seconds/minutes/hours with a CPU and the default client. 2 a day makes it sound like you were using a pool (pools came YEARS in) </p>

<p>to me early adopters see this in their bitcoin-qt transaction logs:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/yNCgQ6q.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/yNCgQ6q.jpg</a></p>

<p>See how dumb you sound when you try and establish &quot;when&quot; you opted in as some sort of meaningful insight as to &quot;how correct&quot; you are? </p>

<p>This whole sell/buy mentality is a dead giveaway that you never actually adopted shit, you just traded it like baseball cards.</p>

<p>3) please explain as to how disruptive technologies that undermine the government are made by the government? You&#39;d be a little more credible if you said it was the commies or the terrorists that invented it, but not much more. or even that the shady black/grey markets are gov funded to discredit bitcoin as the &quot;drug terrorist kiddie porn currency&quot;... but the coin itself? Please explain why the gov would make a partially anonymous currency that allows someone to break so many laws, so easily, so long as they trust nothing? I&#39;d really like to know. More &quot;digital currency anti cash&quot; bullshit? BTC is far more anonymous than cash...</p>

<p>If you think this is argument is credible... logic, facts and reason aren&#39;t going to win you over... shrug</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) What&#39;s your point with open source? Duh that&#39;s how it works, just saying that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s some benevolent little start up like vlc or audacity.</p>

<p>2) Don&#39;t get scammed. Well okay, say that. Say that to all those people that got scammed through silk road where the site operators were caught running fraudulent accounts used to just straight up scam people and take their coins.</p>

<p>3) I started May 2011. That&#39;s pretty early into the game as your &quot;early&quot; definition has a date of &quot;12/?/2010&quot;. Yes, some people were able to cash out early on, others do buy low sell high strategies where they siphon off a certain portion of their coins to do so with while maintaining their reserves. There are many ways you can do bitcoin, it&#39;s a digital investment that can be a bit volatile.</p>

<p>4) The whole sell/buy mentality makes sense when you want to increase your investment. Buy a coin at 500, sell it at 620, buy more when they drop again.</p>

<p>5) Disruptive technologies that undermine the government are made by the government so that the government can get around having to follow its&#39; own laws. How much easier is it for them to make money off drugs through bitcoin than it is through their current MO trading guns and cash with terrorists.</p>

<p>The government made LSD and they still have the recipe, and the facilities to make it in. Hmmm, wonder if they could make money selling LSD on silkroad using bitcoins...............</p>

<p>Otay 0_o freedum &amp; liberty. I need to see a scale &amp; hands with no fingers influencing it. All I sniff is scales of reptiles whom according to you mined the shaft hard early. I postulate this early wealth gained could give them power to manipulate exchange rates to this non stable non money currency of a currency. I do love dragons &amp; lizards, but I do not let their predatory minds guide me to believe they of no harm to all those in their paths or mined lairs. How much loot has been lifted from the scales they built to place on their sides of it? exactly, openly &amp; precisely?</p>

<p>No need to answer the above ? marks, because their profits are not known.</p>

<p>I am cunning enough to postulate that the biggest miners could still mine &amp; manipulate the mine as long as the mine produces non solid [bytes] currency from non solid [fiat] currency. Decentralized does not mean no backdoor or manipulation can occur. I also postulate a backdoor encryption key is likely held by the key network players of this sporadic currency that cuts in on Rothschilds drug like market of non solid money. </p>

<p>Can people hack into the network with keys only they have?</p>

<p>If shit was hitting the fan &amp; the bitcoin was free falling could some with backdoor access gain access &amp; milk the system quicker than others? </p>

<p>Could they jam it for the common non network coin holders if the network controllers see fit to control the bit flow to their advantage?</p>

<p>The above is the intent of my ill choice of original wording you seek to discredit all my other words with.</p>

<p>By encryption key, I mean to imply that if the network is encrypted, how does no one have a key. Encryption can be opened with keys, broken to damage or corrupt, &amp; also hacked. In that sense keys to the flowing bits are possible are they not. If something is sent encrypted, it can be altered rerouted  slowed or read &amp; tampered with before reaching its destination.</p>

<p>I am not a computer genus &amp; seemingly picked my words in an ill manner. I make no claims to know fully how this complicated scheme works, just as I do not completely comprehend the feds currency scam. I hope that you discredit only the tiny portion of my words you call out &amp; I admit are a rushed ill choice of wording.</p>

<p>It is a non solid byte currency bought with non solid fiat dollars. This seems ill. I hope you &amp; others do not lose money that to me seems like a bet on bits. I do not gamble.</p>

<p>Yes. That is the entire point of a decentralized consensus network, after all.</p>

<p>I do think E gold, currency or wallets are risky &amp; hope all goes well for those that uses them. </p>

<p>I must restate I do not trust the shadow founder BS nor the potential for hacking abuse nor their following info site:
<a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/faq">http://bitcoin.org/en/faq</a></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Satoshi&#39;s anonymity often raised unjustified concerns&quot;</strong> No concerns people have are legit &amp; justifiable. Whom ever is writing that page sounds manipulatively ill of logic to tell people such questions are &quot;unjustified concerns&quot;. I find it ill that no ones name is attached to the pompous sounding FAQ &amp; feel it leads me &amp; likely others to postulate that the shadow dude could have wrote it.</p>

<p>I do not trust a non solid byte currency that is bought with a non solid fiat currency. </p>

<p>If bartering/goods backed it as money, I would see it as more safe &amp; solid. That would be a major dealeo to create &amp; manage, plus the FEDS would shut it down super quick. The fact that the FEDs are dragging feet to deal with bitcoin  &amp; are not going after it like hotcakes on a sunday morning after a marathon run, seems sketchy &amp; tells me the OP may be on to something about the feds being part of it. </p>

<p>I do feel strongly that unless the FED Parker bros types &amp; Rothpires have a hand in the control of it then it is doomed to fluctuation manipulation by them getting ton of coins &amp; working the network. I do feel that those ill entities make a global cabal that controls all big time drugs &amp; currency movements on their turfs. </p>

<p>I find the silk road dealeo to prove the direction of their hard on erection to fuck people that cut into their drug turf &amp; I see waves of internet surf threatened by a huge shark bigger &amp; bluer than a smurf on the horizon.

<p>That&#39;s the thing, because it is a distributed network that <em>anyone</em> can participate in, the network can never ever be shut down (without shutting down the entire internet). The FEDs aren&#39;t shutting it down because it&#39;s literally impossible to shut it down.</p>

<p>Also, because of the way the network was created, the code cannot be changed without a majority consensus of the network. Since the 21,000,000 hard limit of coins was built into the code, that is incredibly unlikely to change, because who would voluntarily devalue their own currency? Remember, the network (and therefore release of currency) is not owned by anyone and CAN&#39;T be owned by anyone due to its nature.</p>

<p>Sounds like once the limit is reached it becomes stagnant &amp; would gain insane value that could only rise &amp; not ever fall [if ill powers left it alone]. That is a scheme &amp; IMO not even a currency once the limit is reached. It would soon then become fractionalized so deep that .000000000000000000000000000000000001 = 1 dollar in value &amp; hard to work with for the little people &amp; an eternal gold mine for the big fat cats. That sounds like a pyramid scheme or trade in limited shredded religious relics feeding the greed of rich church leaders. You seem to know more than me on the subject &amp; it is interesting none the less. </p>

<p>I do hope all works out for small owners of bitcoins. I must admit I dislike all currency that is not backed in solid items with the same fury Gsus dude had when he [if he ever existed 0_o] attempted to cease Caesars flowage of coin by tax collectors, usury loaning &amp; shekel conversion by money changers on church/temple grounds.</p>

<p>I hope you stay safe. IMO you underestimate their power. I do appreciate you writing that out. I do not agree with most of it &amp; do not seek to argue. I was a nice read, thank you for sharing. </p>

<p>That it is solid bright nontarnishable &amp; brightly bold. It is slightly cold to the touch when skin first touches it. It can be rolled super thin &amp; is easy to fold into shapes. It melts @ lowish temps for molds. Since days of old, it has been used for things that are sold. All that told, it is not made of non solid bytes purchased with non solid fiat money.</p>

<p>Enjoy ;þ</p>

<p>Bitcoin has not been around long. The US Senate hearings went well, German gov. approved it, as well as the Chinese gov. yesterday. It IS gaining backing by more governments everyday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peter Schiff has also said he thinks Bitcoin is really just a bubble. People are hanging onto Bitcoins expecting them to go up but eventually people will dump them because they don&#39;t have any intrinsic value and Bitcoins don&#39;t have any other good features except for the fact you can spend them easily online.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, if Bitcoin becomes the new currency of choice, gold goes way down. His whole life has been invested into gold. Second, Bitcoins do have intrinsic value. There is a finite number of them and they can be used with less friction, more speed, and with lower fees than normal money. It is like saying the internet hold no intrinsic value, or google can&#39;t be a legitimate business because they don&#39;t sell a physical product. Just because numbers can&#39;t be held does not mean there is no intrinsic value.</p>

<p>Yes, but the issue with that right now, at this moment, is that intrinsic value is determined by whatever you cash them out into. I can&#39;t turn frogskins into bitoin, I have to go from cash (or other currency) to bitcoin to purchase it as an exchange medium. </p>

<p>As it stands right now, BTC is much like using the Euro or Kuwaiti Dinar in a country outside that zone, albeit with a both insanely high and volatile exchange rate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there isn&#39;t intrinsic value to ANYTHING if you take that semantic approach, so its redundant / condescending to state it. People confuse being backed by something an &#39;intrinsic&#39; value when they mean &#39;extrinsic&#39; ... see I can get all semantic n stuff, as well.</p>

<p>if the dollar was backed by gold, that doesn&#39;t mean the gold connection is inherent or within the dollar. And as shown, that connection is easily breakable since it is EXtrinsic.</p>

<p>At the outset of bitcoin, and for everyone who&#39;s ever generated a coin, the value of the coin was minimally tied to the amount of energy required to create it. People stopped mining when it was trivial to do so on CPU power because &quot;ugh my electric bill went up.&quot;</p>

<p>That was one of the foundational basis for a sort of &quot;auto-valuation,&quot; the cost of producing it.</p>

<p>X bitcoins are created based on total hashing power, and that power has a cost. A bitcoin costed that much on average.</p>

<p>So people went along with it and started USING IT and trading it based on that. This is why a 10,000 coin pizza was invented, 10,000 coins only cost that person some fraction of a pizza cost in electricity. The person who got the 10,000 coins wouldn&#39;t need to spend that electricity (though it was investing, novelty, and all that &quot;non intrinsic&quot; valuation that mattered even then.)</p>

<p>veering towards arguments over semantics is silly. are we going to start debating the tree falling in the woods making sound concept over &quot;essential properties that are inseparable from any thing&quot; vs. &quot;things are only the combination of their properties&quot; next?</p>

<p>Bottom line is it doesn&#39;t even have to be a &quot;currency&quot; it is a proof of work system. People assign value to whatever they want to, just because they do so doesn&#39;t imply anything about its essential nature. I can say my dirty socks are a currency too, and see what valuations that yields.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EDIT: Thank you to <a href="/u/the_hedgemon">/u/the_hedgemon</a> insisting that &quot;fiat&quot; applies to bitcoin I now take objection to the word &quot;fiat&quot; and the word &quot;currency&quot; being applied to bitcoin.</p>

<p>According to Blacks Law Dictionary &quot;Fiat Currency&quot; is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currency by official order whose value is based on the authorities ablity to pay. All currency is fiat currency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A bitcoin transaction is not &quot;an official order&quot; based on &quot;the authorities ability to pay&quot;.  In fact it has no value in traditional commerce, or in fact, because it is not a &quot;promise to pay&quot;.  What makes it into &quot;bitcoin&quot; is the <em>result</em> of a transaction, not the state of an unfinished transaction.  </p>

<p>Bitcoin only says you have a balance at an address if it is <em>verified as having already happened</em>.  No traditional monetary value is ascribed because it is not a debt.  Therefore it is not &quot;currency&quot;.  By law, by decree, by fiat all money must be an accounting of a debt, an unfinished transaction.</p>

<p>Also, it is not &quot;fiat&quot; currency either.  It is just a distributed accounting system with a publicly available ledger. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Original Comment</p>

<p>Fiat means force.  Nobody is forcing you to use it.  </p>

<p>Fiat does not mean worthless.  Bitcoin is not currency or money, nor is it a durable good.  </p>

<p>The most concise way I can describe bitcoin is as a positive-value public ledger of accounts.  Our currency is debt based, not positive valued.  So every transaction we do is at best a double-negative (you holding other people&#39;s debt to yourself instead of holding a store of real value).  Bitcoin cannot go negative.  The blockchain shows the creation of value, and the chain of credits associated with the transaction, but the balance of accounts is always 0 or positive.  </p>

<p>Bitcoin is a debt-free accounting system.  It is the inverse of our current system which only trades debt.  Bitcoin only trades positive values.  Also, our current system is all based on secrecy.  The Federal Reserve System has never been audited.  The regulators literally must guess how much USD is in ciruclation and make up interest rates hoping to move the economy in the intended direction.  But even they don&#39;t know how much is in circulation, or at what rate it is changing hands and therefore have no idea how much to print.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is public, it relies on the opposite of secrecy.  It does not necessarily expose your identity.  It is still pseudonymous.  But it is also public so you do have proof, and you also know as a user or as a regulator (I guess that would be a miner in this analogy) the exact status of the network and can make decisions, and base public policy (bitcoin protocol decisions) on real, live, substantive data.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is literally the inverse of Fiat currency, yet because our current system relies on a negative inversion of value, a positive value system appears to perform identically.  I.e. we have used an inverted negative value system for so long we no longer discern its true nature.  &quot;Debt IS Money&quot; as Orwellian as that literally and literately is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well lets look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency">Wiki</a> definition step by step and determine if it is a Fiat currency.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Has it been declared a government to be legal tender?
<a href="http://theinternationalforecaster.com/International_Forecaster_Weekly/Germany_Declares_Bitcoin_Legal_Tender">Yes</a> it has.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it fixed in value in terms of any objective standard? No, its not. I dont even need a link for this one if you know anything about BTC. </p></li>
<li><p>Does it have any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_theory_of_value">intrinsic</a> value?
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoins-have-no-value-2013-4">No</a> it does not.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So therefore, by definition, the bitcoin is a fiat currency. There isnt much to it. The only way it dodges the definition is it isn&#39;t provided or supplied by the government. Now if looking at this post we can agree that the BTC network was setup by DARPA and will eventually be used by the government, than the least we can agree on is if its not already being managed or mandated by the government, it will be soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went with the real definition instead of a colloquialism.</p>

<p>The word itself means &quot;by decree&quot;.  That is the one point where bitcoin differs from every fiat currency in existence.  </p>

<p>Once a government chooses bitcoin as its state-mandated legal tender I will accept &quot;fiat&quot; being used to describe it.  But the one thing that word means is antithetical to bitcoin itself.  </p>

<p>You are right.  It has no intrinsic value.  That does not mean that the word &quot;fiat&quot; is an accurate description.</p>

<p>Since we are talking about matters of law let&#39;s go with this legal definition of &quot;fiat&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currency by official order whose value is based on the authorities ablity to pay. All currency is fiat currency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By that definition bitcoin is not even a currency.  It is not an &quot;official&quot; order whose value is &quot;based on the authorities ability to pay&quot;.  </p>

<p>Bitcoin is not a promise to pay or an order by an authority.  It is just a public ledger of accounts, of values themselves, not value.  It records the VALUE transferred associated with a transaction.  It is not money.</p>

<p>When I send you a donut through the mail in exchange for 0.01 BTC the blockchain records that an amount of value or equity, here recorded as 0.01 arbitrary Bitcoin units, moved from you to me.  No money changed hands. Only a record in a distributed public record keeping software system.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you pushed the issue.  I had not realized by their rules bitcoin isn&#39;t even currency and cannot even be regulated with their existing rules. </p>

When the central banks print money to buy up all the bitcoins, of course the exchange rate of the bitcoin for the dollar goes to the moon - the bitcoin isn&#39;t just worth more, the dollar is worth less. Those at the top maintain their position simply by squeezing more value out of those at the bottom.</p>

<p>for any currency, digital or physical, fiat or not, to have a real diminishing effect on the existing central bank currency control structure, then users of that currency must <em>refuse</em> to trade it for fiat or goods produced through fiat financing. a group using the currency must communize and produce their own goods, using the new currency as an index of their own social relations, and essentially isolate itself from the outside fiat world. people must collectively stop using fiat altogether. when you see stories like &quot;guy bought 25$ of bitcoins then &#39;cashed them in&#39; for $600k to buy a house or whatever&quot; this behavior only hurts bitcoin and helps the banks. the story ought to be &quot;guy mines bitcoins, buys house with bitcoins&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure you can. All they have to do is move the decimal place. Bitcoin is by design infinitely divisible. Right now there are, what, 6 or 8 decimal places behind the zero you can divide it into. Make it 20, or 30. Or 500. 
I&#39;d think that would be similar to lopping a zero off of a denomination. Look at the Zimbabwe example, they devalued their currency by taking NINE zeros off the denomination, and still had 100 trillion dollar notes as an everyday small-purchase currency. 
It could easily become buying a cup of coffee for 0.00000000000000003BTC which is actually worth $3.50.</p>

<p>Just because something may not be manipulable by the Fed does not mean it&#39;s not manipulable by someone, in this case programmers absolutely no one knows and who have zero accountability AND would profit handsomely from such a move.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re saying still requires a centralized authority which Bitcoin does not have. Furthermore, Bitcoin was designed to be highly divisible down to many decimal places. The advantage of a digital currency is not having to worry about the denominations of physical media.</p>

<p>No single currency is immune to people hoarding it. There is always the ability to play the market especially when exchanges are involved, but that is fundamentally different than controlling the currency itself.</p>

<p>Everything you&#39;re saying relies on people caring about exchanging the Bitcoin with another currency. For now, that&#39;s required, but as more places accept it then that need goes away. If people&#39;s wages could be paid in bitcoins, goods and services purchased, and bills paid with it, it would be a non-issue.  </p>

<p>If people could come off the USD completely, then the Feds game would end. At any given moment you can know the exact amount of Bitcoins in circulation based on the block chain. You can&#39;t print more. Therefore, it&#39;d be easy to determine if your debt is really backed or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reserving the right to rebut any and all claims in your post in the future if I so desire, you do make one very profound point.</p>

<p>The people will demand it. </p>

<p>Even on the chance that everything else you said is false, you are absolutely correct about that point.  It is what they are used to.  It is what they expect.  And it is what they will demand once they realize that they are 100% responsible and liable for their own wealth.</p>

<p>The huge banks and governments will become the 51% mining pool (or 100% by decree), and will enforce all sorts of things to allow people to get redress through their government. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been saying for years that bitcoin is not money, it is not a commodity.  It is a public ledger which outlaws debt.</p>

<p>By law (protocol) no transaction can ever be in deficit.  Deficit is everywhere in our current economic system, in fact if you think about &quot;Debt IS Money&quot; enough you start to realize we don&#39;t use <em>any</em> positive values in our standard dual-entry bookkeeping systems of today.  </p>

<p>But in bitcoin there are no negative values.  Debits always equal or are less than credits in every single account.  Original credits only come into existence under limited, and publicly verifiable conditions.  Those original credits are positive values deposited into an account.  Then that account is debited equal or lesser amount and deposited to another account, which only increases in value.</p>

<p>No account can ever be in deficit, it can never be in debt.  The blockchain only records completed transactions.  If it is &quot;owed&quot; or &quot;pending&quot; or &quot;someday I&#39;ll send it&quot; then it&#39;s not bitcoin.  That&#39;s just a story you tell yourself to explain why coins that should be at one address are not there yet.  The public ledger shows the truth, and only the truth.  Equity is enforced.</p>

<p>Imagine if you had a law saying your books always at every single moment had to be up to date and balanced or you don&#39;t get to use money.  That you could never accept something you haven&#39;t paid for.  That is the future of &quot;one world currency&quot; bitcoin... unless extra-protocol means of enforcing liabilities and debts are added... as demanded by its users and/or the users of various government entities. </p>

<p>Wrappers will be build around bitcoin and bitcoin will become the way that banks and money changers transmit value to each other.  You and I will use our Visas and PayPals and no end user of &quot;money&quot; will need to understand what SHA-256 is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  The concept of debt and money causes the problem of the poor.  Without it, in a completely equitable world, ownership is replaced with stewardship.  </p>

<p>When you remove the concept of &quot;debt&quot; you remove the concept of being &quot;owed&quot;.  When nothing can be owed, it is what it is.  Things are where they are and they move when they move.  </p>

<p>Bitcoin is a perfect inverse analogy for our current monetary model.  We use debt-as-money debts-to-me as &quot;money&quot;.  Bitcoin cannot be &quot;in debt&quot;, it is only indicating credits to accounts, or positive values.</p>

<p>It is easy to misunderstand our current system as being a positive value system instead of a double-negative value accounting system.  If you see our current system as positive value money then bitcoin is just another type of &quot;money&quot;.  </p>

<p>But in bitcoin things are where they are, until they move.  There is no concept of debt or being owed anything.  Only proof of where everything is right now as of this block of time. </p>

<p>Bitcoin illustrates the illusion of debt.  It has the ability to belie the inherent lie of liabilities by prohibiting them in the protocol itself.  Sure, you can say &quot;I owe you 35 BTC&quot; on a piece of paper, but that&#39;s traditional &quot;money&quot;, or debts.  It&#39;s not bitcoin because it does not adhere to the protocol.</p>

<p>If I have food and you don&#39;t that doesn&#39;t mean anything.  I&#39;m not owed that food.  I simply have it.  And I can move it to another &quot;account&quot;.  And then it will be there.  In reality there are no debts.  Even the common recited principle of a vacuum thwarts the assertion that imbalance are natural.</p>

<p>You are not owed anything.  You are entitled to nothing.  The very assertion that you &quot;own&quot; or are &quot;owed&quot; something is itself a lie.  And our ability to lie allows us to incur or create liabilities in a debt based money system.  In a fabrication of human ingenuity.  </p>

<p>In reality nobody is poor.  The concept would perish if the concept of money and traditional models of wealth were abolished or superseded.  </p>

<p>It is the very idea that someone can rightfully and ethically withhold necessary resources from another human being that precipitates the systems of enforced and controlled scarcity that plagues our logistical processes in modern day commerce.  They say there is enough food produced to feed every human being on the planet, yet for some reason people believe they are entitled to let it rot rather than alleviate the suffering of another human being. </p>

<p>Once you remove the concept of debt.  Once you realize there is only what there is and debt is a human fabrication, then the ideas of greed and induced scarcity become abhorrent.  Only by making such ideas a fundamental aspect of society can you justify the means and systems for enforcing and perpetuating profitable scarcity and imbalance.  </p>

<p>Without the concept of debt it is much harder to &quot;enslave&quot; a population of people.  Debt is enslavement.  It always has been.  Even today your actions can be compelled because of your promise written on a piece of paper and signed by you.  Indentured Servitude is still alive and well, it just changed its name. </p>

<p>Forgiveness is the opposite of debt.  It is &quot;giving at the start&quot;.  Giving be&quot;fore&quot;.  When I give you $20 and later you say you can&#39;t pay me back I say &quot;I forgive you&quot;, meaning, &quot;At the start it was a gift&quot;.</p>

<p>Instead of forgiveness being something on the back-end of an agreement, in a debt-free world, everything would be given freely from the start and any remuneration would be voluntary and an expression of gratitude.  </p>

<p>In a no deficit would there would only be forgiveness.  I think I would eagerly seek out such a world to live in.  In fact, I might actually take actions to perpetuate such a world.  A world without poverty, where everyone who has, shares, and those who do not have, benefit greatly from the abundance and generosity of a forgiving society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about a &quot;money free&quot; economy?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m working to set up small scale models of currency-free trading systems operating as cooperative associations.  At first the commodities will be limited to specific classifications to ensure liquidity of commodities in the trade engine, however the ultimate goal is to have an open source distribution that acts as a Depot or Marketplace of sorts, providing all of the infrastructure for vendors to effect trade.  </p>

<p>The marketplace would be one &quot;server&quot; managed by a person or association.  That person could set their rates and charge fees for their services.  For example they may charge 12 eggs per month to allow another person to rent a &quot;store&quot; where that person lists their goods for sale, and the marketplace may even offer storage and order fulfillment services.  Inventory management, labeling, and accounting services could be offered by the marketplace too.</p>

<p>An individual starting to trade in this system without any credibility would rely on someone with established presence, such as the owner of a marketplace, to vouch for them.  Marketplaces as well as individuals gain credibility and communities form.  These communities trade among each other and everything is tracked in real goods.</p>

<p>The key here is to treat every commodity as a currency.  In the past they did this and they were using pen and paper.  Today we have amazing computers to do the math for us faster than we could ever imagine doing by hand.  </p>

<p>In the past they used currency and certificates of debt as an intermediate currency to simplify the number of accounts and currencies they had to deal in.  But we just conflate &quot;currency&quot; and &quot;commodity&quot; and the result is simply a modern day stock market style system.  </p>

<p>A solid trade matching engine will be critical.  On a small scale I can write something in PHP that does basic array sorting to match hundreds of items, but a real trade engine with a distributed database and parallel trade match simulation processes working to optimize the results will have to be built to allow the idea to scale much larger than a few hundred users. </p>

<p>This is all theoretical though.  I understand the technical side of it, but the accounting stuff is still a bit rough for me.  And this is all just a huge accounting system with a commodity trading interface tacked on top.</p>

<p>As an example of a currency-free cooperative you can <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cooperatives/comments/1ral5b/im_teaching_myself_double_entry_bookkeeping_to/">look at my question</a> over in <a href="/r/cooperatives">/r/cooperatives</a> about keeping proper accounting in a scenario where currency is not used but equitable distribution of assets is desired. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not hocus pocus really, the technology is interesting however the human element is predictable - it&#39;s a new currency/store of value type thing so it&#39;s evolving right now. The bubble/crash stuff is more a byproduct of market psychology, as the value is overinflated by speculators and people overinvesting, then realising there isn&#39;t much they can do with it, then they sell again etc. it behaves like a stock in many regards.</p>

<p>At this point in time, it will take <strong>serious</strong> effort to get it to his 10000 or drop to 0.001. Stuff like &quot;half the population buys some bitcoins right now&quot; or &quot;a fundamental flaw in the bitcoin protocol allowed a hacker to shut down the whole system&quot;. Its value is largely dominated by herd movement rather than actual utility value (which is considerable but not quite yet $10,000 considerable if you know what I mean).</p>

<p>Seriously though, there are inherent conditions on currencies that can&#39;t be circumvented. If you circulate any currency, it can work just as well as the dollar if enough people believe in it and use it. It doesn&#39;t have to be backed by anything. Bitcoin also replaces the dollar in reverse proportion, i.e. for every unit Bitcoin goes up in value, the dollar drops just as much.</p>

<p>This leads only to two conclusions: either TPTB have to take control over the currency if it really is open source, or they have been in control over it from the beginning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; That&#39;s why we see things like Greenlist written into law without a mention of bitcoin until recently.&quot;</p>

<p>Wait, there are greenlist laws already? Interesting, are you claiming that there&#39;s some sort of shadow law creation that passes laws &#39;for reals&#39; and the public, verifiable, and precedent based/setting laws are pretend?</p>

<p>Global ACH has pretty much nothing to do with bitcoin. I work on B2B systems and their entire point for a global ACH is to stop &quot;Bank of LOL Zimbabwe&quot; from defrauding people since there is no standardization of security.</p>

<p>You are aware that right now certain banks in Canada will not accept non-chipped US credit cards? Certain payment processors will not accept certain african, asian and european transactions by default?</p>

<p>this adds up to increased fees since they have to build their OWN network of trust, aka, centralized point of failure.</p>

<p>Having 1 protocol for transactions is not &quot;lack of freedom&quot; because if there were 2, all you&#39;d end up with is more ways to stop freedom. Pretty simple. </p>

<p>big bad gov will exist and censor external freedoms in your paranoiac uneducated scenario if there are 1 payment systems or 2 or 100.</p>

<p>I find it hilarious that you can&#39;t see bitcoin as an antidote to centralized banking, which was the central conspiracy tenet? Your claim is that it makes it actually MORE centralized? Except, of course, for all of the fees and anonymity? LOL...</p>

<p>your post reads like &quot;bitcoin sucks because its actually the governments creation even though it completely thwarts gov meddling so don&#39;t use it ok??? signed, not_an_agent&quot;</p>

<p>No, there wasn&#39;t. Most of this post is completely random rambling without any actual facts, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>There was <em>one</em> company that&#39;s barely in start up that is planning a greenlist scam, and pretty much every bitcoin user is against them (the whole sub BLEW UP with anti-CoInvalidation stuff after it came to light).</p>

<p>There&#39;s no greenlist law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My own belief is that govs have not played their hand yet, unless their hand is &quot;false flagging&quot; illegal operations regarding bitcoin (linking it to kiddie porn, drug, piracy, mob currency).</p>

<p>They can easily step in and curtail it from the inside out: their biggest roadblocks will not be to the software and network internals, it will be in curbing adoption via laws and policies. For example they could set laws that prohibit tax-incentivized companies from using it. This would be profitable if the number of large companies that jump ship for greener pastures (districts without those laws) are trumped by the mid- small- companies that are not so agile.</p>

<p>saying &quot;lol you can&#39;t stop bitcoin&quot; is ignoring the pressure and power the government has to stop its adoption. it is actually very similar to the stranglehold microsoft has on enterprises... the discounts they give to certain institutions can&#39;t be matched by other companies, and so its either go with ms or lose this sort of &quot;funding.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m waiting to see these gauntlets drop, when non-profits start to accept bitcoin only to find a year later their audits are revealing things that cause them to mysteriously lose gov aid/funding.</p>

<p>1 subway franchise accepting bitcoin is interesting PR until subway loses their sweetheart credit processing deal that they upcharge to franchises due to it, you&#39;ll see those franchise contracts change in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for a good consp. theory, but i think the gov is more likely to stall things under the guise of &quot;chin scratching investigation&quot; when they&#39;re really buying time to fortify positions.</p>

<p>Does anyone honestly think successful capitalists are trying to do anything other than maximize their own profits? That should be obvious, I&#39;d hope. If there is any potential for profit here (hard to argue with +4,000% even if it is the biggest scam in the world) you&#39;d see all sorts of experiments (how much money can we make honeypotting a TOR based drug empire / laundering network / exchange).</p>

<p>Especially since the government can easily EASILY EAAAAAAAAAAAASILY buy in to bitcoin and crush it under its own thumb by mining themselves, or draining the coins with $$$ assigned to &quot;black budgets.&quot;</p>

<p>There are so many ridiculous points of failure on the system that are so obvious, its a bit silly. Are you telling me the US gov doesn&#39;t have the power to completely take over bitcoin via $$$ or computing power? Looool.</p>

<p>It should be a standard sidebar link in r/bitcoin.</p>

<p>I did not however see a reference to a computationally distributed blockchain to prevent doublespends but I did see a reference to a database of spent coins which is in a way a blockchain - just not p2p  or computationally intensive to prevent duplication.</p>

<p>anyway. fascinating intereting history to know the NSA was working on this stuff that long before 2009.</p>

<p>Not because it&#39;s a fork of the original, but because the original works and is a good starting point, as opposed to starting from the ground up. A general rule of software engineering is &quot;Don&#39;t roll your own crypto&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you have any concept of what this means in the context of software development? Because it doesn&#39;t really apply to what you are talking about in regards to btc. Cash is incredibly more anonymous compared to btc which offers a trace of one&#39;s actions. The difficulty of identifying a person and their btc accounts has nothing to do with any &#39;cryptographic designs&#39; in btc. Imagine if the gov&#39;t forced any entity that converted btc to dollars to demand identifying information from their customers. Blammo - no more anonymity in btc-land.</p>

<p>If a number of large nation-states agreed to use btc as the core of a new international transaction network, do you think those nation-states are going to let their citizens trade in competing btc implementations? Do you think the businesses in those nation-states will use the gov&#39;t supported btc, or the free-btc?</p>

<p>The OP might be ridiculous, however, I was asking if anyone could, in the op&#39;s scenario, demonstrate how BTC is inherently secured against such attacks. So far you&#39;ve suggested that it&#39;s self-evident. However, I don&#39;t think that is realistic. In fact, it&#39;s damn naive. To go with an example often used by libertarian btc fans, the dollar is backed by guns. Well, I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d think the guns would suddenly disappear with any nation/state-adopted future-currency, cryptographic or otherwise.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not something I give a shit about, but it would make an entire nation a circle of bitcoin users, too, wouldn&#39;t it.</p>

<p>Also when you say &quot;the government&quot;, you mean the US government. Not everyone you talk to online is from the states.</p>

<p>Listen rather than having a conversation to yourself. You have <em>two</em> ears and <em>one</em> mouth.</p>

<p>Nope they&#39;d be alternatives, not counterfeit bitcoins (good luck with that). Wouldn&#39;t outlaw it. I&#39;ve made my points on this and I rest my case, because you can&#39;t even figure this out for yourself.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even use bitcoin, I find it (and electronic countermeasures) interesting, and I don&#39;t see you espousing <strong>anything</strong> useful. If you&#39;re not busy completely failing to receive incoming signals you&#39;re busy being an arsehole.</p>
