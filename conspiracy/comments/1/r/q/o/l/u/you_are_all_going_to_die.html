    <div class="md"><p>Mayhaps. I am prepared to the semi best of my ability. I understand that there are things,considerations I cannot conceive of. I was trying to be short and sweet with my sentiment, but I can elaborate. Do what you like and love. Provided it doesn&#39;t hurt others. There are a myriad of potential threats and bad people in this life that would love to take advantage of you. Protect yourself, but don&#39;t live in fear. I can go on....but I won&#39;t. Just trying to express, things will happens as they will. Personal cultivation and determination will be the deciding factor, on how you deal with where the chips fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hard time not posting walls of text too. There an alarming amount power in the hands of the people who take advantage of and are grateful for free will and love. People do this based on what you said about the things they have.</p>

<p>The people who pretend to be in power, i&#39;m assuming, don&#39;t even act in their own interests and free will. They&#39;ve been manipulated and have made a deal with the devil in a way. People are also manipulated and they do those things out of free will and love, but are led down a dark path.</p>

<p>The world will become a better, more peaceful, happier, and enjoyable place; this will make the people who think they&#39;re in power think they&#39;re losing power. Once those who pretend to be in power think they&#39;re losing their fake power, there will be costs. Therefore, yes, it will be a tough ride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  We know this.  We are <em>definitely</em> all going to die.  It&#39;s called &quot;Not Being Immortal&quot;.  Considering how shitty this planet is, that we are all going to die is actually an AWESOME thing.  It&#39;s actually a great thing.  You see, this planet is, for the most part, little more than a prison designed to teach the beings living in it the lessons that are necessary in order to develop further and go beyond its rungs.  All this is to say that the sooner one can move and develop beyond it (which almost always necessarily involves that thing which most human beings call &quot;physical death&quot;) the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all given free will. I do believe we came from God and we&#39;re going back to God. The world is a passing thing along our bodies. Feed the spirit, that is where eternal life is. Wherever Christ is that&#39;s where I go. A place incorruptible, permanent peace, immeasurable joy, the source of all truth. I already feel it. A blessing especially in such confusing and troubled times. </p>

<p>I lived for myself for a long time. I realize that humans are inherently unreliable. Now I give myself to God. I understand your philosophy completely, but I&#39;m telling you sometimes a person has got to pray, and more than that they need an answer to their prayers. I joined a prayer group, it doesn&#39;t just change you I&#39;ve already experienced miracles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, just messing with you. On a serious note, and I mean no offense, your post sorta made me picture someone explaining to a group of sheep that they need to keep being sheep. What&#39;s the point? Of course they&#39;ll keep being sheep, it&#39;s the only reality they know. Even if there&#39;s a minority with slightly more awareness of their situation, they already feel impotent (just knowing a fence exists doesn&#39;t make you any less trapped), so you&#39;re preaching to the choir with those guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with ya there bro. Just doubt a message of self empowerment will find much of an audience among a group filled with individuals who may or may not believe the Illuminati was responsible for that flat tire they got on the way to a job interview 20 years ago, because they clearly feared his raw talent and ambition... How else to explain the dead end job and run down trailer? Lack of persistence or strong work ethic? Pshh fuck that, taking personal responsibility&#39;s hard. Nope, definitely the Illuminati. </p>

<p>I have more than zero as it is, and can easily handle the truth as soon as we find it out. Some are happy flipping channels, and others seek the truth about the world around them - like looking for light in a tunnel or searching for a hidden medallion. I really don&#39;t care what others do with their time, but I am happiest keeping an eye on the sociopaths running our world, and am intrigued by the lizard species in general.</p>
