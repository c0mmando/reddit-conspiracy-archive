       I believe in treating people as they treat others when it comes to censorship. given the bans that are happening in other subs is chasing everyone here, I believe this may be the only answer.

       edit:
       <strong>
        the problem is they can ban people here in r/conspiracy I am now shadow banned everywhere and no mod will do anything about it. so goodby reddit, you all are fucked if you let this to continue, this is sure not a place for free speech.

       Being banned doesn't specifically mean you can't read the sub. I got banned from
       <a href="/r/guns">
        /r/guns

       because I posted an image in the Great No Image Crusade of 2013. I can still see their posts.

       ya, but it is something to do against the control freaks that want to rule the world.

       A lot of fucking assholes posting from these subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of banning OP and Amos_Quitos the mods here should be banning all these trolls who have appeared and whose main goal is to disrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no wonder the two big dramas over the last month occurred after a critical comment about Israel was promoted and then over a discussion over the number of dead during WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       These propagandists want to shut down legitimate debate on these subjects.

       He engaged in black propaganda here . . . he posted a anti Jewish caricature of a Jew and then went to conspiratard and subredditdrama and posted the images as "proof" that this sub is racist.

       He engages in getting brigades to come here.  And he generally focuses on trolling this sub and engaging in propaganda fights (most on Zionist issues but also anti conspiracy theory propaganda) on the prominent subs he helps control.

       Just stop being afraid. If you encounter reprisal, push through it. Focus on the positive.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who do those things which we are discussing here, attract negative things into their lives. Don't get sucked into their dark world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing to do is to ignore those people, don't even respond, don't waste your energy or time arguing w/them or giving them their own medicine. It's also important to forgive them and be cool with them. You and me can post stuff and discuss stuff and continue to do so. Make a new account if you get banned, you'll still be able to discuss it. If stuff gets down voted because of shrills or fake accounts, the down votes are not real, and the ones that are real suffer from vote inflation. // vote inflation ....

        sinister grin
       </em>
       i hope this becomes a new term in this community
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you see my point, and I hope it helps. Don't let things like the stuff we're discussing disturb you. The basis of Reddit is for the community to get together and share information; if that's still going on, we're good.

       I keep seeing posts like this from these guys. Nearly all are childish bitching and flaming. I just found out about the bans about a hour ago and just by doing a few minutes of reading came to the conclusion that the banners/conspiritard guys are self centered bitchers who don't like anyone who dies not agree with them. No calm debating or using facts. They just go on the attack and spew word vomit in every direction.

       They should ban all his friends in conspiratard.  That whole sub, as well as similar subs like subredditdrama where bipolarbear and his friends hang out, is primarily focused on trolling this place.

       Banning people from subs only prevents them from submitting/voting. They can still read it like normal though. And even if he was banned it's trivial to just hit the log out button.

       They should ban anyone who cross posts in conspiratard.  The primary purpose of that sub is to troll this place.  The mods here let BipolarBear's and douglasmacarthur's friends run rampant here.  They brigade posts and are generally assholes.

       Wow that is some poor concern trolling. You are currently defending a holoocaust denier, you spend all you time harrassing a Jew and when people call you out on it you act like they're anti-semitic. Surely you can think of a way to do this without looking quite as much of a liar?

       Why are you literally defending Amos_quito, who has denied the holocaust before? Surely since this is a huge thing for you and since for years you have accused others of being anti-semitic with no evidence while keeping strange company ... surely you will stop defending and supporting him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just feels like you can't really play that lie anymore when you are literally defending an anti-semite by making up lies about a Jew. And what is that link supposed to prove other than your anti-semitic agenda?

       That doesn't change his support of holocaust deniers and why he actively works so hard to attack anybody who calls out anti-semitism. There are plenty of racists who have a black friend, it doesn't really change what they are.

       Antisemitism (also spelled anti-semitism or anti-Semitism) is prejudice, hatred of, or discrimination against Jews for reasons connected to their Jewish heritage. A person who holds such positions is called an "antisemite". It is a form of racism.

       BipolarBear is a conspiratard asshole who mods places like

       and
       <a href="/r/SyrianCivilWar">

       and
       <a href="/r/restorethefourth">
        /r/restorethefourth
       </a>
       .  He's a Jewish Zionist asshole who has posted anti Jewish posts here in order to try to prove that this sub is "racist."  He banned people in the subs he moderates for their posts in this sub under the pretext of "racism."
      </p>
      <p>
       He was also active in
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">
        /r/subredditdrama
       </a>
       and defended the idea that all 200,000 users of this sub should be banned from ever appearing in
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       because of "racism" here.  Of course the "racism" he was arguing against in that subbredditdrama fight involved a user's comment about racist treatment of Israelis toward Palestinians.  It's "racist" to complain of Israeli/Jewish racism against Arabs I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods here are also actually in collusion with BipolarBear and have done nothing to defend this sub against attacks by these people and instead are banning the people complaining of these actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       These various dramas reveal that all of reddit is compromised and its purpose is to engage in propaganda (especially Zionist propaganda).

       That wasn't the short version but oh well it's a convoluted story.

       Saying the N word has nothing to do with what Amos_Quitos did.  That would be a good analogy if he would have used the K word for instance.  But instead, he claimed Jews are milking the Holocaust, or are the squeaky wheel getting the grease.  The thread involved some of the other 70 million victims of WWII (and specifically was about 5 million non Jews killed by the Germans in camps).  A better analogy would be if he said blacks were milking slavery.  It might not be true, but I hardly think it would warrant being censored and banning him for racism.

       No.  Not necessarily.  Just like I wouldn't think it's necessarily racist to allege any group is behaving in a similar way.  Zionists often make this claim about Arabs . . . that they milk their deaths and milk the Palestinian issue.

       You're just using "holocaust denier" to shut down debate.  That film linked in the "holocasut hoax proof" thread accepts that Jews were put in camps and many were killed.  It doesn't deny that part of the "Holocaust" story.  It disputes the idea that there were homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz and shows how this may be a hoax.  Others like David Cole and Ernst Zuendel and many other revisionists have made these same claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amos_Quitos was supporting asking critical questions.  What do you have to fear about these questions that you need to work so hard to shut them down?

      <p>
       It is not racist to ask questions about historical fact.

       And you're wrong about the "rant about Israel."  It's hilarious you call that circlejerking.  Why would it be so high on bestof if that were the case?  Also, no wonder the propaganda operatives have now gamed it so the rebuttals are so prominent.  You guys work really hard at fighting any negative comments about Israel.

       ah okay so you're a bit of a holocaust denier too. I don't see why you would think that the Jews would lie, and for some reason not a single nazi mentioned these things during the trials. They all seemed to think it happened as was said. I love that you're defending a movie called "holocaust hoax proof!" that contains no proof. There were definitely gas chambers and to question things likie that is an attempt to minimise the suffering so you don't have to feel so bad about hating those damn jews you're so paranoid about.

       Ernst Christof Friedrich Zündel (born April 24, 1939) is a German[1][2] Holocaust denier[3][4] and pamphleteer. He has been jailed several times: in Canada for publishing literature "likely to incite hatred against an identifiable group", and on charges of being a threat to national security; in the United States, of overstaying his visa; and in Germany for charges of "inciting racial hatred".[5][6][7] He lived in Canada from 1958 to 2000.

       Sounds like a great guy. David Cole seems to also be a bit of a holocaust denier nutjob. I don't get it, there is no historical basis to doubt that it happened. Did the Jews go in and build fake gas chambers after the war? How on earth is this not anti-semitic?

       You are pretty paranoid if you think that I have any stake in the israel/palestine conflict or I'm somehow working for them. I just think holocaust denial is pretty insensitive and don't think BipolarBear deserves a witchhunt from a holocaust denier (or "Questioner" as if thats somehow less offensive sounding). And people actually seeing the mindless and vaguely anti-semitic "omg jews are so bad!" post from

       for what it is is not "vote gaming". You need to work on that paranoia my friend.

Oh and the idiot's "I'm not Jewish" LMAO! You don't have to be Jewish to be a Zionist. A lot of the radical Neo Cons in Washington are Zionists. They just don't advertise it past the enormous amount of aid we give to Israel that they use to murder and torture Palestinians. That's not anti semite that's anti murderous, land stealing bastards.

       HAHAH. You conspiracy theorists and your youtube videos. You know that's not real evidence right? This is the guy who thinks Zyklon B was a disinfectant right? And so do you think that the jews were not killed then? (in which case you're denying the holocaust). If so, why do you think it's okay to minimise their suffering and talk shit about them if they didn't die in a gas chamber? If they were killed by firing squad or starvation, is it somehow less of a tragedy? I would definitely think the people who run the museum aspect of Auschwitz would probably touch up the chambers make 'em look more scary. Maybe "This way to the gas chambers!" on a big sign. But I don't see how this is proof that the holocaust didn't happen.

       This is a big claim. You're saying the "official historians" of Auswitz (I guess the concentration camp had a college attached or something) all agree gas chambers didn't exist. Can you back this up? Do you mean historians from auschwitz or any historian who has ever looked at it? Historians agree that not all the camps had gas chambers, but you will have to link me to this consensus about there being no gas chambers.

       Since your Dr Cole admits there was Zyklon B, we can deal with that, since it's been debunked for such a long time.

       You would think there would be more information about the chain of custody of some of this primary evidence of homicidal gas chambers but David Cole has done the best job of asking critical questions.  Like how did the Soviets and Poles know how to "recreate" the chambers in their present state?  As I'm sure you are aware most historians are fearful of asking too many questions lest nutjobs like you hound them and target them and their families.

       You really are ignorant.

It was used on both insects and small rodents.  Hell, it's even admitted by the "official" Polish historians that HCN was used on clothing at Aushwitz!  It was used in the German army in WWI.

       Do you have any proof that the letter was forged except for sheer desire and pure hatred of Jews and your ability to assume that they are behind EVERYTHING? "so much different to his earlier work" - how so? because it doesn't agree with you? You can't just say that the letter is fake with absolutely no argument behind it, that is not how evidence works.

      <p>
       You are really far down the anti-semitic nazi propaganda chain it seems.  I'm not sure why you think several youtube videos of the same single person making the same claim is evidence. It's just a single person. You are saying that the "chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz State Museum" is the only person who has knowledge of the holocaust and everybody elses historical analysis is incorrect. Do you agree that Zyklon B was used? Who can support this guys story?

       In any case, you going on a huge rant about how the Jews spread lies about the holocaust in order to gain sympathy (because why else would they build fake gas chambers) kinda just proves the anti-semitism here. You're not explicitly saying "I hate jews" and to you that somehow changes the meaning entirely, but we know what all your arguments are just pieces of information collected from your youtube propaganda videos over time compiled into one giant holocaust denying bubble, in which you try to minimise the suffering Jews went through during the holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did you refer to youtube videos as "studies"? Is that really what passes for peer reviewed evidence in conspiracy? David cole retracted his claims and was wrong about the Zyklon B. So why would I put any stock on an interview he did with a single person who works at the museum?

       <em>
        but coerced
       </em>
       .  His
       <em>
        life was threatened by nutjobs like you!
       </em>
       You spread your hate around on places like reddit and encourage an environment where simply asking questions, like David Cole did, targets him for assassination, career suicide, and exposure to nutjobs like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty clear if he were truly going to recant he wouldn't write the very group that threatened him.  He would write it to more reasonable people.  If I ever changed my opinion on the gas chambers I wouldn't crawl to you and write an apology letter to you.  I would have made my mistake in good faith and so I would recant to reasonable people that treated me with respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cole's letter is obviously coerced and he has since pretty much disappeared and not talked about the subject.  If you follow his work it's
       <strong>
        obvious
       </strong>
       that his recantation is so directly opposite to his whole analytical approach that it is not sincere.  The man probably literally had a gun to his head held by some nutjob Zionist conpsiratard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, unlike you I am able to deal with contrary information.  The Markiewicz et al. study you cited from 1994 has been revealed to be a scientific fraud:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v20/v20n2p-3_Rudolf.html#24941">
        http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v20/v20n2p-3_Rudolf.html#24941
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't even test for iron cyanides (the Prussian blue) and thus rigged the tests.  Plus, the initial test results from 1991 confirmed Leuchter's findings but they threw those out and got 1994 results that differed from Leuchter's results in some respects.  But these are flawed for the aforementioned reason and do not prove HCN in the alleged homicidal chambers.

       I do no such thing.  As David Cole so eloquently puts it, telling the truth about what happened is in no way minimizing the horrors that happened to Jews during WWII.  In fact, you do Jews more of a disservice by engaging in bullying propaganda and lies.

       I see that the study has been proven false, well Ill take your word for it because I can't be bothered reading through that guys entire study as he's got the same "hey, i'm just asking questions stop oppressing me!" vibe to his tone like you do. I do not think this proves that Zyklon B is a disinfectant as David Cole claims. I don't think this proves that all the photos of auschwitz are faked or that it Jews were not exterminated en masse.

       People saying things isn't a fact. Him offering to give him to look at some prop doors (??) doesn't really change how bizarre this conspiracy is. Why would the soviets go in and build fake gas chambers? to build sympathy for the Jews? This is all pretty tin foil hatty my friend. What does this prove? That the Jews might have been killed in a different way? We already know that not every camp had gas chambers.

       You can't angrily yell about zionists in a paranoid manner and then just claim to be an unbiased historian looking at the details. You are looking to fit a preconcieved idea. And so is this guy on this website. Look at the language he is using:
      </p>
      <p>
       " Samuel Crowell has unearthed material on air raid shelters built by the SS to protect inmates from Allied air raids. Hans Lamker and Hans Nowak have shown in detail how the SS installed modern (and highly) expensive microwave delousing facilities to protect the lives of inmates."
      </p>
      <p>
       "See! Hitler and the Jews actually got a long, he wasn't really as mean to them as they say. So, would you like to hear more about the evils of Zionism?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a cheap way to attack israel by cherry picking at information you can dig up, of which there is a lot due to nazi propaganda and general anti-semitism.

       I've seen some pretty terrible photographs of Auschwitz, I suppose they were all created by some strange ancient russian photoshop?

       Again, why would Jews need to fake being gassed to death? I'm pretty sure that didn't give them the political push they needed to set up Israel, and I'm pretty sure it's still an absolute terrible event and an attempt to exterminate an entire group of people, of which 5-7 million were killed.

       That is some real self-importance you've got going on there man. I guess you feel really justified in these "I'm just asking questions about wherther it really happened how they said or whether the Jews actually had a great time at the camps, how is that offensive?" rants.

       This is great evidence of your anti-semitism. I'm an Australian. I've never even met a JEwish person actually, and I disagree heavily with Israel's policies. BUt in your mind, I work for the "holocaust industry". Even just the words "holocaust industry" are ridiculously anti-semitic, but you actually go one further and think everybody who disagrees with you is involved. I can see why this persecution complex and seeing jews everywhere might lead to you having an irrational fear of something you do not understand, and cause you to go looking for answers on neo-nazi-related websites.

       It's also constantly attacked by neo-nazi's and gullible propagandists like yourself who rail against it harder than the neoconfederates who pretend the civil war wasn't about slavery. Seriously, there is no other historical fact that gets this much scrutiny and gets "doubted" based on tiny bits of anecdotal evidence. And it's entirely because of the anti-semitism that you and others exhibit.

       I am just a guy from AUstralia. The fact that you see Zionist shills everywhere is just more evidence of your "omg the jews are everywhere" anti-semitism. You even seem to think SRD, a place entirely devoted to mocking idiots oin reddit, is "full of Zionist shills."

      <p>
       I think we've solved it. Conspiracy don't think they're anti-semites, they think that anti-semites are 100% right and therefore not anti-semites. They disagree with anything that does not support their beliefs, and that's why you literally only believe information given to you by other anti-semites and famous anti-semitic organisations like the IHR which were set up specifically to try to poke holes in the holocaust.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Institute for Historical Review (IHR), founded in 1978, is an American antisemitic pseudo-scholarly[1] organization with links to neo-Nazi organizations
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not sure you're getting your information from the most unbiased places. Or is everybody except the Nazi's in on the zionist plot? It does help to explain the mindset of how you and people like Amos_quito manage to claim you are not denying the holocaust:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The question [of whether the IHR denies the Holocaust] appears to turn on IHR's Humpty-Dumpty word game with the word Holocaust. According to Mark Weber, associate editor of the IHR's Journal of Historical Review [now Director of the IHR], "If by the 'Holocaust' you mean the political persecution of Jews, some scattered killings, if you mean a cruel thing that happened, no one denies that. But if one says that the 'Holocaust' means the systematic extermination of six to eight million Jews in concentration camps, that's what we think there's not evidence for." That is, IHR doesn't deny that the Holocaust happened; they just deny that the word 'Holocaust' means what people customarily use it for.
Like many individual Holocaust deniers, the Institute as a body denied that it was involved in Holocaust denial. It called this a 'smear' which was 'completely at variance with the facts' because 'revisionist scholars' such as Faurisson, Butz 'and bestselling British historian David Irving acknowledge that hundreds of thousands of Jews were killed and otherwise perished during the Second World War as a direct and indirect result of the harsh anti-Jewish policies of Germany and its allies'. But the concession that a relatively small number of Jews were killed was routinely used by Holocaust deniers to distract attention from the far more important fact of their refusal to admit that the figure ran into the millions, and that a large proportion of these victims were systematically murdered by gassing as well as by shooting.

       How is proving that that orgnisation is blatantly anti-semitic and the entire world criticises it for making leading claims and looking deliberately to prove the holocaust as a hoax. They have literal ties to neo-nazi organisations. Do you think that neo-nazi organisations have got a bad wrap? Or are you saying that wikipedia is 100% run by jews?

       Here's another source that shows their ties to neo-nazis. Are they still just truth-seekers? How is using sources to show you are literally using anti-semitic sources to prove your anti-semitism a "dishonest ploy"?

       Can you imagine a television channel funded entirely by the US federal budget? Would you think it credible?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's such a joke, folks thinking they are edgy and cool because they get all their news from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.
      </p>
      <p>
       RT is a propaganda arm of the Russian federal government. The budget is entirely funded by

        Russian federal money.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The federal budget for 2009 on Russia Today TV channel is planned to allocate 3.6 billion rubles. This amount may be revised, as the Ministry of Finance in early February plans to complete the allocation of the 2009 budget taking into account the drop in oil prices and the dollar exchange rate. Funds to subsidize usually distributed in mid-February, said a source in the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.

       The funding doesn't matter much.  The U.S. press is equally if not more of a propaganda arm of the U.S. government.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, RT currently has the most independent and best news of MSM sources.  Like Al Jazeera once did.  But Al Jazeera and RT are actually both pro Western.  RT is just in the initial stages like AJ was 10 years ago before they pulled the switcheroo.  RT is building up its bona fides to sucker people on the left and people skeptical of official U.S. claims and U.S. MSM sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just watch.  Just like AJ I bet RT will be pushing subtle pro U.S. propaganda as the years go on and as it becomes more apparent that the U.S. is actually allied with Russia.

       And I don't get why you keep gratuitously keep bringing up the holocaust.  Oh wait, yes I do.  You don't have a rebuttal so you play the Holocaust card . . . which is kind of ironic under the circumstances.

       We're talking about racist comments so my analogy was to a similar instance of generalizing about a race behaving in a certain negative way and asking if it is racist to make this generalization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing by your non answer you think the answer is "no" it's not per se racist to make certain generalizations.  Hell, even Jewish people generalize about Jewish people.  Is it racist for Jews to generalize about the way Jewish mothers act?

        Sounds like a great guy. David Cole seems to also be a bit of a holocaust denier nutjob. I don't get it, there is no historical basis to doubt that it happened. Did the Jews go in and build fake gas chambers after the war? How on earth is this not anti-semitic?

       He's actually very smart and was very effective which is why you nutters marked him for assassination.  You sick immoral crazies torture and kill those that disagree with you.  You're worse censors than the Nazis.

       And yes, the Poles and Soviets did go build fake gas chambers.  See David Cole's well known video where he interviews Dr. Piper of Auschwitz where he admits this.

      <p>
       But you propagandist just lie and lie.  You would rather sling names at David Cole than acknowledge the evidence he uncovered
       <strong>
        from the official historians of Auschwitz.
       </strong>
       They literally built mock gas chambers and are passing them off as the real deal.  Similar mock chambers were built at Dachau.

      <p>
       You're a fraud an a liar.  Your the nutjob for defending BipolarBear and you and his ilk are obviously dedicated propagandists.

       Right you're the famous anti-semite who spends all his time yelling about the Jews.

       Do you also question the historical validity of these genocides? 'cause i don't. I've never questioned any genocide, myself.
