<p><strong>Here is one of the death-celebration songs that <a href="/u/Einstimer">/u/Einstimer</a> likes to sing:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Another song he likes to sing:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rachel Corrie was a Whorrie</p>

<p>Rachel Whorrie was not a kid. She was protecting a confirmed terrorist smuggling hole.</p>

<p>Compare this to the available photographs of Corrie&#39;s corpse, usually found on Zionist hate-group websites like this one: <strong>NSFL</strong> - <a href="http://masada2000.org/Rachel-Corrie-Pancakes.html">http://masada2000.org/Rachel-Corrie-Pancakes.html</a></p>

<p><strong>These are the people who run r/Conspiratard, r/EnoughPaulSpam and r/EnoughLibertarianSpam</strong>. </p>

<p>They also operate <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/l4uoi/subreddits_affiliated_with_or_created_by_nolibs/">a bunch of other hate-groups.</a></p>

<h1></h1>

<p>Again, these are the people who defame this subreddit <em>daily</em> as being immoral. The shameless hypocrisy is astounding. The fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T549VoLca_Q">their hate-group is <em>nominally</em> bigoted and so reliant on using bigoted slurs</a> (anti-bigotry PSA contains <strong>NSFW</strong> slurs) to demean people that they dislike is just the icing on their rotten, hate-filled cake.</p>

That&#39;s what your sub does, it defames by constantly using the worst conspiracy theories to put the rest in the same basket. And your mods are sick in the head and you don&#39;t mind being part of that because it&#39;s fun to dedicate your time to a most unworthy cause. Defenders of Dick Cheney, Bush and Wolfowitz etc, racists, mentally unstable, extremists and fraudsters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technique #6 - &#39;GAINING FULL CONTROL&#39;</p>

<p>It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the &#39;ultimate victory&#39; as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a &#39;honey pot&#39; gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.</p>

Truth is flaming spreads out what is burned in the open airs. + new more powerful life often springs from ashes.</p>

<p>Allegory Fact is burning hanging or killing an accused witch labeled in ill fashion a demon worshiper, only makes their true light glow brighter stronger &amp; longer. I know of no witch in modern times that the masses think as demonic, unless in comical cartoon fairy tales. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_of_the_Salem_witch_trials">Those whom suffered the Salem witch trials are immortals in name</a>. They live on educating children in modern schools cast as non justifiably murdered martyrs. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=salem+witch+woodcut+propaganda&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS431US431&amp;amp;espv=210&amp;amp;es_sm=122&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=U-GZUrbpH5fsoAS0wIHQCA&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1440&amp;amp;bih=798"><strong>The woodcuts &amp; other assorted propaganda used to prop up killing witches in this past is seen today as violence stemming from ignorant minds depicting horrors done to the accused slandered &amp; murdered in ill fashion.</strong></a></p>

<p>I say ignore such flame trolls, downvote them quietly or educate them. Their ill pancake images only make Rachel Corrie shine! in a positive light, just as is the factual case when it comes to images &amp; pro propaganda of lynchings of early northern witches &amp; later former southern slaves. Fact is their ill images caused me to invoke her spirit to rebuke ills in this world beyond her apparent martyrdom.</p>

<p>I do imagine one of the reasons they make such images is they are stubbornly bound to blind loyalty toward Israel no matter what. I do not often seek to kindly educate such hard line nationalistic ignite trolls &amp; know their ways lead to their eventual demise. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Antioch">Ignatius wrote:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;From Syria even to Rome I fight with wild beasts, by land and sea, by night and by day, being bound amidst ten leopards, even a company of soldiers, who only grow worse when they are kindly treated. — Ignatius to the Romans&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means to me is that, the kinder one is attempting to educate away ignorance, often leads the ignorant to seek to kill you for exposing their ill, if they are acting as tools to an army of like thinkers. I prefer not to waste life energy being martyred by diseased lions loyal to hard right extremist views of Zion in their own den <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, but if they come here I shall attempt to tame them or slay their BS.</p>

<p>Note: I imagine these ill pancake painters are often created by being hurt  from ill labeling of all Jews in a stereotypical fashion negatively, as does happen often in the conspiracy communities across the web. I do feel an effort here in this subreddit to not condone such ill wide stereotype label casting behavior when it happens, but it does slip through moderation here sometimes. I welcome ill humans here like a doctor welcomes a diseased patient &amp; thank the mods for their efforts n the subject.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I would like to note: All warpigs domestic &amp; abroad are ill!, unless they walk away &amp; denounce the ill machine &amp; the illete snake headed adders upon ladders fully. They all are or have been paid willing participant ill machined tools to the illetes drug, religion, &amp; resource wars. They are all [even the ones whom seem nice] part of the body of the ill machine. I shall paint them in the blood they, their brethren &amp; their masters spill. I shall continually aggressively non violently attack their swine inFLUence from this world until such disease is eradicated from the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have called out that account twice before now.</p>

<p>See: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rdptq/coup_exploding_world_trade_center_cover_art/cdm7ewh?context=10">example 1</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rh1hc/where_is_everyone/cdnclyx?context=10">example 2</a></p>

<p>The second time I was accused of stalking and threatened to be reported by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/1298734">1298734</a>.</p>

<p>There is also the fact that the<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rqrv8/reminder_the_moderators_of_rconspiratard_are/cdq2u12"> comment reply below by 1298734</a> uses a very similar response<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rh1hc/where_is_everyone/cdnd037"> compared to an earlier response to a comment by me.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>I would not be surprised to see another stalking accusation coming from 1298734 due to my comparison of said user&#39;s own comment history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats a really stupid response, especially here, where you can get banned for pointing out racism, or how the mods allow blatant racism - in fact I bet you really have no fucking idea how far down the rabbit hole iron fisted control goes on in this very subreddit, with a dumb comment like that.</p>

<p>food for thought huh?</p>

<p>oh who the fuck am i kidding, you are probably one of them...</p>
