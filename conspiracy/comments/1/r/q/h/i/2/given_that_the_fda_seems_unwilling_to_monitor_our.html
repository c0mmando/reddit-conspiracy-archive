       To measure low levels of contamination, I'm thinking something like:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Buy food, e.g., a big chunk of salmon
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Compress it somehow, e.g., dry it and grind it into shreds
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Start two Geiger counters, one close to the "food" and the other in a 
background location nearby
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Continually record the data
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Over a few days, look for a significant difference between the "food" and background
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Publish results, including place of purchase, on the internets
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably not much equipment needed, although is there a cheap Geiger counter that can be continuously recorded?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol... support the Kickstarter and we'll tell you if your food is poisoned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully, this would prompt the FDA to get off its backside and start protecting consumers.

       Count me in 100%. I am a resident of Hawaii. I have lots of family with unexplained health problems which can cross over into low dose radiation poisoning. I come from a community of organic farmers, dairy goat keepers, almost all on rain water catchment, we fish, swim, gather food from the ocean, find washed up stuff clearly from Japan, and we all question the radiation levels here. Our state and county did testing for a brief time. We as concerned people are wanting answers. Even if someone could teach me how to do a kickstarter I'd barter whatever I could for the knowledge. This is such a serious subject for me now in my life. Let me know how I can help.

       If you live near the University of Hawaii, you can get your water tested for free for things like gross alpha particles, if they have the equipment. Just give their chemistry department a call.

       This is wonderful idea, however i suspect the FDA would send a
       <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-25/fda-tells-google-backed-23andme-to-halt-dna-test-service.html">
        ceast and desist

       order as they did with
       <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">
        www.23andme.com
       </a>
       . They told them to stop selling their kits since they are not authorized too. I believe since the kit would be intended to diagnose/prevent a disease its regulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       If im wrong please state so. Not trying to shoot the idea down, just pointed out a possible obstacle.

       I have a Geiger counter from the cold-war era that my dad had bought back then and have been checking my well water and vegis/fruits on a regular basis since the concerns over Fukushima radiation were first raised ( I live not too far from Cape Mendocino). I have yet to find anything significant but one of the other users here pointed out that my equipment might not be sensitive enough to pick up what might be here.  They mentioned that there are labs and universities that will test samples brought to them (some for free).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of going out and buying expensive equipment, why don't we have genuine, bona fide labs do the testing for us and then post our results online?

       Because the amount of radiation may be too low for the Geiger counter to measure in a minute or two.  With food, the material is entering your body and accumulating in your tissues.  Same thing with breathing radioactive gases, like radon.  Background radiation, on the other hand, stays outside your body... it doesn't penetrate your outer skin so well.

       So two reasons that low doses in food are important.

       1) It accumulates in your body (e.g., thyroid), and

       2) You don't have skin protecting you inside your body.

       I think this is true, but not certain.

       Is that normally how people measure small amounts of radioactivity? Just use the same geiger counter they would use for more radioactivity but for a longer time? I am very surprised that there is no way to just measure it directly with a more sensitive instrument.

       No, you would use HPLC.
