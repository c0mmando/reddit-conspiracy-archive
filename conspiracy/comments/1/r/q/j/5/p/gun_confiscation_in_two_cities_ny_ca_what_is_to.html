    <div class="md"><p>This is something I think about at least once a week. Living in the south, I&#39;m pretty &#39;safe&#39; as far as the 2A is concerned but even still.. what if?</p>

<p>I think about what if they sent me the letter and I sent them a defiant one back. They come knocking on my door, and I refuse to let them in. They attempt to force entry... what do I do?</p>

<p>Do I give in and allow them to come in, tackle/taze me to the floor, cuff me, and lock me up until trial? At least I&#39;d still be alive.</p>

<p>Do I say fuck it, fuck this complacency, and fuck this bullshit of a country we&#39;ve turned into and go out Waco style? I&#39;d more than likely end up dead, but I&#39;d die well.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have people to survive me, I&#39;m a single guy. I don&#39;t have kids. I have people who love me and people that I love. It wouldn&#39;t be an easy decision but you know... someone has to water the Tree of Liberty from time to time. We always thank our servicemen for &quot;fighting for our freedoms,&quot; but in reality the fight for them is right here at home. </p>

<p>If it came down to it, would you do your service?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I were to own a gun I&#39;d look up everything possible and take a course and go to a range. I looked into a gun briefly and decided that a small revolver would be ideal for me. Portable, reliable, easy to clean, fewer parts, durable and so on. I would also consider a bolt action rifle for similar reasons. </p>

<p>Of the reasons I haven&#39;t gotten a gun one of the bigger ones is that I&#39;m very much a proponent of non-violence. I&#39;m holding off for as long as possible because I really don&#39;t like the idea of having to deal with naked aggression. I still have the hopes that a Gandhi-esque disobedience campaign would yield fruit. All we have to do is stop paying the Feds and they have no money. Use a different currency and their printing presses are rendered irrelevant. The easiest way to kill a parasite is to deny it the blood it needs.</p>

<p>This is optimistic to the point of naive on my part and I know it.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m still hopeful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A man or woman can walk the peaceful path, but one must always be prepared. This has been going on for thousands of years.  Taking away a person right to defend oneself (or self preservation) has always been a goal of the predators throughout history, and anyone telling you there isn&#39;t a so-called &quot;bad person&quot; is either ignorant or lying right through their teeth.  At the very least, try introducing yourself to a hand to hand self defence class, or if your a keener a martial art of sorts (I won&#39;t tell you which one because all persons must choose one to suits ones needs) some are primary and some take a lifetime to master.  </p>

<p>A firearm is the last means of personal defence. You maybe able to beat up 1 or 2 people in hand to hand combat if your trained and have had experience, a firearm is an equalizer. But like I said, this is a last resort option.  At the very very least, familiarize yourself with firearms, so you can defuse a situation (safely unloading, mechanisms,cleaning and care) so you don&#39;t fear what you don&#39;t understand</p>

<p>Good luck citizen and stay safe </p>

    <div class="md"><p>MLK and Gandhi are my personal heros.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m well aware that they were cool with self-defence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that you hold off violence until the last possible second. Our daily lives are evidence that people are normally very peaceful. This is what keeps me going. I think it&#39;s possible. </p>

<p>The trick is to keep your cool. </p>

<p>Watch enough police brutality videos (you wouldn&#39;t believe the months I&#39;ve wasted watching them) you&#39;ll notice something: it&#39;s a two-way street. Once the punk gives lip the cop the cop feels emotionally justified in beating the kid. The ones that get away from cops without violence are the ones that keep their cool and don&#39;t incite anger. </p>

<p>I have a temper so it&#39;s hard for me to preach this without immediately looking at my own inadequacies. So I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m some guiding force or anything. Fuck, I <em>wish</em> I had the cool of Gandhi and MLK. Still, I try to remember that the person on the other end is very likely a person like me who&#39;s confused and upset.</p>

<p>Another wrinkle to this is that I identify myself as just some guy. A cop identifies himself as a part of a larger body with authority. There&#39;s an aspect of identity that comes into play. I haven&#39;t thought about it fully, but I bet there&#39;s a lot in here worth thinking about. I&#39;m tired and have to go to bed so I can&#39;t think or anything right now.</p>

<p>You seem to know what&#39;s up.</p>

<p>Cheers from this side of the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fight with whatever you can. I wasn&#39;t saying that fighting wouldn&#39;t include force but being in a house surrounded by militarized police, with limited resources to fight them with isn&#39;t a sound strategy. You could fight with weapons if need be (but you need to be alive to use them) , and with education, with ideas, with money (probably the most effective if you have enough to matter), with a lot of things. I&#39;m also not saying we should just give up and let them do it. But by the time they&#39;re at your door they&#39;ve already won that particular battle. Sure, you can fight back and maybe get a couple of them, but there will always be more badges to throw at you, and they won&#39;t run out of ammunition. Being stuck in a house isn&#39;t a good place to make an effectual stand. You&#39;ll die and you&#39;ll be labeled an extremist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing will be done. Gun owners are inherently cowardly pants-wetters. They go about their lives in such a state of fear for their pathetic lives that they feel the need to arm themselves with deadly weapons. Whenever questioned on this, they say they are merely &quot;exercising their rights&quot;. What other right do people exercise for its own sake? None. People don&#39;t speak merely to exercise their right to free speech or publish to exercise that of free press. No, they perform these functions because they are intrinsically useful rights. Gun ownership and carriage serves one purpose, making scared people feel less scared.</p>

<p>These cowards are going to roll over when their guns are come for. When &quot;they&quot; come to &quot;take your guns&quot;, they&#39;ll get them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I were to own a gun I&#39;d look up everything possible and take a course and go to a range. I looked into a gun briefly and decided that a small revolver would be ideal for me. Portable, reliable, easy to clean, fewer parts, durable and so on. I would also consider a bolt action rifle for similar reasons. </p>

<p>Of the reasons I haven&#39;t gotten a gun one of the bigger ones is that I&#39;m very much a proponent of non-violence. I&#39;m holding off for as long as possible because I really don&#39;t like the idea of having to deal with naked aggression. I still have the hopes that a Gandhi-esque disobedience campaign would yield fruit. All we have to do is stop paying the Feds and they have no money. Use a different currency and their printing presses are rendered irrelevant. The easiest way to kill a parasite is to deny it the blood it needs.</p>

<p>This is optimistic to the point of naive on my part and I know it.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m still hopeful.</p>
