       It seems that in every post, side-conversations always take the spotlight, which is really annoying if you come to this subreddit for the discussions. I love hearing other people's opinions on a certain matter, but I hate when shit devolves into blabbering about nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       the contents of this thread are a perfect example. "Your racist" "No I'm not, here's a well thought out post explaining my point of view" "Fucking anti-semite"

       i feel as if in the past few months there has been a sharp decline in quality of content and comments. its really frustrating. As superconducter said, its happening in every sub, for the simple reason that reddit's carrying capacity has been reached. It has been overloaded by private interests, its apparent through the consistent censorship of  the more mainstream subs. If there is a better alternative to what was once happening here, someone please let me know.

       It seems that such is the general mindset of a lot of people on the internet nowadays, unfortunately...at least such seems to be the case on Reddit.  It perhaps is an indication of the general low level of intellectual acumen in the general population.

       I agree that it does. But the constant anti-jew ramblings that amount to nothing more than anti semitism is kinda off putting. I agree that it is a shit nation run in a horrible fashion and that apartheid is alive and well in it, but the conspiratard folks that come over and do the anti semetic stuff is frustrating.

       I am not saying pointing out the flaws in israel is anti semitic. There is a difference between pointing out the flaws in israel and a statement like "The jews are using their unearned wealth to take over media." One is racist, the other is a criticism of the government of Israel, which I am all for, because I hate their policies and what they pass off as International Policy.

       How is it racist to say that a group has undue influence over something?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Mormons had an outsized role in U.S. foreign policy would it be racist to note this?  To complain about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Scientologists has a substantially outsized role in the media is it bigoted to note this or complain about it?

      <p>
       You are falling victim to false claims of "racism" (and it's a bit of a red flag you equate anti Jewish bigotry with "racism").  If anything, this privileged status that makes any criticism of Israeli or Jewish influence is bigoted behavior in and of itself.

       Agreed, the blatant anti semetic stuff is un-called for. That said, Israel enjoys lumping that with criticism of itself together to confuse everyone and possibly escape the barbs.

       What "constant" anti Jew ramblings?  What I see are a slew of false allegations like the ones Squackula are making.

       The other

       anti Jew ramblings have been made by people like BipolarBear who is Jewish himself and is engaging in black propaganda to make this sub appear racist.  It does not enjoy widespread support like bigoted comments at conspiratard enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how these types of comments get users that come out of the woodwork (likely from conspiratard) to agree with the false claim this sub is racist.

      <p>
       A user was wrongly banned the other day for being "racist" (i.e. anti Jewish) when it clearly was not a racist comment.

      <p>
       This is a false concern and you're likely trolling.  We're infested here with pro Israel propagandists who make false accusations like you are making.

       You're making the same false argument BipolarBear makes and trying to falsely label this sub racist.

       Hell, this whole sub was banned from bestof for a totally reasonable comment about Israel.

Your racism is ridiculously transparent, it practically bleeds out of you.  99.9 percent of posters on Reddit would find your views repellent.  Hell, I'd bet 99% of

       This reception in the general public is a result of massive propaganda blowhards and fascists like you have created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your fascist friends literally put people in jail for not agreeing with the official story.  The German people were literally "re-educated" and forced to accept the official story on pain of imprisonment and loss of livelihood.  Your nutter friends issue death threats to the prominent revisionists like Jewish revisionist David Cole and David Irving.
      </p>
      <p>
       You and your nutter trolls mod and brigade most of the other subs on this site to make sure your propaganda is enforced.  There is probably no other issue where you and dozens of your friends (with multipiple accounts) will appear out of the woodwork to attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, your nutter friends got a reasonable comment critical of Israel censored from bestof and got all of conspiracy banned because this was "racist."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a false reality you are imposing.  I'm glad we have at least one place where honest inquiry can (sort of) go on.  Yet you trolls are doing your best to disrupt this place.

       That's not true at all.  Again, a false version of history was imposed on most of the Western world.  This is true of almost all history.  I am skeptical of all history written by victors.  I'm skeptical of much of U.S. history.

       By "propogandists" you mean most of the general population, right?  Walk around on the street and use the term "Holohoax" and "Zionist" while denying that Auschwitz was a death camp.  See how many people call you a racist or an anti-semite.

       Typical Holocaust denier BS.  Thousands of surviving witnesses were wrong.  Every Nazi that admitted to participating in the Holocaust was intimidated or threatened.  Every one of the thousands of documents related to the Holocaust was forged.  Every one of the hundreds of historians who meticulously studied the historical records was a co-conspirator.

       No one I know thinks I'm a racist.  I'm far from it.

       And no, I don't go around talking about the Holocaust.  Just like I don't go around talking about conspiracies like 9/11 or Sandy Hook and Boston hoax theories.  These theories are too shocking for most people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not afraid to discuss these issues.  And I don't know the full truth and admit what I don't know and admit I could be wrong about things.  But I try to treat people with respect so I don't get into shouting matches like you conspiratards do with me here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again.  The fact you can't discuss these issues reasonably shows you don't have the facts on your side. You have to label the other side "racist" and try to get others to ignore them to win the argument.  This is an indication your arguments are weak.

       I used "holohoax" tongue in cheek in one of my many comments on the subject (which you have obviously combed through) because I was getting hounded by a conspiratard like you and who refused to hear that I
       <strong>
        rejected the term Holocaust denier.
       </strong>
       I can't even remember the exact context but I did not intend that all of the "Holocaust" was a hoax.  I only stated the case for homicidal gas chambers has not been proved--I accept other instances of murder took place.  So yes, some people did perpetrate a hoax in this limited respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the term "Holocaust" should have ever been adopted to describe Jewish suffering during WWII and it was adopted well after WWII so that people like you could use it as a weapon and support what Norman Finkelstein has described as the Holocaust Industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I specifically admit that Jews were murdered and abused
       </strong>
       during WWII.  They suffered simply because of their religion and ethnic background.  Just as Japanese Americans suffered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionist is an acceptable term that I will gladly use in polite company.  I have both Arab friends and Israeli and Jewish friends.  Hell, I know an Arab who is married to a Jew.  I treat all people with respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I am more free to discuss issues on this sub and other alternative sites than I am IRL.  But this is a good thing.  Israel and Zionism is a taboo subject because propagandists like you have successfully made it a taboo subject and have created a privileged status for Jews when discussing these matters.  This standard in America is actually a racist standard as people like Atlas Shrugged and Neocons get away with all sorts of racism directed at Arabs yet any criticism of Zionism is falsely conflated with "racism" by propagandists and liars like you.

       That's not racist or anti Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm stating that there is not sufficient proof of homicidal gas chambers.  Some people lied about this and thus committed a hoax
       <em>
        on this particular issue
       </em>
       .  There is proof of other crimes and abuses committed against Jews.  Thus, only one limited part of the "Holocaust" is a hoax while I support other facts about the "Holocaust."

       I used the term "Holohoax" tongue in cheek because one of the many conspiratards attacking me kept calling me "Nazi apologist" and "Holocaust denier" after
       <strong>
        I had specifically said I reject the term "Holocaust denier."
       </strong>
       The very term "Holocaust" is a loaded term that is not helpful.

      <p>
       Is David Cole anti Jewish for making the same claims?  Indeed, he said he did so to benefit Jews because the truth is more helpful than perpetrating lies.

      <p>
       And get out of here you're not a propagandist.  You pounced on my comments within minutes and have combed through my dozens of comments on the subject.  You and your conspiratard friends have a primary mission of running interference on this very issue . . . and the proof is the half dozen or so trolls hounding me (just as they did other users on this sub on this same subject).

        Key elements of Holocaust denial:
"Before discussing how Holocaust denial constitutes a conspiracy theory, and how the theory is distinctly American, it is important to understand what is meant by the term "Holocaust denial." Holocaust deniers, or "revisionists," as they call themselves, question all three major points of definition of the Nazi Holocaust. First, they contend that, while mass murders of Jews did occur (although they dispute both the intentionality of such murders as well as the supposed deservedness of these killings), there was no official Nazi policy to murder Jews. Second, and perhaps most prominently, they contend that there were no homicidal gas chambers, particularly at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where mainstream historians believe over 1 million Jews were murdered, primarily in gas chambers. And third, Holocaust deniers contend that the death toll of European Jews during World War II was well below 6 million. Deniers float numbers anywhere between 300,000 and 1.5 million, as a general rule." Mathis, Andrew E. Holocaust Denial, a Definition, The Holocaust History Project, July 2, 2004. Retrieved December 18, 2006.
       </p>
       <p>
        Holocaust deniers generally do not accept the term denial as an appropriate description of their activities, and use the term revisionism instead.[6] Scholars use the term "denial" to differentiate Holocaust deniers from historical revisionists, who use established historical methodologies

       And hey, you're the second Conspiratad troll to post the same bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not interested in "denying" facts . . . I am interested in historical fact and use established historical methodologies to form my opinion.  And I do not claim to have absolute certainty . . . under the circumstances there was a lot of false propaganda and the victors imposed their version of history via force and there is a lot we will never know.
      </p>
      <p>
       You propagandists throw around the term "Holocaust Denier" and "racist" to shut down inquiry and debate.  If anyone is engaging in denial behavior it is someone who uses these tactics rather than accepted methods of debate--you know, counter an argument with a fact or argument rather than an ad hominem attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm open to the argument that homicidal gas chambers were used but the evidence does not support this claim and your side has not met the burden of proof.  The Soviets made a mock chamber to "prove" one existed and used confessions gained from torture. The primary documents don't prove homicidal gassings occurred and the forensic evidence likewise doesn't support homicidal gas chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is reasonable interpretation of the most important facts.  I'm willing to change my mind if you present better evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In response to these argument you sling ad hominems and make appeals to authority (most historians are not going to risk jail or career suicide by entertaining revisionist arguments).  The mere fact your side has to literally jail historians who don't support your side is a strong indication the truth is not on your side.

       Not at all.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There aren't hundreds of accounts from "murderers" supporting the homicidal gas chamber claim.  A few people like Hoss were tortured into giving contradictory and unlikely testimony that is obviously fabricated. Other German defendants at the show trials didn't bother defending the German state from these claims because they were concerned with defending themselves; they would say they weren't involved with or didn't see any gas chambers while there may have been gas chambers elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And actually there were few Jewish prisoners who actually saw gas chambers.  The best witnesses are the Jewish prisoners who allegedly collaborated with the Germans by running the gas chambers but their stories are not believable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there have been ground radar and there is no physical evidence of mas body burnings at Auschwitz.  There were crematoria there as there was a Typhus outbreak and many people did die . . . around 150,000 according to German and Red Cross records.  So the Germans disposed of these bodies by burning.  But there have never been evidence found of large scale body burning in open pits even though forensic tests have been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is no thousands and thousands of documents in the official record supporting homicidal gas chambers.  Quite the opposite.  To get around this uncomfortable fact (because the Germans kept great records for everything else and they didn't appear to hide other facts of their treatment toward Jews) the official story is there was a secret oral order and nothing was put in documents.

       Yes, because he wasn't being anti-Jewish.  That's why it was wrong to ban him.  He made a comment that people like Norman Finkelstein make--that Jews are the squeaky wheels that get the grease when it comes to WWII.  That is not anti Jewish anymore than cricizing Israel is anti Jewish.

       I mean I'm not going to argue the possibility that she was lying. I have no way of proving it, obviously. Just relaying what was expressed directly to me from a supposed primary source. I can't imagine what benefit there would be to lying. This women's family was not Jewish, but her family harbored Jews and a result was lopped in with the rest of the Jews.

       Yes.  I've actually reviewed the testimony.  Most prisoners didn't have direct evidence of the gas chambers . . . because according to the official story those that would have been such witnesses were killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sonderkammandos would be the best (most important) witnesses to support the gassing story as they obviously had a reason to view the operations and live (they allegedly collaborated with the Germans by helping with the gassing and cremation operations).  But this testimony is dubious, at best.

      <p>
       I prepared a lengthier response to your conspiratard troll buddy but erased it because it's pointless arguing with trolls and I would rather save this for a legitimate debate partner, but here are 3 videos that show some interviews with these witnesses and show the unreliability of both the German and Jewish witnesses:

       It's not my assertion.  It's what they said they did!  They evidently told thousands of innocent people to march into a room for their "showers" and didn't warn them they were about to be murdered.  They collaborated in murder.  If you can believe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, they are most likely lying about their activities because it's not believable that the Germans would trust a few Jewish prisoners to do this and only have a couple German guards.  And their description of the logistics is just not believable.
      </p>
      <p>
       They packed people like sardines into a room, that was literally so crowded they couldn't fall down when dead, but these people thought they were really going to get showers?  They didn't revolt?  And the doors used to secure the rooms were super flimsy?  And these thousands of people filed through single doors and the few Sonderkommandos used "hooks" to pick up the bodies and put them on flimsy carts and were able to move thousands of people a day (can you imagine how difficult this task was?).  And they went in after the gassings and didn't use protection even though they likely would have been poisoned themselves if they really did it that way (not to mention the rooms were not adequately ventilated so they and the Germans living nearby would have been poisoned as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       And their description of the crematorium process is totally not believable.  There is no way that many bodies could have been processed in the way they describe.  They give ridiculous times for how long it took to incinerate a body and even then it doesn't add up.

      <p>
       Boy, you sure are gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple thousand people packed like sardines are going to stay locked inside a room when
       <em>
        poison gas
       </em>
       is thrown in because a couple guards are outside.  Sure buddy.  That makes sense.  No way these people instinctively panic and push against the doors and windows.
      </p>
      <p>
       And fuck you with your demand for proof and then refusal to look at said proof.  According to your definition any attempt to prove the official Holocaust story wrong in any way is anti semitism so you've set up a nice little Catch 22.  You must think you're really clever.  You just adopted this trick from places like the ADL.
      </p>
      <p>
       You refuse to consider revisionists history then say it hasn't been proved.  So you are obviously a bad faith troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't even watch an interview with one of the leading Holocaust historians on your side where he discusses issues like the doors on the alleged gas chambers.  Unfortunately, only "anti semites" (according to your sick mind) like Jew David Cole are asking these questions and he was able to ask Dr. Piper these questions only because he is a Jew and was insistent on getting answers and ignored propaganda trolls like you.  It eventually became too much for him (just like with other revisionist historians like David Irving) who had their lives threatened and their liberty taken away so they finally stopped asking questions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Leuchter Report goes into detail about this, but once again it's going to fall victim to your catch 22; you won't consider revisionist evidence because by your definition revisionism is anti semitism and therefore the revisionist case wasn't proved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's the gas that would still linger after the gassing and when they were handling the bodies that would poison the sonderkommandos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the burden of proof is on your side.  Do you have any evidence the mock up the Soviets built is accurate?  You prove the ventilation they allege is feasible.  You do know they built a chimney that isn't even connected to the gas chamber?  As in totally fake?  I don't need a degree in physics to know this is no proof of a homicidal gas chamber.
      </p>

       Of course I've seen the pictures of the crematorium.  The few that exist.  And do you see how improbable it is that the Sonderkommandos claim to have stacked 3 or 4 bodies at a time in there?  Have you even looked at the evidence that shows the impossibility of burning a million people at Auschwitz?  Oh yeah, you have a catch 22 that you won't look at the evidence and therefore in your great logical mind it's never been proved.

      <p>
       Where's the documentation of Hitler's plan?  Hitler definitely was anti Jewish and he wanted to expel the Jews from Germany.  This is why he partnered with the Zionists to force Jews to emigrate to Palestine until Hitler stopped cooperating with the Zionists in the early 1940s.

       <p>
        What's you answer for the hundreds of witness accounts from both victims AND murderers supporting the existence of gas chambers?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There aren't hundreds of accounts from "murderers" supporting the homicidal gas chamber claim.  A few people like Hoss were tortured into giving contradictory and unlikely testimony that is obviously fabricated. Other German defendants at the show trials didn't bother defending the German state from these claims because they were concerned with defending themselves; they would say they weren't involved with or didn't see any gas chambers while there may have been gas chambers elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And actually there were few Jewish prisoners who actually saw gas chambers.  The best witnesses are the Jewish prisoners who allegedly collaborated with the Germans by running the gas chambers but their stories are not believable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there have been ground radar and there is no physical evidence of mas body burnings at Auschwitz.  There were crematoria there as there was a Typhus outbreak and many people did die . . . around 150,000 according to German and Red Cross records.  So the Germans disposed of these bodies by burning.  But there have never been evidence found of large scale body burning in open pits even though forensic tests have been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is no thousands and thousands of documents in the official record supporting homicidal gas chambers.  Quite the opposite.  To get around this uncomfortable fact (because the Germans kept great records for everything else and they didn't appear to hide other facts of their treatment toward Jews) the official story is there was a secret oral order and nothing was put in documents.

       Sad. Just sad that you would defend this assertion that Jews collaborated with their captors. Find your meds. Take them. Or refuse, and provide the rest of us with more deluded entertainment.

       It's not my assertion.  It's what they said they did!  They evidently told thousands of innocent people to march into a room for their "showers" and didn't warn them they were about to be murdered.  They collaborated in murder.  If you can believe them.
      </p>

       Actually, they are most likely lying about their activities because it's not believable that the Germans would trust a few Jewish prisoners to do this and only have a couple German guards.  And their description of the logistics is just not believable.
      </p>

       They packed people like sardines into a room, that was literally so crowded they couldn't fall down when dead, but these people thought they were really going to get showers?  They didn't revolt?  And the doors used to secure the rooms were super flimsy?  And these thousands of people filed through single doors and the few Sonderkommandos used "hooks" to pick up the bodies and put them on flimsy carts and were able to move thousands of people a day (can you imagine how difficult this task was?).  And they went in after the gassings and didn't use protection even though they likely would have been poisoned themselves if they really did it that way (not to mention the rooms were not adequately ventilated so they and the Germans living nearby would have been poisoned as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       And their description of the crematorium process is totally not believable.  There is no way that many bodies could have been processed in the way they describe.  They give ridiculous times for how long it took to incinerate a body and even then it doesn't add up.
