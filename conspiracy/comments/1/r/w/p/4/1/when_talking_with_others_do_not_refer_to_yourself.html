People will either reject you and your ideals, or spiral out in disbelief of reality; but regardless of what happens, almost always, you planted the seed of truth into their minds that WILL follow them and grow on its own. </p>

<p>Their own term is a weapon against its self. Because &quot;those conspiracy theorists were right about ..&quot; are magical words that flip a persons perspective like you wouldnt believe. Brittney Murphy? called it. NSA spying? called it. Area 51? Called it. False Flag Operations? Called it. </p>

<p>Words, titles, even people,  only have power if YOU give it to them.  If everyone in a Kingdom just simply shrugged their shoulders and said &quot;nah&quot;, the most powerful (wo)man (the King or queen) will fall and crumble to the lowest of peasants in only <em>seconds</em>. Same concept can be applied to words and titles. The only thing stopping a term like &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; from being a badge of honor or a term of shame is the people who attach the negative context to it. Does thinking critically and understanding the truth of the world make me a conspiracy theorist? Then so be it. Whatever helps you sleep at night, because ill prove you wrong regardless in the end</p>

<p>Actually it DOES matter even if you do have the facts, brother.  I think you know that - or at least you should.  How many times - in <em>this</em> very subreddit alone, to say nothing about the &quot;outside world&quot; - does the &quot;win argument&quot; go not to the person with the relevant facts, but to the person who can either shout the loudest, sound the coolest, or give the snidest, most sarcastic remark?</p>

<p>This world seems rarely to be one about truth and honesty and facts.  It seems to be one that is more about willful ignorance and convenient omissions.  More often than not it seems it&#39;s not about who actually IS right, but about who <em>sounds</em> the rightest regardless of whether they are in fact actually right or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ive read many &quot;debate&quot; books, so im aware and in agreement with you, though there is some disconnect. Youre right, its not <em>what</em> you say, but <em>how</em> you say it</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Several things: If you ever reach &quot;debate&quot; level, its over and done with and responding any further is pointless. Debates arnt meant to influence the other speaker, but rather a third party who is listening and trying to make a decision one way or another; otherwise its a discussion between two or more people.  That being said, yes, debates are most often won with emotion rather than fact. I find those who debate the most are usually the most full of shiut because as you said, its not about the facts but what fallacy you can string together. However, the goal is to <em>not</em> debate, but to dictate, explain and lecture. Debating requires you to <em>convince</em> the other person and there are many tricks in language or emotional strings to tug. Also the opposite side is cementing their stance, rather than opening up to change it. You must sort of be in a &quot;town crier&quot; sort of mindset.</p>

<p>But if you are dictating the truth to them, your leaving that debate door shut. they can take it or leave it and they see that and arnt as defensive. Their views arnt being pressed directly by you, youre not telling them youre wrong. youre simply saying &quot;heres what i think and the evidence as to why&quot;.  This puts people in a &quot;ok ill bite, hit me with your best shot&quot; sort of mindset and im sure youve experienced this at some point aswell and you can attest to it. </p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t the goal be to mutually exchange? to learn and teach?  It seems to me there is always something on this planet to learn from another regardless of how much one thinks they already know...and it seems there is always something one can teach another regardless of how little one might feel they have to offer.</p>

<p>Sounds about right.  As such, perhaps &quot;debating&quot; isn&#39;t necessarily something one should ever be too enthralled with participating in.  It is, as you said, something which tends to require &quot;tricks&quot; in order to succeed at, and anything requiring tricks in order to succeed seems dubious.</p>

<p>Not if they are willfully or obstinately ignorant.  I&#39;ve seen more than a few people simply say &quot;No you&#39;re wrong&quot; to situations that seem pretty obviously right.</p>

<p>All this is to say that &quot;truth&quot; can be said to be exceedingly relative depending upon the subject.</p>

<p>That modus operandi seems to be a very good one, and I would not disagree with it.</p>

<p>Yes.  It&#39;s often about HOW one approaches the situation...but it can still get a little tricky sometimes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>in a general sense, yes. but if i were expressing my opinion and was called out as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, im not there to teach and learn and neither is the other person.</p>

<p>Youre right in that there is always more to learn, but things like, say, Obama waiving part of AECA to arm terrorists, is pretty cut and dry. The other person can try to justify it, explain the whos and the whats and the whys but the end result remains the same: Obama armed terrorists. At this point it comes down to your ideollogy and moral compass and good luck changing those in a person </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Then theres nothing you can do about it, if theyre willfully ignorant. theyre not there to exchange information so your best bet is to hope you dictate something that will will catch their eye and stick. If youre talking to someone in person, its much easier to convince them to look it up.</p>

<p>on the internet, keep in mind the person youre talking to is not the goal, but rather the 100+ other people who will scroll by the comments and read it. nearly everyone who responds to you either agrees or disagrees already and isnt looking to change their view, only yours. </p>

<p>This is why shills are effective, not so much because they &quot;spread disinformation&quot; its because they discredit everyone else! Being willfully ignorant, for instance, causes most people to get angry and resort to insults; this makes the onlooker reading the conversation instantly pick favorites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All this is to say that &quot;truth&quot; can be said to be exceedingly relative depending upon the subject</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i forget sometimes that everyone is not me and dont know what i think in my head :)</p>

<p>By &quot;truth&quot; i mean the undeniable stuff. I dont touch any topic that i dont have solid (digital or physical) evidence to support my claims. DHS purchasing hollow point ammo for instance is solid fact, its from their own order lists. Anyone who denies it after seeing the forms themselves shouldnt be bothered with. its like someone looking up and saying the sky is lime-green, its not, its clearly not and any more effort to convince otherwise is wasted.</p>

<p>This is also where many people fall. Take for example 9/11. Someone reads about this stuff for a few months and thinks hes figured it all out; this person then goes on to a message board and explains exactly how the buildings fell and why. Despite him having all sorts of science and pictures, and videos, the entire board rips him a new one and tears his theory apart. Why? Because people always try to string together exactly what happened like theyre Sherlock Holmes but fall flat on their faces; theres not enough truth, and too much speculation.</p>

<p>Whats not done enough is simply holding up the official story and then a piece of evidence that contradicts it, allowing the listener or reader to take that information and process it on their own. Back to the 9/11 example, someone saying <em>&quot;they say the jet hit the pentagon while parallel to the ground, but the initial hole is far too small for a passanger jet; heres a picture&quot;</em> is much more effective than saying something like <em>&quot;The passanger jet never hit the pentagon!! the illuminati made it fly over at the last second and then landed at TinFoilHat Airport at 3:33 pm!!&quot;</em>, simply because it allows the person to see the truth, side by side, as opposed to telling them <em>&quot;reform your view to match mine, NOW!&quot;</em> (some basic psychology in there for ya).</p>

<p>when it comes to &quot;conspiracies&quot;, dont need to prove A+B actually equals C, just that A+B does not and cannot equal Z.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I certainly see and understand that point, but a lot of times we end up teaching and learning IN SPITE of ourselves and our intentions because Life in general and the situation <em>causes</em> us to teach and learn in the moment regardless of how we may have come into the conversation, you know?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>things like, say, Obama waiving part of AECA to arm terrorists, is pretty cut and dry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty cut and dry in what sense though?  in the sense that Obama himself is &quot;evil&quot;? or in the sense that there is a secret power above him that is really pulling the strings?  In the sense that we the people are pretty much 100% hoodwinked by TPTB? or in the sense that now&#39;s the time more than ever for us to come together and help one another against this encroaching tyranny?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama armed terrorists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t care about Barry one way or the other, but - playing devil&#39;s advocate - someone can easily say that it wasn&#39;t him.  It was the powers <em>above</em> him that control him and that he, being the &quot;awesome, wonderful, loving husband and human being that he is, simply had to comply to help and save his wonderful family!&quot; lol.  I know.  It&#39;s funny...but I&#39;ve seen people argue in a similar manner before, so I know it&#39;s a possibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point it comes down to your ideollogy and moral compass and good luck changing those in a person</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well yeah.  That&#39;s part of the entire point that I was making.  When the moral compasses are different from person to person, then they&#39;re definitely going to argue different perspectives - and often with similar (if not equal) rigor, conviction, and persuasive points.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not if they are willfully or obstinately ignorant. I&#39;ve seen more than a few people simply say &quot;No you&#39;re wrong&quot; to situations that seem pretty obviously right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then theres nothing you can do about it, if theyre willfully ignorant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I generally wouldn&#39;t disagree with this statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your best bet is to hope you dictate something that will will catch their eye and stick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Sometimes I approach things from that perspective - and sometimes I regard others&#39; arguments against mine from that perspective as well, wondering if there&#39;s at least <em>something</em> that they&#39;re saying that can be right and that I myself can learn from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If youre talking to someone in person, its much easier to convince them to look it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  The textual form of communication leaves quite a lot of room for misunderstanding and bickering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>on the internet, keep in mind the person youre talking to is not the goal, but rather the 100+ other people who will scroll by the comments and read it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s one way of looking at it - and I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s not a valid view point.  However, more often than not I am indeed speaking to THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL regardless of how anyone else will take the conversation.  I do see your point though, and, again, it&#39;s a valid one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nearly everyone who responds to you either agrees or disagrees already and isnt looking to change their view, only yours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah but part of the beauty of conversations - even textual ones on the internet - is that if people go into a conversation with a level head and use critical, balanced thinking, one can always learn a lot of new things and even possibly enrich someone&#39;s previous view point on a subject or two.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is why shills are effective, not so much because they &quot;spread disinformation&quot; its because they discredit everyone else!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say they&#39;re effective for <em>both</em> reasons among others.  It&#39;s difficult sometimes to not get upset and tell them to simply fuck off, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being willfully ignorant, for instance, causes most people to get angry and resort to insults; this makes the onlooker reading the conversation instantly pick favorites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems valid, but I guess it kind of depends upon the topic of conversation.  There are times when the person hurling insults <em>doesn&#39;t</em> get ostracized if what they&#39;re hurling insults about regards a popularly held subject or belief.  I do see your point, however, and - again - it&#39;s noted and valid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By &quot;truth&quot; i mean the undeniable stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like what?  I&#39;d say that a lot of things can be denied depending upon who you talk to.  A person who fancies themselves a Relativist can <em>really</em> argue for the malleability of quite a few things in this world and universe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DHS purchasing hollow point ammo for instance is solid fact, its from their own order lists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That certainly seems valid enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>its like someone looking up and saying the sky is lime-green, its not, its clearly not and any more effort to convince otherwise is wasted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if they woke up from an operation with lime green glasses on?</p>

<p>Facetious example, perhaps, but my point is simply that while I agree with the general direction of what you&#39;re saying, I tend to leave myself a comfortable opening for accepting the possibility that I might be wrong about even the things that might seem &quot;obvious&quot; to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite him having all sorts of science and pictures, and videos, the entire board rips him a new one and tears his theory apart. Why? Because people always try to string together exactly what happened like theyre Sherlock Holmes but fall flat on their faces</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another possibility as to why is because sometimes (a lot of times) people&#39;s willful  ignorance is willing to conveniently pick only that which fits their own narrative and world view.  What if the person researching the 911 information actually <em>does</em> have it figured out, but the board still rips him a new one anyway because the information he imparts is simply very unpopular?</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#Disputed">First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you.</a>&quot;</p>

<p>...doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you&#39;re wrong though...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>theres not enough truth, and too much speculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems certainly true as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whats not done enough is simply holding up the official story and then a piece of evidence that contradicts it, allowing the listener or reader to take that information and process it on their own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;m not very critically minded then (no /s) because I believe I&#39;ve seen quite a bit of information doing this very thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>someone saying <em>&quot;they say the jet hit the pentagon while parallel to the ground, but the initial hole is far too small for a passanger jet; heres a picture&quot; is much more effective than saying something like &quot;The passanger jet never hit the pentagon!! the illuminati made it fly over at the last second and then landed at TinFoilHat Airport at 3:33 pm!!&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...But wow.  Who would really say <em>that?</em> lol.  Dang.  That&#39;s like ASKING not to be taken seriously.  It&#39;s not very difficult to see the error in <em>that</em> type of presentation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>simply because it allows the person to see the truth, side by side, as opposed to telling them <em>&quot;reform your view to match mine, NOW!&quot;</em> (some basic psychology in there for ya).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would agree that this is indeed basic psychology.  The more complicated and difficult version of psychology to deal with, however, is the one that shows that there are occasions when a person can present the evidence in as calm, cool, collected, studied, and rigorous a manner as one could possibly present it...and the information is STILL railed against because people&#39;s minds simply refuse to wrap themselves around a truth the individual themselves might be entirely unwilling to face.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when it comes to &quot;conspiracies&quot;, dont need to prove A+B actually equals C, just that A+B does not and cannot equal Z.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would disagree, my good man.  The truth as far as I can assess it is that while it might not be all too difficult to get an individual to change their stance on information that is INTELLECTUALLY-based, it has proven itself exceedingly difficult - nigh almost impossible at times - to get people to change their stance on really almost <em>anything</em> in life that is EMOTIONALLY-based <em>regardless</em> of whether that emotionally-based information is wrong, incorrect, or whatever.  The implications of 911 hit and dig and grind <em>so</em> deeply for so many Americans that MANY people in this country are just simply <em>entirely</em> unwilling to come to grips with the very real possibility of what the evidence behind this tragic attack might actually mean:  The very country and the institutions that people have grown up their entire lives faithfully abiding by, listening to and honoring are actually run by powers that are actively trying to keep them dumbed down, subservient, enslaved, and who will if necessary actively hunt them down and kill them by the thousands if it suits them.</p>

<p>That shit is just WAY too deep and intense and scary for most people to look at and come face to face with - psychologically, and ESPECIALLY emotionally.  Uncovering actual indisputable proof that the towers were downed by TPTB in this country will do actually very little to some individuals that are simply obstinately committed to a world view that would be entirely shattered by that revelation and by the evidence.</p>

<p>There are more people in this country still trapped in the bubble of this type of &quot;Amurka!  Number 1!  Fuck yeah!&quot; world view than we might think.</p>

<p>Ha.  See?  Told you. :)  I don&#39;t even know what occasion you&#39;re even talking about actually, and it&#39;s for the most part because there&#39;ve been so many of them that I lost track of who&#39;s who a <em>long</em> time ago.</p>

<p>Pretty much anyone who&#39;s been in this subreddit for any real length of time I&#39;ve likely had both very good interchanges with (where I&#39;ve heard &quot;Wow, man.  You hit the nail on the head there!  You&#39;re like a rockin&#39; dude!&quot;) and...<em>bad</em> interchanges with (where literally the very same user can on another occasion also say &quot;You fucking <em>asshole!</em>  Why do you have to be such a fucking jerk?  I swear you&#39;re an ignorant, arrogant piece of shit!&quot;).</p>

<p>Yeah.  A great deal of the indoctrinated sheep would actually follow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, it depends.  If enough of them come forward <em>and</em> get assassinated to absolutely show the masses that there is indeed a nefarious elite negatively controlling everyone&#39;s lives (something which there is an indubitable amount of evidence - nay proof - for already), then perhaps the stupid masses will finally get up, band together as one people, and stand against the horrible oppression that has been ruining all of our lives for so long.</p>

<p>That would be pretty rad.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Good</em>.  People&#39;s heads NEED to mentally melt down.  That&#39;s the only way that the real truth will eventually get in to the majority of a lot of people&#39;s heads who have been so indoctrinated by shit as to be entirely brainwashed and unwilling to see any other point of view besides what they&#39;ve been told to believe by <del>their church</del> the MSM.</p>

gets upvoted here, it worries me. There may be many legitimate concerns, but you can&#39;t find it, or don&#39;t believe it, because it&#39;s paired with &quot;The evil jew nwo is taking our guns and jobs away! REVOLT!&quot; idiots.</p>

<p>Maybe if people where more careful about what they believed rather than believing everything &quot;the man&quot; doesn&#39;t want you to (therefore being just as bad as &quot;the man&quot; because your opinion is not based in fact at all, just others opinions) they would gain some notoriety.</p>

<p>umm. what? are you suggesting there <em>hasnt</em> been a an instance where someone called out a conspiracy theory? hahaha, no there certainly have been. i can think of 3 off the top of my head in this year alone.</p>

<p>Secondly, your link only has 20 up and 14 down. hardly proves your point or any for that matter.</p>

<p>whats with the constant sweeping generalizations? youre clearly picking the minority group and blowing the up as the majority. Theres hardly any talk of the &quot;jews&quot; did it, as you referenced twice and im even beginning to notice people rejecting the idea of singling them out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, and heres why:</p>

<p>For instance, if someone were to admit say, that 9/11 was an inside job, you admit to ALOT of things. </p>

<p>You admit that the government will lie to the people for special interests. You admit the past 13 years of &quot;terror threats&quot; were 100% fabricated and false. You admit that your government has no problem pulling the trigger on hundreds or even thousands of its own citizins. You admit the government limited your rights over a lie. You admit the added security isnt for the &quot;terrorists&quot;, its for you. You admit there is a tyranny in our borders and the world is not as it seems.</p>

<p>Conspiracy today has shifted from the UFO/reptilian/bigfoot era into actual news and world events. Under the table deals and analyics for what the deals are leading to. these are the things actually matter! The only people i believe would shrug would be the kind of people who say &quot;well, its not effecting me right now and theres nothing i can do about it, so im going to run through a meadow and stick flowers up my but&quot;. Otherwise, a jolt of fear should shake their bodies, and usually is the case.</p>

The smarter population are the people who understand that we are the enemy to the government.  Asking why is more powerful than who, what, where, when.

One can, after all, be a thinker with a very, very low IQ, for example.  That would still qualify one as being a &quot;thinker&quot; per se...just not a very good one at that point.  One wouldn&#39;t necessarily wish to classify themselves as <em>that</em> type of thinker necessarily.

If something comes up in conversation I&#39;ll just calmly state that I logically accept the possibility that we&#39;ve been lied to about certain events in our history. I&#39;ll then support my claim with a piece of evidence or a congruent event that&#39;s been proven true. </p>

<p>Most people that categorically reject the notion of conspiracies are those that have never even looked at the evidence, questioned what they&#39;ve been told on the evening news, or assume that we&#39;re all driven by paranoia and the desire to believe in a string-pulling mastermind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like sexuality, simply &quot;coming out&quot; to your friends and family can have a huge impact on their perception of things they&#39;ve been programmed to distrust.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t, however, engage people in debate over this stuff. Debate is important and I&#39;m glad people are out there willing to be mavens for the information, but in personal relationships it can be damaging. Most of the time I don&#39;t see the point, people believe what they want to believe. They say that about us and I just laugh, I don&#39;t fucking want to believe that people are so evil and corrupt that they would kill their fellow country men for permission to go to war. But enough fucked up shit has gone down in my own life for the glossy sheen of our society to not satisfy me. </p>

<p>I never believed in Santa Claus, and since then I&#39;ve spent my life with my eyes and ears wide open, my nose in books and my feet firmly on the ground. I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist I&#39;m just a person living in a country that&#39;s been built up on a century of global war, with more information accessible than humans have ever had pumped into their faces, and that has had an unprecedented effect on our society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We could use the power of language to our benefit if someone could come up with an alternative term that&#39;s catchy and accurate.  We could spread the word to only use that term.  Then the only people using &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; would be the MSM and the govt and it wouldn&#39;t make any sense anymore.  I tried to come up with one but it wasn&#39;t that good.  Maybe there could be a pool of them and this subreddit could vote on the best or something.  Something like Truth Seekers or Public Watchdogs (or Non-Delusional Humans lol).  I know those are stupid but you get the point...something that more accurately states what we are about.  Then when someone asks if you are a conspiracy theorist, all over the country, you can say, &quot;No, man.  I don&#39;t know what that is.  I&#39;m a ------.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience the best way to go about talking about the real world/culture/society that you live in with other less informed members of it who are more interested in getting themselves &quot;likes&quot; on facebook or a new car is to NOT ALIENATE THEM.</p>

<p>This means lose your selfishness, lose your self-centeredness, stop trying to make yourself look good, stop worrying about your ego and your appearance/other people&#39;s perceptions of you - pretend to be dumb or ignorant but interested, ask them leading questions that will make them <em>reason things out for themselves in order to answer you</em>, and you are just playing dumb so they think they&#39;re helping to have a real conversation with you rather than being confronted by uncomfortable facts that make a. them feel small, and b. make them perceive you as an attacker harming their feelings about themselves and the ideology they&#39;ve been given from birth which is reinforced every time they turn on a TV or read a newspaper or magazine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a tough system here in the west, guys. Scientific governance is already here and has been for many decades. These new generations are so thoroughly entrenched in their garbage, rubbish, and ignorance/self-centeredness that they can hardly unplug for one second from &quot;trying to look cool&quot; amongst their peers.</p>
