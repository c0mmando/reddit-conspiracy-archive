       This is also happening in a time when conspiracy theorists are slowly being drawn to be candidates for ameri-terrorists by pop media. And preventing terrorism is their most publicized military application. Aaaand we have no promise.

       Microsoft did put a backdoor in their OS for the CIA/NSA to enter from.. so ya, some technologies being introduced do have a caveat.  I for one dislike the concept of buzzing drones around my property and do not understand why someone would need something within 30min-1hr.  How about we use fucking 3-D Printers and make them mandatory in every home like a heater/ac/plumbing/fridge etc?  Then we can just cut out he middle-man and print our own tools/objects.  We're steering ourselves in the wrong direction - this is just enhancing our doomed consumerist mentality.  We should be moving away from our current model of consumerism, not enhancing it's delivery system.  Main reason why this won't happen - big corporations (in specific ALEC).

       This drone stuff is ridiculous....
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The shipping cost would be insane. Because it's shipping a single parcel you're going to pay the full cost associated with that shipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Thieves will have a field day with this, shooting down drones with sling shots or something and stealing the packages.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The application is so limited... unlikely they'll be shipping large items (and if they do, the shipping cost will be HUGE).
      </p>
      <p>
       Carrying parcels in the air is ridiculous because the energy required to keep something in the air is far more than to roll it along the ground. Hence, cost is far higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason trucks, trains and ships are used to transport 99% of the worlds goods and not planes.

       Really this is how you interpet this? I see it as a new way to get products to consumers. I also see it as innovation.  Think about it for 1 second, they being the powers that be can execute anyone at will. So since we know that this is doing something good with said tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know that most people in here will claim I am gunna shot it out of the sky it flys over muh house. Pfffff you try that and see how that goes for ya. If someone or some cooperation wants you me or anyone else dead it is gonna happen.

       Just think of me when you're staring at a few drones in the sky trying to reassure yourself that they're only amazon drones and that you have nothin to worry bout.
       <br/>
       Honestly, even with the perception of history that's been built by the winners, I think it's naive to watch the world develop and not be worried about certain things. No one has the courage to consider that most of what we know is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       And "some cooperation" doesnt want its "everything-is-alright-you-guys-are-paranoid-lol"-ers dead. So you're right. Just keep buying stupid shit all the time  even though you and the mass majority of folks are scrapping the bottom of the barrel for a source of income. Just keep doin what you're doin, and if anything else spooky happens, you can always bury your head in the sand again. Of course naysayers want to see FULL DEVASTATION TIER results to come to fuitition as proof of what us paranoid critics are bitching about.

       Didnt mean to condescend. We can disagree. Your life will prolly go on normal as hell till you die.

       First off I am hardly scraping the bottom of the barrel. I make around 1000 to 1500 k a week after taxes. And my bills hardly total 1000 a month. I busted my ass to get where I am so I don't have to decide what gets paid and what don't. So I can go drop over 1000 on black friday and not care.

       Listen, I can find meaning in philanthropy but that doesnt mean buying iwhatevers for financially stable relatives or kids you added to the world. If busting your ass your entire life to make 50-70k a year-so you can buy extra plastic shit on black friday without caring- is meaning, go bonkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't explain Meaning in few enough words to imply I know the meaning of meaning, but thinking critically about the world we live in and looking out for those who dont... seems a lot closer to it than 50k

       It isn't about legos lol you and others take it as that is all I post cause I found a sub that I relate too so that is all you know about me. I enjoy a great many things in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have busted my ass to get where I am. Now I don't have to I found a job I am good at without having to work as hard as I did before. Now I get a decent wage and heaps of overtime. I found the balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is to many people out there that can do it for themself I was one of them that always felt I was being looked over like I was the victim. I wasn't I just thought I was then I said hmmmm these other people eat, breath, and shit the same way as I do what is the differance. So I figured it was attitude I changed mine and made it. Am I saying I am well off. Hell no I am just comfortable. I refuse to help anyone that don't show me they want help.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance there is a girl that works at a gas station near my house great person.  Always happy nice to me and the wife and kid and is never in a bad mood. Least she don't show it well I know she needs help here and there. She told me her little boy likes legos we went and got some wrapped them up and said here ya go. Merry xmas for you and yours also gave her some other sht too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being if someone needs help and I feel they are trying the then and only then will I do something. Till then I don't care. Plus those legos are going to help underprivileged kids at a library close to us. Every thru of the month they do a lego building thing for kids and parents we donate our sets for the day so they can build them. Yeah it isn't giving them away but it is what I do.

       Microsoft did put a backdoor in their OS for the CIA/NSA to enter from.. so ya, some technologies being introduced do have a caveat.  I for one dislike the concept of buzzing drones around my property and do not understand why someone would need something within 30min-1hr.  How about we use fucking 3-D Printers and make them mandatory in every home like a heater/ac/plumbing/fridge etc?  Then we can just cut out he middle-man and print our own tools/objects.  We're steering ourselves in the wrong direction - this is just enhancing our doomed consumerist mentality.  We should be moving away from our current model of consumerism, not enhancing it's delivery system.  Main reason why this won't happen - big corporations (in specific ALEC).

       Who would be losing jobs? According to what I read on the FAA website, every one of these delivery drones would need a pilot.
