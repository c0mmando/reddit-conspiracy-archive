       Drones flying above our heads to deliver packages to our houses would just be the beginning, just wait until the police start using them for surveillance or having their own drones equipped with radar guns to patrol highways for speeders. how would we tell the difference between an amazon drone and a police surveillance drone? this is the beginning of something very scary and the comments in those threads are making jokes and saying how awesome it will be without giving any notice to the potential abuse of something like this. I'm just wondering if anyone else thinks that something like this could lead to local police and for the matter the government to have their own drones flying in the United States.

       There is ample reason to be concerned. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently purchased the Washington Post. In 2010, Amazon pulled the plug on hosting the WikiLeaks website under heavy political pressure. Earlier this year, Amazon inked a $600 million cloud-computing deal with the CIA.

       Oh, and Bezos is a billionaire. But he's not just a billionaire. His net worth is nearly $30 billion. He's the 13th richest person alive. And he was a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council in 2011 and 2012. And he's a member of the Bilderberg Group.

       That's strange. I just placed a dummy order on Amazon to check and it's charging me $4.98 shipping and handling on a $37 order. But hey, it's probably part of their nefarious plan to get us all arguing about dumb shit like whether or not they charge postage.

       Okay.  I don't really use Amazon so I assumed they used UPS or something like it rather than USPS.

       I imagine Amazon is able to use its power though to ensure a low rate from USPS.

       Anyway, it doesn't really matter much.  We know even if Amazon is paying full price it's likely doing so because mail that can take a few days is probably cheaper to do via USPS.

       Yeah.  I would assume it's in the interest of USPS to do these deals even if the margin is really low.

       Unless there is evidence the Postal Service is being cannibalized to enrich private parties (like Fed Ex, UPS, DHL, Amazon, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think there is evidence USPS is being sabotaged and its historical function in this country is being privatized to enrich private parties (for instance the "reforms" of USPS and saddling it with the pension obligations).  I don't know if there is evidence of collusion to enrich parties like Amazon though.

       The thing with margins for the USPS is that it can be really low and they still make a profit because they're already traveling to every address in the United States every single day regardless if they have package or not.

       Well, that works both ways.  Traveling to every address 6 days a week (for now) is a requirement imposed on the USPS and it makes them less profitable (which is why they want to cut delivery days down).  So this requirement actually enables them to cut a deal with Amazon for a very low price that they couldn't get from private outfits (assuming Amazon gets a bulk deal with the USPS which I don't know is a valid assumption or not).
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually agree that the Postal Service should be required to deliver to every address every day (or at least 6 days a week) as I think our mail should be a subsidized government function as our founders believed.

       Actually, if anything Congress taking money away from the USPS (from Wikipedia):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The USPS has not directly received taxpayer-dollars since the early 1980s with the minor exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters.[6] Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume,[7] after which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act,[8] (which mandated $5.5 billion per year to be paid into an account to pre-fund retiree health-care, 75 years into the future, a requirement unique among organizations and businesses in the U.S.[9]), revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced[10] declining mail volume,[11] prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting costs to reduce its budget deficit.[12]

       It's foolish the think private enterprise would be able to deliver mail more democratically and cheaper than the a government monopoly.  If we let private enterprise deliver our mail to any address in the country and made them deliver 6 days a week and provide the other services that USPS did it would definitely cost more after the profits and subsidies were taken out.  We in fact ended/minimized subsidies to the USPS so the days of a democratic and cheap postal service are probably coming to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ability to mail letters cheap all over the country were a huge benefit for the majority of people.  There are some areas government can provide services more democratically and cheaply and postal service and health care are two examples.

       No, it would cost more for people who lived in remote locations to get their mail. Those in cities, where population density is high and addresses are close together, would get their mail more cheaply because they wouldn't be subsidizing the rural addresses. Why should we "make them" deliver 6 days a week? I have no need for mail that often, and I would gladly pay less if I could for less frequent deliveries. Rural people would probably just pick their mail up from a central location on their way to/from town when they went shopping. There's no real need to have mail trucks deliver to every address all the time.

       Well, you make a good point that there is less of a need than there historically has been.  But I still think there is a benefit to treating all citizens, rural and urban, equally when it comes to mail delivery.
      </p>

       There are still some people that rely on mail delivery (people receiving drugs, for e.g.) and it does promote a higher quality of life for all citizens.  Plus, I don't see how it hurts.  In an era where drones are taking over our jobs I don't mind subsidizing good jobs and subsidizing cheap and efficient mail delivery for all people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Privatizing it just means higher expenses for most, or less convenience, and worse jobs for the workers.  The USPS is a model that has worked for generations and its a shame to see the propaganda chip away at this venerable U.S. tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some areas where Socialism works well and mail delivery is one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually would like to see the USPS re-institute its role in banking and to see a nationalization of internet services.  Access to the internet and e-mail services is very similar to mail services and we pay way too much for crappy private service when we could have a government utility provide a much more democratic service.

       Why? Subsidizing rural life just makes more people live there, which means that the subsidies must continue forever. It leads to permanent inefficiencies. If people want the rural life, fine, but they shouldn't expect others to pay for it.

       Privatizing means lower expenses, because there are incentives to lower expenses. Public sector corporations with monopoly privilege (USPS) have little incentive to do better with the money they have because they can't go out of business and they have no real competition.

       It's not subsidizing all rural life . . . just a certain aspect of it.  Mail delivery, cable, phone, internet and health care should be delivered to all citizens equally imo.

       Actually, "redistribution" of wealth is a buzzword that drives me up the wall.  All economic systems redistribute wealth.  Laissez faire capitalism does this as well . . . the power of capital allows the wealth of the lower classes to be hoovered upwards.

      <p>
       Organizing an economy so that there are lots of middle class workers, be it postal workers or clerks in ma and pa stores, is much better for the vast majority of people.  We are all a lot better off paying slightly more for U.S. goods and services in ma and pa stores than we are paying less for crap made in China.  Efficiency is not always the best goal.  We can have children slave laborers and drones make cheap goods for the 10% of Americans that still have any purchasing power in a neo feudal capitalist society and this may be "efficient" but it's not a just or good situation.

       Providing jobs in certain sectors does not preclude others from holding private jobs.  While I would like to see the number of jobs provided by the government expand (mostly in health care, but also things like national parks, postal workers, and newly nationalized industries like internet and some banking services) I would like to see a stronger privatized sector in other areas (like the ma and pa stores we're talking about here trying to compete with Amazon and Walmart or in farming).  I would love to truly see small business supported more.

       Well, they have lower expenses because they do not have the same mission to treat customers and employees with the same level of respect.  Efficiency not only ignores the quality that customers get and the deal employees get, but it ignores the profit wrung out of the system.  Walmart is hella profitable but instead of this profit being shared amongst a whole middle class of shopkeepers it is in the hands of very few people.  This is not good "efficiency."  Efficiency is not always good.

       The illustrated story looks well done.  I'll try to look it over if I have more time but I can already tell I disagree with some of the assumptions . . . like capitalist investment is necessary to grow an economy . . . or the idea that greed is good.  This is capitalist propaganda imho.  Don't have time to rebut it but I think there are certain sectors where other forms of organization other than laissez faire capitalism are superior.

       No, because in a free market system, the only way to get wealth is to have other people give it to you. And the only way they'll do that is if they are also benefiting from the transaction. In a free exchange,
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       parties get wealthier, or the exchange wouldn't happen. What we have right now is a system where people use the government to get wealthier than they otherwise could, by, for example, controlling regulatory agencies to harm the competition. When government is involved in a transaction, one party usually loses, because otherwise the transaction would have happened without the government involvement.

       Then buy from them. The problem is that small businesses really do suffer from a lot of inefficiencies due to their small scale. However, they are also more flexible than big businesses, so they can often out-compete the big guys by being more responsive to consumer demands.

       If you don't want to see so many huge businesses, you should also work to keep the government's hands out of the economy. Big businesses get bigger once they have enough political clout to start bending the laws and regulations in their favor. See

       You forget that the "profits" are shared with the people who shop there, in the form of lower prices. Walmart has made significant improvements in production and supply chain efficiency. No, I do not idolize Walmart; they use the government to get lots of special treatment and subsidies. But they have been very good for us in terms of doing more with less. They create a lot of wealth for themselves, yes, but the amount of wealth they create for their customers is significant. A penny saved is a penny earned.

       Those of us that value a cohesive society and care about our fellow neighbors want to provide some basic things to everyone--even if some of us benefit more and some of us benefit less.  Heck, insurance and annuities work this way as well.

       Hey, I agree with you.

       Well, there is an efficiency to large scale business but this is often a net negative.  There is no way to prevent this other than government intrusion.  For instance, we use to have more protection for American business but "free trade" policies with places like China helped these big corps get bigger.  Government capture is a problem inherent in capitalism and why we need to artificially limit corporations.  If I were king I would break up most big companies just because of the inherent power.  There might be a few areas where non government large private companies are needed (where the efficiency of scale outweighs the societal costs), like in some manufacturing concerns, but these should be the exception.

       Just because we do doesn't mean that we should, and it doesn't justify the inherent unfairness of taking money from some people and giving it to others. Why do those who have no children, or those who choose private schooling or homeschooling, have to pay tuition for other people? Public schooling is also extremely inefficient, with more and more money thrown at them with little to no improvement. Economics aside, it also introduces some rather scary systemic biases to have your government in charge of education. It becomes politicized and subject to corruption.

       The problem with "stimulus" attempts is that they just kick the can down the road. The money has to come from somewhere, and when the government is in charge of moving it around it typically gets dumped into wasteful projects that squander resources. It's easy to see the good that comes from a new public works program or whatever, because the money is concentrated in one place and you can see the results of its efforts. What's much more difficult to see is where that money was taken from -- private citizens who would have used it in trades that enriched both parties. Public money is always allocated inefficiently because the politicians are spending other people's money on things for other people. Private money is allocated much more efficiently because people are spending for their own benefit, so they take time to ensure they are getting the best value for their money.

       Real free trade doesn't require a policy. It requires that the government stops interfering with the trade that happens naturally.

       I just recoil at the argument it hasn't been "efficient" to school kids.  This argument is based on bad metrics and bad assumptions.  Our public schooling is not the reason kids aren't getting jobs or are going to jail, etc.  These are wider scale decisions on how to run our economy and propagandists use free market excuses to try to justify it (it's really a top down policy to offshore jobs and create a police state to enrich a few people but they hide behind "free market" propaganda).

       It's really easy for a few individuals to control everything so there really is no freedom of choice and freedom of contract.  The natural state of affairs is to collude and to unfairly wield market power to crush competition.  This is not "solving a problem" for consumers.  This is trapping consumers.  Just because someone got wealthy doesn't mean they benefited consumers.  Private health insurance companies serve no real purpose and they got insanely rich.  But are their consumers any better off than countries that have socialized medicine or single payer health care?  No.  This is a profit that capitalists invented and provides no added value and it simply exists by making sure the better alternative is not pursued.

       </em>
       better for everyone than private schools, where people voluntarily spend their money. There are lots of private schools right now, and their students usually perform at levels equal or better to nearby public schools, but for a lot less money. Private schools have incentives to reduce costs on administration, etc., but a counter-incentive to produce a valuable education for students since parents have to pay a lot out of pocket for them. Public schools have no such incentive -- they just have to squeak in under last year's budget and do what they can to get a bigger budget next year.

      <p>
       Real insurance provides an immense benefit. It pools risk. You pay a fee (the premium) to protect you against a catastrophic loss. The "insurance" we have in the health care industry has been distorted to pool payments for known and expected costs, not just unknown risks. This changes consumer behavior considerably. If your auto insurance covered oil changes and gas, do you think you might have less concern for the price of gas? Maybe drive a little farther just for the fun of it, or get an oil change every 1,000 miles just because you could? Now imagine that someone else was paying your premium.

       With that amount of subsidisation the quality would not be worse than what America is currently getting - it's absolutely atrocious. One could say the current internet speeds are being deliberately kept low as there is a internet provider monopoly who's leadership don't want high internet speeds.

       TANSTAAFL. Someone has to pay for everything. The question is whether the money performs better in private hands (who have an incentive to get the most value for their money) or in public hands (who have an incentive to get campaign donations).

       The phone network infrastructure has already been set up (with billions of dollars of government and military money). It would have required a group with enormous capital and intellectual skills as in off the genius chart to have set it up in our capitalistic system.

       ancient money can select the highest quality of intellects, lobby governments , and store all the military tech information not of their own design. Basically you're assertion that government projects are inherently inefficient and worse at innovating/ maintaining than private sector is flat out wrong.

       Well, it's a double edged sword.  They can get rid of more inventory and reach more customers this way but have to cut prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazon is not the sole reason ma and pa stores are failing.  It's macro U.S. economic policy over the last 40 years or so.  It's the "free trade" deals with places like China.  It's the rise of places like Walmart.  And the competitive advantage of internet stores like Amazon that don't have to pay sales tax is a huge advantage to mostly larger companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This increased competition generally lowers prices for consumers but at the expense of the millions of people that use to own and earn a living by working in this sector.  It's now been replaced by a few billionaires at the top (Bozo and the Waltons) while the middle class owners/workers have been replaced by low wage drones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would rather a country where we pay more to local merchants for mostly locally produced products in stores owned and run by locals.

      <blockquote>

        Amazon.com supports online sales tax these days. How’s that for an about-face? For years,
        <strong>
         Amazon avoiding sales tax was a prime—perhaps the prime—company strategy.
        </strong>
        Price was even more important than convenience, and the sales tax swing was plenty big enough to make all the difference.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you're wrong about distribution centers (from the same article as above):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (5). Warehouses Aren’t Presence. By 2008, Amazon had distribution centers or other facilities in 17 sales tax states. Amazon was collecting tax in only four of them: Kansas, Kentucky, North Dakota and Washington. Yet it kept warehouses in Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas. See 2008 Amazon Annual Report.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Amazon claims warehouses or fulfillment centers are not a legal presence sufficient to create nexus for tax purposes.
        </strong>
        See Sorry, Shoppers, but Why Can’t Amazon Collect More Tax? That argument has appeal to purists but seems a stretch. Isn’t a 500,000 or 600,000 square foot warehouse with a hundred employees a presence in the state? See Amazon’s (not so secret) war on taxes.

       Well, reinvestment is a business expense, no?  So they don't technically make a profit, right?

      <p>
       I guess they could make a profit if they stopped investing in further ventures though . . .  which is the claimed reason the stock is inflating without an actual profit.

       It's not the fact that government is losing taxes. It's that amazon can effectively undercut all competitors without being legally done for dumping criminal activity.
Central banks -esp america- can create money out of thin air.

       Well, that may be true.  But ma and pa owners of stores have to charge a sales tax and it's internet stores that have traditionally avoided this . . . I think it's changed now though but in the first few years of the internet stores like Amazon were given a competitive advantage to undercut ma and pas.

       Well, there are only about 4 states that don't have sales tax so the impact of crossing the border to buy goods can't be that big of a deal.  Amazon is going to be a bigger threat to the vast majority of sales tax revenue across the country than those 4 states are.

       Also, as Forbes explains, avoiding sales tax was the main way Amazon succeeded:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For years, Amazon avoiding sales tax was a prime—perhaps the prime—company strategy. Price was even more important than convenience, and the sales tax swing was plenty big enough to make all the difference.

       I am an anarchist. I find the concept of government immoral, considering it is founded upon the principle of violence. You will fund the government, or they will steal more money from you, throw you in jail, or kill you if you resist. It's the definition of mugging to me.

       Of course the system is manipulated; there is no doubt of that. But without the quasi-legitimization of the initiation of force this situation simply could not happen. Where there is government power to force people to do x or y, there are corporate entities that wish to corral that force to do their own bidding. Without the government force to start with, corporations have to compete like everyone else.

       Not always. I noticed you name-dropped some people that have been involved in government central banking schemes since the 19th century. But consider gold or silver production; it can be done by several different companies that can compete with each other for consistency in value, purity, etc. Crypto-currencies are by definition decentralized, so no central authority can control it. Check out Bitcoin and its brethren.

       There are a lot of risks with Bitcoin that I'm very unwilling to take. While I work in the IT industry (or perhaps
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       I work in it), I have little to no trust in anything meaningful in cyberspace.

       We think our money is fake now? Hell, at least (some of) it is paper or coin - tangible. In cyberspace? It truly doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd have a lot more faith in precious metals and gems, especially if, as you say, production was not centralized to very few organizations. But it would still wind up centralized at some point, wouldn't it? It's the nature of things - the strongest competitors eventually merge and each side becomes more powerful and/or wealthy in the process.

       Because the vast majority of people who use this talking point advocate government of some sort . . . especially to enforce the contracts or property rights they they hold so dear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anarchists are at least being intellectually consistent when they argue against all government.

      <p>
       Well, the better analogy would be the state going to war.  It sanctions killing therefore it's not "murder" but justified homicide.  Execution is another analogy that works.
      </p>
      <p>
       When cops kill someone they usually justify it under self defense and even citizens have this right and many Anarchists or libertarians would claim this is a natural right.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, describing taxes as "mugging" is a bit histrionic.  The same could be said for when the government uses its power to enforce your property rights.  Say I see an apple tree in your back yard and I decide to chop it down and take it.  The government would come and mug me of my apples to enforce your "right" to these apples.  All government enforcement of contract and property laws can be described as a "mugging."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's a bit histrionic because the government is providing you with the very currency you claim is being stolen from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I think taxes are a harsh way of funding the government.  I think government should mostly be funded by fiat money.  Income taxes should be abolished except on the top 1% to 10%.  Employment taxes should be abolished.  Most sales taxes should be abolished.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there should be tariffs to protect American products and taxes on sinful items we want to regulate . . . like alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, gambling, and stock trading.  As mentioned there should hardly be an income tax.  And local governments should raise money with a wealth tax (also preferably on the top 1% to 10%) and a small real estate tax.

       you are using the word 'histrionic' improperly
      </p>
      <p>
       your arguments are bizarrely inconsistent, which is doubly silly because you are accusing people of being "inconsistent" when they (correctly) instinctively sense government taxation as theft, or "mugging".
      </p>
      <p>
       the veracity of something does not depend on the person(s) who are delivering the message, or their other beliefs that they happen to have. taxation is theft, whether or not people are down with government, or support government but don't like taxes, or support taxes but don't like government, or whatever scenario you want to come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       as an anarchist, i may not be the biggest fan of statists who are anti-taxation but still support the state, but at least they can recognize taxation for the mugging that it is. unlike yourself, who recognizes taxation as theft, but at the same time do not, because you apparently just do not have the balls to force yourself to admit the truth

       Not sure what you are getting at here. They are clearly spending more money than they make because they continue to expand. If there's any agenda here it's on the part of the board of directors to keep growing the company at the expense of profit.

       More like their actions are consistent with a company whose agenda is more about sacrificing some money now for a larger payoff down the road. More companies used to be this way. Today it's all about the short term for most of wall street. If anything I applaud their vision and strategy, even if I don't really respect the company's practices.

       Yes I'm concerned. It's not just Amazon drones. What about the NFL drones that deliver beer to the fans? The MIT swarm drones that come with facial recognition and react to voice and gesture commands?

       They're backdooring us with making drones mainstream by emphasizing the social/fun/geeky aspects and trying to make us forget that on the other side of the planet these people use drones to murder civilians like flies.

      <p>
       Facebook and Twitter and Google were social/fun/geeky at first. Until Snowden showed us what these things are really meant for.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot on the one hand be against global surveillance and the violation of your constitutional rights and your human rights, and at the same time say Amazon drones are pretty neat. Most of us are too braindead or brainwashed to see the forest for the trees. It is a deep seated and historically ingrained we're-the-good-guys-so-it-can't-happen-here mentality that's got us so docile and willingly marching in lockstep, agreeing to whatever "they" say is good for us, and labelling everyone outside the narrow norm as conspiracy theorist nutjobs or fundamentalist extremists.

       The NFL serves a propaganda function as well.  Hell, there are now three things flying above football stadiums, bald eagles (which I saw before the Michigan v. Ohio St. game I think), military jets, and now drones.

       I guess, but what if this is just a cool,  useful piece of technology and a few people are developing it independently? I don't think it would require a coordinated effort to make drones more acceptable, they are cool and people are going to like them no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there are hobby level drones these days. You're going to see a tonne of drone technology everywhere soon and I feel like it's because of its utility. And if the police start using it against us (as they probably will) it will also be because of the utility of them, not some big secret.

       The military/government funding of the internet is very similar.  And they used private corporations to enrich a few people and monetize this technology that was developed with government money.

       Who are "they"? Companies do what they will to make a buck. Automation. There's not some sinister ulterior motive to NFL drones or Google cars or what have you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can make the observation that more drones will make people more comfortable with them, but it's a bridge too far to conclude that all these companies are deliberately working together so the police can start surveilling everybody.

       I'm not trying to break your stride, we need passionate people willing to stand up, but saying "people use (American) drones to murder civilians like flies" is just incorrect. The both domestic and foreign media has brainwashed the world into believing this. American military and Agency drones don't just go throwing Hellfires at villages willy nilly. There are very strict rules and regulations that require multiple levels of approval possibly taking days from request to approval to drop a missile on a target. Is there collateral damage? Sometimes. Is that acceptable? Absolutely not. But it is not nearly to the degree of which we are led to believe.

       Considering there aren't any reliable official numbers, I'd say you don't know if the collateral damage is high or not.

      <p>
       Also considering how the military keeps track of almost everything in terms of numbers and effectiveness, the lack of data is most likely because collateral damage is embarrassingly high.

       You know, you are absolutely correct. I don't have any real numbers either, but I've worked in the community that perpetrates these strikes for almost 5 years, and solely based on my experience, which obviously doesn't encompass actions taken all over the world, the numbers aren't even close to how they're portrayed to the public.

       I appreciate your honesty. I know people working in Intel (96 bravo) and contractors with big DC firms. I know that there is the general feeling that great measures are taken to ensure precision and avoid civilian casualties. But I also know that compartmentalization is very effective, and it is in the interest of the higher-ups to project the feeling of these measures, whether they are true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of the double-tap standard clearly points to a reckless attitude on the part of those giving the commands. The CIA commanding a majority of the drone strikes is also very reckless. The projected image just doesn't add up. Talk is cheap, and actions speak louder than words. Especially when those words are coming from politicians and bureaucrats.

       I don't think it always makes sense to think about technological development in terms of moving forwards or backwards. Was the development of nuclear weaponry a step forward or backward? Nanothermite? Autonomous killer drones?
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as 'moving forwards' means continuing to let elites, military R&amp;D, and capital dictate what technology we develop, I don't think we should move forwards.
      </p>

       Do I believe we should stop developing new technologies? No. I believe these decisions need to be made democratically and be communally based.

       Right now, I fear that we're being maneuvered into a situation where ecological disaster will only be avoidable by giving these forces even more power, because they'll be the only thing that can save us.

      <p>
       Our ecological situation gets worse and worse as wealth inequality becomes more and more severe. If there isn't a revolution soon, we may have to choose between eco-fascism and catastrophe...

       My point is that progress is dangerous. Not all advances in science are good. Nuclear weapons? Nuclear power? Carbon-polluting technologies?
      </p>
      <p>
       I bring up manifest destiny to point out that what is progress for some (settlers expanding westward) can be catastrophic for others (the tribes who already lived on the land). What is an advancement for some (digging into the land for gold and uranium and coal and oil) is violent for others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who benefits from autonomous drones? And the increasingly advanced killing machines which have been developed in the last 100 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing "stop making scientific/artistic advancements." I have a problem with the way these are being made now, led by corporations, military r&amp;d, elites, and capital with minimal or self-serving concern for the well-being of the earth and the life it supports.

       Oh thank goodness. Thats a very rational argument. Yes, progress for some can be a detriment to others, but I am a bit confused by your nuclear argument with regards to ecological protection. Nuclear power is arguably the best way to produce power with a low carbon footprint. Coal burning and natural gas power plants have hurt the world far more with their carbon output than nuclear ever has with radiation leaks, yet you don't see any press flaming about it like they do with Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets ignore the fact that modern designs of nuclear reactors are fantastically built to withstand virtually any type of trauma short of a meteor. There are not a whole lot of these new ones being built other than China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets ignore the fact that the reactors cannot be built near fault lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets ignore the hyperbolic statements of radiation from Fukushima reaching dangerous levels on the west coast of the United States (the baltic sea has more radiation than the Pacific).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets ignore the fact that over 20% of the power in the US is from nuclear energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Storage of the spent fuel rods is an issue, yes. But it is a far more elegant solution than having to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why do you think that Nuclear Energy would not help our ecological problems? Its one of the only options to go for, and Thorium reactors are extremely promising as well.

       I'm glad you think so. One concern I have with nuclear power is that it  carries the baggage of nuclear security and the entrenched military-industrial complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another is that progress for some/detriment for others debacle. I don't remember who the tribe was, but there was a conflict recently because the u.s. wanted to create a new burial site for nuclear waste on tribal land. The waste needs to be stored for 10,000 years, and the tribe is upset because they consider the land sacred and are not the beneficiaries of the energy and never needed nuclear power to sustain their way of life anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, nuclear energy is dangerous and risky. Perhaps concerns about Fukushima and other reactors are overblown, but fukushima was pretty bad and next time could be even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Above all, though, nuclear energy just isn't enough. Ted Trainer has
       <a href="http://www.greens.org/s-r/48/48-11.html">
        argued
       </a>
       very persuasively that renewable energy cannot sustain a consumer society, even if we were to harvest as much as possible. The same is true of
       <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510002004">
        nuclear energy
       </a>
       . The rich countries' energy consumption is simply too great, and the rest of the world cannot 'catch up' unless there are massive cutbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I think that devoting time, energy, and talent to things like developing drones is really misguided. Even if there is nothing nefarious about using them to deliver books, it benefits the billionaires. Global wealth &amp; energy inequality is staggering and these kinds of developments prolong and deepen a problem we desperately need to address.

       So? neither are scientists/engineers. But you are expecting the scientific and R&amp;D communities to focus on solving global wealth and energy equality. If "they" are responsible for making sacrifices because "they" have too much money, why aren't you? You don't need your cell phone or computer, or 50% of the food you eat. You can live on less and donate that money to the people who need it. So why don't you? You are only making the problem worse by being a consumer and funneling more money to the billionaires that own these corporations. But you have the balls to say its their fault and not yours, your fucken paying them. You are probably better off than more than 50% of the world when it comes to wealth. You are part of the problem, not a victim of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly think the money that went into developing the latest version of the OS on your computer was better spent than the money that is being spent on R&amp;D for drones? But you are not complaining about that, because its practical to you. You bought your computer thinking that its value was worth the price; it would return to you in entertainment and usefulness what it initially cost. but when a company invests in R&amp;D, thinking that the investment will return itself in future profit, they should be shamed! How dare a company spend money for personal gains and not on solving "global wealth &amp; energy inequality". You are a selfish hypocrite. Complaining about others not doing their part when you have done nothing yourself.

       And you think these scientists/engineers are not better off than 50% of the planet? But you do not demand they abandon their phones or computers; for you, to criticize how their work can be used is merely to complain. You use the same technology as I do or we could not be having this conversation, yet you are justified in calling me a selfish hypocrite despite knowing almost nothing about me. You do not know what I have done.

       Im not interested in playing your 50%  game, because you are not playing it either. Such a small number of people control such a vast amount of wealth that while we can be a part of the problem, we can also be a part of the solution. We can use technology and the internet to criticize what is going on and share our thoughts, and science and technology should not be shielded from criticism just because we are using it. In the end, you defend what amazon is doing because their pursuit of profit trumps other concerns, and it is this logic more than the actions of any one person that I am criticizing.

       The difference is that I don't bitch about wealth inequality. I don't point the finger at corporations that are making decisions that are in their best interest because I realize I do the same thing on a smaller scale. Its in my best interests. So yes, if you call them selfish for doing the same thing as you, then you are selfish and a hypocrite.

       You say this like you have somekind of moral high ground. As if funding R&amp;D into drones is more unethical than say, supporting the commercialization of the semiconductor industry (or hell, entertainment industry). If you could invest your money and see a profit down the line would you consider it to be selfish and promoting wealth disparity? Should you be shamed for doing it? If you answered yes, then why are not not sacrificing your own wealth to reduce inequalities? Your own words in this context:

I ask this because you claim they should be making sacrifices, and shaming them for it, while you make none of your own.

       Bullshit. There's a pretty big difference between being the 13th richest person alive, and being well off. We are both selfish, that doesn't mean we are as responsible for wealth inequality as jeff bezos. Neither of us has ties to the CIA or bilderberg membership and the idea that all of that should be ignored because anyone talking about it is bitching is absurd. Divide and conquer. How poor do you have to be to critique the development of drone technology, exactly? You realize I could benefit from this if I wanted to?

       You are against R&amp;D into something not because its nefarious, but because the money could be spent on something that fixes the wealth disparity.

       What difference is that to the man who is starving to death right now because he can't find food? Do you think you are morally superior if you sacrifice 10% by not buying the latest smartphone, compared to someone who sacrifices 10% by not buying a new house?  Both are luxuries, unnecessary, completely "wants" rather than a "needs", but apparently one is worse because they have acquired more wealth than you. In your eyes, feeding that starving man is their responsibility and not yours. They should be the ones making a sacrifice and not you. Why? because you are more entitled to your own money than they are? You are so much better off than the true poor globally, that the change from their wealth to yours would be much more drastic than the change from your wealth to joe shmo richest man alive #8.

       I do not see how that is relevant. They are investing money to realize a profit down the line. They could easily make a profit today if they wanted to but they don't; shareholders/investors think its better off for the future of the company if they focus on expanding their market share.

       If you really felt we were irredeemably selfish for having phones and computers, you'd make the sacrifices you're asking me to make. You're in the same position I am. However, you are not criticizing the system that makes this possible, you're using your critique to shield billionaires from criticism, as if they did not have far more ability to make sacrifices that would do something about global wealth inequality.

       It matters that amazon doesn't make a profit because it shows their rationale is more complicated than you initially made it out to be.

       You say they have far more ability to make sacrifices but what does that even mean? is it not relative? Would a ex-homeless man being evicted from the house he just lived in for 2 months take living on the streets as hard as you would? Who do you think would be making more of a sacrifice? If you scale that up to the wealthy, why are they expected to sacrifice their wealth when you are not? why should you be entitled to a new phone/computer/TV/console when they must sacrifice a new house/boat/car? Its relative. You have yet to address this question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't try to play the "i'm talking about billionaires" game. They are much less responsible for wealth inequality than everyone else. Yes I said that. why? because there are only about 1500 billionaires having a net worth of 5.4 trillion. If you were to redistribute all of that money try and figure out how much it would put in everyone's hands (hint: its less than $1000). Compare that to the ~230 Trillion dollars in wealth that exists and you'll find that anyone with a net wealth of over 37k is on the hook. aka, nearly everyone in western society. But fuck that right? its not your responsibility, push the blame to someone else.

       You clearly haven't taken economics 101 yet. Amazon is run by investors, they know that their company can turn a profit if they want it to. If they shift their focus to making a profit, they could be a profitable company in less than 1 quarter. Instead they feel that the best approach is to keep prices low and expand market share. This will give them a larger piece of the pie in the future allowing for greater profits. They are investing their money to see greater returns along the line, not some secret CIA-bilderberg agenda. Its literally the same thing Sony/Microsoft do when releasing a new console, they sell the console at a loss to increase marketshare &amp; future revenue.

       Billionaires are a small group of people, and it is possible to measure 'responsibility for wealth inequality' in a way that downplays their influence and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Responsibility for wealth inequality is not just about the quantity of wealth one can redistribute, although that is important. Even though billionaires and millionaires can contribute more than everyone else, it is also important to consider

       . This is happening alongside 'austerity' and cuts to social service programs like food stamps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your estimate of the net wealth of billionaires also downplays the role of the industries which manage and administer a pool of assets much, much larger than their net wealth. For instance, the

        bank of new york mellon
       </a>
       has over US$1.4 trillion in assets under management and US$27.69 trillion in assets under custody and administration. The assets of the global fund management industry total at around $117 trillion. That's half of the wealth you claim exists today.

       You don't know that, and those things are not necessarily opposed. Amazon inked a $600 million cloud computing deal with the CIA

       . Google provides the NSA with its cloud computing. Clearly the CIA and NSA trust these corporations to secure these machines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazon and Google also happen to be developing and deploying mass-produced drone technology just like the U.S. military. CEOs of Amazon and Google happen to have attended bilderberg meetings. The CIA recruits many engineers and computer scientists at college campuses. Many of the people working for the CIA have another employer as a cover. As companies like Amazon and Google continue to develop drone technology, the CIA is going to reap the benefits of most if not all of the improvements that are made, especially when it comes to AI.

       Edited for emphasis.

      <p>
       There is no way that carbon emissions from cars are systematically destroying/killing a targeted group of people. You are claiming that the byproduct of a industry created a century ago was is deliberate, targeting a specific group of people. The effects of carbon emissions were not even known 100 years ago, let alone the beginning of a deliberate mass murder of some unidentified group of people.

       I've read the links, and I sum them up by "begging for buzzwords". Not a single one identifies a group that will be 'destroyed' as a result of carbon emissions or global warming, let alone how it was deliberate.

       'Genocidal consequences', does not change the definition of genocide, or that you were referring to carbon emissions as the cause.

       Yeah this doesn't worry me, because the only thing Amazon can do is provide us with better services so they make more money. The government, on the other hand, has power and can come arrest me if it wants to whenever it wants to as the constitution has less and less bearing on the actions of the government. As long as we hold the government's feet to the fire, I have no problem with this technology in the hands of the private sector.

       Yes, but this is a story to get people used to the idea of drones. It seems highly unlikely that miniaturised drone helicopters are going to be a more cost-effective means of delivering goods than a minimum-wage man in a van. The corporate liability insurance for these drones may be prohibitive - any incident involving one of these things injuring somebody will involve massive payouts.

       I don't see why you would think drones would be a more expensive delivery system. First of all UPS, FedEx, and USPS workers all make over minimum wage. Second the delivery company has to pay for the gas in the the truck. The drone isn't powered by gas it is powered by electricity so it will be cheaper to run and will only get even cheaper as fossil fuel prices go up. Finally the system is not even about saving money it is about Amazon being able to deliver shit to your house in 30 min. or less. There are legitimate concerns about drones but not being effective but cost is not one of them.

       The current crop of mini-drones are really quite limited in range and are going to struggle to lift any object more than a few hundred grammes. These drones are flimsy as fuck - it would only take a strong gust of wind to flip them over - or are you really anticipating military-sized drones landing in the street outside your house?

       No of course not this drone delivery system is an interesting idea from amazon that is still years off from implementation. Also according to amazon the drones will only deliver packages up to five pounds and only to places that are 10 miles from a fulfillment center. Most packages will continue to be shipped the old fashioned way.

       On the flip side, the corporation doesn't have to pay a drone a salary or benefits, and never has to worry about the drone getting pregnant, taking a leave of absence, poor working conditions, or quitting. It's the perfect worker.

       There were 7,185 commercial airplanes in the USA at the end of 2011. There were about 142,300 commercial aircraft mechanics in the USA in 2010.

       Drones are certainly simpler than commercial airliners but I seriously doubt it will be anywhere near 100:1.

       Well it's no more complex than a car or other type of vehicle- and it's smaller. How many cars can one person repair in a given week? Probably dozens. I am envisioning a drone garage with lots of spare parts- probably with 10-20 mechanics in it and they are supporting hundreds of small drones. I don't think it would need to be a huge operation.

       It could easily be 1 mechanic per amazon outlet. The things are built from parts that are cheaper to replace than repair (batteries, electric motors, cameras, sensors) so you don't need a crew working on them. With a airliner, you don't replace the entire engine if it stops working, but with a drone that small its cost effective to do so. So I could easily see 1 guy maintaining a fleet of 100 of those drones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if 10% failed on a daily basis, that's 10 part repairs a day or 45 minutes to replace each part.

       Failures probably won't typically happen at the repair shop. Someone will need to retrieve the failures.

       I agree that this could reduce the number of people employed due to Amazon business just like any type of robotics reduces labor. It's a shame that the US education system is trending more toward creating delivery drivers and less toward creating robotic engineers every year.

       What if the mailman came through your property/took a shortcut (instead of the sidewalk) to get to another mailbox.  I'm sure there is a law that states you can do whatever you want to anyone on your property (especially if you have a "No Trespassing" sign) and do whatever you want with anything he was carrying.  I do not, however, know how high a person's "property" exists/borders.

       They do that in Minneapolis.  They walk through the yards from house to house.   You actually have to shovel a path across your yard for them in the winter or you can be ticketed.

       Pretty slick, 100's of millions in advertising on their super bowl of shopping night..
      </p>
      <p>
       This definitely looks like a free traffic gimmick- popping up all over the message boards, news, and tech websites, just hours before cyber Monday. With a link to their website below the youtube video- going to a page advertising "Cyber Monday deals week starts today"
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously anyone that has an R/C hobby knows this is obviously a joke for advertising their Cyber Monday.. but to play along with the Fortune 500 ceo psychopathic mindset:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm.... 1) Eliminate human jobs with automated gps drones VS using the collapsing postal service or air/ground services like FED-EX &amp; UPS.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Progress!
      </p>
      <p>
       (Hey- at least the bankers will get rich insuring this disaster waiting to happen.. Camera, privacy, pet, &amp; property issues, crashes with those rotor blades, malfunctions, shoot downs, noise. Thefts will increase -psychology: stealing from a human vs nameless corporate computer drone.)

       Not Really, we can't be afraid of every new technology because of what it might do.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be rational with our fears. Remotely operated drones, for uses like this make a lot of sense, and have the chance to be faster and greener than current technology.

       It's also certain applications of technology that I fear for logical reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear my car only having electronic locks with no manual lock. Only way out when it doesn't work is to break the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear only electronic windows on cars because again, only way to "roll it down" if it fails is to break it. Manual doesn't have that problem, it could potentially jam but so can the electronic and at that point if you need to break the window you'll do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear only electronic locks on the doors to my home, which I will never ever let happen, because holy shit do I even need to explain how fucking stupid of an idea that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is healthy to have a general mistrust towards certain technologies and how they can be exploited.

       I had a car that, while it had both types of locks, you really couldn't grab the lock mechanism manually while it was in the locked position, effectively sticking you with only electronic locks. I didn't notice it before I bought it, but it was one of the reasons I kept a window breaking device in the car.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just about exploiting the technology. If you lose power in the vehicle, you're basically trapped in. It's really hard to break automotive glass without applying lots of force with something hard and pointy.

       Yeah, especially since our protections have been whittle away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third parties like Amazon have been giving information to the police more freely now and the police/gov. can more easily use this information against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are fewer protections for invasion of privacy.  This technology is coming into fruition at a time when our privacy rights are probably at the lowest they've been in the history of this Republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, look how we now have a web of cameras on our streets and there is no regulation over how they are used against us.

       We should have the freedom of contract and if we don't like our phone company or cable company, we should just drop them and go with a company that treats us well.  Same with insurance companies.  It's up to consumers to do the research and shop for the best deal.  Free market capitalism will be a sufficient restraint on bad behvaior.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they screw you over you can always call and complain and they will spend hours pretending to listen to your concerns without doing much.  Well, they may issue a gift card that just makes it slightly better--payable in 8 to 10 weeks.  And if that fails you can sue them . . . well, actually, you gave that right away (did you read the fine print?) and you can go to arbitration where you don't stand a chance and have to pay their lawyer bills if you lose.  Hey, don't like it?  Do some research on the internet and hope you don't fall prey to a "consumer rights" site that is actually paid for by industry with the intention of heading any of you troublemakers off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, the free market is the best way to look out for customers.  If some Bozo makes a billion dollars it's probably because he
       <del>
        is really good at suckering/entrapping victims
       </del>
       provided a service that was mutually beneficial to all parties.

       I'm against Big Brother as much as anyone, but I very much like the idea of EVERYBODY having cameras and drones - not just "The Man". I wish every city had drones (operated by civilian overwatch - not the PD) following their police when on duty. It would protect the public, and it would preserve good cops and start to eliminate the bad ones. We live in a surveillance society, and I think we should all take part in it, instead of being scared and trying to pretend we can put it all back in the bottle.

       I started to count, on my fingers, the number of ways that this could go horribly wrong. I ran out of fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine the lawyers at Amazon are buzzing with the ramifications of delivering packages autonomously to random remote locations, and doing it without losing the drone to overhead cables or overenthusiastic gunowners, and without killing anybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the number of ways this could fail is infinite. The whole scheme is a disaster waiting to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the real purpose of it? To get us accepting and even enthusiastic about the idea of little undermanned helicopters whizzing around above our heads. That's all it can be. And once we've accepted them, they will be used against us.

       Yeah. At first I was thinking of the money they would save over a truck but it really wouldn't be that efficient as it's not like you could load nearly as much stuff on a drone.  And it still takes an employee to operate it.  Maybe in real rural areas it could make sense?

      <p>
       Amazon has never made a profit and it probably exists to serve the government or other mafia figures for reasons like this.

       I think you could look at this one of two ways. 1.) being that most civilian technology was a first one point military technology, and thats great if it benefits civilian life, why not use it. 2.) perhaps it is just another scheme put out there by the powers higher than us to basically "test the waters" about how the public reacts to drones above them?

       There is no mystery,automobiles can take kids to school or bulldoze schools to the ground,drones can drop off parcels or drop off bombs etc etc.

       So yeah drones will be used for everything you can imagine.
Get used to it or get a catapult/gun and shoot them down.

       Government and police forces will already have their own drones.  In my opinion the more private people/institutions employing drones the better.  This means that the government won't have a monopoly on drones they way they do on violence.  Drones have to become mainstream the same way that telephones, guns, cars and frozen pizza have.  It's a new technology with amazing and incredible potential and also very dangerous potential, just like guns, cars, and not so much frozen pizza but you get my point.  We're going to see them in our lives, that's not backdooring that's just new technology spreading. What would be of greater concern is if the government said we don't have a right to use drones in the civilian sector.  Bezos is no peach, but at least you have one giant keeping drones in civilian hands.

       I'm a little late to this one, but I think drones for everyone might be a real possibility in ten years, and it might be a great equalizer of sorts. If anyone has read Iain Banks, you might recall knife missiles. Essentially it's an AI in a small drone about the size and shape of a four inch long double ended knife blade, but a little fat in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is rather intriguing to imagine a drone as a constant companion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine in 20 years you have a drone the size of a humming bird, one of the really really small species, not much bigger than a large bumble bee. It is your smart phone and a drone. Perhaps not AI, but dumb-smart enough to make Siri look like a phonograph. It stays with you always hovering nearby monitoring and recording everything around you. It can respond to sub-vocalized commands and inputs visuals directly to a heads up display embedded in a contact lense. It has radar, FLIR, GPS. When social conduct dictates, it flies into your shirt pocket or lands unobtrusively on your shoulder and goes to standby. It can alert authorities if you are in danger, and inversely alert you to the presence of authorities. In emergency situations it can defend you as an impact weapon. It will have software that detects aggression before you even realize you're in trouble. Although it's body is made of carbon nanotubes and is extremely light weight, it is yet very stiff--essentially a projectile capable of 60mph top speed and thus poses a significant deterrent. Or in the alternative it can seek help. It will be your baby monitor. It will watch the kids in the yard and feed video to you. It will play with the cat when not needed. It will inspect the garden before you get out of bed and let you know it's time to pick tomatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all going to have drones eventually. The question is will it be an equalizer? Will they make police and others accountable? Will drones become like the Internet--developed by the military, commercialized and then democratized by the people?

       How about: I'm the NSA. I know you just ordered something from Amazon. It will arrive in 30 minutes. I hack into the drone, send it back; and I send my drone that looks similar. You take the package, open it; and BAM. You're dead. Then I send people to clean up. And no one knows your missing until someone calls 911 two or three days or weeks later. Brilliant. These guys are geniuses. I'm thinking of going to the dark side with them. It is far more entertaining.

       IMO @ this stage Amazon is just using overpriced currently non feasible prototype idea hype to appear more advanced than they are. PR hype much alike prototypes @ car shows of which
       <strong>
        most fail to be delivered
       </strong>
       in any near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not see this as a soon to be large scale reality:
      </p>
      <p>
       A 5 pound package falls on a human from high above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cries of foul that poor areas are not serviced.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most all dense urban areas door delivery would be impossible &amp; only rooftop heliport penthouse illetes would be serviceable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazon ships so many packages the sky would be full of too many potential packages falling upon people, making such accidents possibly daily occurrences.
      </p>
      <p>
       How wide of /many frequency channels would amazon need to own? As I comprehend it RC units such as these require multiple channels or cross communication info becomes an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who the fuck is going to drive the drones? Are they going to team with googles self driving car tech? This would be much more a pain in the ass to to program IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weather [wind rain hail snow] would pummel the shit out of the drones they have shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this PR prototype hype is going to be super expensive &amp; only done to service rural rich routes &amp; likely only for a short period of time.

       I started three attempts in trying to explain the plain obvious, but then I deleted it all, because it is so obvious. If you can't see it, if you can't think further than "but the police are nice people, here to help us", then I am afraid any explanation to the contrary won't make any sense to you.

       It was surreal to watch Amazon unveil the drones and brag about winning the contract to host the CIA's datacenters in the same show. Clearly Amazon is in bed with the CIA, which surely means their drones will be doing much more then just delivering packages

       Drone Tech will advance rapidly in the next decade, it won't just be the government, it will be used for advertisements, research, general surveillanc not just of the public but for wildlife, geologic events, and just grid surveys where it might be too costly to send a person.  Like it or not you will see this tech everywhere, yes there will be a lot of abuse of it, hence why the FAA is going crazy over proposals for regulation of thousands of these things in US airspace daily.

       I too have been extremely skeptical about the use of drones, and with the current enlightenment of the NSA and surveillance on the brain, of course this general skepticism is going to perpetuate.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is severely difficult to allow technology to thrive right now given the situation. Technological advancement is happening one way or the other, and to stop it in it's tracks is attempting to stop evolution in a way. I have faith in humanity to overcome tyranny, so we can prosper and move forward.

       The police will be using them regardless of whether or not Amazon uses them.  The police (in some states) already use mounted, hidden surveillance cameras for routine traffic tickets - running red lights, speeding, maybe even stop signs. In my eyes, Amazon's use is irrelevant to the surveillance equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm interested in Amazon using them because delivery that rapidly seems really cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a bit leery because of safety. I could see them crashing and hurting someone or damaging property. I could see the tinfoil hat crowd shooting at them or mucking with their electronics and causing those crashes.

       Drones are here to stay.  They will only get more sophisticated and smaller.  Just need updated regulations to govern their use to balance security and privacy properly.

       I'm confused. Why am I supposed to be worried about Amazon? Besides their insanely low prices and the fact that they carry pretty much everything I've ever needed, I've never felt threatened by them. In fact, their customer service has always been pretty good. Returns are hassle free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'm looking forward to their new drone delivery service. As soon as that little helicopter lands on my lawn, I'm gonna hit it with a bat and throw it in a bag and use it for parts. Its like order a few phone case, get a free drone.

       The fact that this Amazon idea would really only be efficient in urban areas is completely shattered when you realize that most people there live in apartment style housing. There is no front porch for you to land on without other people potentially compromising your delivery. Amazing technology nonetheless.

       UPS/FedEx trucks are larger than the proposed delivery drones, and also come staffed with a real live person that can interfere with hijacking attempts and/or call the authorities.

       It's demonstrably easier to take out one of these tiny drones than it is to take out a truck. Fly one straight at me, I'll take it out with a baseball bat.

       Also seems unlikely. They'll probably fly high enough to avoid running into things like trees and houses and people and stuff, then descend at their destination to deliver their package.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, one wonders just how big or small they might be. Probably not truck-sized, but it might take a fairly big piece of aircraft to deliver a 35-60 pound box, right?

       I would guess drone deliveries are going to be for smaller items. Sorta like how right now you can order stuff delivered to Amazon Locker, but only up to a certain size/weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I think if one of these things descended to my front door to drop off a package, I'd have at least a pretty good opportunity to take a swing at it.

       Really, taking a swing at a drone would be more justifiable if it was a police drone. If enough of them get taken out and the cost for replacing the fleet continually goes up, maybe the police departments that use/will use these things will cut their losses and stop using them.

       Well, let's think about this for a second. Personally, I like Amazon's services and I think that if this is truly possible on a grand scale this is a great thing. I would be proud to support some form of technology that alleviates drudgery for all of those delivery people.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, OP does have a point. but, we need to realize that not every form of technology is looking to do us harm, for technology is inherently neutral. I think what you're getting at, OP, is that we as a society cannot be this ass backwards about the technology we employ. Drone Strikes are currently killing a ton of people every day, needlessly, but at the same time does that make the use of automated vehicles reprehensible? I say no.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that we are all visiting this subreddit because we know that what OP is talking about is entirely possible (you would be a fool to think that it is not) if no action is taken to prevent it. So, here we are. I hope that we decide to act when our hour is upon us.

       Add terrorists and criminals in that. You guys see the solar powered drone boat that went from east coast to Europe? How long until smugglers have them? I am betting they already do. 40 drones carrying max payload of explosive flying in formation heading into...target of choice?

       Really. You're more worried about the several pre-teens with access to those resources than the United States military that already has a proven track record of killing children in poor communities with drones? The same military that depends largely upon the MIC, which depends on it's Corporate roots for funding?

       The Police Service of Northern Ireland already fly their own drones, usually for security alerts or crowd control situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were bought/ gifted for the G8 summit this year.

       I sometimes think that N.Ire is used as a 'proving ground' for a lot of these technologies. Already ANPR and remote control disarming robots were developed here.

       This drone drama is getting ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its called the future. What did you expect.  Law enforcement technology is not going to stay in the twentieth century.  Get over it.  Police in most big cities already have drones.  They are not looking inside your house, they are patrolling outside, just like cops with cars and helicopters have been doing for decades.  Drones allow them to do their job more effectively and for less money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for all the facial recognition shit that they will be employing.  What did you expect.  Law enforcement technology is going to continue advancing with the times.  Cop cars already scan license plates and put the locations of your car in a database, no one really cares about that.  If this stuff increases the arrest rate for murders and rapes im all for it.  They are not violating my privacy and I am not planning on committing any crimes.

       It's called the future, a place where cops can raid your home with no knock warrants kill anyone that's in the way while doing it, causing no repercussions to themselves no matter what the situation was at the time of the warrant, a time where cops can shoot unarmed civilians in public places while causing harm to innocents in said public places and put all legal blame for causing harm to innocents on the unarmed person they were shooting at while taking no repercussions themselves for pulling the trigger and causing harm to bystanders/innocents. This is America home of the tyrant police state and you think giving these people (who already abused what little power they have), more power would be a good idea? the only thing i see past this point is a whole lot a death of many tyrants and many patriots and i don't see that as being beneficial for any side regardless of which side you think your on.

       Paranoid hyperbole aside, None of that involves drones.  If you dont want cops killing civilians then you need to stop them from killing civilians.  That has nothing to do with drones, that has to do with accountability of the police.

       Don't you see? Drones becoming accepted by the mainstream because they "deliver packages" just makes it easier for them to justify producing more drones to murder and spy on people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's to stop them having armed police drones hovering over suburban neighborhoods in future?

       I guess I differ on how I view this situation. I view this as an example of the free market using technology to better serve their customers. I mean who doesn't want to get the products they buy online delivered same day?

       You are talking about two different entities though. How is Amazon using technology to speed up shipping the same as the government killing people? It's like saying we can't have airlines because the government will use planes to drop bombs. All tools can be used for evil purposes (eg, guns, knives, cars, needles) but also have very important peaceful purposes.

       What free market? The free market does not exist in the USA.

       No, I'm talking about the government creating mainstream acceptance of drone technology so that they can further justify military and police drones over US soil.

       A true free market does not exist but we do have a quasi-free market (not a real free market i know). Amazon producing shipping drones is not the government creating mainstream acceptance. In the interview, the Amazon CEO even said the government will be the one to slow down the process to make it a reality. Why would the government slow it down if it wanted to make it mainstream?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how using drones to ship packages will make people more accepting of using drones to kill. It's not like people using guns to hunt for food makes the public more accepting of people using guns to kill people. The technology is not the problem, the way you use it is. And if the people can't see the difference between using technology to ship faster and using it to kill people, then we have much bigger problems.

       You should also know they don't need a warrant to peer into windows.  They don't need a warrant to view things in plain sight when they have a right to be there.

       Police state and the number of people in prison are different things. Police do not (yet) have the right to do whatever they damn well please. Some may act like it, but they're the vast minority and they usually face consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       If cops can already look into our windows, then the problem isn't that they might get new technology to do it, but that they're allowed to do it at all. Fix the main problem, not the branch-off.

       I have no problem with amazon drones, thats if they wont have any surveillance. Government and Police? What else will they use them for other than surveillance? Its not hard to make a compromise between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       If amazon ends up having what seems like microphones (cameras are a given because they need them to see and navigate), then I wont use these drone things. Easy as that.

        Why? Subsidizing rural life just makes more people live there, which means that the subsidies must continue forever. It leads to permanent inefficiencies. If people want the rural life, fine, but they shouldn't expect others to pay for it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not subsidizing all rural life . . . just a certain aspect of it.  Mail delivery, cable, phone, internet and health care should be delivered to all citizens equally imo.  This is based on fairness.  Same with school buses.  Rural kids should have the same access to schools even though it costs more to bus them there.
      </p>

       <p>
        It hurts because wealth is redistributed inefficiently, which is a drain on economic growth.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually, "redistribution" of wealth is a buzzword that drives me up the wall.  All economic systems redistribute wealth.  Laissez faire capitalism does this as well . . . the power of capital allows the wealth of the lower classes to be hoovered upwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organizing an economy so that there are lots of middle class workers, be it postal workers or clerks in ma and pa stores, is much better for the vast majority of people.  We are all a lot better off paying slightly more for U.S. goods and services in ma and pa stores than we are paying less for crap made in China.  Efficiency is not always the best goal.  We can have children slave laborers and drones make cheap goods for the 10% of Americans that still have any purchasing power in a neo feudal capitalist society and this may be "efficient" but it's not a just or good situation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fine, you do it then. I do mind, and I'd rather opt out.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Providing jobs in certain sectors does not preclude others from holding private jobs.  While I would like to see the number of jobs provided by the government expand (mostly in health care, but also things like national parks, postal workers, and newly nationalized industries like internet and some banking services) I would like to see a stronger privatized sector in other areas (like the ma and pa stores we're talking about here trying to compete with Amazon and Walmart or in farming).  I would love to truly see small business supported more.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Privatizing means lower expenses, because there are incentives to lower expenses. Public sector corporations with monopoly privilege (USPS) have little incentive to do better with the money they have because they can't go out of business and they have no real competition.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, they have lower expenses because they do not have the same mission to treat customers and employees with the same level of respect.  Efficiency not only ignores the quality that customers get and the deal employees get, but it ignores the profit wrung out of the system.  Walmart is hella profitable but instead of this profit being shared amongst a whole middle class of shopkeepers it is in the hands of very few people.  This is not good "efficiency."  Efficiency is not always good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illustrated story looks well done.  I'll try to look it over if I have more time but I can already tell I disagree with some of the assumptions . . . like capitalist investment is necessary to grow an economy . . . or the idea that greed is good.  This is capitalist propaganda imho.  Don't have time to rebut it but I think there are certain sectors where other forms of organization other than laissez faire capitalism are superior.

        I fear only electronic windows on cars because again, only way to "roll it down" if it fails is to break it. Manual doesn't have that problem, it could potentially jam but so can the electronic and at that point if you need to break the window you'll do it.

      <p>
       I had a car that, while it had both types of locks, you really couldn't grab the lock mechanism manually while it was in the locked position, effectively sticking you with only electronic locks. I didn't notice it before I bought it, but it was one of the reasons I kept a window breaking device in the car.

       It's not just about exploiting the technology. If you lose power in the vehicle, you're basically trapped in. It's really hard to break automotive glass without applying lots of force with something hard and pointy.

       No of course not this drone delivery system is an interesting idea from amazon that is still years off from implementation. Also according to amazon the drones will only deliver packages up to five pounds and only to places that are 10 miles from a fulfillment center. Most packages will continue to be shipped the old fashioned way.

        The USPS has not directly received taxpayer-dollars since the early 1980s with the minor exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters.[6] Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume,[7] after which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act,[8] (which mandated $5.5 billion per year to be paid into an account to pre-fund retiree health-care, 75 years into the future, a requirement unique among organizations and businesses in the U.S.[9]), revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced[10] declining mail volume,[11] prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting costs to reduce its budget deficit.[12]

       While I'd much rather spend that money on high speed internet than on blowing up brown people, your comment presumes that the government could actually provide that service for that many people for that price. As with

        nearly all government programs

       , the cost would far exceed initial projects, and the quality would be much worse.

       Edited for emphasis.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way that carbon emissions from cars are systematically destroying/killing a targeted group of people. You are claiming that the byproduct of a industry created a century ago was is deliberate, targeting a specific group of people. The effects of carbon emissions were not even known 100 years ago, let alone the beginning of a deliberate mass murder of some unidentified group of people.

       I am critiquing drone technology in other ways, if you look at what I've said in the rest of this thread that'll become clear. You've picked out one statement of mine you don't like. Fine. Wealth and energy inequality IS a problem. I don't deny that I need to make sacrifices. So do you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really felt we were irredeemably selfish for having phones and computers, you'd make the sacrifices you're asking me to make. You're in the same position I am. However, you are not criticizing the system that makes this possible, you're using your critique to shield billionaires from criticism, as if they did not have far more ability to make sacrifices that would do something about global wealth inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It matters that amazon doesn't make a profit because it shows their rationale is more complicated than you initially made it out to be. It has something to do with the bilderberg group's agenda, and the CIA's plans. But talking about those things would shatter the false equivalences you are trying to create.
