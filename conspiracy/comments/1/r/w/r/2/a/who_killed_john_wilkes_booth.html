       A very strange and seemingly unimportant question answered by an even stranger revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boston Corbett, a strange man who disobeyed a direct order to take Booth alive so that he could be interrogated and so that his coconspirators could be discovered.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When Booth's diary was recovered by Stanton's troops, it was delivered to Stanton. When it was later produced during the investigation, eighteen pages had been ripped out.
       </p>
       <p>
        From Booth's trunk, a coded message was found that linked him directly to Judah P. Benjamin, the Civil War campaign manager in the South for the House of Rothschild. When the war ended, the key to the code was found in Benjamin's possession.

       Thanks for posting this.  Who knew it went back

       What I find so weird is how the
       <em>
        modus operandi
       </em>
       (mode of operation) has so little variation.  Set up a patsy assassin who gets killed while in some form of police custody or detention (a burning barn is a form of detention if you're in it).  Call the patsy a "lone gunman."   And so on.

       "I know in expressing with this frankness my ultimate opinion of the Jews, I expose myself to enormous danger. Many people share it, but very few dare to express it publicly, for the Jewish sect...constitutes today a veritable power in Europe. It reigns despotically in commerce, in the banks, and it has invaded three-quarters of German journalism, and a very considerable portion of the journalism of other countries. Woe, then, to him who has the clumsiness to displease it!" ~ Mikhail Bakunin, 1814-1876, Russian revolutionary. (Study of the German Jews, 1869)

       Dorner is the only person to kill someone in Irvine, CA (my hometown) in over 3 years. He killed an innocent couple that didn't deserve to die. I don't think he was a patsy, just a murderer

       Just consider how you know that fact. Christopher Dorner was never tried, never had a body of evidence produced, and had his own testimony cut lamentably short by both the multiple differing copies of his "manifesto" (a clear watchword by the way, only nuts release manifestos, ergo, Dorner was a nut) and being burned to death by the police. You can maintain your opinion, but at least consider the source before condemning the man as a murderer.

       That's true, innocent until proven guilty, and he never was 'proven' guilty, but the government only kills when they feel it will benefit them in some sort of way. It doesn't make sense that the government would kill a man and his wife (who were people of political unimportance as far as I know).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's plausible that the government killed these people in an attempt to deface Dorner, but why choose Irvine? It's one of the safest places in America and killing someone there would provide a good anti-government message by showing that the police can't even protect those in the safest place. I'm not going to say Dorner is evil, but it doesn't make sense (to me) that the government would kill someone in such a police infested suburb, since it shows that the police are less powerful than previously thought, which is what I assume Dorner was trying to show.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think you can give me a reason that those people weren't killed by Dorner, I'm all ears, it just seems strange that the government would kill a couple, especially in a high risk place like Irvine (rarely do people ever get away with murder, or even robbery here).
      </p>
      <p>
       Facts can be altered, but logic prevails over all. If Dorner didn't kill that couple, then why would the government do it? Considering that the attack occurred in the early evening.

       That is not how a criminal conviction works. There are any number of other explanations beyond "the government killed that couple to pin it on Dorner." And truth is, you or I don't need to come up with the explanation. Convicting someone of a crime requires evidence and a trial. There is neither in this case. You can say you suspect Dorner killed that couple, but the only reason you suspect such is because you were told to suspect Dorner. If you had never heard that Dorner committed the murder from the same authorities who burned him alive, what line of reasoning would you use to link him to the crime? The type of thinking you are engaged in is dangerous and subverts the very notions of justice upon which our judicial system is based.

       Burden of proof, we both have no association to the person, and both lack the resources to find the truth. My basis is on who the main suspect was, while yours is on no basis at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not asking for proof, but I would like to know who else has a vendetta against this couple or would have motivation to kill them. Dorner had a clear association with them, which is why he was known as the number one suspect.

       That is not proof. Proof is physical evidence, eyewitness testimonies, video evidence, etc. The prosecution's duty is to overcome the burden of proof. It is not about what information we both have, it is about the simple fact that there was no trial. There are no witnesses who have been examined. There is no evidence that has been examined. There is only the say-so of the very same people that prevented gathering any sort of evidence, or even a suspect, by burning the man alive. You are calling a man a murderer based only on hearsay and yet you still try to justify it as some sort reasoned position. It is not. God forbid you should ever be selected for jury duty.

       What are you talking about? There were hundreds of witnesses to Booth shooting Lincoln and it was known from the first day that there was a conspiracy.

       You think the word "patsy" means a person who did not do the crime.  That is not correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The patsy is the person on whom a conspiracy blames the whole thing.  Even though Booth fired the shot, he is considered a "lone nut gunman" because (apparently) he was the "fall guy", or patsy, for that conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patsy is a mafia word and it's not the same as the victim of a frame-up.

        Abraham Lincoln worked valiantly to prevent the Rothschild's attempts to involve themselves in financing the Civil War.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, Lincoln and his Treasury Secretary, Salmon Chase, asked August
Belmont, the banker and an agent of the Rothschilds, to seek funding in
Europe for the war effort.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Interestingly, it was the Czar of Russia who provided the needed assistance against the British and French, who were among the driving forces behind the secession of the South and her subsequent financing. Russia intervened by providing naval forces for the Union blockade of the South in European waters, and by letting both countries know that if they attempted to join the Confederacy with military forces, they would also have to go to war with Russia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is not accurate. Russia did support the United States rhetorically and declined to join France and Britain in breaking the blockade, but it didn't send forces to help the blockade nor did it, as far as I am aware, threaten France and Britain with war if they assisted the Confederacy.

       All wrong. Chase was not an agent of the Rothschilds, the National Banking act did not establish a central bank, and the Rothschilds had nothing to do with its passage.

      <p>
       Judah P. Benjamin didn't have anything to do with the Rothschilds and the Rothschilds opposed the Confederacy. They forbade the trading of Confederate bonds in their exchange in Frankfurt.

       This quote is valid, but it isn't against the "international bankers", but against the Bank of the United States. Also, it's from February, 1834, not 1835.

       The quote "The bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me...." is from 1832. Jackson is referring to the attempt to defeat him in the election.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what the coincidence is supposed to be. Garfield made the declaration about the control of money in 1880, when he was in the House of Representatives. He was arguing against
       <em>
        the government

       printing paper money. Garfield was well known as a hard-money Republican and a friend of the bankers.

       , not Executive Orders 11 and 110. Second, it did nothing to exterminate the Federal Reserve. The order was part of Kennedy's plan to eliminate silver certificates and replace them with Federal Reserve notes.
