       Verizon got a lot of shit last year for introducing a DVR with similar creepy features - talking about targeting contraceptive ads to people it detects romancing, etc...

       Yeah a lot of kids are going to get it and have zero problems. They'll grow up loving the technology and have no problems being laser/IR scanned at every waking moment. No problem with that at all. We can trust companies that make electronics, no matter how invasive the tech is or how many times they get caught lying/aiding spy/law enforcement organizations
      </p>
      <p>
       might as well copy/past this here too...
      </p>
      <p>
       The kinect, and other viewer-monitoring devices, are going to change advertising and programming/content to levels you couldn't believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The IR will know which parts of commercials send the most blood to our cocks, or which tv-show arguments/news programs get us mad, what makes us happy, what we'll sit through, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think tv, and everything else "entertainment" now, is derogatory and pandering enough as it is. If they're going to be openly collecting this kind of data - and openly trying to monetize every aspect of it - and not so openly using it for scarier purposes...
      </p>
      <p>
       TV and movies are going to be TERRIBLE in ten years, not to mention how far the police state will advance by then...
      </p>
      <p>
       This shouldn't be about gamers avoiding one company's product, it should be a society rejecting an

          "This may sound preposterous but it is neither a joke nor an exaggeration," Capuano wrote. "These DVRs would essentially observe consumers as they watch television as a way to super-target ads. It is an incredible invasion of privacy. Given what we have recently learned about the access that the government has to the phone numbers we call, the emails we send and the websites we visit, it is important for consumers to decide for themselves whether they want this technology. Think about what you do in the privacy of your own home and then think about how you would feel sharing that information with your cable company, their advertisers and your government."

We could have compressed the crap out of them and saved a ton of bandwidth but I guess if we did that then the NSA would have to figure out the compression/encryption on each game... ...Microsoft policy does not permit the transmission of encrypted voice, video, or text chat...

          Microsoft provides fusion center technology and funding for surveillance - Did you know Microsoft helps fund the National Fusion Center Association which, in turn, helps police departments buy surveillance tech? In fact, it provides fusion architecture and the Microsoft Fusion Core Solution.

       Or 3rd party, like SteamOS.  Imagine routing your XBone or PS4 to run the SteamOS.  With proper emulator you'd have no problem popping in your XBone or PS4 games into their respective systems and going to town on a whole different interface.  Of course, there's going to be that pesky issue with XBox Live and PSN...  Better just run Steam.  But Steam has their own marketing tactics too, just not so blatantly obvious and intrusive.

        Imagine routing your XBone or PS4 to run the SteamOS. With proper emulator you'd have no problem popping in your XBone or PS4 games into their respective systems and going to town on a whole different interface.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Currently, even emulating a PS2 game is somewhat dodgy, and requires very, very powerful hardware. So, the option of emulating a PS4 or XB1 game on a console running SteamOS is quite far down the line.

       The ps2 wasn't built on x86 compliant hardware, however it's important note the original Xbox was, complete with stripped down direct x and windows. There are still no emulation options for original Xbox games, I sincerely doubt we will see any for the ps4 or One any time soon.

       It is a nice hope though.

       Very, since the coders for any 'aftermarket' emulators will have to start from scratch. With the 360, Microsoft had the benefit of the original uncompiled source code for DirectX, Win32, and any other API's required by the original Xbox, it was trivial for them to make changes to that code compared to the homebrew scene starting with practically nothing.

       Microsoft created backdoors into their OS and some applications which allowed the NSA free access to your computer, Skype chats and emails.  No one knew about them because the software source code is a company secret.

       It will have security holes, every OS does, it's just a matter of finding them.

      <p>
       As for a backdoor, it's possible but much less likely in an open source OS, like *BSD or Linux, for obvious reasons.

       it was extensively audited before inclusion in mainline Linux.
      </p>
      <p>
       the NSA's rationale for creating seLinux (security enhanced linux) was two fold.  The first being that the NSA uses Linux internally, and adding functionality to it to bring it up to their internal specifications for secure systems is a win for them. Second, because Linux is open source and freely modifiable by anyone (although inclusion in mainline only happens after review), it provides a mechanism by which you can push closed source software around. one of the NSA's mission objectives, although not very notable in it's history, is taking steps to try to increase the electronic security of US interests and the economy. by implementing proper security in an open source os, you pressure others to do the same, lest they lose more market share.  same tactic that Google used when they developed the V8 JavaScript engine, and the chrome browser. Google wins when the web works better, which happens when browsers are less shitty. they don't care if chrome has market dominance, since its mere existence has spurred Firefox and IE to step up their game.  win or lose, Google wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       the release of seLinux, amongst other factors, has spurred Microsoft to harden the windows security model. widespread adoption or not, the average computer has become less susceptible to general attacks.

organizations collaboratively working on SELinux together, including Red
Hat, IBM, HP, NSA, DOD, Tresys, Trusted Computing Systems. We have a
significant open source community built around SELinux, colleges and
universities contributing and doing experiments with it. We have
multiple distributions shipping with SELinux including Fedora Core
(2,3,4 and soon 5), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Gentoo, Debian, Ubuntu,
Suse and Slackware.

       I haven't really spent the time researching to confirm or deny the presence of security holes. I don't use OpenBSD. I have a kernel I tailored from Gentoo source but even that's likely to be running SELinux.
      </p>
      <p>
       I focus more on just keeping my nose clean. Everything we do is monitored to some extent. Better to just stay out of trouble until we get this all sorted out.

       Read what he said. Putting the OS on a ps4/xb1 and then using the emulator to run the games. Since the emulator is being run on their home systems, they should be able to handle them just fine.

       I'm a little skeptical about using emulation for that. Not that it wouldn't work but I don't think that the benefit would outweigh the risk. Just don't buy an Xbox if you're that concerned. Also, Linus Torvalds had some harsh words for nvidia, which I think Sony uses for graphics processing in the ps4.

       BSDs have been around long before Linux, and the original one has been dead for decades. I think you're confusing this with SELinux, which is a security framework for Linux originally developed by the NSA, and which was merged into the main source long ago.

       I'm pretty sure Windows can just change that setting on it's own now (especially in Win8), I know I've seen it reverse itself if using Microsoft Security Essentials on Win 7 before, Win 8's Defender likely does the same.  MSE has administrative rights and uses WinUpdate to patch itself and acquire virus definitions and whatnot I think, so unless you've handicapped it there (and thus lowered it's effectiveness), it'll just do what it wants unless WinUpdate is totally disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're running pirated Windows, you're better off just letting it run unimpeded and periodically re-activating it with updated activators as necessary. That's what I do now, my Win8.1 is fully "activated" with updates enabled and all features unlocked, if and when that prompt re-appears, I'll just make it go away again, it only takes a minute.

       Someone else was touting Fedora. I am not committed like marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I started with 6.04 it was a great alternative and came in a reasy-to-use package.  Flavors change over time and I am more comfortable with things. The freebies #ubuntu help-channel made things possible for me. Now I can suppose there are similar channels for other distros.
      </p>

       I once tried Fedora 11 and it was enough ahead of Ubuntu that it was able to warn me my HD was failing. I was grateful.

       Right. They now claim they turned all (or MOST) of those invasive features off. Right. 2 years from now we find out they never did take those things out or they will claim they did an update and it accidentally turned them all back on.....Fuck that.

       I think kinect has to be plugged in at all times still if I recall. Supposedly they suppressed the microphone listening in, certain data collection, and the constant need to be hooked up to the internet though. Regardless, too much for me.

       This is exactly how I looked at it. As soon as the info on the One was released and the backlash ensued, I was immediate in my decision that I'd be going back to the PS network. I was a PS gamer before I got a 360 as a gift anyways, so I've never been the type to be ultimately one system over the other.
      </p>

       The sad thing is, all of this shit has happened within a matter of 10 years, basically. I graduated high school in 2002, and back then, I think maybe two of my friends had personal cell phones. Most of us were relying on AOL instant messenger and our house phones to stay in contact. Now, everyone feels like they need to have a cell phone. In my opinion, there is absolutely NO REASON why anyone under the age of AT LEAST 16 should have a cell phone. Why does a 10 year old need a smart phone? Hell, why do they need a smart phone, a tablet, a Nook, an XBox, and a laptop? I'm all for technology, but this constant idea of "We always need to stay connected!" is part of what has ruined our society and our social activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know. Maybe I'm just a little old school in my thinking because my class/age group was basically the last generation to not have constant contact via cell phones. The more we constantly feel we always have to be connected, sharing, photoing, uploading, screen shotting, Snapchatting, etc... the worse I can only imagine things are going to get.

       What is sad is, as I am a 15 year old in high school, all of my peers openly mock me because I refuse to use my phone for anything except emergencies. I have no use for the thing, and I only have one because of my parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any time I try to convince people that the "always connected" philosophy that they have is dangerous, they write me off as paranoid and a lunatic. I feel that a cellphone can be a useful device, but it must be used in moderation, not like how these people use them. Every waking moment is spent on the dang things. No one else knows how to have a nice conversation face to face anymore.

       I got my 1st cell phone, a prepaid little Nokia brick that never had more than 10-20 mins on as the only reason I had it was I turned 16 and bought myself a car.

       Haha, I graduated HS in 1988 (!) and have never not had a phone with me since then. Of course...back then the spying that's going on now was inconceivable...and we were running the Sega Genesis as our "next-gen" gaming system.

       Oh, I'm sure they both have their flaws and things we as a people wouldn't appreciate them doing/tracking, but I'd say that's pretty much going to happen no matter how you're connected to the internet. Gaming, phone, browsing, downloading, whatever... I guess you just have to decide which is the lesser of the two evils for you.

       I'm content with my 360 still anyways. I just think XBox shot themselves in the foot with what they originally announced, and all of this spying news across the world doesn't help their case.

       It has nothing to do with being antisocial. I never said we were becoming antisocial to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technology has changed our every day life and how we socially interact. It hasn't made us recluses, but it has made is lazy, shy, uncomfortable, and rude in ways that we never were before every person on the street had to walk around staring at a phone screen all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assholes get in line at restaurants and stand there and talk on their phone, holding up lines and being rude to the people that work there. If you're going to go place an order, get off your fucking phone and place an order. You can talk about how drunk you got and how you shit your pants at that party later. In line at a restaurant/gas station/grocery store/ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE line is not the place for you to be rude to others simply doing their job because you think it's an inconvenience that they're talking to you while you're on the phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any statistics to back this up, but I can only assume that the trading of nude pictures to people that shouldn't be seeing them has risen ten fold since the personal cell phone boom. And as many people have said, you see kids as young as four, five, or six knowing how to use these things extensively. I'm sure this is going to continue to turn out wonderfully for our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put - Technology is great, but too much of it ruins the basic human social interaction. When I was growing up, I couldn't wait to get outside and play sports, hide and seek, go fishing, whatever... just be outside! Now you drive past playgrounds and kids sit on swings and benches playing games on tablets, phones, e-readers, laptops, whatever... I just think it's sad. It's not antisocial in the least, but it's completely changed human life as a whole. If you can't see that, I feel sorry for you.

       I'm not really trying to support a cause here. I was just stating my opinion on how I think society has changed due to technological advances. Do you really need me to post evidence? You see it every day, everywhere you go. Why do you think we have national driving laws about texting and driving? Because phones/technology have changed every thing we do. People die regularly because some dumbass can't wait ten minutes to get home to text his friend about how his day was. Evidence is everywhere, just look around you, read a newspaper. Hell, you're on Reddit, I'd say thats proof enough.

       I switched from Xbox 360 to Playstation 4 for many reasons, and after reading this I am even more happy about the decision. The PS4 is for people who want to use the product as it's intended, for gaming. Xbox has focused more on the "Entertainment", and less on the gaming.

       It's easy too see how advertisers and feds would drool with a technology that allows them to monitor so many people on the privacy of their lives and considering how little they care about privacy I guess it's not that far fetched that they are really doing it.

       The funny thing is all three consoles have amd chipsets. They are all in on it. The real question: What is the reason for the spying? They will say terrorism or pedophiles but that is a lie. They want to know who you are and how you think. When the play is made to officially kickoff NWO, the people that have made the lists will be the first to go.

       nope. theres actually an option in the settings to turn it off a long with the voice commands and the low power state where you can wake it up just by saying "xbox on"
      </p>
      <p>
       ill admit at first it did sound like it would watch / hear you all the time but all that can be turned off in the settings as i found out first hand....and if you really want to go the extra step they even sell privacy covers for the kinect.

       Conspiracy theories aside... I probably won't get the Xbox One despite being a 360 owner.  I don't
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       stupid stuff like Kinect and it's worlds more expensive because it's crammed full of features I don't particularly want or need.  It's also shaping up to be full of cookie cutter games and the same old franchises (Gears, Halo etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The PS4 is cheaper and seems to be the more powerful system.  It's a good time to switch seeing as the XBOne isn't backwards compatible with anything related to my 360.

       Good thing he doesn't have a PS3 and games that would be rendered obsolete by a PS4. Personally, I'm going to pick up a PS3 with The Last Of Us and any other exclusives I've missed out on, and wait a few years before going next gen.

       I don't understand why anyone would have gone xbone, especially since the NSA revelations were around the same time as the original unveiling, that put me off for good, no matter how much Microsoft backtracks to make the console seem a little less invasive.

       Now is the best time to buy an older system that you've not owned yet. Tons of games (that are still new if you've never played them before) for cheap. If you get a ps3, and plus subscription, you'll also have access to many other games for the price of a subscription.

       I'm not too bothered about both next gen consoles.
I've got a 360, I'll probably pick up a cheap PS3 just before Christmas; Then leave it a year for the games and everything else to develop before getting either of the next gen.

      <p>
       I don't think a PS4 will be any less invasive though.

       this is a great idea.  i've been itching to pull the trigger, but a PS3 bargain will satisfy gadget habit and let the next gen market settle down.

       Correct, both have such a vastly different internal framework that making them backwards compatible would have been super expensive for both companies. Especially Sony, since the PS3 has one of the strangest internal frameworks out there. At least, thats the information I found.

       If by internal framework, you mean they literally swapped from Cell processors to Intel, then yes. You can't be backwards compatible without also including a Cell processor.

       I never had a PS3 and the XBOne isn't compatible with anything I currently own 360-wise.  Therefore it shouldn't make too much difference which one I get, but tempted to have the PS4 for a bit of a change.  Will probably wait until the new year and watch the game line-ups take more shape.

       All this reminds me of the new iPhone with its fingerprint scanner. Biometrics is information you don't want in the wrong hands, I think fingerprints is even more scary. And yes, I know fingerprint scanners have been on laptops for years. Never on this scale.

       What would I say? I'd say you speak like a goddamn meme that was played out 3 years ago. I'd like to preface my response by saying that I in no way responded with hostility. You did. I'd be more than happy to have a civil discussion, but apparently that's just a little too much to ask for someone with your level of emotional intelligence and maturity. Though I won't dumb this down. Try to keep up, sport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, to start, you're obviously a sad, confused, little man. Biometrics is not the same as fingerprints. The iPhone doesn't collect biometric data because it cannot. It collects fingerprint data because you ask it to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how fingerprints could be used to advertise to you. Biometrics, on the other hand, is pretty obvious. I'm worried about fingerprints because they're nearly indisputable. If a prosecution uses them to positively identify me for a crime I didn't commit, I can't possibly defend myself. Even if the prints were planted. Or weren't ever there at all. The burden of proof is always on the prosecution, because it's so hard to prove you didn't do something, compared to proving that you did. I didn't drive a corvette yesterday. Well, how can I possibly prove that?
      </p>
      <p>
       DNA information is largely useless in this context. And pointing out who may or may not have it doesn't prove any sort of point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could identify things like hair color or ethnicity, but that's about as useful as looking out your window to identify demographics. Obviously, this can be tied back into false identification. Only a handful of states even collect DNA information at birth, and even so, it has only been practiced for a few years. Anyone with sentient thought enough to use a computer is too old for that kind of widespread genetic reaping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, in some states, newborns are fingerprinted. Again, this is relatively new and relatively uncommon. If they fingerprinted every person born, the database would be too large to reasonably use as a basis for identifying someone any number of years later. Especially considering the stretching and growing that takes place after a human is born. But you knew that people grow, didn't you, sport?
      </p>
      <p>
       But, please, tell me how 'the hospital' has collected biometric information on me, having been to one once since the day I was born. Please, explain that to me, sport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although judging by a cursory browse through your comment history, I'd expect all of this to go right over the head of a stoner snow-rat. A real walking stereotype. Good luck with that, sport.

       Jesus Christ you have issues. You're really digging through my comment history and insulting me while trying to chastise me for insulting you - which I didn't do. I wasn't even remotely emotional in my response to you.... I didn't even down vote you. Take a fucking chill pill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note - you really think that the database of fingerprints would be too ungainly to be used if we fingerprinted everyone? That is an absurd argument. You realize that the government acknowledged that they keep the entire internet for 3 days time to search through at any given moment. That is infinitely more information than these fingerprints would net and would take much more effort to comb through. You don't have to dumb anything down for me, your arguments were already stupid enough to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the part of your response that really slays me though - do you genuinely not see how much you're projecting here?

       I offended you this much by using the word 'sport?' Really? You were much more insulting to me than I ever was to you. I was perfectly civil. You were extraordinarily, above and beyond hostile. You combed through my history to find more reasons to hate on me. Stop for a minute and think about how pathetic that makes you look. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume there is something else going on in your life rather than judge you by this experience. Good luck.

       You have no idea how your language evokes feelings in others? Come on, if that was true, you wouldn't have said anything at all. You're a disrespectful little shit and deserve to be put in your place.

       I got nothing better to do than find a reason to hate you. Gonna push someone, expect to get pushed back. For the record, I looked at about 2 pages and knew you were someone attacking. Fuck druggies forever. Scum of the fucking earth. Got no sympathy for you hippy fucks who OD- just keep yourself out the way of the rest of society. Try not to take anyone else out with you.

       I played Xbox One at a friend's house yesterday for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were messing around with one of the Kinect's launch titles. First off, after "seeing" my face once, from a distance, in the dark basement, it began to log me in to the system every time I walked back into the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       When determining who the two players in the Kinect Sports game were, the system displayed a graphic of a wedge-shaped "net" that represented its readable area. To not be included in the game, the third person had to step off this net and watch their icon slowly turn red, flash, and disappear.
       <em>
        We were literally hiding behind a wall so that the Xbox wouldn't see us and track our movements precisely
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It was goddamn horrifying.

       I wouldn't go to their house anymore.  Just tell them if they have an XBONE you're not going to their house.

       If you're having a heart attack the kinect can see it and tell it's happening...are they going to call the medics?  Nope, but they're gonna sell the information and you'll have advertisements for heart healthy items soon!

       Not going to somebody's house because they own an xbone is a bit extreme, don't you think? Owning one is the scariest aspect, as you log a lot of personal information into the machine through the use of social networking, purchases, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't own one, then regardless if it sees you or not at your friend's house, it wouldn't be able to detect exactly who you are or pull any personal information about you. The ads that it would market would be towards your friend, not you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's something I'm missing about all this, feel free to correct, but from what I'm seeing, it doesn't infiltrate the privacy of a guest, unless you consider the xbone recognizing a human and not being able to get anymore information other than that an infiltration of privacy.

       Actually it DOES recognize you.  It uses face recognition technology.  Every time you go there the kinect will read your face and know exactly who you are.  It assigns you a number based on your facial profile and records all information about you.  What games you played, what snacks you ate, how often you visited, and of course every single thing you said while you were there.

       Looks like I should have done further research. But with all that being said (and excuse me if this is in the article, can't read it at the moment), can it take all that information it gathers from you, and apply it to a name? What I'm trying to figure out is if it recognizes my face, habits, foods, etc. then how will this information be matched up with who I physically am? Does the xbone have the ability to recognize a face from one xbone to another, even if I don't have a profile? Is it able to eventually find out who I am (first and last name), and link the information gathered from the xbone to a bigger database?

       Well consider this.  The machine knows exactly what your face looks like, your exact height, eye color, hair color, skin tone, and it absolutely knows your name because it's recording the conversations.  Microsoft will assign you a number for their database and every time you enter any home or BUSINESS that has a kinect it will know that you specifically are there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Microsoft might not know exactly who you are as in what your federal social security number is but the NSA most certainly will because microsoft feeds it all to them.

       I assume you mean "literally"  Did you even pay attention to the OP's points?  I don't even own a PS3 or PS4.  I own a 360 but if I had to choose between the xBone and the PS4 I'd get the PS4 and not get it's version of kinect.  Same with the Nintendo system.

       I'm just stating my point of you saying " don't go to their house " is IGNORANT. 
we already know you clearly believe whatever you read on the Internet. If you really think your life is going to be different, for the worst, because you either Own an xbone or your friends own an xbone. Than you have much bigger issues you need to figure out haha. But you prolly won't because that table leg you've been chewing on tastes too good.

       I don't believe "whatever I read on the internet" I read the facts and then decide on issues.  The only way to stop this agenda is for everyone to finally throw their hands up and refuse to co-operate with it.  Otherwise just MOOOOOOO MOOOOOOOO sit there and be a good fucking consumer while they record every action you make and every conversation in your home.

       First off, that's incorrect, because the whole voting with your dollars platitude is only stated by those who buy into or are the few beneficiaries of "capitalism". Secondly, that's kind of rude and rather ignorant to act as if its only Americans that choose with their money. Unfortunately, the world is being made to be one where you really don't have a choice, and you actually have less opportunity to vote with your money in the USA than I have seen and witnessed in many other places around the world.....which is exactly how lazy "free-market capitalists" like it..... Lip-service free-market capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing you are misidentifying is our apathy in a belief that we are "safe" from abuses as we are the dominant player in the world and feel like we can't be affected. It is the naked and naive hubris of the inexperienced that believe just because something that hasn't happened, a totalitarian and authoritarian regime, it won't ever happen; even though it is unfolding right in front of our eyes, just like it always does before turning on ever more of its own people.

       Right, voting with your dollars is bullshit. That was my point. Also, I mention the US because that's where I live and the focus of the topic and anti privacy in recent events. I'm not intentionally ignoring other nations. But as a superpower that claims morality but acts differently, that is the rationale of my focus.

       Why say something so very stupid? It is the people 'here' that wouldn't buy shit like this in the first place. The OP is trying to reach those that have no clue. Yes he seems to be preaching to the converted but on reddit that is how it goes. This is a very well researched and comprehensive post that should be shared on the subs where more gullible people dwell. You miserable sods could maybe share it instead of misunderstanding and generalising wrongly.

       Correct me if I'm wrong (I could be), but there was no mention in the original post about unplugging or turning off the Kinect sensor?

       No need to be disparaging. I get your point but on the other hand what do you/we do when everything has tracking and monitoring built into it and you can't participate in society without?

       Well if you want to not be tracked and monitored,
Never get a drivers license, and never enter a bank or major retailer.
       <br/>
       The list ones on but that will suffice to keep you out of society.

       That's one of my other points posted here.
There are greater (and older) ways of monitoring and tracking people.
Including the use of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       People worrying about what information is going to be captured, yet they're happy to get a passport, driving license, use the internet, use their phone, go out in public etc etc.

       Hate to tell you this, but it's already happened. What is coming out with the leaks is the tip.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most dangerous thing is that people never think it will happen to them and it will never come from within. Unfortunately, Osama bin Laden has been winning this "war" we are in since 9/12/2001, we just haven't realized it. It's rather reminiscent of the decline of the Roman empire, not that I am a fan of the Roman empire, but there's something rather poetic in the fact that what seems to be our self-inflicted decline and loss of focus and principle has rather stark similarities with the slow drain that was the decline of the Roman Empire and Republic. Hubris, it's a bitch.

       Not yet, but every care that has an equivalent of OnStar does. And if you want to count smartphones, or even dumb phones; then pretty much yes.

       Correct. When it first was announced, it was that way. Which caught my attention to the whole situation to begin with. It caught others' too, because Microsoft backtracked and made it functional regardless of the Kinect.

       Thanks.  To be fair, like the article implied, Microsoft claimed for over two years that the kinect was to be an always-on technology.   They only did a 180 of that little more than a couple months ago.  Further, while disabled through settings, the kinect is still on and IR blasting.  It seems that the kinect must still always be attached and powered, or am I interpreting this incorrectly?

       It can be unplugged completely, not connected at all. 
You can have your xbox 1 in one room in use and the kinect in another house if you wanted to.

       We can either circle jerk around the Kinect 2.0 all day long, or take solace in the fact that if it creeps you out this much, JUST UNPLUG IT. You don't need the thing to use the XB1.

If it's caused Microsoft to backtrack on something they were adamant about it just shows that people can force a change.

       I think the OP is aware they can unplug the Kinect device; or better yet, not use any "creepy devices".
      </p>
      <p>
       However the article seems to be about the bigger picture. There will be many people who use Kinect 2.0 and other similar devices (e.g. LG Smart TV) which expose their customer's households' to a variety of privacy threats.

       Don't you see the possibility that MS will change it's mind (again) and require the Kinect be plugged in?

       Everything they tried to pull this summer and then changed back will be slowly added back in over this generation.

       Playstation did it with linux. Microsoft has already shown its hand for the direction it wants to take the xbox. Before they backtracked, they claimed you couldn't disconnect the Kinect due to the architecture of XBOX One. I really don't think it is that far of a leap to think a simple mandatory software update will make it impossible to play online without having it plugged in. Despite the outcry of the fan base, Sony faced no repercussions for wiping people's linux partition even though it was an advertised feature.

       The fact that you casually throw the word shill around and that you just called video games "murder everything in hd" tells me that you're a middle aged old fart that's out of touch with reality. A shill is someone that encourages/hypes people into an idea. I'm simply being realistic here. Don't like the thing? Turn it off. You're acting like someone has a gun to your head forcing you to use this.

       I read the whole thing. Two things to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The reason why kids will accept Kinect or other things without question is because smartphones and game consoles are, to some people, indispensable. They provide the user with something that they refuse to part with. That's why South Park had an episode of the itunes T&amp;C update making people the property of Apple (or something, I forget the details of the episode). Especially when the consequences are fuzzy and after the fact, the mind sees the costs as already assumed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you are worried that a written work, especially one with numerous additional sites, is too long, then it probably is. I appreciate the work you did to put this together, but what always sits at the front of 50-page research papers is a summary of findings. A paragraph TL;DR that entices the reader to get into the depths, but still allows them to come away with the gist of what you've found.

       The problem is that the next cable box you get will likely do the same sorts of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying you have a choice is like the people who tell you not to use Facebook, for example. I'm all onboard for that, but now half the websites I visit won't let me comment or participate in conversations. My current and previous employers just assumed everyone was on Facebook and used it for work...  When a company as big as MS makes a move like this, you can count on it having larger ramifications. ...I just read about someone who convinced their boss to buy two Xbox ones to skype, just another example.

       This shouldn't be what scares you. Don't you know they will be putting things like the kinect in all state and federal buildings. Then they will put them on the streets. They will be able to identify you just by the way you walk. Not many people know that our gait is like a finger print, everyone walks differently. Then companies will put them in all business's under the guise of giving better deals. Soon there will be no hiding.

       Kinect is merely the consumer brand that people will demand be put in their homes.

       When we have thousands of even higher resolution versions of these creating 3D models of everything going on in our cities, we'll basically be able to just fly around Google Earth looking at what everyone is doing.

       . I just don't even know how to handle people like that. The person I was arguing with thinks that its really in our (Americans) best interest to be spied on along with everyone else. Despite the fact that the govt. is using the information for espionage and using against its own people.

       r/conspiracy only makes the front page if you're subscribed to it, and then if you're subscribed to it you should pretty much always see something from it on your front page.

       Right now they're very much in that phase of "omg stop hating the Xbox, you fedora neckbeard" because they are "tired" of the circlejerk. It may never end, but you'll probably have to wait a few months or years before criticising the Xbox becomes "cool" again.

       Or even in general it seems reddit is growing "tired" of "neckbeard fedoras" (the only insult they seem to ever be able to call anyone they don't like) talking about privacy issues etc..

       Yeah, reddit is full of circlejerks and anti-jerks. The anti-jerks are, most of the time, much worse than the actual circlejerks they're bitching about.

       More precisely, they need people to buy the games, and that's how it shall creep back in; games will require it. Then, you watch the marketing data until a game requiring it isn't at a discernible competitive disadvantage. Once that comes about, you could put out your next system with an integrated kinect, just take their word for it that it's off when not in use. They tried and failed, evidence that there is no monolithic conspiracy
       <em>
        that can manipulate and override the sensibilities of the market
       </em>
       , but also a clear sign that Microsoft wants to do this. Now, I've explained how I know they want to doit, and how I think they'll keep trying to get what they want. Why do you think they will give up?

       Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       MS TRIED to do it. They really did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MS execs responsible developed a plan to fundamentally change console game ownership, focus tested it, talked to people they know, and pondered what the reaction of the gaming world would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their whole company would have been discussing it among themselves. I know If I worked there, and knew, I would have been alarmed that they were really going to go through with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they truly believed gamers weren't going to be as super pissed as they ended up being, they were blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they knew it was going to blow up, and still decided to go through with it, OR were tied into contracts they couldn't/wouldn't get out of by the time they realized it was going to be a huge mess, then they were irresponsible and arrogant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the whole episode doesn't give me much faith in them to NOT, try it again in 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <em>
        Guess what Gamers, digital games are now $5 cheaper than retail games. Look how much of a better deal they are. oh! Remember that family circle game sharing feature we were going to give you, until you ruined it by complaining? It's back too!"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       6 months later.
      </p>
      <p>
       MS announces used games are off the table, digital only, install discs only, game sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Millions of people don't suddenly try to sell their Xboxes and hundreds of dollars worth of disc games (nothing changed about old games) and buy a ps4. They stick with xbox for the rest of the generation.

       The system MS initially tried to implement was Microsoft's step towards turning to a digital platform with ease of access. There was no malicious attempts to spy on people. The loss of some privacy and not owning games in a traditional sense was a byproduct of this.

       That'll come once they finally do away with the used game market....which I predict they will in this generation.

      <p>
       That will cut out the middle man (EB, GameStop, etc.) so that MS will get a bigger slice of the game-sale pie. No cut for the middle man on new games since it's all digital, no used games so more digital games sold.

       Hell I stopped playing games on my computers for years because I hard switched to Linux.  Now all of the games are coming to me and now I have far more control about how I run them.  Often games for Linux will be released in a tar.gz format (a zip file) and I simply put those files into a separate gaming account.  Then the game doesn't need access to any system registry or system locations.

       As for targetting ads you have to get used to never watching them. First, I NEVER click on an online ad.  NEVER. Second, I never watch an ad on TV. When an ad comes on I change channels or turn off the sound. We have to teach them they can't target us.

       I have heard some of these things before, and there was a lot of new information on here for me. Thank you for taking the time to put that all together. Question... Wouldn't our cellphones be the better access point into spying on someone? we bring them everywhere and always have them with us. even the younger generation is even more attached/ dependent on tech more than ever.

       They're already using them, this just tells them what you do in detail once you get off the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       It recognizes who is in your living room by their image, walk and voice, potentially recording all that information.  It can recognize emotions and tell when ads (and/or propaganda) are effective on you based on how you react.  It's also possible it could tell where you are when you leave the living room based on sound and/or WiVi echolocation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your phone can't do any of that (yet) so this just adds another layer of information to attempt to predict behaviors and events.

       I read your whole post, I liked it, going through your sources now, but I have questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why and for what purpose is all this surveillance necessary? What is the justification? Is it JUST for increasing advertising efficiency and squeezing more $$$ out of a population, or, is it for something (which you seem to hint at) more nefarious, like 'theyre getting ready to kill us off' or 'prevent a massive uprising'?
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy part of my brain wonders if there are types of humans that are desirable and types of humans that arent, and these new systems will mainly benefit those that are. A dumbed down, pandered to, laborer2.0 that is ok with being a rat in a cage. Actually more like an ant.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR; whats the point of all this, is it really 'bad'?

       It's there because these are companies want to make more money off you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The companies want to make more money off of you because they are required by law to put profits for the shareholders first, before any greater societal considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sounds like a cliche, but it really is a result of the advertising industry which grew up in the first half the 20th century. Since then companies have done everything they can to persuade people to give them more money. They largely do this with really base appeals to emotions that aren't very effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       In recent years the idea of creating personalized advertising that's particularly persuasive has been championed tech companies that are built on data and data analysis. To date, these tech giants haven't been too good at providing useful information to advertisers, so attempts to collect more data increased. This is where we stand today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Xbox One offers MS a major new source of data to mine. They hope they can use this to understand customers better, and also just to sell the data upstream. The technology itself is not created to monitor you, that's just a benefit MS gets based on having a camera and mic on all the time (at least potentially).
      </p>
      <p>
       The bad part is that you may legally be giving up just about all privacy expectation you have in your home. You're allowing a third party to monitor just about everything you do, I'm sure we'll have gov't lawyers maintain they don't need a warrant given this "choice" you've made. And then there's all the NSA stuff that's come out--it would hardly be surprising if the NSA collected realtime audio and video from every single one of these and kept it forever--I'd be shocked if they aren't trying to do it. That might be considered "bad."

       Yes, these incredibly cool features that people want are totally scary.  I mean its not like us consumers can just unplug it and put it back in the box if it does something we don't want it to. I can't believe these companies are forcing us to have these in our homes... If only we could choose what technology we buy and surround ourselves with.

       These are sold as toys and marketed to children. They come out at xmas because they sell so many as presents. I don't think this is a government conspiracy for a second, but that doesn't mean there aren't real considerations we should be discussing when millions of homes suddenly open themselves up to constant monitoring (most probably doing it unwittingly).

       I'm not overjoyed about the idea of technology sensing "emotions and body language" in my private space. The tech itself is harmless, but I don't have the confidence that what it detects will never be gathered and transmitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the scenario of seemingly harmless logs of how often we seemed outraged, depressed, etc., being given to the same good ol' organizations that already dig into our habits without permission....

       agreed its a disturbing trend, just the fact that you can make it turn on by saying "Xbox On" says it all: if it can recieve that voice command, that means it can potentially record anything and everything you say, and due to the PRISM act Microsoft makes all of its collected data available to the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I don't exactly know how the government benefits from spying on dorito eating, mountain dew drinking Xbox players, but its disturbing nonetheless that many households could essentially have a wiretap in them and a camera via the kinect.

       99% percent of the people who buy these things will never be spied upon by the government. 100% will have data about their activities (maybe even language recognition) collected and used for marketing. It is certain that the gov't will use these to spy on some people, but that's also true for smartphones already.

       And this is why I'm a pc gamer! Honestly pc gaming has been growing exponentially the last few years and I don't see it slowing down. The ps4 and the Xbox One seem to be a rehashing of the last Gen consoles just with better graphics. Neither system really has anything that makes me say wow, I have to have that. Plus, most of the big titles are coming to pc anyway. I owned both last Gen consoles but I really think I'm going to skip the new gen... Plus right now with Black Friday and Cyber Monday you can build yourself a decent rig fir around the same price you would pay for the xbone.

       One time I was reading a website about mechanical locks (you know for doors and such), and there was this seemingly "crazy" guy everyone was making fun of, said he was a security advisor or something. He made this one claim that LCD screens could somehow be turned into a reverse camera. Who knows, maybe it is possible.

        Apple patent embeds thousands of cameras among LCD pixels

        Oh Barry Fox, does a week ever go by when you don't find a great patent or two? Today the intrepid Mr. Fox manages to dig up an application by consumer-darling Apple for an LCD display embedded with thousands of microscopic image sensors that would allow users to video-conference while looking straight into the "camera." Data accumulated by the individual sensors would be stitched into actual images using special software, which will probably be bundled into future versions of iLife. Since the patent specifies almost as many sensors per screen as there are pixels, some of those sensors could have different focal lengths, with a defacto zoom lens created by switching between them. Apple goes on to suggest portable uses for the technology, such as employing the displays in cellphones and PDAs, so you can add another item to the list of features we'll be expecting from the iPhone and Newton 2.0 when they finally hit stores.

        We could soon see a new kind of display screen from computer maker Apple - one that simultaneously takes pictures while showing images.
       </p>
       <p>
        The clever idea is to insert thousands of microscopic image sensors in-between the liquid crystal display cells in the screen. Each sensor captures its own small image, but software stitches these together to create a single, larger picture.
       </p>
       <p>
        A large LCD screen filled with image sensors would be ideal for videoconferencing, Apple suggests, as participants would always appear to look straight into the "camera". The technique could also add a camera function to a cellphone or PDA without wasting space, and light from the screen should help illuminate a subject.
       </p>
       <p>
        The more sensors there are, the wider and clearer the image. Sketches accompanying the company's patent show as many sensors as liquid crystal cells in a screen. If some of the sensors have different focal lengths, switching between them would make the screen behave like a zoom lens.

       I understand the friends list deal.  Both online friends and actual friends.  I just have a feeling that while now they say you can play the  xbone without having the kinect attached...soon they will find a way or reason to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the system was first introduced Microsoft stated that when released the system would not work at ALL unless you had the kinect hooked up.  Public outcry made them change their decision on that.  But how long until you find out that most games you want to play "won't work at all" unless you have the kinect on?  They will find some stupid reason to do it.  Like make one tiny part of the game controlled by hand motion only or you have to use your voice and actually SAY a password to enter an area or something.  You'll see.  I'd bet anything on it.

       Any of them really.  It's not about the FBI entirely.  It's about being monitored like cattle 24-7.  Watching your heartbeat, recording everything you do and using facial recognition to number then label you and anyone in your home.  let alone recording all conversations.  It's creepy and it's too far.

       But why?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I guess Bill Gates is as evil as the IT people used to claim. And let him do all the "good" he wants to in Africa.  In America he'll always be known as the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm been thinking about "Why". And I don't think the government, certainly not under Obama, cares that much about us. But who does? The plutocracy. Our capitalist masters. Fascism is a merging of state and corporate power. And corporations want to know everything about us. So they can use us. Control us. Exploit us. Like a diary farmer wants to know about his cows. When they wake, when they eat and how much and what. When they exercise. And how they can best be exploited.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is our masters who want to know everything about us. And once the republicans are in control again, they will use all Obama has let be collected. They will hurt anyone who they think might resist them. Or who just will not produce enough to satisfy them. It is they who want 1984. Occupy was undermined by the corporations working with the government.

       All the Xbones come with kinect.  The Kinect see's everything in front of it, and with wifi it's even possible to see through walls.  The Kinects IR camera can even see you in the dark.  It can tell what content stimulates you, what content upsets you.  It broadcasts all of this to Microsoft who in turn sells it to marketers.  And the NSA records it all.
      </p>

       Conspiracy theorists and technology scolds are crucifying Microsoft for putting a gesture recognition feature on their new game console. This system, "Kinect," was created to compete with the Wii, which kicked MS' ass last generation. The new Kinect allows you to navigate with voice commands and uses facial recognition to log into your profile. Because of all the NSA leaks, normal people are rightly concerned about gov't intrusion into their private conversations, while the conspiracy people (to grossly generalize) seem to think this the coming of 1984.
      </p>
      <p>
       The result will be that lots of these game consoles will indeed sit in people's homes, a very very few will be used to monitor people directly, everyone will have more data about them generated for marketing research, and ultimately nothing important will happen.

       I don't want to discredit anything in this article, but if you have a smartphone and laptop then really you don't have any form of total privacy left anyway. I'm gunna get the Xbox one cause privacy is just an illusion and to be honest if some dude in an NSA building is gunna watch me jerk off through my Kinect cam I couldnt give a fuck really. The amount of private things that have been within view of my webcam or phone cam is already in the thousands.

       I don't care that it is always listening. I also don't think it is a big deal. I mean you more than likely have a phone with a mic or two in it and it is always connected to the internet. Plus what do you have to hide from the kinect? And if you really don't like it that much then plug your Xbox into a power strip and just turn it off when you are done. Its such a simple thing to do and yet people still freak out about it.

       The console itself doesn't seem to be a problem to me. If I were to buy it (assuming I had money) I would either not plug the Kinect in or stow it away in the attic until a game I wanted to play required it. And even then, when I'm off said game, back to the attic for you.

       I agree with you in many respects, and I am very leery of using an Xbox, but for the sake of argument, how do you think we can go about advancing technology while still respecting privacy concerns? It is clear and obvious that many of the technologies in the new Xbox will be incredibly convenient and add a lot to the gameplay experience (such as the IR tracking, the voice recognition, etc). What do you guys think would be the best way to advance this objectively awesome new technology while still respecting privacy concerns?

       Tech is going in this direction because it is being
       <em>
        pushed
       </em>
       in this direction. It doesn't need to be, it wouldn't be tough to build these devices with hardware switches that are off by default, encrypted front to back, and serviceable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Darpa and gov contracts developed a lot of this tech. Clearly a conflict of interest.

       People are being trained to accept your premise. But it isn't true, it's just the goal of the risk-averse elites who find the masses annoying and useless (unless you can monetize and control them).

       I do agree that the tech needs to be more managed/local/encrypted rather than always-on/internet enabled/etc, but people will be hesitant to trust the tech at this point anyway. Case in point, Apple's new fingerprint scanner does not send the fingerprint info to apple's servers, it is encrypted, completely localized and difficult to hack, but people are freaking out over privacy concerns. 
I almost see it as a necessary evil for the progression of technology, but it has certainly started getting to the point that I question if the 'neatness' of the new tech is worth the sacrifice.

       Xbox One owner here. The system isn't creepy at all.  It's a carefully built system that seamlessly integrates voice and gesture control into your TV. So far I am very happy with my xbox one.  If ur so worried about ur privacy then I would recommend avoiding the entire internet as we know it.  What you're afraid of is called data mining and every tech giant right now uses it to monetize their services.  If u have a problem with Xbox then delete ur Google account,  Facebook and Twitter.  Microsoft is an easy target because of its unpopular public image especially with the younger generation.  Face it... The only way tech companies can make money is through advertising, PERSONALIZED advertising, so if u want to see continued advancement of the internet in general u need to let this happen.  Oh,  and just so u know there's a lengthy privacy settings options section on the Xbox One so if it really bothers you, u can turn off a lot of the features that freak u out. And half of the data ur afraid the Xbox One is stealing from u without ur knowledge is most likely data and information about urself that most people willingly give out to other companies like Facebook and Twitter.

       This entire statement exhibits a complete lack of understanding of the Xbone's technology. I'm not going to spend 20 minutes refuting your claims one by one, but if you understood how the Kinect works, you wouldn't be whipping yourself into a paranoid frenzy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll say this: the Kinect can't see your cock, and the Xbox is most certainly NOT always listening. Secondly, if the government wants to know what you are eating for lunch, all they have to do is point a satellite at you. We have already lost the privacy war, might as well play some video games.

       We've lost the privacy war unless courts redefine privacy expectations. Law is slow to adapt and the way technology and privacy were analyzed traditionally was whether you "gave" a third party access to something. If you did, you had no privacy expectation. The problem with that is currently we are forced to "give" third parties access to just about everything we do. Either the law changes or we basically don't have any privacy, as you say.

       A slippery slope is a type of logical fallacy because it is an argument whose premise tends towards hyperbole. It's also like a strawman because the person employing it can't argue with the idea itself, so wants to argue with a different idea which is more obviously objectionable. Most importantly, the slope might be imagined to slide in either direction, because the slope does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might say that we can't allow homosexual marriage, because it's a slippery slope and soon we'd end up with beastiality and pedophile marriage. That would be exactly as logical as saying we have to allow homosexual marriage or soon they'll be outlawing other kinds of marriage, and then we'll all live in a Huxleyian dystopia where love is a crime and reproduction a regulated, industrial affair.

       There are options now, yes. How far do you think it is into the future when we have no option?

       No, not downplay... but the powers that be are maintaining just enough people in the core nation (US) enough pseudo freedoms for them not to be upset enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, at the same time, I do see the system crumbing under it's own weight/greed.  The powerful are beginning to step on the toes of those who have power to do something about it... ie the citizens of the core nation the powerful get their power from.

       I feel as though we agree here, we've simply hindered by the limitations of emotionless text.

       My guess it that if you don't have a clearly mapped out life (via FB or data gathered from whatever sources you want to pick and name) while clearly taking one side or another on important issues then you are "unknown" and therefore possibly "dangerous" and "likely to be trouble".. Something like that, I'd assume. If not now, sometime in the near future. Yuck.

       You're not forced to buy an xbox, you're not forced to buy a tv, you're not forced to buy a camera, you're not forced to go online.
People still seem to be ignoring the fact that the Kinect can be unplugged. I guess that would be too convenient though.

       Every kind of electronic device has the capability to spy on you. Does that mean your going to go back to watching fire burning in a hollow box or something? All these comments saying o just dont buy the product and boycott are ridiculous. Unplug the system when its not in use and if you really want to change the issue of privacy invasion, MAKE NOISE AND STAND AGAINST THESE UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES

       Good thing he doesn't have a PS3 and games that would be rendered obsolete by a PS4. Personally, I'm going to pick up a PS3 with The Last Of Us and any other exclusives I've missed out on, and wait a few years before going next gen.

       I don't understand why anyone would have gone xbone, especially since the NSA revelations were around the same time as the original unveiling, that put me off for good, no matter how much Microsoft backtracks to make the console seem a little less invasive.

       Correct, both have such a vastly different internal framework that making them backwards compatible would have been super expensive for both companies. Especially Sony, since the PS3 has one of the strangest internal frameworks out there. At least, thats the information I found.

       I never had a PS3 and the XBOne isn't compatible with anything I currently own 360-wise.  Therefore it shouldn't make too much difference which one I get, but tempted to have the PS4 for a bit of a change.  Will probably wait until the new year and watch the game line-ups take more shape.

       It will have security holes, every OS does, it's just a matter of finding them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for a backdoor, it's possible but much less likely in an open source OS, like *BSD or Linux, for obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an interesting aside, the NSA also had a hand in creating part of Linux. They wrote SELinux, an access control security module currently in the kernel mainline.

       It has nothing to do with being antisocial. I never said we were becoming antisocial to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technology has changed our every day life and how we socially interact. It hasn't made us recluses, but it has made is lazy, shy, uncomfortable, and rude in ways that we never were before every person on the street had to walk around staring at a phone screen all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assholes get in line at restaurants and stand there and talk on their phone, holding up lines and being rude to the people that work there. If you're going to go place an order, get off your fucking phone and place an order. You can talk about how drunk you got and how you shit your pants at that party later. In line at a restaurant/gas station/grocery store/ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE line is not the place for you to be rude to others simply doing their job because you think it's an inconvenience that they're talking to you while you're on the phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any statistics to back this up, but I can only assume that the trading of nude pictures to people that shouldn't be seeing them has risen ten fold since the personal cell phone boom. And as many people have said, you see kids as young as four, five, or six knowing how to use these things extensively. I'm sure this is going to continue to turn out wonderfully for our society.

       Simply put - Technology is great, but too much of it ruins the basic human social interaction. When I was growing up, I couldn't wait to get outside and play sports, hide and seek, go fishing, whatever... just be outside! Now you drive past playgrounds and kids sit on swings and benches playing games on tablets, phones, e-readers, laptops, whatever... I just think it's sad. It's not antisocial in the least, but it's completely changed human life as a whole. If you can't see that, I feel sorry for you.

       So your "evidence" is merely your own personal bias mixed with a healthy heaping dose of anecdotal evidence.

       Same. A small piece of electrical tape over the camera works fine.

       As for the microphone, I haven't figured out how to dig those out of a prefab mac. Which is why I will be building a computer myself with zero cameras or microphones

       BSDs have been around long before Linux, and the original one has been dead for decades. I think you're confusing this with SELinux, which is a security framework for Linux originally developed by the NSA, and which was merged into the main source long ago.
