        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here are my reasons:</p>

<p>First of all, the US has been fiercely pushing QE, which has seen US debt increase exponentially over the recent years. I believe that this is unsustainable, and that the US economy is in for an ever bigger collapse than we have ever seen before. As such, I don&#39;t see much value in the stock and forex markets for these 2 years.

<p>Secondly, China, the largest holder of US debt has announced that it is no longer &quot;in the interest of the country to increase their foreign reserves&quot;. This means that China is not only NOT buying US debt, but I would assume that they will be looking to DECREASE the US debt they currently have.

<p>Thirdly, the rising tension in the middle east -- Syria, Iran, Iraq. This is a proxy war between the USA and the powers from the East (China, Russia), and has already been going on for decades. If anything, it&#39;s only going to get worse, as the USA continues to try to assert their dominance in the middle east, especially over oil trading.

<p>These are my reasons for why the economy will collapse by the end of 2015. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but before you dismiss my comments, I advise you to take a look at my links and judge for yourself with an open mind.</p>

<p>If you agree with me, my advise is to BUY BITCOINS, and let&#39;s build a new world together =)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But China is in no better shape. Their debt load is more than every other country on the planet. They are debasing the Yuan just like the US is doing to the Dollar. Their rapid, unsustainable growth has polluted their air and water so badly it is literally toxic now. Their property bubble is insane due to rampant overbuilding with no demand beyond as speculative properties that families have invested their entire savings into, which is showing signs of serious problems on the horizon. </p>

<p>Whoever fires the first shots, the entire world economy will collapse in a domino effect due to this fragile economic linkage. Neither the US or China will survive the collapse of the other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a conspiracy theory that the West and the East are both controlled by the same group, in which case the ends of individual nations are secondary to those of the New World Order. In this case, establishing one-world government is more important than running China&#39;s trade markets. The NWO could only come into form after WWIII between the East and the West imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Great Leap Forward was a failed social engineering policy which has proved that the state cannot understand and control the market and ensure wellbeing ofthe people, yet from another point of view the primary reason why China is booming today is as a result of failures and lessons learned from Mao&#39;s policies.</p>

<p>In short, Chinese are not afraid to implement radical policies and changes in society. They are not afraid to suffer in the short term if in the long term this will mean a better life for Chinese people and billions in the pockets for the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once QE tapering finally happens, interest rates will begin to rise. </p>

<p>I keep my eyes on the 10Y Treasury yields. The amount of interest we would owe back on our debt through securities with a 10 year fix will cripple the national debt. Once this interest rate passes above 3.5% for a number of days, creditors will start trying to get out because they think we might default. Once confidence in the USD is lost from our biggest creditors it will be game over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is that the <em>only</em> option left? </p>

<p>Investing you&#39;re money/time in a skill/trade that produces something needed (i.e. learn how to farm) is far more valuable than some imaginary digital number.</p>

<p><strong>What makes crytocurrency worth anything?</strong> How is it any different from fiat currency? Who controls it? </p>

<p>Why the hell would anyone advocate to buy bitcoins <em>now</em>? It is at it&#39;s all time high [buy low, sell high].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin has almost always been at an all time high. Why does the ceiling have to be at $1000? As much as you are simply dismissing it as a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot;, I am not going to rebutt you on that, because you are not even dilligent enough to study your own claims. Like I said, bitcoins have utility and people look to it as a currency because of their distrust of fiat dollars.</p>

<p>For the record, I am trying to make people see that the economy is going to collapse. And I&#39;m not trying to &quot;push bitcoins&quot; because whether or not I&#39;m telling you guys about it is not going to make the price change. I personally see Bitcoin as a highly profitable investment and I&#39;m just here to advise you to invest in it. Don&#39;t take my word for it.</p>

<p>But if you think bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, go on, hold on to your FIAT dollars. Let&#39;s see how it does in 2016. It&#39;s interesting that you mention learning how to farm because that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m doing and I&#39;m going to use my bitcoin profits to buy a farm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the probability of rising interest rates is already priced in to the price of the 10 year treasury. And from that we can get what the forward rates for the next ten years, which is basically what the market thinks the interest rate will be. And from there you can estimate how much the interest on the debt as a percent of GDP will be, as the CBO did. And using their calculations, that percent won&#39;t be any higher than under Bush, where no reckoning came. So, your concerns are not grounded in reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have to admit that I do not expect this either. Fracking has massively increased US production, but we still import a lot of oil as far as I know. I don&#39;t think fracking will last for a long time. The well crash out after 5 years or so. Production falls to 10% of the original production. So, I am not seeing this.

<p>If the US empire falls, then there&#39;s a chance. Otherwise, party on garth. Seriously though, credit ratings have been slashed anywhere and everywhere. Most economies run by central banks got nipped with downgrades. I have never been afraid of china (as an opponent). Private and public US coporations are partnering w the chinese like crazy right now. I know, because I work closely with sales executives who fly there every month. As long as GB and the US don&#39;t piss-off putin (came close w syria) or the casa de saud, we should be ok.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not a conspiracy theory, or even a conspiracy. If one knows of banking history and the formation of the US Government, and can read market graphs, it is obvious this is all coming to an end, and probably soon. It&#39;s not like currency collapses should be so surprising, as it has happened many times in history, for exactly the same reasons as it is happening now. The fatal flaw of our monetary systems is that no issuer of the currency can be trusted, whether private or government, and inevitably become corrupted. The only key difference is that this might happen on a worldwide scale at the same time which has never happened before. </p>

<p>The FED is pumping money into the economy (Wall Streets that is) to get &quot;growth&quot;, and now they cannot stop or the entire scam will collapse around the entire world. Simply tightening QE recently sent emerging markets into the tank is enough evidence of this. Private banks and their oligarch dynasties have pushed their control to the limits, and now the financial system is so complex that they have actually lost control of it. Just one major bank failure is all it would take to destroy the global system, each home to <em>trillions</em> of Dollars in unregulated and dangerous derivatives that if gone bad would be like dropping a financial nuclear bomb. Think Lehman Brothers but 1000x worse. </p>

<p>It is not looking good, and now war tensions will destabilize everything further. No country can afford a new, massive war. I fear such a thing if started will quickly bankrupt the planet. </p>

<p>I have faith in Bitcoin however, and when it all really starts catching fire in the fiat world, Bitcoin will be the only working economy to run to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The economy will collapse partly because the people&#39;s increasing distrust of a government backed currency. That is why the economy will not be back up and &quot;running again&quot; with FIAT money like it is now. At least, that&#39;s how I imagine it.</p>

<p>In fact, I think the Internet can somehow be re-established by using mobile phones to act as peer-to-peer support networks, although I&#39;m not sure of the specific technical aspects involved.

<p>I think the event will more likely be triggered by external events. These could be:
1) US losing footing in Middle east
2) Other superpowers bypassing US dollars</p>

<p>This is because the value of the US dollar is, if anything, backed by Oil and it&#39;s Army. When countries start to trade oil in anything other than the US dollar, we can start seeing a major decline in the US dollar, and an eventual collapse of the US economy.

    <div class="md"><p>I do not agree with your view on Bitcoins. If anything, I would say that Bitcoin is the beginning of a revolution, especially against the current monetary system. Bitcoins do not have intrinsic value, but it has tremendous utility in transferring wealth without a 3rd party (and exorbitant fees). The utility of Bitcoin alone will be enough to give it value, especially if you compare it against FIAT dollars. Whether or not the final price will be higher or lower than what it is now, who knows. But I don&#39;t see it going to $0, even if Google comes up with a better, more useful, decentralized cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>In the case of mainstream media or not, I am pretty sure that what we&#39;re learning from our history textbooks is largely junk. The supression of knowledge and information by the elite since the 1800s (or ealier, who knows) has brainwashed our society to the point where so few people are seeing the truth behind what&#39;s happening right in front of our eyes. We are trapped in a system of debt slavery, and few, if any, even stop to ponder the limitless possibilities of life, unbounded by society&#39;s restrictions and free of judgement. </p>

<p>Yes I understand where you&#39;re coming from. However, once US economy suffers, there will be a major shift in world power, would you agree?</p>

<p>Life will continue, but things will very different from how it is now. Coupled with an increasingly aware society and increasing distrust among the people against the governments and corporations (one prime example would be Anonymous - see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkkL8fwPnKg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkkL8fwPnKg</a>), I think we&#39;re in for a rollercoaster ride. When the US economy collapses, the whole world&#39;s economy will follow suit and many countries, especially those backed by the US dollar, will be in big trouble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>China has over 100,000,000 people earning less than $2 per day. It has made <em>amazing</em> progress in reducing the poverty rate over the past three decades.</p>

<p>That said, it is still a repressive dictatorship. The &quot;deal&quot; it has cut with its burgeoning middle class is basically &quot;ignore our corruption and monopoly on power and we will continue to deliver 8+% annual growth.&quot; That 8% growth needs a healthy US economy.</p>

<p>The US <em>already</em> survived the Great Depression without a revolution. I doubt China could survive five years of 1% growth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congress determines how much the government spends and sets tax rates. It authorizes the Treasury Secretary to borrow the gap between spending and collected revenue. The Treasury auctions off securities--treasury bonds and treasury bills.</p>

<p>People and institutions buy and sell the bonds on an open market. The Federal Reserve buys a portion of these. Recently, it has been buying a huge portion of these. But that doesn&#39;t increase the amount that the government owes. It actually saves the government money, since the Federal Reserve gives almost all of its profits to the government.</p>

<p>The main danger from quantitative easing is inflation, but that hasn&#39;t been a problem the last few years.</p>

<p>The debt did soar after the financial crisis, but that&#39;s because (1) tax revenue falls when the economy is doing bad, (2) tax rates were cut to help stimulate the economy, (3) the Obama stimulus program boosted a lot of spending in the short term, (4) miscellaneous expenses associated with the financial crisis and recession.</p>

<p>That is all in addition to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast">Republican strategy</a>, since 1981, to cut taxes and drive up the deficit, creating a crisis atmosphere so that they can cut government spending.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Like I said, war is already happening right now in the middle east. Don&#39;t be fooled by what we see on the surface, because when you dig deeper, you find a wealth of information that you will find hard to believe. Or at least, I have.</p>

<p>I am not going to deny I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist, because the topic I raised here is only a small part of a bigger picture. I honestly don&#39;t think its a question of IF the economy will collapse, but more of WHEN it will.</p>

<p>what will constitute as a realistic threat to the current status of the petrodollar</p>

<p>If the US empire falls, then there&#39;s a chance. Otherwise, party on garth. Seriously though, credit ratings have been slashed anywhere and everywhere. Most economies run by central banks got nipped with downgrades. I have never been afraid of china (as an opponent). Private and public US coporations are partnering w the chinese like crazy right now. I know, because I work closely with sales executives who fly there every month. As long as GB and the US don&#39;t piss-off putin (came close w syria) or the casa de saud, we should be ok.</p>
