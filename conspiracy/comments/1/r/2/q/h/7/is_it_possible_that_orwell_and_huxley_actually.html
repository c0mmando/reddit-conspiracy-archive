<p>You haven&#39;t read much Orwell, huh? While Huxley undoubtedly had reactionary tendencies (loss of religion is a big theme of BNW), Orwell was an anti-authoritarian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell#Political_views">through and through</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have seen wonderful things and at last really believe in Socialism, which I never did before.&quot;[149][150] Having witnessed the success of the anarcho-syndicalist communities, for example in Anarchist Catalonia, and the subsequent brutal suppression of the anarcho-syndicalists, anti-Stalin communist parties and revolutionaries by the Soviet Union-backed Communists, Orwell returned from Catalonia a staunch anti-Stalinist and joined the Independent Labour Party, his card being issued on 13 June 1938.[91] Although he was never a Trotskyist, he was strongly influenced by the Trotskyist and anarchist critiques of the Soviet regime, and by the anarchists&#39; emphasis on individual freedom. In Part 2 of The Road to Wigan Pier, published by the Left Book Club, Orwell stated: &quot;a real Socialist is one who wishes – not merely conceives it as desirable, but actively wishes – to see tyranny overthrown.&quot; Orwell stated in &quot;Why I Write&quot; (1946): &quot;Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>also</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I worked out an anarchistic theory that all government is evil, that the punishment always does more harm than the crime and the people can be trusted to behave decently if you will only let them alone.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike many intellectuals of the time, Orwell was intimately familiar with the real fight against fascism on the ground - he was nearly killed by a sniper shot to the neck when fighting with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. It&#39;s really depressing to see him tarnished with this broad brush just because he&#39;s famous, or something.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting I agree with his politics 100%, but the idea that he was an evangelist of fascism is an ignorant joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orwell personally combated the forces of Fascism and witnessed the treachery of the Soviet Communists himself in the Spanish Civil War. He was furthermore bitterly opposed to British Imperialism, which is a major objective of the Round Table Group which control (or controlled) the CFR, Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg. No, it seems absurd to me to suggest that a man who gave much of his life toward combating the forces of tyranny was secretly on their side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering that both <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/assets/fabian_society.jpg">Huxley and Orwell</a> were members of the socialist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Society">Fabian Society,</a> I would say that both popular novels, 1984 and Brave New World, were possible attempts at predictive programming. Orwell and Huxley seemed to be writing about what was already being discussed by power holders behind the scenes. Instead of prescience or providing blueprints, the authors seemed to be attempting to unconsciously influence the general public.</p>

<p>One should also think about how both books end in very defeatist manner. Consider the fact that Orwell constantly beat a defeatist drum. I agree with Orwell on the fact of rising fascism after WWII even though many considered it killed off after the defeat of the Axis powers of WWII. What I don&#39;t understand was instead of informing the populace into how to counteract the rising totalitarian trend, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox-shlDXKO4">Orwell only offered defeat</a>. </p>

<p>According to 1984 and Brave New World, in the end you will either <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TQZ-2iMUR0">love your servitude</a> (<em>He loved Big Brother</em>) or die (<em>Slowly, very slowly, like two unhurried compass needles, the feet turned towards the right; north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-south-west; then paused, and, after a few seconds, turned as unhurriedly back towards the left. South-south-west, south, south-east, east</em>).</p>
