       Sorry if this isn't "conspiracy" enough for this board. I have a trip planned to Philly. Leaving tomorrow. I've been so nervous about it. Has any one heard of any possible False flags in PA? I go to Philly every year to visit an eye doctor there. WHY AM I SCARED OF MY OWN COUNTRY!?

       I was hoping my idiotic reply would be as obviously sardonic in text as it was in my head.

       Never watch a Chevey Chase movie immediately before posting on reddit.

      <p>
       Conspiracy theory websites are notoriously thick with dudes. I think this is only because dudes are statistically more into theory and chicks are statistically more into application. Both are really needed, clearly, but this is why you'll see a lot of chicks in bureaucratic capacities and dudes in their godamn basements like gremlins. If you look at the aristocratic courts females frequently operate behind the scenes in surprising ways. Officially men have power, but you'd be amazed at what happens outside of officialdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the high weirdness that is modren American politics has become thoroughly bat-shit crazy more and more dudes and, subsequently, chicks are unable to ignore how nuts it's become. By statistics alone an influx of women is to be expected. That said, as this happens, some people are still of the mindset that this ought to be out of the ordinary. I, personally, see the widening and diversification as wonderful news.

       Which legitimate fears? The "attack" cited as reason for fearing a city was an industrial accident, which can happen anywhere. Don't get mad at me, get mad at the "false flag" conspiracy theorists who have planted these fears.

       I guess what struck me as the most odd thing about the inquiry is that it was made AFTER the travel plans were made. If a person is truly worried about the rarest of rare attacks (some might say the type of attack that has never been proven to have happened), don't make the plans in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, this person probably never would have thought to fear a false flag attack if some conspiracy theorists hadn't come up with it. Mugging, murder, airplane/car crash, rape, etc. are the types of concerns most people come up with on their own when faced with going to "the big city", but an attack on the citizens by their own government is a bit of a stretch, to say the least.

       I would argue that telling someone they have nothing to fear is much less an attack than encouraging them to be afraid. Imagine how difficult life would be for someone who is afraid to go about their business for fear they will be the victim of an attack by their own government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also surmise that if anyone is planning the type of attack OP is concerned about, not a single Redditor is privy to it, thus the inquiry is useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I attacked this person, whoever planted the idea in their head did that a long time ago.

       Well considering that we have a long history of trolls in this subreddit who have nothing more to say than "you're a paranoid delusional nut bag" or "you're retarded, get a life" we don't allow these kind of comments anymore.

       You may not have meant it that way, but they aren't allowed so the warning stands.

       I'm paranoid for a few reasons. Last time I went to Philly, on June, a building collapsed 2 blocks from me. I heard it, felt it. And I'm also paranoid because I'm leaving my daughter behind, I will be 4 hours from her and wouldn't want to get stranded.

       Are you truly that afraid cause if so then you got more problems then having a false flag attack happen around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are driving hell a drunk driver can hit you I find that outcome a more likely scenario then a terrorist attack.

       Are you referring to the demolition conducted by inept engineers? I can guarantee someone will perish today because of the stupidity of another person but there is no way to assume it won't happen in your home town. You're more likely to get hit by a drunk driver than you are to get crushed by a falling building while antique shopping next door. You won't get stranded anywhere and I assume you are leaving your child in good hands since you are worried. Just go handle your business and get home.
