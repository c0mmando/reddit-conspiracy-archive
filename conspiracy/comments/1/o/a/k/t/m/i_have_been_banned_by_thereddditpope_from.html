<p>In reality, your account is basically deleted. None of your posts or comments ever show up to any other user and none of your upvotes or downvotes count. If you log out of your account and try to view your own account page, you will see it is deleted. </p>

<p>Basically it tries to trick people into thinking that they&#39;re still valid users, but in reality they&#39;re invisible. It&#39;s a terrible concept and the fact that it even exists proves that Reddit has been compromised by people who want to censor us. </p>

<p>The fact that I can see your comment proves that you are not shadowbanned, but if you ever feel that you may have been shadowbanned, you can use this to check: <a href="http://shadowbancheck.appspot.com/">http://shadowbancheck.appspot.com/</a></p>

<p>Second, vote manipulation, when we can prove it, is a ban on sight offense. We usually reinstate people if they apologize and switch to an NP link, but your brigading was a special kind of awful designed to gin up outrage at the mods of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. The post you brigaded was removed in error, but rather than ask us via modmail, you decided to try to rally <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to bust out the torches and pitchforks.</p>

<p>You deserved the ban, and honestly, you probably deserve a Reddit wide ban.</p>

<p>People of r/Conspiracy please note that Snowden stories show up on r/Politics all the time. Don&#39;t worry, those posts are just fine and this was just an accident that no one mentioned to us in mod mail otherwise it would have been fixed sooner. </p>

<p>Also, we don&#39;t care if you want to have an opinion about politics or point something out about the community. We just ask that you use a No Participation link or a screen shot. Thanks! </p>

We didn&#39;t need to be called out by anyone. One person could have sent us a mod mail concerning the link and we would have immediately fixed the error. Twist the facts to your liking, but the truth of the matter is that there are Snowden and NSA stories on our front page All. The. Time. We don&#39;t mind that. It&#39;s obviously related to US politics.</p>

<p>We only recognize a few key words:</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to inform you that without officially recognized and authorized verbiage your post will be either ignored or downvoted. I suggest you think about what you&#39;ve done and the confusion you&#39;ve let loose on this poor, innocent and easily misled sub. Next time come in with some inks to documentaries made by people wearing Guy Fawkes masks set to the Inception sound track and you might - <em>might</em> - get some responses.</p>

<p>Otherwise cheers and I hope your day goes well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do nothing but talk shit.</p>

<p>Frankly, it&#39;s the only thing that amuses me. I&#39;ve been through all of the phases and am graced with a modicum of self-awareness; mostly due to how many times I&#39;ve said fucking embarrassing things in public. I have no problems poking fun at myself and others. </p>

<p>Hell, as you pointed out, I&#39;m in this sub more than any other.</p>

<p>Is that not, in itself, funny?</p>

<p>Also look through my posts and you&#39;ll see that I&#39;m a troll, though a troll with something to offer. You may look through the last couple months of my history or you may ask me a question (ask me anything - answering questions is literally the only thing I&#39;m good at). You&#39;ll find that I&#39;m always willing to impart whatever knowledge I have to give. And I&#39;ll likely do it with a few jokes - some exoteric and some esoteric. In the case of the reply to which you replied everything I said was an exoteric joke.</p>

<p>Or, let&#39;s look at it this way:</p>

<p>We need some godamn levity in here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That depends on who you ask. Some people would say it&#39;s the CIA. Others would say they were French men contracted by the New York or Chicago mafia. I&#39;m of the opinion that it has all been obfuscated specifically so that it would be in question for the public. I think Bill Hicks <a href="http://youtu.be/KJPwM8nehkQ">had it right</a>.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I think you should dis-engage from the U.S. Federal government. They&#39;re obviously corrupt and they clearly covered up the Kennedy assassination and 9/11 and a bunch of other stuff we all know about. Don&#39;t give them power by participating in their bullshit.</p>

<p>We may never know who killed Kennedy.</p>

<p>But we can deal with where we are right now.</p>
