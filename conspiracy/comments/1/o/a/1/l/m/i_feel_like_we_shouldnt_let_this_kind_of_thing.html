       I went to a Nine Inch Nails concert tonight in Boston (yes, it kicked an unbelievable amount of ass). Afterwards my boyfriend and I walked out of TD Garden and there were two street performers playing drums with buckets. They were amazing and there was maybe 50 people surrounding them while some danced in the middle of the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       After people began to disperse I look over and notice a police officer with a bullet proof vest on and a dog that was lunging at people as they walked by. Then I read the words on his vest which said POLICE DHS and on the back it said Dept. Homeland Security. I stared him down and he met my gaze the whole time until he turned the corner. I feel like he was trying to intimidate people..

       As a former Cape Cod native resident who moved to NC, I found myself slowly deprogramming from my "state" of mind and realized that Massachusetts really is a beta test for the usurping of our Constitutional rights and enforcing a police state. The Boston marathon bombing (false flag event) and the "shelter in place" orders (martial law) that were implemented during a search for alleged suspects confirmed my belief. I am very happy you are noticing a pattern, and being aware of police presence, DHS is likened to the Sturmabteilung or Brownshirts of pre nazi Germany, in my opinion. Once they orchestrate fear and intimidation to a satisfactory level,  that's when the SS troops take over, and our modern day SS is most likely foreign troops that are here along with Blue hats of the  UN.

       I do believe that we're a part of a greater whole within this thing we call 'humanity.' I do think that some semblance of 'government' is reasonable. I, however, am of the opinion that
       <em>
        this government
       </em>
       is thoroughly illegitimate. I don't really mind laws and taxation per se. I just think that what we have is an offence morally and ethically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marc Stevens contends that there ought to be zero government. On philosophical grounds I understand what he's saying and ven agree with the core concept - I just think that there are psychopaths who would abuse the lack of enforcement of things like laws. Marc Stevens himself is aware of psychopaths and I don't really know how he'd deal with them; I haven't read his book yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I haven't resolved this in my own mind.

       If you and your boyfriend, as you say, were the only one noticing he can't have been as intimidating as you described.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just an observation, reading your words. That's OK. We all exaggerate our stories to friends. It makes it more interesting, I guess, and as I say, we all have done it, from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, I believe your story. Have made similar observations in another major US city. I just don't care to elaborate. This is the "new" normal. Doesn't make it right.
