       There's no doubt, it's not a ploy, the asteroid is coming. Gas is what you have in the car. Money in the bank is only allowed to be withdrawn within 24 hours. Disneyland is open. So are National Parks (couldn't help myself...) All cell phones and email/internet work.  What would you do?

       Brodies, alllll day. Until I run out of gas. Then go shoot shit. Until I run out of bullets. Then go smoke all the pot. Until I run out of weed. Then go get some beer. And reverently sip on it and reflect on how much better it would have been to get the beer first

       So does that mean he stays true to himself when he lies? Or is it that his lies are the truth in that they are real and the truth is real, in that a his truth is false making it true? I've always wondered, maybe too much.

       I'd actually drive
       <em>
        toward
       </em>
       the impact zone.  Life on this planet generally sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you realize that this life is a prison sentence, you stop looking at death as any sort of end.  You view it as a release.  This is a
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       thing.  I understand that some prisoners become institutionalized and actually prefer to
       <em>
        stay
       </em>
       in prison, but I'm personally
       <em>
        very much
       </em>
       looking forward to finally getting out.

       Damn, bro, that's not living. I feel bad for you. There is still joy and hope. There is beauty &amp; wonder in every day. I recommend looking into the 12 steps, find a higher power
       <em>
        of your own understanding
       </em>
       and gain some acceptance &amp; peace. Plus, it really pisses TPTB off when we find serenity in the madness.

       Independent of the fact that this comment you just made has almost literally
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to do with what I just stated above, it in itself is largely ignorant of the true extent of what it means to be grateful or ungrateful, as well as of the relativity of either state.  For you or anyone to call someone "ungrateful" who 1) might have a place to sleep and is not out on the street, but who is 2) still very much aware of the difficulty and often monumental vicissitude involved in life on this planet shows a great, great deal of arrogance and ignorance on your part.  Your inability to grasp how it is that one can live in the United States and yet
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       have an understanding of what true difficulty is like might say more about your short comings than theirs.

      <p>
       If you just got stabbed in the shoulder, would the fact that the person next to you just got shot in the stomach keep you from crying out in pain?  And exactly how intelligent or understanding - or even
       <em>
        correct
       </em>
       - would you be if you had the insensitive gall to berate the individual from crying out in pain who is now bleeding profusely from their arm?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are my problems the "biggest, most terrible" problems in the world?  No, they're not.  Does that make them any less worthy, or significant, or difficult to deal with in their own right?  No.  It doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, all this is independent of the real point involved in what I was initially referring to in the first place:  This life is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       as closed and limited as most on this planet think it is.  It is a school - a generally difficult (read "shitty") school for most.  One's job for the most part should be to learn as much as possible while in "class",
       <em>
        pass
       </em>
       the class, and then look forward to moving on to the next lessons
       <em>
        elsewhere
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, it is exceedingly sad and actually borderline pitiful, now that I think about it, that you came on here asking a question the answers to which you have decided to berate if they don't exactly make sense to you or fit or coincide with your apparently
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       limited world view.
