<p>Remember when going to war used to be a big deal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the fucking problem. We&#39;ve been at war for 13 years running. Think about all of the teenagers out there right now that were too young to remember 911 happening. Their only political awareness is War on Terror, War on Drugs, and massive inequality. I am lucky enough to remember the 90s. </p>

In a sense, violent movies/tv industry (murder porn!) and games like COD and Battlefield just as two small examples in a huge larger structure have been like a 15 years period of sexy-ing up war/violence, making it a game, and excitement, a thrill, with the use of technology.Now you have &quot;soldiers&quot; in all our bases all over the world, go out on a mission and come back and sit and play &quot;war&quot;  on screens like some sort of subconscious robot simulator sub neural construct mind control slaves sitting around in hibernation mode, programed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(from the guardian)...
Statistics provided by Special Operations Command (pdf) indicate that special forces groups were operating in 92 different countries in March 2013. The AUMF premise, no matter how it gets tweaked, is enabling a system of eternal warfare, a reality that is not only financially untenable for a nation in deep debt, but also ethically indefensible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for reducing our overseas military presence, but that has nothing to do with the shutdown. The shutdown is happening because a small group of Republican congressmen want to defund the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<p>It&#39;s both sides, not just the GOP. To be fair, the GOP has offered several bills that would fund the government but the Democrats won&#39;t vote on it. This is just political theatre. The elites want this to happen. They want us to think we need the government. That is why they are making things as inconvenient as possible. Since when do we need the government to walk in a forest? Since when do you need the government to look at a monument? Notice nothing of their special interests is shut down. The NSA data facility isn&#39;t closed. The government golf courses aren&#39;t closed. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The House Republicans offered several bills that would fund the government but defund or delay the Affordable Care Act. Those bills were voted on in the Senate. They were rejected.</p>

<p>The Senate has sent bills to the House, but <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-06/boehner-says-house-doesn-t-have-votes-to-raise-debt-limit.html">Speaker of the House John Boehner (GOP) will not let the bills be voted on in the House.</a></p>

<p>It is true that the administration is trying to inconvenience people, but it&#39;s in order to make the Republicans look bad and pressure them to re-open the government. Most of the &quot;elites&quot; don&#39;t want a government shutdown at all. But some &quot;elites&quot;, like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/a-federal-budget-crisis-months-in-the-planning.html?_r=0">Ed Meese and the Koch brothers have been planning the shutdown for their partisan purposes</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point there is no difference between voting no and not voting. If you are the majority (like the GOP in the House), why waste time when you know the bill will fail and look bad? The Senate votes because they want the GOP to look bad. Again, it&#39;s all just political theatre. Plus the mainstream media isn&#39;t helping things either.</p>

<p>The real &#39;elites&#39; want a shutdown. (besides, no politician that could lose their seat would publicly say they want a shutdown, that&#39;s just bad politics and will lose them their job/power). A shutdown will eventually lead to Obama ruling by executive order since Congress will be at a stalemate. The executive branch will absorb more power and the other two branches will not stop it.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that shit is going to hit the fan eventually. Our country is not stable and the elites are taking too much power. To be honest, I think defaulting and letting this play out will be better in the long run for our country. Shit will hit the fan faster rather than dragging this out until people finally wake up and realize we are being ruled by a one party system and things get too out of control. Might as well get it over with sooner rather than later. </p>

<p>Actually, there are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/06/majority-of-house-appears-to-support-clean-cr/">probably enough Republican votes to <em>pass</em> the Senate bill,</a> and that&#39;s why Boehner doesn&#39;t want a vote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real &#39;elites&#39; want a shutdown. </p>

<p>Who are these people that want a shutdown? What&#39;s your evidence? </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/10/04/229103229/monitoring-how-journalists-cover-government-shutdown">division within the Republican Party that has led to this</a>, and the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/32-republicans-who-caused-the-government-shutdown/280236/">32 Republicans most responsible</a> are hardly the elite.</p>
