    <div class="md"><p>A pole shift would take all those events and magnify them thousands of times. Our gravity is effected greatly by our rotational spin. If all of a sudden that wobbles and the poles flip, imagine what all the mass of the planet would do? This may be why there are tons of ancient cave systems theorized to have been used as cities in the past. </p>

<p>I wonder how the oceans of the world will react to it? I imagine a long slow push all in one direction and oceans swamping through coastlines and possibly over mountain ranges. Could make for a great movie!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good Point. I believe there is an argument for the possibility of a violent pole flip as the pole shifts farther and farther out. Best analogy is how a spinning top acts, espescially the kind that flip themselves up on to their handle and then keep spinning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most significant aspect of a pole shift is the monumental movement of water, and a complete submersion of the new equator. Incidentally, I am not talking about magnetic pole shift (which is a completely different issue) but the movement of the North and South poles to a different location on the Earth&#39;s crust.</p>

<p>You are presumably aware that the earth is not a true sphere, but an oblate spheroid. Because the earth spins on its Polar axis at about 1000mph, the earth bulges significantly at the equator (and flattens at the poles). The result is that the circumference of the earth at the equator is some 40km greater than the circumference around the poles. </p>

<p>When the poles shift, so does the equator, and so does the bulge! The first thing to move is water - millions of cubic kilometres of it - seeking out the new equator like a spirit level.</p>

<p>What happens is that landmasses on the new equator that were comfortably above sea level before the pole shift, are suddenly hundreds, even thousands of metres below sea-level in a matter of hours. The opposite is true for the old (current) equator - land masses rise out the sea.</p>

<p>Everybody else can expect severe (albeit less dramatic) flooding in all coastal and low lying areas across the globe. Billions of humans (and other animals) will drown in a matter of hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The magnetic poles &quot;shift&quot; the whole time without causing any serious problems. Magnetic North has meandered for hundred of miles around Northern Canada and the Arctic Ocean since scientists started to measure it.</p>

<p>The only meaningful pole shift would be of the geographic poles. It would involve enormous forces, but this would not necessarily entail an altering of the spin of the earth, merely crustal displacement. The mantle and core would carrying on spinning on the same axis as before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on the solar weather during the actual flip. Right now our magnetic field deflects and allows some energized particles to funnel down at the poles (creating auroras). During the flip, the poles will travel across the equator. A direct, head-on blast of energized particles, even from a relatively weak and common flare could do damage to electronics on the ground and in orbit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compasses (both mechanical and biological) stop working as the magnetic field becomes weaker, then reverse entirely as it becomes stronger in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>During the period of weakening, radiation from the sun is not blocked as effectively by our magnetic field. Skin cancer rates will go up, but not by an extreme or particularly dangerous amount. Electronics <em>might</em> be more likely to be affected by atmospheric radiation, but that&#39;s not a certainty.</p>

<p>Over time things will go back to normal, except compasses will point backwards and the migratory habits of birds will have changed. They will either have evolved new behaviors to fly &quot;north&quot; for the winter, or they will have changed physically to not need to migrate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that we&#39;ve been through the ride a few times over the course of history. That that the continents are shifting for &quot;most efficient spin&quot;. Basically they are balancing themselves out for a smooth ride, and each time there is a build up of enough energy to destabilize and cause another shift. Think about putting a rubber band around a pen and twisting it up and then letting it go, the recoil will store enough energy to spin the pin back around the opposite direction but with less energy, the waves of energy become smaller and smaller. The pole flipping, in my theory, works the same way, less and less energy at each switch, less and less destruction after billions of years. Eventually the piles will find their balance, but before they do, there will be a back and forth and the balance ebbs and flows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You won&#39;t notice it, if it happens. The magnetic polarity of the planet will flip, and compass needles will start pointing the opposite way (eventually, when the shift settles down). But for us it will be a non-event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK then, 99.9999999%. Physics is pretty consistent, and inertia is well understood. The amount of energy it would take to stop the Earth spinning in a short amount of time would be incredibly huge. Far more than just a weak magnetic field changing direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if the magnetic field is gone, what does that say about the core of the earth? What does that mean for the way the earth interacts energy with other planets/sun? Yes, electromagnet force is the weakest of all the forces, but ever heard of the electrical universe theory? And what does it mean for our personal electromagnetic fields? Which possibly communicate via the earths electromagnetic field.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more questions. It&#39;s funny how science can seem like it knows all. It doesn&#39;t. No one knows how an absent field will effect the earth. Sure you can speculate based on past flips that humans weren&#39;t around for. But, again, it&#39;s all based on our observances within our lifetimes/man kinds life times. Just because something is produced in a lab, under controlled conditions, doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll explain all phenomena that&#39;s similar or pertaining. </p>

<p>I agree with you, but still, I&#39;m not going to act like we know anything. I think we could &quot;research&quot; for millions of years and not even be close to answering this pole flip question without inaccuracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that not everything is known, and there would almost certainly be surprises that we didn&#39;t expect if something happened to the magnetic field, but someone claiming the Earth would stop spinning is ridiculous. There are things which can be speculated, and there are things that are known. </p>

<p>Sure, people can say &quot;there&#39;s always a chance&quot;, or &quot;we can never know for sure&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean it <em>would</em> happen. According to quantum physics, your computer could vanish from in front of you you right now and appear at the other side of the universe completely intact, atom by atom. Does that mean it will happen? of course not, unless you have a few hundred trillion years to spare to wait for the tiny chance it could happen. </p>

<p>Add to the amazing unlikeness the fact that a pole shift has happened before, as many geological surveys have found, yet the earth has always spun at roughly the same speed through them all, and it shows that we can be very confident, as close to certain as is possible even, that it won&#39;t happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re 100% correct, hahah. </p>

<p>But I mean, how would the 3 days of darkness thing work if it wasn&#39;t an actuality. Because, I&#39;m on your side and don&#39;t see how darkness is possible due to a pole flip.  However, google search 3 days of darkness pole flip and you get a bunch of results. I don&#39;t support google search results as the answer, but how did these two ideas even become tied together. Cause like you said, it doesn&#39;t make sense based on the common knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t know how someone could have connected them. But at the risk of being down-voted, some conspiracy theories are more in the realms of Hollywood fiction than reality, and there&#39;s always someone out there who&#39;ll believe it. I mean, there&#39;s still people who seriously believe the Earth is flat, something that was proven wrong thousands of years ago, and people who think we&#39;re ruled by reptilian overlords, so maybe this is one of the more <em>sane</em> theories....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hahah, assuming such a theory exists as a <em>sane</em> one in this society. You really wonder when you hear some people defend the moon hoax though. It&#39;s like...dude. Commercial space flights are a real thing. Come back to reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is inaccurate. There are several storylines that may or may not happen.</p>

<p>It is unknown what will whipe out electricity. Ones say it will be russian nuclear weapons all going off at once in chech coal (?) mines (because they are losing), causing massive earthquakes, change of earths axis, pole-shift and through that the end of electricity.</p>

<p>Others are reporting that comet ISON, or fragments of it, will impact on earth (there are several perspectives about this, one includes the nazis who live in hollow-earth ... quite fascinating), causing the earth to crack, axis change, pole shift.</p>

<p>You should stick to Alois Irlmaier ... and not youtube.</p>

<p>edit: after reading this ... i have not enough understanding about physics to tell what could/could not whipe out electricity, but the chance of it happening seems, considering current events in our time-line, very likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good Point. I believe there is an argument for the possibility of a violent pole flip as the pole shifts farther and farther out. Best analogy is how a spinning top acts, espescially the kind that flip themselves up on to their handle and then keep spinning.</p>
