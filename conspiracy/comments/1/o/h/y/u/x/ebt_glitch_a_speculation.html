       Had a thought last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the EBT glitch where people had temporarily unlimited funds was a way to monitor resource consumption in the market? What if it was a test to see what kind of items are the first off the shelves in the event that money is no longer a concern?
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems to me like there's a pointed stress test of our social systems going on right now, and this alleged EBT glitch seems to follow the pattern. And food speculation is quickly becoming a new economic bubble, we all know how much Wall St. loves it's bubbles.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Holy shit, any confirmation on this?

       They mean that people who use EBT do not make up the average group of citizens, and that for this study to be unbiased you would also need citizens who do not use EBT, to see how they would react in a no money anything goes type situation.

       Would it be safe to argue that Wal Mart was harder hit than other stores by the EBT glitch?

       From what I read, Walmart shot itself in the foot. Unable to determine an EBT card's limit, they had two choices:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Deny all purchases.
       </li>
       <li>
        Ignore any limits and sort it out later.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       As they went with #2, the results were entirely predictable.

        While many retailers promptly halted use of EBT cards since the outage meant they couldn’t see cardholders’ spending limits, Wal-Mart let cardholders go ahead and buy food and other necessities at the two Louisiana stores and others across the country.

       retailer most notorious for shitting on the little guy.... yet they allowed unpaid for purchases to go out the door on a whim? I don't buy it, I'm sorry. Something else is at play here.

       Her justification was something along the lines of "We chose to let these people get the food they needed to feed their families and children" or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, a giant positive PR spin for Wal-Mart. Like "Look, we let these people have food, even though we're gonna lose money on it."

       Wow this has been one of the most profoundly intelligent posts I have ever seen in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it's easy to jump to the conclusion of malfeasance when your view of the system has already become so engrossed with a vision of corruption, hypocrisy, greed, lies, and outright evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equally the same for people who view it as good to instantly believe it to be the organic technical glitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where rationality and critical thinking must come in to play though, as those are the tools that allow you to determine which scenario is more likely to have played out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally would pin it on indirect malfeasance as I believe it WAS done as an experiment to see how the lowest rungs of the social-economic scale would react to a situation wherein their food purchasing power is either shut down or unlimited.
      </p>
      <p>
       It IS a test because their sample IS the poor people on EBT. Those results could then lead to their ability to speculate what people on the next level might do, as after all, we're all humans with the same base needs of food and water, so given the situation wherein we're confronted with the possible loss of those necessities, it's fair to say we'd all act within a similar predictability range.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Ockam's Razor shit is a half assed psychological intellectual ploy to trick less intelligent people into believing them by seeming to be more intelligent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a ploy though to convince you that this EBT experiment was anything but.

       Don't listen to this shill telling you it can't be a test, what a load of garbage. The poor people are a representative sample of the middle class because we're barely above them and all have the same need for food and water. As I've previously stated that situation leads us all to act in similar predictable manners, so you can easily test this by doing it to poor people.

       It would be nice, wouldn't it, if we could decide, as a nation, to use our own money supply to improve the lives of the neediest human beings rather than those who already have the most? That's the premise of David Graeber's book

       Wow! what a really fucked up government you have.....
      </p>
      <p>
       So the US government
       <strong>
        will forgive billions upon billions of dollars in debt owed to it by other countries and multinational corporations
       </strong>
       but when it comes to a couple hundred million in food subsidies to their own poor and unfortunate citizens they just make them pay it all back?
      </p>
      <p>
       WOW!

       I'm pretty sure I saw her name on a CNN report today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her justification was something along the lines of "We chose to let these people get the food they needed to feed their families and children" or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, a giant positive PR spin for Wal-Mart. Like "Look, we let these people have food, even though we're gonna lose money on it."
