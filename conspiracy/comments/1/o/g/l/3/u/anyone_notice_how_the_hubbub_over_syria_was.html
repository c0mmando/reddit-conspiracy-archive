<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The CW&#39;s were never a real issue. Their <em>alleged</em> use was an excuse for the West to enter the civil war - which has already claimed more than 100,000 lives - only 1,000 (+/-) of which were killed by chemical weapons.</p>

<p>Of course the US has never considered Syria&#39;s CW&#39;s a <em>direct</em> threat - <strong>Israel does</strong>. The <em>allegations</em> that Assad used CW&#39;s have never been proven - indeed, all evidence points to the &quot;rebels&quot; deploying any CW&#39;s that were used (with a little help from Assad&#39;s enemies).</p>

<p>So it was clearly Israel that was calling for the US intervention to &quot;stop the madness&quot; (contrived) AND it is clearly Israel that is benefiting from Assad being disarmed of CW&#39;s.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Israel maintains its OWN stockpile of CW&#39;s, as well as nuclear, bio, and any other weapons system you can imagine.</p>

<p>And now Israel, the Nuclear Nematode, is back to screaming that the US must BOMB IRAN!!!</p>

<p>Screw Israel. </p>

<p>We all get caught up in the drama of our lives - the daily struggle with survival. Given the little time that most of us have to pay attention to the &quot;broader world&quot;, it&#39;s easy to be blown to-and-fro with whatever the media is pimping on a given day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure whether you&#39;re mocking / being sarcastic, but...</p>

<p>It&#39;s not all that strange, really. Once you start paying attention to what is going on, you begin noticing links and patterns - not just in what is happening, but in what the reactions and responses of our &quot;leaders&quot; are.</p>

<p>Then you ask the key question: <strong>Who benefits?</strong> It&#39;s not a novel concept, as any seasoned criminal investigator will, after examining the prima fascia evidence, will ask: Who had the means, the opportunity and the <strong>motive</strong> to commit a given crime.</p>

<p>As time passes, we are gifted with hindsight, in that we are able to observe the reactions and responses to a given event, and to determine if and if said reactions are congruent with the criminal act.</p>

<p>For example: We were told that the events of 9-11 were carried out by 19 Saudi hijackers under the control of one wealthy and eccentric Saudi national, allegedly sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan. </p>

<p>Naturally, we directed our outrage and vindictive wrath toward Iraq, who had NOTHING to do with 9-11 - yet we concocted a web of &quot;facts&quot; to support said claim - &quot;facts&quot; which were later revealed to be based on lies supported by false evidence - largely supplied by &quot;interested&quot; third parties.</p>

<p>The gift of hindsight allowed us not only to condemn the reaction as unjust, but also called into question the scenario under which the original act was carried out.</p>

<p>And again we ask: WHO BENEFITED FROM 9-11, and from the subsequent wars and political upheaval?</p>

<p>Did Osama, the Taliban and the Afghans benefit? Did Saddam Hussein and the people of Iraq benefit? I think any rational person would answer <strong>NO</strong> to those questions.</p>

<p>Once you realize that there is often a hidden agenda, and that one of the primary goals is deception of the befuddled public, the game becomes much more intriguing - and as patterns of repeated deception occur, it soon becomes easier to smell the bullshit, as &quot;bands of usual suspects&quot; emerge.</p>

<p>And before long it becomes glaringly obvious that these &quot;usual suspects&quot; are loosely in cahoots, but they do seem to universally agree on one thing: <strong>The &quot;enemy&quot; is us.</strong> </p>

<p>Enjoy the show.</p>

<p>Apparently you are either too young or were not paying attention to the warmongering rhetoric that was being floated by the Bushies and the NeoCon Crowd post 9-11. They not only (falsely) claimed that Iraq had WMD&#39;s, but they repeatedly claimed (again falsely) that Iraq was affiliated with al Qaeda - and the FIRED-UP American public lapped it up.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I noticed that you used WARS in the plural, here - meaning Afghanistan <strong>and IRAQ</strong> - so apparently you already knew that a major pretext for Iraq was its alleged 9-11 connections, and you&#39;re just shilling.</p>

<p>I remember seeing a link in here about how Saudi Arabia was actually responsible for the attack... anyone got more depth to that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Saudis may well have played a role in setting up the Damascus false-flag, but as this <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Syrian-rebel-forces-trained-by-West-are-moving-towards-Damascus-324033">Jerusalem Post article reveals</a>, both the US and Israel had been training &quot;handpicked&quot; operatives for months in a camp on the Jordan/Syrian border - and that these operatives were dispatched into Syria - headed for Damascus - only days before the chemical weapons attack (conveniently blamed on Assad) took place.</p>

<p>Could it be that the US, Israel (and possibly the Saudis) cooperated to train and equip these &quot;rebels&quot; with the specific intent of framing Assad?</p>

<p>Means, <strong>motive</strong> and opportunity.</p>

<p>Who had all three?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course!</p>

<p>It was a false-flag, people saw right through it, Americans are sick of fighting wars for Israel.</p>

<p>They had to shut it down quick. Bad news?? Now &quot;they&quot; realize that nothing short of a nuke going off in American is going to mobilize the American people to do ANYTHING--and even then they won&#39;t do anything.</p>

<p>Look for nuclear terrorism in the USA VERY soon. I&#39;d say no more than a year at most. Hell, it almost happened a few years back at the Superbowl in Dallas--luckily, somebody (David Chase Taylor) connected the dots and spoiled the Zionists&#39; little surprise for the Americans...</p>
