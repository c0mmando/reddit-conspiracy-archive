       The main internet backbone for this part of the continent is through a company called Level 3 Communications.  I used to work at call center that did tech support for the largest DSL provider in the U.S., they resold their services to ATT, Verizon, and almost every American ILEC. I had NOC access, and I can tell you that when the McLean VA. Level3 connection went out it wrecked havoc on the entire eastern seaboard.  What's interesting is that Level 3 doesn't have a data center in McLean Virginia, they have a "Government Team" located there: "Level 3 Communicationsâ€™ dedicated federal team, located in McLean, Virginia, is led by seasoned executives with extensive federal telecommunications and contract experience."

      </p>
      <p>
       As per Wikipedia, these are the Government agencies located in this area:  "The headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency are located in the Langley area of McLean and the headquarters of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is also located in McLean. The Department of Transportation's Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center is also located down the street from the CIA headquarters."

       Anyway, I figure whatever program CIA is running that it has to be larger than the NSA's PRISM, because PRISM works ad-hoc with backdoors and other exploits, this CIA thing however is centralized into the internet backbone itself.

       This was the case for the Internet in Britain, back in the 90s, everything went through either a London CGHQ/MI5 clearing house, and maybe some regional ones.

       the UK govt also has the DNS lookup tables under full control, during the first couple of days of the 'Charles and the butler' scandal, UK people were unable to access the popular US gossip websites. UK govt and the royals wanted their version disseminated before people could read up on the story from overseas.

       Even in the late nineties there wasn't the hardware to filter, store or process the traffic produced in the UK. There were connection logs tying a phone number to an IP, but that was about it in the 90's.

       Also, the DNS servers in the 4.2.2.X range are also hosted at this location, and a large number of ISPs in the US and Canada use them.  If your computer or router is using that address range for DNS, every URL you query via a browser is likely stored along with your IP address on Langley's servers.

        He saw an eye, a shape in the asphalt. "I knew the eye from the training," he says. To bury an improvised explosive device in the road, the enemy combatants place a tire on the road and burn it to soften the asphalt. Afterwards it looks like an eye from above.
       </p>
       <p>
        The soldiers' convoy was still miles away from the eye. Bryant told his supervisor, who notified the command center. He was forced to look on for several minutes, Bryant says today, as the vehicles approached the site.
       </p>
       <p>
        "What should we do?" he asked his coworker.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the pilot was also new on the job.
       </p>
       <p>
        The soldiers on the ground couldn't be reached by radio, because they were using a jamming transmitter. Bryant saw the first vehicle drive over the eye. Nothing happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then the second vehicle drove over it. Bryant saw a flash beneath, followed by an explosion inside the vehicle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Five American soldiers were killed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       anyone else think this is BS?  they couldn't reach the soldiers on radio?
      </p>
      <p>
       anyone else think someone made the call not to radio those soldiers?  and made him watch them die?  as like a kind of test.  is he hard enough for this job?
