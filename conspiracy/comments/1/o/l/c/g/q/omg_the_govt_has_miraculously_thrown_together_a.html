       We saw this deal coming.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1o53og/the_shutdown_seems_like_a_punishment/ccp05ke">
        I said it a week ago .
       </a>
       Not to be a sensationalist or anything. Just saying, I thought it was obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       [The following is a generality and doesn't apply to every single individual, please be aware that i'm aware.]
      </p>
      <p>
       Every week, it seems as though this is the time when everything will go down. But, it just doesn't. The system keeps surviving. Obviously, it's slowly deteriorating, but holy shit how much does it have to deteriorate before we get an end of paradigm?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm ready for this paradigm to end. I can't function within the public realm without feeling so leftout. I feel like i'm missing some kinda dream that everyone is having. Everyone I talk to is just so...dull. Like literally. If they aren't dull, they're usually socially awk. But, i'd take socially awk over mindless drone anyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our social life is erroding, especially among 15-30 yr olds. I've never seen such a degree of impatience and lack of urgency at the same time. Also, the form of humor/socially acceptable convo has become a blip. It's based phrases, quotes, short sentences almost as if we are texting each other face to face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Privacy has become extinct, yet every person is extremely defensive over their "private lives". No one is really honest with others or themselves. They think and say what others want to hear or others want them think. Because, if you don't, you risk ostracization.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, when you try to talk to someone who hates awkwardness, usually every reaction they have makes me feel awkward. Then, they think I'm awkward, when in fact, i'm just a sponge that gives the energy it receives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the point of my ramble is...well. Just to ease my mind and see if anyone else feels this way. Anyone else can't stand what social life has become in the past 4 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: wow, wasn't expecting this much traffic. But thank you to everyone that promoted solid discussion.

       Is there a way to push it through, and possibly ruin the higher up groups from profiting as much as they would if we waited? 
Or the better option, to stop it.

       Well its all just a game. "The Debt Ceiling" and so forth.  The collapse will legitimately occur the moment other countries (like Iceland) say "fuck the banks". At that point the dollar will no longer be the world reserve currency, and collapse becomes apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now its just a fear game to scare people into thinking "what would you do without big brother".  The shutdown, the shutdown of parks and public places, the shutdown of websites, the false-flag EBT shutdown... bla bla bla.  They are doing it statistically; to see who will ask the almighty government for forgiveness.

       Don't forget the NSA leaks. Anyone else think that is a deliberate attempt at showing peoples psyches just how much they can know about you. It would definitely make someone much less likely to spread and learn about these crazy ideas online.

       Absolutely.  They keep repeating "conspiracy theorist".  That started with Kennedy.  See before that word, you were either a patriot or a communist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since its very difficult to call Americans (aside from Muslims) terrorists; they have tried to put a bad spin on conspiracy theory; lumping us in with white trash racists and anti-semites.  I may be a bit anti-zionist, but I as well as most of us obviously don't hate specific cultures; we hate specific classes, very very different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I don't even think we hate specific classes.  We hate the concept of those classes; because they are fucking idiots.

       Agreed. Except I hate those classes because they aren't idiots. They are actually too smart for their own good. Anyone who benefits and profits from intentionally fooling other stupid (or not properly informed) people is the worst kind of person. Instead of using this position to make the world am amazingly better place (I believe we have the technology today that can drastically reduce poverty and end world hunger), they give tax cuts to millionaires and make sure its OK to invade a country for their resources.

       We don't have to dismantle the machine, it's eroding from the inside due to lack of proper maintenance and oversight. Eventually a part will break, the machine will fail and we will be unable to find a replacement. Only then will the people relying on the machine's output become disgruntled and angry. It will be too late to fix the machine as the technology has become obsolete and the last firm manufacturing parts closed long ago. Eventually someone will come along with a newer, better machine. After the first one has broken, but once the chaos has already begun.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will welcome this new machine, it will promise a newer better future. All along never realizing that they are all cogs in the machine, and it is really the operator that has changed. They will shrug and continue their lives because the machine still runs...

       I'll be honest, I can't wait for it all to fall apart. I feel dirty every time I get a paycheck and see $300+ going to the government in taxes, just thinking... I'm helping to fund this tyranny with MY tax money against my will, there is no win.. Only lose by living within the system.. Pushes me closer by the day to leave the system.
Also add in the absolute crushing stupidity of the people around me and their normalcy bias... Like a bunch of goddamn  sheep being lead to the slaughter saying WERE the crazy ones.. 
Plus add in the crumbling of culture and morals... I feel like a stranger in a foreign land, I'm awestruck every day by how much this country is fallen. Its sickening and soon enough I'll either be out, dead, or helping take it back.. 
Edit: terrible spelling on cellphone :p

       So true, the amount of irony is unbearable when people call you crazy because you are aware of your surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I can't wrap my mind around the stupidity of the society. Its not like the people are actually dumb, more like they are indoctrinated. You'd like to think its only in the public, and that those in colleges or higher learning are more aware. But, sadly, it perpetuates the paradigm and just creates more "normal people".

       John 3:19 - And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible is literal, metaphorical, and allegorical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The darkness means in secrecy, hidden from the view of others ( and God obviously as is the context ).
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is what people do. They rape, torture, and murder people in secret. They hide it because they know it's wrong, that's why you don't see people raping and torturing people in public.

       Sure, there are many public acts of violence but that's because people are inherently evil and their anger knows no bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is a bit extreme, I know, but I feel it's necessary to make people truly grasp how wicked people are.
      </p>
      <p>
       That all being said, yes, everything just seemed to turn to garbage the last 4 years, like the shitty switch is on full throttle and the stupidity level is crashing through the top of the gauge.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are dumb but the past four years of unadulterated stupid being ladled all over the masses has truly revealed how absolutely mindless they all are. "Hey did you like 'remake princess 12' ?" "Yeah, it was almost as sweet as 'breakfast with a chance of cupcake ninjas' !"
      </p>
      <p>
       How about "DON'T YOU LOVE EVERY COMIC BOOK AND 80S/90S NOSTALGIA FILM WE'RE CRAMMING DOWN YOUR THROATS?

      </p>
      <p>
       And this is why I vaguely pay attention to what's actually happening, don't care about the nonsense other people waste their lives with, quite literally.

      <p>
       Fuck EVERY physical award/medal/trophy that has ever been given to anybody. It all ends one day and is gone forever. It means nothing and it's worthless. Who cares what it does to your life when you live it, you still die.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens then, when you die, and your worthless trophy had nothing to offer you as a solution to that. What good was it to your life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your conscientiousness only matters if it still exists after you die, and myself and billions of other people all think in various forms that it most definitely does and it most definitely matters.

       That's really romanticist thinking. I dig. Freud had this same diagnosis of humans, said that we are violent and aggressive. WW1 proved him right.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, seriously get outta my brain. Everything from, "that all being said" is exactly it. You couldn't have said it better. I'm happy that someone else shares this perception with me. Everyone I talk to, even my bestfriend, has no clue or get pissed when I talk about this. It's been really tough living in both worlds lately. That's why I wrote what I wrote. I don't know how much longer I can do it. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, like almost as if my head will literally split.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is my exact belief, that consciousness never stops. It's my belief that consciousness defines where you go after you die. And that the way you live your life defines your consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if you didn't live according to God's will, then you wouldn't even want to be in Heaven. Your consciousness wouldn't align with the consciousness of the kingdom. If you lived a self-serving life where you were only concerned with satisfying the subconscious mind (which we discussed as being inherently evil), then you'll end up alone, in your hell. I'm not the only one who share this opinion, C.S. Lewis had a really similar allegory in one his books.

       Take this one step farther; How you consciously live shapes what happens to your consciousness energy when you shed your physicality (die). Some gods would like you to align with their frequency for whatever reason (known only to them).  Why is that energy valuable to them?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple disciplines and philosophies that can teach an individual to live life in such a way so that when one leaves, their consciousness energy is free to do as it will.
      </p>
      <p>
       So be aware, that energy of yours and mine and ours is valuable to "gods".  And if they find value in it then we should as well and be very aware of where we choose to place it.

       I'm right there with you, except for the "gods" part. Unless you mean Jesus, God, and the Holy spirit. The only God(s) I believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be pretty hectic to think that "gods" are looking to feed off my energy. Unless you mean ""spirit beings". I definitely believe certain spirits feed off certain energies. But, again, it's more of the biblical point of view.

       I use "gods" as a general term, but "spirit beings" is probably better.  But make no mistake, not just the God from the bible exists.  There are others.  If Yaweh exists then so does Odin, Zeus, Kali, Ganesha, and a whole bunch of others.  We should all be careful who we back.

       I see the indoctrination your talking about on a daily basis. I have teacher at my school (high school) that will make you feel like such shit if you don't stand, recite or even put your hand over your heart during the pledge and even make you feel like such a piece of shit if you say anything bad about the government. But then again with it being public school it's pretty much indoctrination camps. I really wish I was home-schooled.

       My guess is that so much has happened recently that it could be too hard to trust anything too serious can or would happen. Sure, news media has a lot to do with it, but I'm not so sure it really matters if you personally feel like you don't make a difference. Occupy was
       <em>
        crushed.
       </em>
       The leaders of non-violent protest organizations are murdered. We can't win. They'll always be a few steps ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, what do we do? What is there
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       do? Wait around for the end? I'll be damned if I'm going to live in a concentration camp. We shouldn't let it even get that far. Oh, but I'd be killed for organizing a huge congregation for change and the news would black out my name, call me a terrorist, and no one would know the good I've tried to do so that they might be inspired from my sacrifice.

       I dont know if its by one sole factor. I think by creating debt based currency. But, right now, its due to perception. Cause the dollar should be worthless, if you look at the numbers.

       What pisses me off is the fact that it is blantly obvious that we (the american people) really have no opinion at all anymore. The rich are gonna make the rules and distract everyone into thinking everything is chill. You dont know how many people Ive come across that had no idea about the government being shut down. Let alone what it was going to do to us if it continued.

       Still keeping a watchful eye. Call me anxious but I feel like it's near. The EBT mishap (read: test run) is very ominous. Once the zombies are in the street and looting it's time for martial law.

       I haven't seen the latest proposal but last I heard it was some short term compromise. To me, that's just procrastinating this situation until then (Jan).

       Very true, the ebt situation kinda scares me
      </p>
      <p>
       But  honestly, many moves since 2011 have suggested that an event will unfold soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly is going to occur is up for speculation with the constantly changing social perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, we will see the fed increase the amount of govt bonds they are buying.
       <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-could-see-qe4-135126762.html">
        I think a qe4 will be introduced before the end of the year
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some say qe3 is already unlimited. But, that's not true for the amount of bonds they buy each month. I think the fed will double its current qe package. This will most likely tip the scale and cause OPEC to drop the dollar. If the dollar isn't tied to oil, the perception will be lifted and other countries will dump it. That's what I see happening. Business as usual. Oops, we printed too much. Sorry guys, bread costs $500. Good luck.
      </p>

       But, you know. We have so many side plots going on that it could really be anything or a combination of events.

       It may not be quite the end yet but I feel like this year has definitely accelerated towards that goal. Can we get any faster? (I fear the answer)
      </p>
      <p>
       The apparent gain in momentum is a good thing -- it's waking people up. It's giving people time to prepare. No need to live life thinking today will be your last normal day but it's great to be prepared if it does turn out that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about oil. A lot of people think it's because "we need to it for our cars and whatever." Hardly, we need it because that's all our currency is worth. It used to be yellow gold, now it's black gold. Any threat to that is a threat against us and must be handled "appropriately."
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't necessarily say they are "side plots" as much as just part of the big picture. The Constitution is in their way, it always has been. They used to sidestep it, now they just ignore it. The moment you challenge it, terrorist this and security that. "Even if we save just one life it's worth the sacrifice!"
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the final piece of the puzzle is the fact that we remain armed. It's hard to be an oppressor of an armed populace. Again, that "pesky Constitution and NRA". They have learned the best way to make people give up their freedoms and liberties are to make them ask for it. Create the situation (martial law) and people will beg you to make them safe by taking away weapons and provide them with food and shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surveillance state is part of keeping track of dissidents before they become revolutionaries and organize. Thoughtcrime and all that. It is all about absolute control and mitigating any risk to the machine.

       If you've ever looked at the rate that technology progresses, you'd know the answer, and it's scary. I don't want to even consider the implications on cognition/perception of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, this current situation with the shutdown has gotten a few more people to start asking questions. For example, this thread looks like it's getting attention from people that don't frequent this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right again, the side plots seem to intertwine with the big picture. It's interesting to see all these seemingly coincidental actions that don't fit together, unless you look at them as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just your whole post, spot on.

       Yet, where do we go from here? Cause I don't think it's endgame just yet. There's still plenty of money to be stolen from the public at this time.

       Let this motherfucker fall, even though they have a new system in place already. We're not supposed to live like this, fuck the old paradigm, we've outgrown it quite some time ago and it just does not reasonate with me anymore and I'm sure I speak for MANY others.

       Ermm, I think if you're against the current system of perpetual debt and enslavement you would be more against them raising the ceiling. Raising the ceiling is literally just delaying an inevitable collapse.

       I AM against it in "principle" but after not working for nearly 9 months I can settle for just having a job and life continuing on as normal for just a little more. I have no money to my name. You think I want a revolution to start? With nothing having been done to secure myself from what may happen upon the collapse? I have been against the current system for a long time but I have a rational mind about it.

       the problem is you're tuning into the wrong things. disappointment comes from unrealistic expectations, so by changing your expectations you can become happier. facebook and twitter have created a false expectation, and my advice is to completely stop using them. go outside, get a job (any job to give you a feeling of purpose), meet older people, learn new things, stop worrying about what other people are doing or thinking.

       So, you think, "this is how it is"? Can't be changed? Just lower your expectations? That makes you sound helpless. As if you, as a human, only have value when you're working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying you shouldnt work but what is considered a job in our society today? Filing papers? Waiting on people? Many jobs are unmotivating and perpetuate your own helplessness. Many people can't control psych factors within the job and this causes distress, unhappiness, and helplessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why work? To buy items you don't need? Fulfill your unconscious desires with material items to express your individual character to others? Buy a mass produced good to demonstrate your uniqueness?
      </p>

       I don't wanna seem like I'm attacking you, but I don't agree with that mentality at all.

       realizing that certain things are not as you thought they were, increases your understanding of the way the world works. there's nothing helpless about understanding the way the world works. there's a reason i said "any job". creating art is a job, building websites is a job, helping people is a job. something that gives your life form and purpose is a job. work isn't about money, and its even less about what you said it is about.

       I don't know when it will happen, but as soon as the petrodollar hegemony ends the USD will inflate quickly and then the paradigm will be forced to end. So watch what the Chinese, Russians and Iranians are doing for oil trades. They're already starting to do some oil trading in Yuan, but we can't attack China, so we focus on Iran instead. Same reason we invaded Libya and same reason we tried to invade Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       That and central bank control are the 2 main reasons the US starts wars these days. But the gig is up, it's in the endgame.

       Exactly. China is the country to look at. They will decide when the printing has reached its max.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, look up BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). They have been phasing out the dollar and IMF for a while now. They plan on being completely dollar free in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next world war could very well be setting up with the fall of the dollar.  You have the US and allies vs. BRICS in a currency war right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't think Syria is over yet. I think it starts as soon as we think it's all over in the middle east.

       The theoretical BRICS currency was invented by Goldman Sachs. The fall of the dollar, the instability you're seeing, is all part of the game.

       As bad as America is right now, don't trick yourself into becoming anti-American. This is an anti-globalist struggle, soon enough America will cease to be their zombie cow of choice and we'll be left to collapse, divide and conquer ourselves within an SSRI-dependent state of nature while the game moves somewhere else (BRICS would appear to be the next game).

       You said that very well and put into words what I myself couldn't. I just wanted to tell you that there are a lot of people that feel that same way.
      Keep positive down to daily interactions with people and that will help. Other than that we, as a (and i hate to use this word) "conspiracy" community, or better yet, a free thinking community, need to band together. Because our voices will be so much louder together. We can do this.

       yeah, i get what your saying about how we just reflect peoples ego's maybe not the right word but what ever, makes me think about all the stuff Charlie Manson had to say about our society and how fucked up it is, he was right about our need to build a shit ton of prisons in a need to feel safe, when in reality most people live in fear a mental prison. Not saying the guys totally innocent but helter skelter motative to me is bullshit thats a conspiracy that can be on here.

       Seriously, though. If you share these ideas outside this sub, then you will get swatted by the hive mind.

       And, thank you for addressing derivatives (bigger than housing bubble that caused 08 crash). It's just banks playing with your money. Then saying, fuck you, we aren't accountable for our loses. You pay them.

       Exactly. China is the country to look at. They will decide when the printing has reached its max.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, look up BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). They have been phasing out the dollar and IMF for a while now. They plan on being completely dollar free in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next world war could very well be setting up with the fall of the dollar.  You have the US and allies vs. BRICS in a currency war right now.

       And I don't think Syria is over yet. I think it starts as soon as we think it's all over in the middle east.

       My guess is that so much has happened recently that it could be too hard to trust anything too serious can or would happen. Sure, news media has a lot to do with it, but I'm not so sure it really matters if you personally feel like you don't make a difference. Occupy was
       <em>
        crushed.
       </em>
       The leaders of non-violent protest organizations are murdered. We can't win. They'll always be a few steps ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, what do we do? What is there
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       do? Wait around for the end? I'll be damned if I'm going to live in a concentration camp. We shouldn't let it even get that far. Oh, but I'd be killed for organizing a huge congregation for change and the news would black out my name, call me a terrorist, and no one would know the good I've tried to do so that they might be inspired from my sacrifice.

       I'm right there with you, except for the "gods" part. Unless you mean Jesus, God, and the Holy spirit. The only God(s) I believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be pretty hectic to think that "gods" are looking to feed off my energy. Unless you mean ""spirit beings". I definitely believe certain spirits feed off certain energies. But, again, it's more of the biblical point of view.
