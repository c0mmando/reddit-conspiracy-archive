       I discovered this page when I was doing thesis research for a paper on the interpretation of Islam, post 9/11, and never left. I love it. I find myself spending 2-3 hours a day now reading everything you guys post. The one thing I don't understand, though, is why there is so much negativity towards the Jewish community. From what I gather, people seem very cautious of Jewish folk in power. Why is this?

       Those who are in the know, will use the term
       <em>
        Zionists
       </em>
       , rather than just
       <em>
        Jews
       </em>
       . It's like saying
       <em>
        Muslim
       </em>
       , when you mean
       <em>
        radical jihadist
       </em>
       . (Though most of the "terrorists" are CIA funded &amp; trained...) I can't really summarize the Zionist movement, you just have to dig around here before you lose the "
       <em>
        omigawd, they're all racists!
       </em>
       " reaction, and start getting the hairs raised on the back of your neck when you realize how deep &amp; ancient these Zionist connections are...

       That actually makes a lot of sense, thanks. Jihadist is such a broad term though, I wouldn't count the people taking up arms against the States, since the invasion, Jihadist. More so freedom fighters (though mainstream media would never report that). Do you know of any books or sites where I can get an overview of the Zionist movement? I've heard that term thrown around a lot, too, and never understood it either.

       That formed 25% of my thesis paper. It's amazing what you find when you just pay attention and understand stuff. That sends you down a rabbit hole, though, that I'm yet to emerge from. All from asking myself 'why?'.

       I think the best way to think of it is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       We understand there are christian extremists.
      </p>
      <p>
       We understand there are muslim extremists.
      </p>
      <p>
       We understand there are white supremacists.
      </p>
      <p>
       We understand there are black supremacists.

       Why can we acknowledge these simple truths in all people of all cultures.... except for one?

       Ryan dawson is one of the best researchers on the topic of israel, imo.

       He is most definitely not a racist.

       Whether or not someone is wiling to speak out on Israel is to some extent a litmus test as to the validity of their information.

       Israel has by far the most advanced civilian intelligence apparatus, this is where the whole "Joos control the media" meme comes from.

       If someone is capable of speaking out against israel, you can give them a modicum of credit on other topics.

       I think that the major problem is Zionists and that is the main thing to focus on but also that Jews can be problematic as well.  Jews are extremely into their victimhood and they tend to muddy a lot of waters which stops this whole Zionist situation from being cleaned up.  Some people think that Zionists are only a problem and when people say Jews are a problem that they actually mean Zionists (unless they are Jew hating racists).  Well I understand the differences between the two and that there are problems with both overlapping groups.  I don't think that every Jew is a problem but that as a whole they have enjoyed entirely too much cover for all of the bullshit that they pull from the trivial to the serious because of the whole Zionist routine.  I think that the two are quite a bit interlinked in the Jewish community.  Also Jews have been completely over represented in Hollywood and media, which means that even if they all have benign interests - their viewpoint is drowning out other viewpoints.  I think that quite a number of Jews don't really mind their viewpoint having a huge audience, and I don't blame them for that part but it has created problems.  As an excercise try to find a Jew who thinks that the Jewish story is overrepresented in society.

       sure as a jewish man, I'd love to...here's the problem, everything you know about history is a lie...lies parroted by your teachers, parents, tv, authority, all of it, bullshit....winners write history...the current remnants of "jew" hatred are ideologies instilled from the ww2 era. The most important thing to understand in this situation is that there is a system of control that exist on this planet, that control comes in the form of controlling the "scam" that central banking is, or in simple terms set up a false authority {government} and then no matter what, make sure your company is the ones that supply that country with its currency/money...It is a fact that the central bankers that are in charge of the world are Jewish primariliy, not all but most. The gangsters specialize in mental manipulations and rely of the fall guy tactic for maintaining control, they never play "leader" or guy in charge, even if they are, they always will hire people to fill that role, that way, they remain safe and hidden. And in a way the modern "we hate the jews" is a perfectly crafted plan by this certain subsection of Jew gangsters, who have been running this same scam forever. WW2 was used as a cementing of this ideology in the minds of people and has bought these zionist central banker jews time, it has done so by basically using the entire jewsish race as a decoy, human shield. By creating a "don't say bad things about the jews" environment, we create a scenario where regular jews will unknowing stand up and defend the central banker Zionist jews. This is very intentional. As a Jew I find myself in a juxtaposed love hate affair with Hitler. For you see there is very much a reason he has been demonized, that is because he is the one person that came the closest to shutting down the Jewish Zionist central banking families. Unfortunately in order to rally the troops of the times, it was needed to lump all Jews in the same category, and Jews back then like now, were used by the Rothschilds, Loeb, Kuhn, Cohens, Oppenhiemers ,Schiffs and all the other owners of the central banks as decoys. Basically Hitler had the 100% right idea to round up and exterminate these central bankers/masters of usury, but had the wrong method by lumping all Jews into the same category...There are many untruths about the "holocaust" ...for example, I have descendants who were in camps, but they did not die from being gassed or stuffed in ovens, the died trying to escape or starved. Both not fun ways to go, but big difference between being stuffed in an oven and dying of starvation because you are the last in order of importance to be fed....
      </p>
      <p>
       The central banker Zionist have a new major problem that they did not have even just 10 years ago, it is the largest threat they will have faced since Hitler, that is that Jews, such as myself, who are just normal "dudes" now understand why we have been held up to be hated by these scumbag criminals, we understand now that we have been used by these bankers, and now, they are fucked, because frankly more and more Jewish people are defining the difference between "jew and zionist jew"....
      </p>
      <p>
       and just incase you wonder whats all the fuss about with these central banks, they have no money, yet get to create it for "governments" governments "borrow" air {typed digits}, then you get to work your ass off and pay interest in the form of income tax to these central bankers...They do nothing, you bust your ass, they get rich off of you, you stay poor....it is what ww2 was about....Trust me, hell hath no fury like a bunch of hopping mad jews who have been fucked over by their own race. You go to places where jews are and you hear one thing lately...."what are we going to do about this Rothschild thing?"

       I agree with what you say about the central bankers. But that doesn't go far enough to cover the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews control the media, and for almost a century the media has been spewing out propaganda designed to undermine white Christian culture. As a Jew you may not find this objectionable, but as a white Christian, I do. Jews are 2% of the US population, and yet they are permitted to corrupt and undermine white Christian culture, simply because they -- the Jews -- don't agree with it? Well, they don't get a say. White Christian culture was created by white Christians, for white Christians. Whether the Jews like it or not should be irrelevent. It is not irrelevent because we have allowed Jews to seize so much wealth and power. Far, far too much wealth and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews have been so successful in corrupting white Christian culture, that over a period of decades they have succeeded in turning a large percentage of white Christians against it. They have disseminated pornography through our culture, they have attacked and mocked and reviled our religion, they have undermined the quality of our schools, but the most pernicious part of this campaign to destroy the white race -- and that's what it is, ultimately -- has been to brainwash white Christians into hating themselves, hating their skin color, hating their own heritage, hating their own culture, hating their own religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, it was Jews who created the communist revolution, which resulted in the misery and deaths of untold millions in the Soviet Union and other countries. That movement collapsed and failed, but not before the damage was done. Now Jews in the West have undertaken another revolution, very similar to the communist revolution, that has as its ultimate goal the genocide of the white race, and the emasculation of the Christian religion. In the end that may fail as well, but not before millions suffer and die.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet Jews wonder why white Christians have anything against them. You -- your tribe -- is trying to
       <em>
        kill us
       </em>
       . We have every right to act against you with as much force as is necessary to prevent this.

       the NWO is the corporate conglomerate, "central banking" is a generic term that encompasses all that "it" is, which is very much the control of media. To use it as propaganda and to spread moral corruption and filth, to manipulate the thought process, this is the way of the central banker. I have no defense against what you state, there are many Jews who are in the gang, the gang encompasses many different categories, health care{insurance scam} media {propaganda/filth/corruption of youth} pharma {the drug lords} and any other division that lays down the law on you.

       Jesus was Jewish. In the same way the people you are mad at are. Concentrate on the boss. Don't get caught up in the manipulation. You are being baited. Sure it all seems real and obvious.. But focus on who is misleading you and the one misleading the Jews that are upsetting you. That one is not Jewish.

       I hear what you are saying. If the top man of the conspiracy I outlined is not a Jew (and not even ... well, you know), yet Jews are still the officers in his army. They are the ones making the destruction of the West happen. They are the movers, even if one of them is not the Prime Mover, or Sub-prime Mover, shall we say. They bear full responsibility, on this plane, in this flesh.

       You have your own soul to worry about. If you see their evilness as jewishness and not the real source you are making the same excuses in yourself for yourself. I am not judging you although it might come off like that in text. Just saying we have to be vigilant of the deception. It serves evil for us not to see and acknowledge the source of it. We should have compassion for those people that are so deluded. For ourselves too for having given anything to it. Peace!

       Thanks for the insight as a Jewish man. I would suggest that they aren't 'your own race'.. Which is the final epiphany. They use real Jews for a reason. Because they hate them the most. That is the big conspiracy. It is ancient and it has to do with the whole 'choosen people' thing. Imagine if the highest order of Zionists aren't even Jewish! They aren't. So because of that no real Jew can be a real Zionist. They can only be misled away from who they really are.

       The ancient history of this civilization, the story of it's creation and it's end has many actors. Each must play his part. Goodness is a foundational characteristic we can all hope is playing us. But it's not misleading to point out the significance of the Jewish people when discussing the drama and how it must unfold. It's not suprising that we find the Jewish emancipation and glorification being mocked with a concentration camp named Israel. The bizarro promised land. Created and lead by demons pretending to be Jews under the guise of Zionism. I am not Jewish.. Or religious. I believe in the story of our civilization because it's accuracy. There IS actual hatred of Jewish people. The devil hates humanity and he has a thing with drama and God's people.. His work is obvious and literal in the place where he got his name. Just look at what Israel is compared to what was promised.

       That was very eye opening, thank you. If you've ever watched that 'Four Horsemen' documentary on LiveLeak it explains the mechanics behind the world banking system, and that it's controlled by a select few. I'm glad I know, now, that when people say "Zionist" that's who they're referring to.

       really the much more appropriate term is "central banker" that's what the real problem is, central banking, money printed as debt, usury...by definig a crime in the context of a racial thing, we, with great intent, get "confused"...please keep in mind, Jews may run the show, but there are plenty of lap dog goy who fill the roles as "leaders" for these criminals...Those who know who and what they work for, they like others, do it for all that money can buy....
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly in this situation is understanding that YOU! whoever  or whatever you are, are really the "problem"....what I mean by this is that once you understand the money as debt scam, you understand that all it is really about is having faith in the currency, the brainwash is that "government" is in charge of the creation of money, they are not as we all know now....so what this means is that a bunch of criminals have laid out a scam for you to "believe" in, and by participating in and having faith in the scam/money, you are the ones who put your own noose around your own neck....It is only because you believe in and use their currency that you are a slave to them...
      </p>
      <p>
       So obviously the key is to get everyone to understand what the problem is so collectively you can tell them to fuck off by simply not using their money anymore...
      </p>
      <p>
       unfortunately they have planned for this contingency and are now co-opting bitcoin to make it seem like the alternate currency to jump to....and they will probably win, based on what I am seeing, the assimilation process is going smoothly
      </p>
      <p>
       until you have a nationalized movement to have honest transparent monetary systems that are mentally{have faith, know is honest} backed by the people, you will have systems that are subject to "them" getting to the inside

       Nothing lasts forever, though. If there is anything that keeps me optimistic it's the Kondatieff cycle. No great civilization has been the exception, and it seems since Capitalism in America reached its age of decadence in 1980 the walls are slowly starting to crumble. I think within the next 100 years the rise of the next form of society happen. It just sucks that our generation will be remembered as the society that ruined the Earth.

       Let me start off by saying, I agree with your over all message, that being said...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Unfortunately in order to rally the troops of the times, it was needed to lump all Jews in the same category, and Jews back then like now, were used by the Rothschilds, Loeb, Kuhn, Cohens, Oppenhiemers ,Schiffs and all the other owners of the central banks as decoys. Basically Hitler had the 100% right idea to round up and exterminate these central bankers/masters of usury, but had the wrong method by lumping all Jews into the same category...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If Hitler didn't lump all Jews together, there would have been Jew-led covert operations happening within Germany on a daily basis during the war; disrupting the war effort, destabilizing the country, Hitler had the foresight to see that connection within the Jewish people and decided that it was best for Germany to put all Jews into camps/out of the country.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        By creating a "don't say bad things about the jews" environment, we create a scenario where regular jews will unknowing stand up and defend the central banker Zionist jews.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Except this mentality of standing up, protecting and defending the central banker Zionist Jews was alive and well within the psyche of Jews before World War 2. I have an inclination to think that they would even be proud of their Jew brothers doing so well in a foreign country, manipulating the system, using the goyim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you said,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trust me, hell hath no fury like a bunch of hopping mad jews who have been fucked over by their own race.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But who gives a shit about those White people, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is partly why you detect animosity towards Jewish people. You choose to categorize yourself as separate from everyone else and then you act insulted, surprised and guilty when it benefits you.

       Don't be offended because he identifies himself as a Jew who knows about hopping mad Jews. I would hardly call that separating himself. He's making a point about the culture he is from. Like you might about a characteristic of your culture. Recognize him as coming from an understood part of yourself and it'll be much less offensive.

       I give a shit about all people and all life. I identify myself as Jewish by my heritage as you identify your self as white, as we both should, for that is the truth about who we are. Some may act insulted, supprised or guilty, I do not. What I do know is that PEOPLE who are divided by the Jewish gangsters and their White yes-men will fail to rise up against the evil. As when it comes down to it, that is what we are dealing with. Evil. We must have faith in ourselves that we all want the same thing in order to trust one another, we must have hope for a better future by working together against this evil as a team, and we must have love for one another in order for light to triumph over the darkness.

       edit; Hitler was doomed from the start as by that time the central bankers had been well entrenched in America and already had control of the dollar. It was predetermined that America would enter the war before they did. All part of the plan. And the second that was on the table, was the second Hitler was already defeated, as well as Japan riding on their coat tails.

       While this may be true, I would assert that should the Zionist regime falter, many other religious oligarchies from different parts of the planet would be leaping at the chance for world domination. When we describe the sickness that is currently robbing this world of its spiritual and physical wealth, we must make it very clear that this is a sickness that stems from the innate condition of being human, and not one single set of religious doctrines. The Zionist regime is just the capstone of our current societal pyramid structure, and when it falls, others will rise to assume its position.

       well seeing how no one has more money than the source of all money, it's easy to buy out desperate people to work for you..."I got bills to pay"...very few people have the moral fiber to have a choice between eating and starving and choosing starving because it's the right thing to do...
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been on every internet forum since they have been, I have spoke the truth where ever I go...
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell you now, I feel myself to have a moral fiber that most men could not grasp, I say this because I was one of them, trained to take over the helm, I walked away from my inheritance, which is all of you, in order to stand shoulder to shoulder with you...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am Jewish, I am a carpenter/wood carver and I am the son of a demon, for you see there are several families beside the poster boy Rothschilds who run the central banker racket, I come from one of these families, my father is Satan, he is pure distilled evil in a bottle and I have sworn to destroy him.
      </p>
      <p>
       An angel who has fallen upwards from hell to the earth. It is said that Jesus, the Christ, was the son of god, sent to save you. I would say to you and others that I am the son of a devil and I have been sent here to save you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please do not take the religious connotations literally, I am a Christian moralist {do the right } thing, but worship no diety...But I do find the storyline, as it relates to me, as "interesting"
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I feel there is no one who has a better chance of saving you than I, delusional or not, I am an insider, I know ALL of the tricks, I know how they think and the tactics they use, I feel that I am well spoken, and I know how to teach people the truth about the facts. Beyond that, I feel it my personal duty to right the wrongs that the gang to which I once belonged to have inflicted on you, so much so, that I would willingly lay down my life for you or anyone. to fight the evil and expose the truth and to die doing so is the very least I can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your sin and everyone around you is that you have faith in this "money". I will die for your sin and try to absolve you.

       During the mid century or medieval times, i cant remember, people needed loans! you know for business and what not, to buy the new bread maker idk. however, most people were christian and int he christian faith you cannot give loans on interest. however in the juduism faith there is nothing about giving loans with intrerst. so thus, all the bankers were JEWS! and so peoplel got loans from jews and when people couldnt pay the intrest back they became broke, thus you have people on the band wagon of saying , DAMN JEWS! even though its wreally thier own fault because they couldnt pay the loan back!

       Some people, in their struggle to come up with a coherent worldview, blame pretty much everything on the "joos"

      <p>
       others however realize that Israel has done some of the most evil, racist, supremacist things you could possibly imagine and have been getting away with it for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       many of the awful things the US have done in the past years make a lot more sense when you realize just how much influence if not downright control the Zionist bloc has over US foreign policy.

       'Jews' it's such a broad term though. It's ignorant to class an entire group of people as something. Individually most humans are decent people, it's the ones who aren't that frame the negative interpretations.

       Well, again, actual Zionists like me will say that the viewpoint folks have is highly debatable, but the claim that they mean one thing when they write something else is just silly. Look at the sidebar. Where does it tell you to go to find out more about "Zionist manipulation in the United States"?

       They say Jews because they either mean Jews, or want people to associate all Jews with what they're talking about.

       These are, by and large, the "Jews" that we know and love today. They totally dominate Jewish culture both inside and outside of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the goal of the Zionists was not to prevent Jews from being killed - it was to prevent Jews from disappearing from existence via ASSIMILATION into Gentile culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this became a MAJOR concern - that Jews would increasingly intermarry, and simply disappear via attrition - melt into broader society. It is a major concern to this day, and the larger Jewish community continues to fight this "threat" through various means - FEAR not being the least.

       The one inspiring Jewish people to operate out of fear instead of love.. Love of life, their culture, their resilience, their history is not Jewish. Because that fear is the destructive and dominating force behind the growing threat to the Jewish people. Especially those in Israel. It's all deception born of hatred.

       So what was their goal, if not for the better interests of the Jewish people? Because honestly, post Holocaust, a state of our own doesn't seem like that bad an idea in terms of not having that happen again.

       Sadly, you fail to realize (or conveniently forget?) that the Quest for Zion
       <em>
        preceded
       </em>
       the Holocaust, and that the latter was a product of the former.

       Nah, I am aware of it. But Jewish people weren't surprised by the holocaust. That shit's been going on for an awfully long time. A state of our own is also a good idea to avoid things like being deported en masse.

       I get that, which is why I don't like using broad terms. Lumping people together diminishes the cause of the individual. Someone isn't a Jew because they're greedy, they're greedy and just happen to be a Jew. I think it's these vast generalizations that damage the conspiracy cause. It makes us seem like ignorant racists.

       It's a pretty important indicator. I'd question, if they are so devoted to making that distinction or at least devoted to not being seen as a group that doesn't make that distinction, why it hasn't been changed.

       Why don't you message them and ask?  If it is a problem for you, you should voice it.  I'm betting nobody has directly brought it to their attention.  I honestly didn't even realize it said that, but at the same time, I bet they would change it if they realized it might be offensive.  Not everyone thinks about the political correctness of what they're typing.  People generalize a lot, so it's more likely that it's a mistake in my opinion.

       The fact that there is a constant movement by zionists within the jewish frame work to overthrow, manipulate, and dominate non-jews. It's like dealing with a person that is awesome on one hand, but has a dominating split personality that tries to strangle you in your sleep. Many people can't see past that evil zionism to the good jews beneath.

       I think you're confused here, we are asking why there is so much distrust of jewish people. We are explaining that ignorants tend to lump jews and zionists together. The reason they do this is because zionists exist within, and use judaism as a 'human shield' to deflect attention from their evil machinations. Another poster has illustrated this as extremist terrorist jihadists within Islam.

       You're the one asking us to differentiate and stop being racist and this guy has just done it yet you're still dissatisfied. What exactly do you want? It seems you just don't want any kind of discussion at all with regards to anything to do with Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll make my position to you quite clear. I don't hate Jews, I have no reason to include entire peoples because of the actions of a few maniacs. It's the same way I wouldn't call all Muslims suicide bombers because it simply makes no sense. If someone is a Jew and they do horrible things, it deserves to be pointed out. It's not being pointed out because they are a Jew, it's because of their actions. And from that you can differentiate between hating Jews and what some individuals are guilty of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Israel is such a hot topic is because we know in the past and now it has a huge influence on American foreign policy. That needs to be discussed because things are being done on behalf of Israel that has a grave cost for the US in many different ways and the people don't get a say on those actions. Replace the 'Jewish lobbies' with 'Muslim lobbies' and there would be a massive uproar from the American people because what they are enabling. And it isn't just conspiracy theorists that talk about how powerful these lobbies are.

       These are mainstream news and even Jewish news reports about how AIPAC (Israeli lobby) were pushing America to bomb Syria. Nobody in the US wanted the government to bomb Syria so an outside country pushing hard for it doesn't seem like something I can vote on and it's subverting my democracy because i don't want it or I can't vote on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look at US wars in the Middle East, the biggest beneficiary is Israel as they've stated on the record they want the wars but they don't do it themselves - they lobby another country to send their troops, use their money and take the criticism worldwide for a horrible war. And on top of that, the reasons for the war are not revealed in a meaningful way. You have to dig around yourself to get a historically accurate depiction of what really happened instead of shit you hear on the news. It wasn't Bush's war, it was Israel's war and they got their sympathisers elected into the Bush Administration to make sure it went ahead.

       This puts every single person in the USA in jeopardy... Supreme court justices on down.  If you're interested in covertly operating in the US, then you can use the Mossad.  Their laws don't apply here.

      <p>
       Likewise, we can use this same rationale for doing operations in concert or "for" our "allies".  That way we create this nice network where everyone can be blackmailed and manipulated by having the other guy do their dirty work for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       No laws broken that way and you can provide plausible deniability.  Note that our government never tells us the

       You aren't aware of the actual space you need to go. Israel is a prison. It's true. Who put the Jews there? Who created the prison and tricked Jews into it? Made them scared and proud.. Made them build walls and dominate their neighbors out of fear and hate? Zionists. Again the Jewish people have been oppressed and this time it's worse than what Hitler did. They are told the concentration camp that is Israel is the kingdom promised them by GOD! It's physically in the right place.. But spiritually it is a concentration camp. That is zionism .

       The army is openly controlled by the Zionists right? It's not even questionable. They are the one's who created this modern Israel. Forcing children to populate their army.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the Nazi reign humanity still existed inside the camps. Love was shared, laughter, REAL humanity, REAL strength and joy and comradery was expressed and shared among the Jews trapped in that hell. How could this happen inside these prisons? I find it interesting that the characteristics you point out as signifying freedom are about protection and guns. You can travel, you can cross the physical borders but you cannot escape into real freedom unless you can acknowledge that what has been created is a very poor implementation of the promised land. The people who created Israel have stolen and hijacked what it could, should and WILL actually be. Building walls, instilling fear, insisting "Might is RIGHT!".. all lies that cloud the truth. Who decided that segregation was REQUIRED? Isn't that exactly what a concentration camp is?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Oxford English Dictionary (1989) gives the meaning as: "The action of 'interning'; confinement within the limits of a country or place."
      </p>
      <p>
       You know that Jews have lived in the land of Israel for thousands of years. Free to travel to other countries. Throughout history Jews have been oppressed and modern day Israel is just another example of that oppression. It's the most sinister expression of that oppression yet. Turning many Jews into their own captors and oppressors. You can blame everyone in the world for what Israel is. But really you need only look to the Zionists who will be NOWHERE NEAR Israel when the real war begins. THEY are the one's who travel freely because they wouldn't dare make Israel their actual home.

       Most of the Jews that were present in Palestine when the Zionist State was founded had NO desire to be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were uprooted from what had been relatively comfortable and prosperous lives in Europe and FORCED to move to Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself: Who wanted Jews to move there - and ONLY there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who had been working for half a century to lay their hands on the real estate, and THEN to populate it with Jews?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionists have got you into a bit of a sticky wicket, and the creation and maintenance of the snowball-in-hell known as Israel has made enemies out of most of the world.

       Ah, you are most correct. Israel
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a "concentration camp". Nearly half of the world's (known) Jews are there - surrounded on all sides by peoples that the Zionists have worked HARD to make into bitter enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Existential threat" is a part of daily life - and this is no accident: Were it not for the perpetual threat from exterior "enemies", real or imaginary, Jews would cease to be cohesive, and might tend to ASSIMILATE.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I mentioned previously, assimilation is THE greatest threat to Judaism. Should this threat fade in the minds of Jews, the hard-core zealots will do whatever is necessary to keep the fire of fear burning in the forefronts of the minds of their brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cohesion and unity of purpose is the backbone that has held the Jews together
       <em>
        as a people
       </em>
       through 2,000 years of Diaspora. It is their strength - this is why they reenforce it among their ranks, and work to DESTROY unity in those they wish to subdue.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Diversity is our strength"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Food for the goyim - NOT for the Jews.

       Why have Jews been regarded with suspicion and shunned throughout history? Do you think it's because people woke up one morning and said to themselves, "What am I going to do today? I know -- I'll hate the Jews!"
      </p>
      <p>
       No, it doesn't work that way. When something or someone is hated by millions in different nations over a period of more than a thousand years, it's because they did something for which to be hated. This is elementary, and shouldn't even need to be said, but Jewish propaganda had obscured this obvious point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews have presented themselves as innocent victims of evil white people. They have put forth this fiction for centuries, and are still putting it forth, even though they are the wealthiest and most powerful ethnic group in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, ingenuous person (who I am sure has no connection with the JIDF or any other Zionist advocacy organization), ask not why there are things said against the Jews in this subreddit -- ask why there were things said against the Jews for the past thousand years in dozens of different countries by tens of millions of people.

       You're the one spreading hate and malice in this thread. Throwing around all kinds of slurs and insults: white suprmists, trolls, nazis - what's next commies and terrorists, no doubt... STFU with this nonsense and read some of the posts so you can TIL about zionism vs. judaism

       I think it's a clever way of making conspiracy theorists seem like ignorant racists. Even the word conspiracy conjures up negative connotations within the public's mind.

       I give a shit about all people and all life. I identify myself as Jewish by my heritage as you identify your self as white, as we both should, for that is the truth about who we are. Some may act insulted, supprised or guilty, I do not. What I do know is that PEOPLE who are divided by the Jewish gangsters and their White yes-men will fail to rise up against the evil. As when it comes down to it, that is what we are dealing with. Evil. We must have faith in ourselves that we all want the same thing in order to trust one another, we must have hope for a better future by working together against this evil as a team, and we must have love for one another in order for light to triumph over the darkness.

       edit; Hitler was doomed from the start as by that time the central bankers had been well entrenched in America and already had control of the dollar. It was predetermined that America would enter the war before they did. All part of the plan. And the second that was on the table, was the second Hitler was already defeated, as well as Japan riding on their coat tails.

       Don't be offended because he identifies himself as a Jew who knows about hopping mad Jews. I would hardly call that separating himself. He's making a point about the culture he is from. Like you might about a characteristic of your culture. Recognize him as coming from an understood part of yourself and it'll be much less offensive.

       The ancient history of this civilization, the story of it's creation and it's end has many actors. Each must play his part. Goodness is a foundational characteristic we can all hope is playing us. But it's not misleading to point out the significance of the Jewish people when discussing the drama and how it must unfold. It's not suprising that we find the Jewish emancipation and glorification being mocked with a concentration camp named Israel. The bizarro promised land. Created and lead by demons pretending to be Jews under the guise of Zionism. I am not Jewish.. Or religious. I believe in the story of our civilization because it's accuracy. There IS actual hatred of Jewish people. The devil hates humanity and he has a thing with drama and God's people.. His work is obvious and literal in the place where he got his name. Just look at what Israel is compared to what was promised.
