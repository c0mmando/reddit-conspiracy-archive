    <div class="md"><p>It depends on the modification. People want them labelled to identify what modifications they underwent.</p>

<p>The ones that are most campaigned against are those plants which absorb pesticides and more importantly herbicides. People fear that crops with high herbicide content can potentially harm the tiny plants or micro fauna in your gut as your body is actually inhabited by countless forms of plant life that are needed for proper healthy functioning and those plants inside you are just as vulnerable to herbicides as those weeds the herbicide is designed to kill.</p>

<p>TLDR: GMO plants are engineered to resist and absorb herbicides which find their way into the gut and kill the mini plants inside that keep you healthy.  (And the microbiota of honeybees and butterfly etc)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve waited all month for someone else to say this.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t with transgenetically modified organisms (GMOs). The problem is with a monoculture agricultural system that destroys biodiversity, fractures ecosystems, pollutes the waters and ultimately fails to nourish humanity even though it produces more food than we need at a rate of 1 food calorie produced for every 10 calories of energy expended.</p>

<p>GMOs are just an expensive distraction that is supposed to solve these problems while simultaneously lining the pockets of the corporations who got us here. Just to drop a hint, GMOs aren&#39;t solving anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing really quick. There is nothing wrong with GMO organisms. There are many things wrong with the current GMO modification strategies. What they&#39;re trying to get the new genes to do.</p>

<p>The most popular GMO plants (which account for something 90% of the GMO market) are plants that have been modified to be resistant to glyphosate. A few milliliters of glyphosate will kill a human within seconds if ingested orally. The strategy is to make these plants resistant to this herbicide so farmers can continuously spray glyphosate on the crops to combat weeds. What happens after 5-10 years? You build up the concentration of glyphosate in the soil to such a degree that glyphosate resistant crops grown on that soil will have a high enough concentration of glyphosate to outright kill someone after ingestion.</p>

<p>Eventually we&#39;re going to start seeing people poisoned from these crops and we&#39;ll realize what a huge mistake we&#39;ve committed.</p>

<p>Or here, better yet.....Monsanto has a company who comes in and provides food for lunch and such and caters to their needs that way.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a lame excuse. </p>

<p>I would like to see all food labeled properly so I can make decisions on my own as to what I want to eat, whether it came from China or down the street, or is GM or not, or has been sprayed or not. In this digital age, its easy and inexpensive to do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting GM is good or bad. I&#39;m sure the answer is much more complex than &quot;good/bad&quot;. But those who choose not to ingest it for whatever reason should be given that choice.</p>

<p>Aggressively lobbying against labeling suggests that it <strong>is</strong> bad, and they have something to hide. Perception is reality.</p>
