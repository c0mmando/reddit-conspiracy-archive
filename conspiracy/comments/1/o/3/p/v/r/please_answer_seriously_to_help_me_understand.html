       It depends on the modification. People want them labelled to identify what modifications they underwent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ones that are most campaigned against are those plants which absorb pesticides and more importantly herbicides. People fear that crops with high herbicide content can potentially harm the tiny plants or micro fauna in your gut as your body is actually inhabited by countless forms of plant life that are needed for proper healthy functioning and those plants inside you are just as vulnerable to herbicides as those weeds the herbicide is designed to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: GMO plants are engineered to resist and absorb herbicides which find their way into the gut and kill the mini plants inside that keep you healthy.  (And the microbiota of honeybees and butterfly etc)

       Gut microflora refers to the bacteria that inhabit the stomach and intestines. There is no evidence of even algae or cyanobacteria existing in the microflora. What separates plants from animals? Using the sun to gain energy. Not a whole lot of sunlight where the sun don't shine.

       people want to have a choice to continue to eat food that isn't modified.

       also, until we can demonstrate complete understanding of genetic code and its expression, we don't exactly know how we're affecting systems.

      <p>
       a good example is the way we've modified the environment to suit monoculture agriculture methods.   sure they produce a lot of crops, but they are ultimately incompatible with the larger ecosystem.

       I've waited all month for someone else to say this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem isn't with transgenetically modified organisms (GMOs). The problem is with a monoculture agricultural system that destroys biodiversity, fractures ecosystems, pollutes the waters and ultimately fails to nourish humanity even though it produces more food than we need at a rate of 1 food calorie produced for every 10 calories of energy expended.
      </p>
      <p>
       GMOs are just an expensive distraction that is supposed to solve these problems while simultaneously lining the pockets of the corporations who got us here. Just to drop a hint, GMOs aren't solving anything.

       For the same reason German shepherds have hip dysplasia? It's not a natural evolution, so we should let nature sort out the adaptations to our chemical drenched world. It's a mad science experiment! (Didn't everyone do the nutrition mouse experiment in like 5th grade?) Feed a mouse GMOs, see the infertility &amp; cancer...

       Here's the thing really quick. There is nothing wrong with GMO organisms. There are many things wrong with the current GMO modification strategies. What they're trying to get the new genes to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most popular GMO plants (which account for something 90% of the GMO market) are plants that have been modified to be resistant to glyphosate. A few milliliters of glyphosate will kill a human within seconds if ingested orally. The strategy is to make these plants resistant to this herbicide so farmers can continuously spray glyphosate on the crops to combat weeds. What happens after 5-10 years? You build up the concentration of glyphosate in the soil to such a degree that glyphosate resistant crops grown on that soil will have a high enough concentration of glyphosate to outright kill someone after ingestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually we're going to start seeing people poisoned from these crops and we'll realize what a huge mistake we've committed.

       Once concern people have is that they engender dependency on large corporations, like monsanto. Some of their crops require purchasing seeds every year, short circuiting the usual "one generation's seeds give birth to the next."

      <p>
       Hurts farmers, helps mncs, creates dependency.

       You don't think GMO create is intentional?  They've been doing it for how long and they're just not getting it right?  They've been selling their mistakes as NON-mistakes the whole time?

       Monsanto "scientist" - Gaaa!!  When will we finally make a break through and make a corn that DOESN'T give people cancer!  BAH!  This whole time, all of my mistakes were being sold to people and eaten as if they were NOT my mistake!  How will I ever tell the wife?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or here, better yet.....Monsanto has a company who comes in and provides food for lunch and such and caters to their needs that way.  This company went out of their way to post a sign for Monsanto employee's assuring them they they do not use GMO foods because they haven't been proven safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       They feed a company who makes GMO's, NON-GMO foods because they're not proven safe.  What does that say?  Google it if you don't believe that.

       Organic farming is the only farming worth having. Most gmo crops are bt producing or glyphosate resistant, both toxic pesticides that harm our gut bacteria which causes harm to us and our environment. There are zero human clinical trials for gmo safety.

       I personally am not a fan of the patent implications.  The other is that I'm automatically weary when there is so much spin and deception.  My concern is that we don't actually know what, if any, health risks are associated because there is such immense profit margin on monopolized food sources that it's not much of a stretch that this truth would be buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR
Not saying they're poison, but can't trust the source so I would prefer non-modified.

       AKA - the Business wouldn't do so well if they were labeled.

       That is your argument?  A negative association is to be avoided....not remedied.  Not resolved or fixed but just marketed PROPERLY so that the real information is ignored.  Thus no labeling.

       Wow, you don't have to be talking about Monsanto at all.  You can speak about any company who does that and if you STILL advocate for that kind of action then you Sir, are fucked in the head.  You're saying its OK to play games with people's foods.  It's OK not to label because, "think of the profits lost!!!".  ffs.

       You'd allow them all the leeway in the world to produce cancer causing foods and you'll be all for it.

       That's a lame excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to see all food labeled properly so I can make decisions on my own as to what I want to eat, whether it came from China or down the street, or is GM or not, or has been sprayed or not. In this digital age, its easy and inexpensive to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting GM is good or bad. I'm sure the answer is much more complex than "good/bad". But those who choose not to ingest it for whatever reason should be given that choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aggressively lobbying against labeling suggests that it
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       bad, and they have something to hide. Perception is reality.
