       Who is "we?" Yes the public has access to guns but chooses to be complacent in their police force instead. Gun owners are far from the majority of society and that's the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, guns exist in America and are legal to own and carry. However, it's far from the societal norm. For most it's "they" instead "we" for guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       People ask "why should I
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       a gun?" Well, why do you have insurance of any kind? There's no sense in
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       owning and carrying a gun on you. No it doesn't have to be an AR-15 or big caliber handgun or a Glock with 30 round mags. It can be just a simple revolver or pocket gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society needs to stop looking at guns as a menace and respect them as a tool and weapon. That respect and proper handling should continue to be passed down generation to generation to preserve and exercise the 2A.

       Voting is an illusion of choice. Do you think if Romney won we would be in any different a situation now? We get choice D and choice R which both are corrupt (or will be) puppets.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to take the power back ourselves. When our legal and democratic means are broken we have no other choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drones aren't the kings of the battlefield. First, they're unmanned but not autonomous -- someone has to fly them remotely. Think our military is going to be gravy with killing their own people on American soil? Second, they're hackable and can be jammed (GPS).
      </p>
      <p>
       Kinetic weapons will always be somewhat effective. Even with body armor and armored vehicles it doesn't make you invincible. The numbers are also not in their favor.

       It's not a threat because of propaganda, not because our underlying democratic system takes away the power of our vote.
      </p>

       Now if you are making an argument that if we were going to do something like end capitalism through the vote, the powers that be would stop it. I can see that argument

       But if hypothetically we were to all vote 3rd party in 2016, without giving any indication to the establishment. Our country would change very quickly.

       Go read into the great depression. We don't need anything but popular support to change this country.

       Thank you for saying that Mookind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love this argument, because it fails to look at the bigger picture.
Yes one guy with a small revolver cannot fight a tank or an F18. However, a war is seldom won on firepower alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, drones can be shot down with shotguns or larger caliber rifles. So that's an easy one...
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, we could equate a battle between the Gov't and it's citizens, with the Vietnam War, fought between the mighty Americans and the tiny country (the size of Montana) of Vietname. The Vietnamese managed to defeat the Americans with a less diverse military, less power, and fewer troops. Here's how:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) They intermingled their troops with ours. This rendered the far superior American air power useless as it would have resulted in an equal amount of collateral damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Vietnamese chose the time and location for every skirmish. When they didn't want to fight, they let the American troops stumble through the jungle. When they were ready, they were ready... (look up the Tet offensive)
      </p>
      <p>
       3) They had the will of the people. The Vietnamese troops were convinced this was their destiny and this would make them hero's. The Americans, on the other hand, could not wait to get "out of country." They did not want to be there and as a result "didn't have their heads in the game"
      </p>
      <p>
       Sun Tzu writes about how much smaller forces have fought against much larger and more powerful forces and won. It has been happening for 1,000's of years. (Read the Art of War, then read a military analysis of the Art of War)
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you (and many, many others) cannot do anything to change the system is as a result of "their" brainwashing. "They" make you feel powerless so that you (the group) do not think you can do anything and just lay down. This is furthered by the fact that people don't see a need to own guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm not suggesting armed revolution. I am, however, suggesting that "they" know they have something to fear, and are trying to combat this by taking away guns, and making those with guns feel that they could never do anything with them.

       So you want us to fight a guerrilla war for the next 20 years on the home turf of the biggest empire that the world has ever seen?Why the hell would we as the American public pick a fight on grounds that we at best are simply going to fight a war of attrition with them.

      <p>
       Instead of using more effective non violent solutions. That have been proven to work. Want to bring the empire down? Stop consuming and paying your taxes. Bam done over
      </p>
      <p>
       If you truly had the popular support you're talking about to start a war. You'd have enough votes to change the country. That is why we have the system
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that the fight seems hopeless. But what you're describing is even more terrible than our current situation.........And will likely end with less freedoms for all of us, and a lot of dead innocents

       As I said earlier, I am not suggesting armed revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am suggesting is that "they" have something to fear, and they know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to combat their fear in 2 ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Getting rid of guns (obviously most effective for them)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Making everyone feel helpless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, voting is a sham called the "Illusion of Choice". Both parties are two wings of the same bird.

       Guns are a social problem and the only reasonable purposes they serve are hunting and self defense. Arming yourself to fight a civil war is not reasonable in 2013.

       Not sure if it linked properly but mass shootings are defined by more than 4 victims in a single incident. We have about 25 a year going back decades. In a country like Australia they got rid of their guns and haven't had one in a decade.

       I don't like the idea of prohibition of anything, it doesn't work. But perceiving a weapon as giving you power you don't have is something people need to get over.

       It is seeing this debate that is depressing to me when I think about it, your country is becoming divided, at least from what I see, I'm sure it's a small % but there are those who want war, certain patriot groups scattered across your country, not enough to do any damage but what gets me is how would the rest of America react? more &amp; more people are beginning to "wake up" &amp; while I can't profess to see the bigger picture, I do see a country whose history I favor, you were born with these very ideals &amp; then from creation you rose like a pheonix from ashes, but you are nearing your peak, &amp; the true disaster is your military is why the world is not tearing itself apart, everyone else is afraid of you, but if you were to have the slightest internal strife, that could create to perfect storm, a bad sorce but if you wikipedia "conspiracy theory" down the page they paint a grim picture, &amp; if some American can tell me in depth that its just talk that would be great because its sad watching my brother die.

       1) The US military/Government is in fact the ones tearing the world apart (Afganistan, Iraq, political assassinations in South America, gun running around the world, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Its very funny (to me, anyway) that you would compare the US to the Phoenix. The Phoenix is used a lot in occult "organizations" to symbolize the US. So much so, that it is even on the back of the $1 bill. In order for the Phoenix to rise from its own ashes, it must first be destroyed. Which is where they are trying to take us.

       That is why I said I can't profess to see the bigger picture, the end game, who benefits from destroying America &amp; the world? looking at 3rd world countries, especially ones we've invaded, it wouldn't help anyone for the US to go that way. So be that as it may, it's a depressing thought. &amp; I just figured wars in the middle east waged by America was semi-legitimately trying to stabilise regions with your usual corrupted officials trying to profit on the side. my point was if America falls, not that China is a bad country but there leaders have no backlash to fear &amp; would need say Taiwan to make up for losing america economic benefits. &amp; Russia would have no one to fear, &amp; the EU would see no alternative to using nukes in self defence, Pakistan &amp; India both have nukes &amp; aren't friends, &amp; I don't think I need to point out the obvious Israel &amp; Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR My problem is if America falls, the world will see worse than the "war on terrorism" &amp; fearfully in my eyes worse than WW2 if nukes are involved.

       The conclusion is guns aren't good for much but killing small groups of individuals, not fighting tyranny

       Please let me know what can be done.  The system is so broken that representation no longer works - the two parties who are really the same thing have made sure of that.  And if small cells of people so fed up start actually attacking government facilities and people to start some form of revolution, they will be quickly labeled as terrorists and more laws will be passed to oppress people even more.  I really don't see how this ends with anything but a downward spiral into complete and utter tyranny.

       If everybody just stopped playing the game, there would be no need for a violent revolution, at least instigated from the public.

       Whether or not the ruling class will sit around doing nothing as we stop playing their game, that is a different question.

       Well you might.  I guess you didn't understand the second part of my comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself, will the people in power just sit around as the citizens decide to stop working, paying taxes, and using their currency?  Or will they simply clamp down on the public even more?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm reminded of the following quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The illusion of freedom will continue as long as it's profitable to continue the illusion. At the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain, they will just take down the scenery, they will pull back the curtains, they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater.”
― Frank Zappa

       Violent action wouldn't change anything besides public perception.

       Guerrilla war is all about working down the oppositions will to fight you, and I don't think if anyone starts a fight over the core of their power base they will give up, this isn't Vietnam or Algeria.

       You're not understanding my point, unless they have public opinion on their side they cannot use violence against dissenters. If they were to crush a non violent movement with violence they would just end up with more dissenters.

       The minds have changed though. The American public are pussified now. They're all talk. Shit has been bad for decades, and people have fought so hard for gun rights.....to.....do...what? Have their shinies to be range queens?

       The meaning of "bear arms" should be carefully considered.  It means to point them at people, not to carry them.  "To bring a gun to bear" means to aim it.  "To bear on the target" means to aim at it.  To "bear" a weapon meant to point it at something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow the language has been changed, and now "bearing" a weapon means to carry it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2nd amendment protects the power of armed citizen's arrest, not concealed carry. And that was the intent!  Look it up!

       But realistically what are you going to do with a gun? If the government sensed a threat they would firebomb it with fighter jets. Do you really think that a few semi-automatic firearms could compete with todays military forces?
      </p>
      <p>
       This statement is correct for the times but we have allowed our government too much money and power in the sector of defense and now we have no way to end such oppression but through martyrism.

       I was trying to make a point.  If you give up before trying (oh well, they have tanks, might as well not do anything), then you have failed.  Better to try.

       Also, to compare/contrast, the Chinese protestors were unarmed, whereas hypothetical US protestors would be armed.  Also, the prevailing attitude of the military and whether or not they would carry out actions against their own countrymen would be a big factor.

       They have tanks and jets...  But how many members of the US military would drop a bomb on their own people? I'd  say worst case scenario it'd end up pretty even once defections started taking place, although the government would have the advantage of organization and planning.
