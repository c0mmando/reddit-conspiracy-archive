If the NSA/security state soft-fascism gets too much resistance, then channel the anger into a demagogue in the Tea Party and go for the old-style fascism complete with blaming minorities and poor people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>an interesting <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/tribpedia/ted-cruz/about/">article</a> from the Texas Tribune on Ted Cruz.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After a few years in private practice with Cooper, Carvin &amp; Rosenthal, a high-stakes litigation boutique law firm,Cruz, who had a “a strong desire to work in federal government,” joined the Bush-Cheney campaign in 1999 as a domestic policy adviser. He also worked with the campaign and the GOP on the infamous Florida recount.  After George W. Bush was elected president, Cruz was appointed as an associate deputy attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice. From 2001 to 2003, Cruz served as director of the Office of Policy Planning for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) before moving back to Texas to take up the reins as state solicitor general under Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, where he served until 2008.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heidi Nelson Cruz is the 4th name listed on the <a href="http://www.cmc.edu/rdschool/discover/boardofadvisors.php">Claremont McKenna College Board of Advisors of the Robert Day School of Economics and Finance</a> website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cruz, who graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in economics and international relations from CMC in 1994, is a vice president in the Private Wealth Management Group at Goldman Sachs, Texas. She and her two partners work with clients to implement high net worth portfolios across a range of investments and asset classes, including complex derivatives products, private equity, hedge funds, single stock risk management, U.S. and international equities, and fixed income.</p>

<p>Ms. Cruz began her career as an investment banker with JPMorgan in New York, focusing on international structured finance and subsequently on Latin America mergers and acquisitions.</p>

<p>In 2000, she served on the Bush 2000 Campaign in Austin as one of President George W. Bush&#39;s three economic advisors. She also served in the Administration as the economic director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council at the White House, advising the President and then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. She also is a former director at the U.S. Treasury Department and was special policy assistant to Ambassador Robert B. Zoellick, then Chief U.S. international trade negotiator.</p>

<p>In addition to her private-sector work, Heidi served on the Board of Directors of Living Water International, dedicated to providing clean water and sanitation equipment in the developing world. Her publications include the book chapter, &quot;Expanding Opportunity Through Free Trade,&quot; in Thank You, President Bush; a chapter in Exchange Rate Policies for Emerging Market Economies; and a Harvard Case Study: &quot;American International Group.&quot; She also is a Term Member of the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well now, isn&#39;t that interesting. So you have the husband of a major player at Sachs committing economic jihad against his own country. No wonder Cruz acts so confident -- he&#39;s only the tip of the spear. Between his wife and his father preaching that this is time to loot the economy for Jesus (watch the vid posted by purimfest_1946), you can see where he&#39;s coming from. It&#39;s nutty, but understandable.</p>
