       Believe what you'd like. Say what you will. You can't deny the parallels between these verses and our nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelation 18.
      </p>
      <p>
       "And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Does this not sound like america?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       8 Therefore shall her plagues come in
       <em>
        one day
       </em>
       , death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.
      </p>
      <p>
       9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
      </p>
      <p>
       10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
      </p>
      <p>
       11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
      </p>
      <p>
       12 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
      </p>
      <p>
       13 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
      </p>
      <p>
       14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.

       That's false. Dan Brown has perpetuated this false information in his Da Vinci Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       The canon of books was passed around by disciples and people within the church. If there was anything added or taken away, the people would've known. That's why the bible was a publicly published, contained lots of detail, and was passed round by people. If there was anything that wasn't correct, the people could be like, "ummm, I just went and talked to that guy that met Jesus, it's bs."
      </p>

       Dan Brown claims that the Christian leaders shaped the gospel to support their party. What is a christian? A follower of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what Dan Brown is proposing were to hold its weight, then you'd see Jesus Christ take sides in debates that were going on in the early church. But, you don't see that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, educate
       <em>
        yourself
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: that's fine if you want to downvote me and believe false info. As if Dan Brown ever read or even understood the bible and christianity. Just proves how much this world needs the comeback.

       I'm actually not informed by Dan Brown, but by The Bible As Literature; a 400 level English class at CSU; the professor was a
       <em>
        former
       </em>
       Jesuit priest.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was really very informative, and liberating. Look out for that Jesus fellow; he's carrying a sword, and it's double edged too; hell on religious filter-bubbles, let me tell you. ;)

       Don't blame the Word for the actions of man. The Bible says to kill the heathens, yet it is the Christians who are being persecuted and butchered all over the world. Where are the crazy Christians going around beheading people?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Quran says to kill heathens and
       <em>
        they are
       </em>
       . Why? Because their god is not the True God.

       How can you define good? When a gazelle gets killed by a lion for food, is that considered bad? Are lions then 'inherently' bad? No. Good vs bad is just another institution..
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you feel remorse crushing an ant? A living entity? Of course not, because you are educated to believe they are lesser beings who probably feel no pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just irrelevant details that have been said by humans since time immortal.

      <p>
       Without laws, we revert to our nature, killing things and beings hedonistic. Looking out for ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe education can change that, but inherently, we will commit what you call 'evil' acts.

       Are you thick? Or just not studying in the field? Cause, I'm a masters student in biopsych. You're misinformed. Freuds ideas are used largely by the consumer industry.

      <p>
       Sure, some think its bullshit. But, if its such bullshit then when do we have such a society obsessed with consuming to fill their subconscious desires? 2/3 of the economy is based on consumer spending.

       8 The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, 9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. - Revelation 8:8-9

       10 The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water— 11 the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       12 The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night. - Revelation 8:10-12

       edit: We're on the second trumpet. There are 7. The countdown has officially begun.

       Mystery-Babylon/Synagogue-of-Satan: Look at the NWO governments; look at their institutions; look at the secret doings of their prominent figures; look at their histories, look at their public buildings; look at their money, what do you see? The sorcery they use to build empires has a price that must be paid to the demons who do the work; and it's the people of the land, and the land itself, which
