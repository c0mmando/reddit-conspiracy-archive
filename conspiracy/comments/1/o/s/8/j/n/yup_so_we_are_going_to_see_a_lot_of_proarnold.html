<p>This is <em>very</em> much correct.  This is definitely part of the reason why we can&#39;t/don&#39;t come together as one.</p>

<p>For real. If Barack Obama belonged to a church that said white people were a race cursed by God an wouldn&#39;t allow a person with even a single drop of European blood in their ancestry to become members of the church, only to change those practices in 1970, you&#39;d have heard about it more than once. To be frank I think Obama didn&#39;t bring it up because he&#39;s not comfortable with us seeing him as a black man, only as a president, and up until now those things have been mutually exclusive so he tries to make his race as much of a non-issue as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I&#39;m a Californian and I don&#39;t really know what the fuck he did in office. I know he boned some maid or something. He called the legislature &#39;girly men&#39; then got blasted for it, and then I seem to remember him apologizing for using the term because it wasn&#39;t fair to women and girls that they should be compared with the legislature. That may not have happened, but it sounds cool.</p>

<p>He gave some death row inmates clemency, and denied a few. So I guess he supports the death penalty sometimes?</p>

<p>There was something to do with a couple days a month being unpaid working days for state employees. You can bet that pissed people off.</p>

<p>I called him the Gubernator all the time.</p>

<p>He wanted to start some environmental committee to fight global warming. And supported emissions regulations, etc.</p>

<p>Minimum wage increased a couple bucks at some point during his... governorship? Time in office?</p>

<p>He supported the legalization of same sex marriages, but only if it was passed in the legislature. (or something) So when the mayor of San Francisco tried to legalize gay marriage in San Francisco (I&#39;m really not sure of the details, as I didn&#39;t really pay attention when it happened) he opposed it, because mayors can&#39;t just sidestep state legislation. So he ended up both supporting and opposing various aspects of gay marriage, depending on the situation. I guess? That window of time where gay marriage was legal, he supported it. Republicans disliked that he didn&#39;t openly oppose &#39;the gays&#39; and democrats didn&#39;t like that he didn&#39;t openly call for marriage equality, and especially after that San Francisco thing. Or something.</p>

<p>People mainly don&#39;t like him because of the sex scandal, and the fact that he&#39;s the fucking Terminator. He didn&#39;t really do a great job, but that could be co-attributed to a hostile assembly, as well. But he didn&#39;t really do a terrible job, either? I personally liked him because he&#39;s a badass and there was honestly nobody else we could have realistically elected who would do a better job. California&#39;s got multiple personalities. I would not support a presidential campaign. If he even tried that I&#39;d break into his house and shit in all his pants.</p>

<p>edit: I just looked it up, and he supported some basic gun control legislation. Like requiring background checks at gun shows, and supporting the Brady Act. To be honest, I don&#39;t know a lot of people who really fiercely oppose the Brady Act. But then again, I am Californian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing, he&#39;s fucking stupid.</p>

<p>Arnold is a moderate conservative, with ties to the Kennedy family I believe through his marriage so that curtails some of his more right wing ideals enough to make him palatable for those who think the Teabaggers are off their rocker but also don&#39;t want liberals in office.</p>

<p>Personally I would vote for him if he ran on a platform of beating the shit out of every congressman, supreme court judge, and heads of each department in the executive branch.</p>

My comments were partially a joke referencing a bunch of shit you seem clueless about. 10 years ago people were floating around a constitutional amendment in order to make him eligible. This fell flat on its face because a few very vocal and aware people started throwing a shit fit about the whole thing, and he shelved it. Meanwhile Messers Buffet and Rothschild personally got him elected as governor of California, and they bid their time. </p>

<p>Now its back, and as you say, they are trying to re-interpret, but its going to fail again - because not all of us are as clueless as. </p>

<p>Also, you must not realize, arnolds father was a nazi police officer, and he has openly spoke of his admiration for Adolph Hitler, on video.</p>

I&#39;m a non-american (well, I&#39;m a permanent resident) but I would vote for Arnie in a heartbeat if I could and it&#39;s not based on any kind of politics, just the fact it would be awesome to see Arnold shouting at world leaders.</p>

<p>Come on, admit it, you know you&#39;d love to see him shout things to Congress like &quot;I HOPE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR MY FIST BECAUSE I&#39;M GOING TO RAM IN INTO YOUR STOMACH AND BREAK YOUR GODDAMN SPINE&quot;.</p>
