<p>Hollywood &amp; the comic book industry is predominantly and historically mostly Jewish. Superman isn&#39;t an allegory for Jesus. It&#39;s only pandering to the Christian base by loosely connecting superstitious dots and letting them think Superman is based on Jesus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. PBS actually had a documentary on the other night with the history of comic books starting with Superman.</p>

<p>Superman is actually based on Samson who was the Hebrew hero. Both Jews &amp; Christians are big on the guy whose hair made him invincible. Samson translated literally means &#39;man of the sun&#39;. Kryptonite = Samson&#39;s hair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the bit where he was sent down to earth, by his father, to act as an example to all of us, and that bit where he floated out of the space ship with his arms outstretched in a crucified pose, we&#39;re probably masonic things too. Right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was sent from another planet, not another dimension, or &quot;heaven&quot;. He&#39;s essentially an alien, come to save humanity. Does that sound Christian to you? The outstretched pose is basically a blasphemy; an alien imitating Christ. Everything in Satanism is the reverse of Christianity, so this is not surprising he would make a mockery of Jesus. The &quot;S&quot; on his chest lies inside a 5-sided shape, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tI9bHlF.png">where you could drawn an upside-down pentagram perfectly</a>. He is symbolic of the <em>Anti</em>-christ.</p>

<p>edit: One more observation, in Superman, his father (God) died. The True God lives forever. This movie is saying &quot;God is dead&quot;.</p>

<p>Remember how we were talking about symbolism? </p>

<p>Terminator Salvation (Salvation, get it). You&#39;re expecting it to be a story about a guy called John that has quite a following (not a babtist but remember, SYMBOLISM) then this guy turns up called Marcus Wright (rhymes with...). This Marcus guy gets tied up with his arms outstretched &amp; SACRIFICES himself, giving his heart (his love), for the SALVATION of all mankind. </p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re right. It was probably just a film about shooting bad robots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Superman has a pentagon on his chest. You only get a pentagram if you draw one on. I&#39;m not saying everything about Superman symbolises Jesus, the Dean Cain TV show was quite light on biblical references, but the Man of Steel film definitely is. Whether or not it is heresy to do that is beside the point. Man of Steel definitely references Jesus at several point. The crucified pose &amp; his age are no coincidence. </p>

<p>FTFY</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Masonic sun worship - <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/codex_magica/codex_magica22.htm">&quot;In the mythology of the primitive world, the serpent is universally the symbol of the sun...The serpent was universally represented by the sun symbol, the circle or disk. - Bishop Alexander Hislop&quot;</a></p>

<p>Superman Wiki: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman">&quot;Living Solar Battery – Superman&#39;s powers rely on his cells&#39; ability to absorb and metabolize solar energy from local stars like Earth&#39;s sun.&quot;</a></p>

<p>He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men.

</blockquote>

<p>Just one more:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He did away with the pagan priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem--those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts. - 2 Kings 23:5</p>

<p>that references Jesus in many ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It references the mystery religions more accurately, but you insist on giving credit to the Bible? I have yet to see you confirm anything you say using the Bible itself. For someone claiming to know Christian symbolism, you&#39;d think that the Bible would be useful to you, but all I see is conjecture and misguided opinion. Brush up on your theological knowledge before trying to engage in the subject, else you may end up looking like an even bigger fool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I think the relationship between Jesus and Superman <strong>is not a thing we invented in this film</strong>...&quot;</p>

<p>You tried using <em>that</em> quote to prove a point? Just amazing.</p>

<p>-Did good</p>

<p>-Resurrected</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to look for passages that back this up. </p>

<p>What I have done is pointed out the times when Man of Steel does similar things to the Jesus story &amp; provided a quote from the creator of the film saying that there is a Jesus connection &amp; that connection has been there for a long time before this film was made. </p>

<p>Not too up on early Superman but IIRC it was written created by a couple of US Jewish immigrants that used bits of the old testament &amp; bits of their story as outsiders in a new land. </p>

<p>Since Jesus was Jewish, I don&#39;t think this precludes Man of Steel from symbolising the life of Jesus. Especially since the maker if the film has specifically said that it symbolises the life of Jesus. </p>

<p>And that sounds like, &quot;if you see Jesus, good for you. but many people won&#39;t&quot; </p>

<p>He never mentions the Jesus parallel as intentional.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s compare:</p>

<p>Jesus&#39; birth was announced to Mary and Joseph beforehand | Superman&#39;s parent never got anything</p>

<p>Jesus was sent by his father from heaven | Superman was sent by both his parents who died</p>

<p>Jesus was born of a virgin | Superman landed on a space ship and was adopted</p>

<p>Jesus was betrayed by one of his twelve apostles | Superman... had no posse and gave up on life?</p>

<p>Jesus was tried and prosecuted | Superman.... got pouty and ran away?</p>

<p>Jesus was tortured and crucified | Superman... flailed around in space?</p>

<p>Jesus died and was buried | Superman still chilling in space</p>

<p>Jesus resurrected after the third day | Superman... still being useless</p>

<p>Jesus later ascended back into heaven | Superman never left Earth</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Superman is definitely Jesus. <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jksadegh/A%20Good%20Atheist%20Secularist%20Skeptical%20Book%20Collection/Parallels_between_Jesus_and_Horus_an_Egyptian_God.pdf">Nevermind that the Jesus story is older than Jesus himself.</a></p>
