       I don't know where you live, or what the procedure is in your state, but the attorney general's office has no such role in my state.

       I would bet that your mistaken about their role in your state too.  If you think the AG is getting involved in minor misconduct cases, your goofy.

       This is Illinois state specific. Some cities, like Chicago, have their own local internal affairs. The rest of the state, such as the large southern Illinois, have none. Any complaints are made to the Attorney Generals office.

       Well, if you say so... I looked it up and some of those counties have less than 10,000 people, so maybe the AG has a IA branch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would still say that most petty complaints are investigated in house with the ability of the AG to take over if it rises to the level of a crime.

       No, I used internal review once.. that cop who broke his own thumb with the force he slamed my friend's face into the ground was aked not to do that again.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a PDF from the justice department website, I think it was a newsletter a few years ago, it shows that police can be sued and that they are afraid of this.

       It's about suing in their personal as opposed to official capacity, so you just can't sue "officer jones, fiction of the state" but "mickey jones, the dick who sometimes finds employ with the police dept. and broke his oath while violating my rights for his paycheck."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also good to listen to rule of law radio (.com) they point you towards how you can sue the cop, his boss and his boss on top of that

       Right, perhaps we should have people with no background in policing decide if the police acted properly...while we are at it, let's have lay people review brain surgeons and every other profession they have never done and have no training in.
      </p>

       This implies 100% of cops everywhere are crooked, which, of course, is ridiculous generalization.
I know. I know. People in power are the enemy here. Blah, blah. Just saying: my step mother is a stand up gal bearing a shield.

       While the OP'ss analogy is not without it's flaws, it is not implying, in any way, that 100% of police are crooked.  It implies just what it says, having the entity that is accused of misconduct investigate the accusation of misconduct, makes no sense and crosses conflict of interest boundaries.
