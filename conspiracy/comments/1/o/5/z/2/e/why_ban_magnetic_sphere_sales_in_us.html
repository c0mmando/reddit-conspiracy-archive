<p>Now I&#39;m not posting here to discuss if the ban is good or bad, or outrageous.  Leave that elsewhere.  I&#39;m more curious as to -why- they&#39;re pushing so hard for magnetics to be shut down like this.  What sort of military or scientific breakthroughs require large amount of magnets?</p>

<p>Was thinking perhaps a magnetic levitation device for trains or spacecraft launch, perhaps the development of a railgun and it&#39;s ammunition?  Have there been any strange purchases for large amounts of land, or the purchase or rental of heavy, deep earth mining equipment?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was commenting on GrandpaSkitzo saying legos should be banned because kids swallow them.  I agree that any toy should be monitored by a child&#39;s adult, but can also understand ones that pose great threats being removed.  You can do everything in the world to try to stop something from happening, but a kid can still somehow manage to find the magnets and swallow them without an adult knowing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not thinking of just one magnet, or a single pack.  CPSC estimates about 175,000 units sold by Buckyballs alone (source: <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2010/Buckyballs-High-Powered-Magnets-Sets-Recalled-by-Maxfield-and-Oberton-Due-to-Violation-of-Federal-Toy-Standard/">http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2010/Buckyballs-High-Powered-Magnets-Sets-Recalled-by-Maxfield-and-Oberton-Due-to-Violation-of-Federal-Toy-Standard/</a> ).  The smallest pack you could buy (aside from 10 piece extras) was a 216-magnet pack.  The balls themselves were a desk accessory, meant for bored desk workers to play with and make geometric figures and generally just have fun with.  The only things I could think of that could use rare earth magnets are a mag-lev device, or a rail gun.  I&#39;ve been trying to do research on land purchases as well as earth-moving and mining equipment.  Started locally, but nothing so far seems out of the ordinary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how when parents make poor choices and give their children toys they obviously don&#39;t have the mental capacity to play with safely, we don&#39;t blame the parents for being retarded, we just go and ban whatever it is that &quot;caused&quot; the problem...  </p>

<p>The problem with the state of our democracy is that we cater to the stupidest citizens when they do stupid things and it ends up affecting the rights of normal people.  We constantly try to take Darwinism out of the experience of living life and all that will accomplish is creating a world where this stupidest of the stupid will determine what you can and cannot do.  Example: a woman backed over her child after her child unbuckled herself got out of the car and wondered behind the SUV when they were at the bank...   The woman admits she heard this happen and still backed up without checking to see if her daughter was in the vehicle! The woman wasn&#39;t punished at all, she was treated as if she was a victim and she went to blame the manufacture for not having backup cameras as the default method for reversing the car.  She even pushed for legislation that would require every car to have backup cameras...  I don&#39;t think it went anywhere but the fact that she couldn&#39;t take responsibility for her actions.  She even goes on to say how her daughter survived 4 heart surgeries and that she would have understood if &quot;god had taken her then&quot;.  As if it was god who completely ignored the red flags that should have gone off when she heard the car door open and shut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting idea.  The magnets to operate the gun could be electromagnets, and if the ammunition were already strongly magnetized then it would fire.  Just have to make sure the magnets in the rounds are always facing the same direction, every time.  Though where could you store rounds like that anyway?  I can&#39;t imagine taking a gun like on a naval vessel, how could you get the ammunition from sticking to everything.  Land-based defense perhaps?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why you use an electromagnet. You could take a piece of wood, coil copper around it, and have an electromagnet. It isn&#39;t very good, but it will work.</p>

<p>You want a round that is smooth, and only exerts a proper flux when preparing to be fired. It doesn&#39;t need to be magnetic while stored in the magazine. </p>

<p>We already have rail guns on aircraft and naval vessels. They perform the duties of a cruise missile at 1/100th the cost.</p>

<p>Now what would be the effect of say...400 of those magnetic balls being hydraulicly forced through 8 insulated &quot;tubes&quot; of alumina, by a mercuric solution? Would they generate more flux while traversing the tube? Would they generate something other than EMF?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They also ban a little toy called a Kinder Surprise...which is a chocolate egg with a toy inside it...probably under the guise that kids will swallow the toy...so these are banned for that reason and it is a good one but we don&#39;t want to live in a fascist nanny state.</p>

<p>These magnets and the science around them are fascinating and I think hold at least a key to unlocking future technology (that has already been secretly unlocked by the elite) and the elite doesn&#39;t want us experimenting with them in fear that we will discover more technology that they don&#39;t want us to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you can do with lots of small magnets and a sizable amount of mercury inside an alumina container, in vacuo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was thinking perhaps a magnetic levitation device for trains or spacecraft launch, perhaps the development of a railgun and it&#39;s ammunition?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes...exactly that. The problems with &quot;modern&quot; rail guns are that they are dependent upon the rail for, not only accuracy, but for propulsion. Blasting 1000 rounds out of a rail gun can cause catastrophic damage to the rail. Having a round that doesn&#39;t touch anything is the key. You need your rail gun round to levitate during the firing procedure. That&#39;s only 20% of the problem, but I digress.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing what you can learn at the right university with a $200 bottle of scotch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the thing about it, is that they&#39;re only banning the small ones.  The creator of BuckyBalls have the larger ones, Liberty Balls and Ball of Rights, to help fund their fight against the CPSC.</p>

<p>So if the government was serious about the magnets, will they tell them to stop selling these large ones too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that all those selling magnetic spheres are receiving heavy pressure from the government to stop.  I figure it&#39;s due to one of 3 reasons:</p>

<p>1) these rare earth magnets are essential to some technology they&#39;re building, and are trying to cut off supply &quot;leakage&quot;</p>

<p>2) they&#39;re dangerous, and our benevolent government is just trying to protect us</p>

<p>3) these types of magnets provide health benefits of some kind, perhaps to do with human energy polarity or something.  (I won&#39;t lie, this is what my gut tells me the reason is. Call me crazy)</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe the official story because of the overwhelming body of evidence out there that suggest that these regulatory agencies want us sick and broke.</p>

<p>What do you think is the reason, if you were going to throw a guess out there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not thinking of just one magnet, or a single pack.  CPSC estimates about 175,000 units sold by Buckyballs alone (source: <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2010/Buckyballs-High-Powered-Magnets-Sets-Recalled-by-Maxfield-and-Oberton-Due-to-Violation-of-Federal-Toy-Standard/">http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2010/Buckyballs-High-Powered-Magnets-Sets-Recalled-by-Maxfield-and-Oberton-Due-to-Violation-of-Federal-Toy-Standard/</a> ).  The smallest pack you could buy (aside from 10 piece extras) was a 216-magnet pack.  The balls themselves were a desk accessory, meant for bored desk workers to play with and make geometric figures and generally just have fun with.  The only things I could think of that could use rare earth magnets are a mag-lev device, or a rail gun.  I&#39;ve been trying to do research on land purchases as well as earth-moving and mining equipment.  Started locally, but nothing so far seems out of the ordinary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how when parents make poor choices and give their children toys they obviously don&#39;t have the mental capacity to play with safely, we don&#39;t blame the parents for being retarded, we just go and ban whatever it is that &quot;caused&quot; the problem...  </p>

<p>The problem with the state of our democracy is that we cater to the stupidest citizens when they do stupid things and it ends up affecting the rights of normal people.  We constantly try to take Darwinism out of the experience of living life and all that will accomplish is creating a world where this stupidest of the stupid will determine what you can and cannot do.  Example: a woman backed over her child after her child unbuckled herself got out of the car and wondered behind the SUV when they were at the bank...   The woman admits she heard this happen and still backed up without checking to see if her daughter was in the vehicle! The woman wasn&#39;t punished at all, she was treated as if she was a victim and she went to blame the manufacture for not having backup cameras as the default method for reversing the car.  She even pushed for legislation that would require every car to have backup cameras...  I don&#39;t think it went anywhere but the fact that she couldn&#39;t take responsibility for her actions.  She even goes on to say how her daughter survived 4 heart surgeries and that she would have understood if &quot;god had taken her then&quot;.  As if it was god who completely ignored the red flags that should have gone off when she heard the car door open and shut.</p>
