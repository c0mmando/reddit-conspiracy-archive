       Cancer research has not made any progress in over 15 years.  Is the ribbon only being used to sell products.   Almost every product seems to have a pink version.  Where is all the money going?  Is this a Ponzi scam?

       Yes, most companies do use the pink ribbon as some cheap PR. Your claim that 'Cancer research has not made any progress in over 15 years' is completely unsubstantiated though. The money goes largely towards funding research groups around the world, who have saved millions of lives in finding ways to detect cancer earlier; cure at later stages as well as financially support patients.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because we don't see results over night doesn't mean people are not winning the fight bit my bit.

       We haven't found a cure for the common cold yet we find a way to lessen the effects of restless leg syndrome and whatever else disease they want to make up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what op means is why don't we have a cure for it yet when trillions of dollars have gone to these things. I am with him on this and I know we can't expect a cure overnight but think about this what is the hold up can't be lack of funding.

       Because we don't

       how to cure it. It is as simple as that, if it were just a matter of money then some conglomerate would just fund the cure and sell it privately at $5,000 a pill, we know they are evil enough to do it. The reason they don't is because it is a lot more complicated than throwing millions at some scientists and expecting results.

       I don't buy that for a second they know how to cure it but it is more profitable to make it last longer and bleed a family dry with false hopes and radical procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason they don't just sell the cure is cause people would know about it and demand it then when they didn't get it all hell would break lose knowing there was a real cure for everyone would piss everyone in the world off if you didn't make it avaible

       That's complete conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) You don't think there is a financial gain in becoming the first 'scientist' to cure cancer? Instantly, overnight, you become as rich as you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why would a government, lets say the UK government who fund the NHS billions each year in treating cancer, hide it if they have a cure for it? It would save them
       <em>
        TRILLIONS

       Like I said it would have to be available to everyone everywhere just like the cure for aids it is out there. Maybe this sub is getting to me but we put a goddamn man on the fucking moon made with computers that have less abilty then my cell phone I got now.  We cloned a sheep for fucks sake and yet we can't cure these things.

       I have thought about it, maybe not in America but in England it would be financial suicide to suppress a cure. Just think how much medical bills, paid for by the government, would be reduced if they found a cure? Can you give me one possible reason the British government would wish to spend billions each year on something they supposedly have a cure for?

       Because a middle class that is able to be reminded they are mortal and live in fear of everything are able to be controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       It works here in the usa too. Hell they have more fucking cameras then people in London it seems. The powers that be have to keep reminding you that you can die at any moment and if they made it known there was a cure for cancer it would be the start to them losing control. That is what it is all about it isn't money it is about control and who has it and who doesn't.

       It's going to the same place where all the money goes.  You know, all the money from the AIDS benefit galas and Live Aid and Tsunami Relief and text here to save Haiti and help the Sandy victims and Katrina victims and 9/11 families and Sandy Hook families and the Boston bombing amputees.
