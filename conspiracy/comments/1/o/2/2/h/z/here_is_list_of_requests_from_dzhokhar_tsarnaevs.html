<p>EDIT - Add details re SAMs
Tsarnaev is also under restrictive Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) - his attorneys are fighting these also as being unlawful and unconstitutional - so restrictive it makes them impossible to prepare his case and keeping him totally isolated with almost no human contact since August 27</p>

<p>I now have to wait 10 minutes between posts because people who didn&#39;t like what I have to say downvoted me past the subreddit&#39;s threshold, so my posts are now being censored (my posts are being censored on a conspiracy forum... isn&#39;t that a conspiracy!). I&#39;d love to debate why random blogs comparing three frames of a video is gasping for straws and the conclusions random blogs reach with three video frames is incorrect, but that is not possible on this subreddit because the downvote buttion == the disagree button. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a huge gap between saying &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; and &quot;a fake crime followed by a fake trial.&quot; Most of the evidence is still under seal and we only have rumors of it, but there was clearly a bombing where people died and many more were injured. There&#39;s no basis for claiming that a trial that hasn&#39;t taken place yet is fake.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If the explosives are of the same type as those used at the marathon bombing, that&#39;s actually very, very good evidence. The fact that they carjacked someone at gunpoint and allegedly told the victim that they were the ones responsible is evidence, too.</p>

<p>Obviously no matter what I tell you, you&#39;ll tell me &quot;thats not evidence,&quot; so I&#39;m not even going to bother. </p>

<p>Edited:</p>

<p>Since my posts are being censored, there appears to be confusion as to this post. I&#39;m not a federal prosecutor, I don&#39;t have all the evidence they&#39;re using to prove his guilt. A lot of evidence was never released (standard practice in lots of trials), so I really can&#39;t answer that question. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.viralread.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Martin_Richard_Suspect_Bombing_Boston_Marathon.jpg">This is by far the best thing the public has to answer your question.</a> The photo showing the bomber carrying the same backpack used in the blast, moments before the explosion, appearing to be ready to drop the backpack, at the exact spot of the blast. Does this not count as evidence (on top of the home and dorm filled with bomb-making materials, instructions for bomb making, guns etc etc)? I&#39;m really confused as to where people are getting this &quot;there is NO evidence&quot; claim from. Obviously you&#39;re not going to have a murder weapon with fingerprints on it because, guess what, that weapon is in billions of pieces. </p>

<p>If someone is caught on a security camera entering an office building with a large backpack, leaves 2 minutes later with no backpack, and then the building blows up one minute later, is that really not enough evidence to suspect him of doing the bombing (and then finding bomb-making materials at his home consistent with the bomb used at the office building, along with guns and recipies on bomb making). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you&#39;re accusing someone of murdering and injuring tens of people, yes I&#39;m going to require some proof.</p>

<p>Proving a negative is futile hence why our system of justice is (supposedly) innocent <em>unless</em> proven guilty.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s your proof other than a bunch of police chasing two kids in car? Sure, maybe the kids were armed, still doesn&#39;t link them to the Marathon. Yes, there may be evidence they were present at the marathon with backpacks, still doesn&#39;t make them guilty.</p>

<p>Now one is dead and the other can&#39;t speak and has been kept tucked away. Dead and mute men tell no tales. Wouldn&#39;t matter anyways, the media and government have already painted them guilty beyond any defense at this point.</p>

<p>Look at the Zimmerman trial for reference of this effect. The media portrayed him as a racist just looking to commit a hate crime. When the actual trial took place it became very clear that it was self defense. Unfortunately there will be no real trial for these two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally agree with your statement that we should withhold judgement before the trial. But this case is unique in that a lot of the evidence linking these guys to the bombings has already been made public.</p>

<p>There are photos of them bringing backpacks backpacks to the bomb sites shortly before the blasts. victims identified the bomber as having left the bags which exploded. After they were id&#39;d they murdered a cop and hijacked a car and admitted they were the bombers to the driver. They got into a shoot out with cops and we&#39;re found to have more bombs. and finally the surviving one admitted to the police that he did it.</p>

<p>I would say given the evidence that it&#39;s highly unlikely that they are innocent.</p>

<p>The fact that they have <a href="http://www.viralread.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Martin_Richard_Suspect_Bombing_Boston_Marathon.jpg">photos of them walking RIGHT by the blast site moments before the explosion appearing to put the same type of backpack used in the bombing down at the exact spot where the explosions occurred?</a> You make it sound like the photos they have show them standing innocently in the crowd an hour before the bombings. That&#39;s just not true, so I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re getting  &quot;there&#39;s no evidence&quot; from. </p>

<p>Obviously you&#39;re not going to have solid evidence like a murder weapon or fingerprints because, you know, those got blown into billions of pieces. So what would you even consider sufficient evidence in this case? Can everyone just get away with setting bombs off because there will be no fingerprints or murder weapon? </p>

<p>what spot is that exactly?  the black patch on the ground close to the blown out window or the spot where people appeared to be injured.. there&#39;s some discrepancy here.</p>

<p>people close to the &#39;blast point&#39; were fine, until they came and applied moulage.  it&#39;s all on film.  frame by frame showing the deception in progress.  even your &#39;acting director of homeland security&#39; is on the scene directing action.  how convenient.</p>

<p>A high def camera mounted 300 feet away from the bast site isn&#39;t going to pick up tiny BB pellets. Not to mention when the bomb goes off those tiny BB pellets are going to go flying hundreds of feet, not stick around less than a foot away from the blast site. </p>

<p>Because, you know, people don&#39;t magically expel all the blood in their bodies the second the blast happens. There is something called bleeding.

<p>This guy was stopped because he looked like Tsarnaev. He was released when they confirmed that it wasn&#39;t Tsarnaev. How do we know it wasn&#39;t Tsarnaev? Because Tsarnaev had already been shot when this guy was detained and Tsarnaev was declared dead at a hospital while this guy was still being detained at the scene.</p>
