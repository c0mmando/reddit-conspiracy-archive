<p>No, because we all know anti-semite means &quot;Jew hater,&quot; that&#39;s entirely how it&#39;s been used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#cite_ref-13">since its inception as a term in 1860</a> and if you consult <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+antisemite">literally any dictionary whatsoever</a> as to the meaning of the term you&#39;ll find that it refers to someone who hates Jews.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t get this line of argument / inquiry when it so often crops up. If it makes you happy let&#39;s pretend that I said the cartoon is blatantly anti-Jew, does that make you happier?</p>

<p>Furthermore the 9/11 commission report isn&#39;t scapegoating all Saudis and suggesting they&#39;re responsible for all of society&#39;s ills, which would be more in keeping with the tone of the linked cartoon if we are to suggest the report is anti-semitic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great! A little fucking holocaust denial to liven up my morning! TIL the Jews were systematically exterminated by Hitler&#39;s regime because they were the &quot;enemy inside the gates.&quot; Also antisemitism didn&#39;t really exist until the Jews &quot;declared war&quot; on Germany, even though god damn fucking Mein Kampf, which you no doubt have read, was written in 1926 and makes no secret that Hitler saw Jews as a parasite to be exterminated and was <em>incredibly</em> well received and responsible for Hitler&#39;s popular support. </p>

<p>This video is despicable, it&#39;s just regurgitating the <strong>Antisemitic</strong> (oh no! I said it!) bullshit lies that bigots happily lap up because it justifies their bullshit bigoted hatred. It could only really be seriously entertained by an idiot or produced by an intellectually dishonest sympathizer of Nazi Germany.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://youtu.be/fh_wrJ7sjYI?t=12m34s">Here you go</a> for his claim that the Jews were the &quot;enemy inside the gates.&quot; &quot;This declaration of war was Jewish initiative and the reason why the Jews of Europe were later herded into concentration camps.&quot;</p>

<p>So it&#39;s their fault, huh? Never mind that it wasn&#39;t a very effective boycott and wasn&#39;t universally adhered to by German Jews. No mention of <em>why</em> such a boycott was called for. I&#39;m sure the Nazis were just minding their own business, right? Not, you know, <a href="http://youtu.be/L34R19bcxEc">calling for the extermination of the Jewish race</a> or anything like that. </p>

<p>&quot;Today with no mention of the context the <em>not unreasonable fears</em> of the Germans are denigrated as being Anti-Semitic, pure and simple.&quot; (emphasis mine)</p>

<p>Yup. Okay. Totally reasonable fears there. The Nazis were just acting self-defense, right? And I bet you actually believe that.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/fh_wrJ7sjYI?t=12m8s">&quot;International Jewry&quot;</a> hmm that almost sounds like it&#39;s taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_Jew">this</a> antisemitic piece of trash published by America&#39;s most-loved Nazi sympathizer, Henry Ford. Nah, I&#39;m sure that particular turn of phrase is just an unfortunate coincidence.</p>

<p>Well now you&#39;ve gotten me to waste more time on this transparent piece of propaganda made by the same guy <a href="http://www.opinion-maker.org/2011/05/anthony-lawson-speaks-his-mind/">who said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it seems that there is no solid evidence that Germany put in train a plan to systematically murder Jews using gas chambers. I have no doubt that some Germans were as cruel as some of those bombing-raid planners, and that a lot of unnecessary deaths resulted from that cruel streak, which seems to show itself in so many humans, but I do not think that the facts support the planned systematic- extermination scenario that the ever-growing number of Holocaust museums claim was perpetrated by the Germans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you have it, the Nazis are just misunderstood, they fought back against the &quot;international Jew&quot; that declared war on <em>them</em>, and they totally didn&#39;t implement systematic genocide, and that all means that <em>basically Hitler&#39;s transparently moronic rhetoric was actually right</em>. Nope I don&#39;t see how someone could misconstrue this stance as that of a neo-nazi or anything. </p>

<p>It&#39;s probably not a good idea to make any assumptions about what I believe. Think about what you actually know about me other than a video link I&#39;ve provided for dissemination.</p>

<p>My take on the entire subject can be summarized briefly as &quot;generally confused&quot;. It would seem of all the atrocities committed throughout history that it is only <em>this one</em> that is forbidden to study, examine, scrutinize, or even question. It&#39;s been quite a while since I actually watched the video I linked but I recall one of the most striking points made was the fact that this incident in particular is literally the <strong>only</strong> historical event to have legal ramifications in certain nation states that are otherwise quite liberal.</p>

<p>It is the taboo nature of the study and/or discussion that intrigues me, not the establishment of empirical fact of whether or not it took place.</p>

<p>Now if you&#39;ll excuse me I have more pressing matters to tend to.</p>

<p>Can you explain to me what you mean by that? Sure there is a circlejerk going on over there just like any other sub but I have not seen any insecurity/fear there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Statism is a lot like religion. They don&#39;t like ideas that are contrary to their preconceived notions of reality, politics, social constructs and the true mechanisms that shape them. The organized down voting conducted by that sub derives from a longing for the legitimacy of state doctrine because the alternative is mighty unsettling.</p>

<p>P.S. what happens when we talk in deleted threads?  Is it like a little chat channel or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, explains a lot doesn&#39;t it? Ever wonder when there&#39;s these bitter, combative, cruel people hanging around a subreddit they vocally hate- who the fuck are these weirdos? Why are they hanging around a conspiracy site just to scream about how people who buy into conspiracies are insane? Apparently, somehow, they derive some joy out of doing so. Surprised me too, and if anyone can explain the motivation, beyond sadism...scratch that, don&#39;t bother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re hardly sadistic or bullying, they&#39;re just sarcastic and sardonic and almost always pick the low hanging fruit for use as a vehicle to discredit the entirety of the content within the sub. It is quite rare to find a well heeled purveyor of state doctrine who can hold their own in a proper debate. They will almost immediately employ transparent straw man and ad hom before tucking tail</p>
