<p>The United States Supreme Court has not hesitated to interpret the word “income,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You;&#39;re right. They haven&#39;t:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lucas v. Earl, 281 U.S. 111 (1930) - &quot;The claim that salaries, wages, and compensation for personal services are to be taxed as an entirety and therefore must be returned by the individual who has performed the services which produce the gain is without support, either in the language of the Act or in the decisions of the courts construing it... It is to be noted that, by the language of the Act, <strong>it is not salaries, wages, or compensation for personal services that are to be included in gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal services.</strong>&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conner v. U.S., 303 F Supp. 1187 (1969) - &quot;... whatever may constitute income, therefore, must have the essential feature of gain to the recipient. This was true when the 16th Amendment became effective, it was true at the time of Eisner v. Macomber Supra, it was true under Section 22(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1938, and it is likewise true under Section 61(a) of the I.R.S. Code of 1954. If there is not gain, there is not income ... Congress has taxed income not compensation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is a clear distinction between &#39;profit&#39; and &#39;wages&#39;, or a compensation for labor. Compensation for labor (wages) cannot be regarded as profit within the meaning of the law. The word `profit&#39;, as ordinarily used, means the gain made upon any business or investment- - - a different thing altogether from the mere compensation for labor.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Merchant&#39;s Loan &amp; Trust Company v. Smietanka 255 US 509 (1921) - &quot;It is obvious that these decisions in principle rule the case at bar if the word &#39;income&#39; has the same meaning as the Income Tax Act of 1913 that it had in the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, and that it has the same scope of meaning was in effect decided in Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 330, 335, where it was assumed for the purposes of decision that there was no difference in its meaning as used in the Act of 1909 and in the Income Tax Act of 1913. There can be no doubt that the word must be given the same meaning and content in the Income Tax Acts of 1916 and 1917 that it had in the Act of 1913. When to this we add that in Eisner v. Macomber, Supra, arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, with the addition that it should include &#39;profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets,&#39; there would seem to be no room to doubt that the word must be given the same meaning in all of the Income Tax Acts of Congress that was given to it in the Corporation Excise Tax Act and that what that meaning is has now become definitely settled by decisions of this court.” [Corporate profit]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Staples v. U.S., 21 F Supp 737 U.S. Dist. Ct. ED PA, (1937) - &quot;Income within the meaning of the 16th Amendment and the Revenue Act means, <strong>gain ... and, in such connection, gain means profit</strong>... proceeding from property severed from capital, however invested or employed and coming in, received or drawn by the taxpayer for his separate use, benefit and disposal.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oliver v. Halstead, 196 VA 992; 86 S.E. Rep 2nd 85e9 (1955) - &quot;There is a clear distinction between &#39;profit&#39; and &#39;wages&#39;, or a compensation for labor.

<p>&quot;Income&quot; has been repeatedly defined by the Supreme Court as corporate profit and not an individual&#39;s compensation for services.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In addition, the Code explicitly defines “gross income”, from which taxable income is computed, as including compensation for services, i.e., wages.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is absolutely not true. It&#39;s not &quot;including compensation&quot;. It&#39;s <em>derived from</em> compensation. Let&#39;s assume what you say is true about the definition of &quot;income&quot;. If one has received $100 compensation for services, how could one <em>derive</em> &quot;income&quot; from that? One would have to invest that $100 and then any profit derived from it could be considered &quot;income&quot;... under your definition.</p>

<p>You know, there&#39;s a reason the term &quot;income&quot; is not actually defined in Title 26. I&#39;ll leave it up to you to figure out why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently you can change your exemptions to 10 and try to skirt by.  If they catch on they&#39;ll send a lock in letter to your employer and the employer will set your exemptions to a single person unless you have a previous w4 stating otherwise.  If they don&#39;t follow the lock in letter orders, then the employer is responsible to pay whatever taxes aren&#39;t covered by your withholding.  If you alter your W4 and submit it to your employer, the altered W4 is considered invalid and the employer again is &quot;obligated&quot; to set your exemptions to a single person.  I find it interesting that the IRS goes to the length of putting this in the Q&amp;A about altering W4s &quot;Any alteration of a Form W-4 (e.g. crossed out penalties of perjury statement above the signature).&quot;  So basically if one lies on their W4 about their exemptions, then they are committing perjury when they sign the W4 and thus creating a legally bind.</p>

<p>THINKING OUT LOUD -Question- If one refuses to sign or submit a W4, in other words refuses to enter into a contract with the IRS by way of accepting the perjury term, then the employer will execute the withholding.  Now at the end of the year if one doesn&#39;t file a tax return then how would one get their money back from the IRS since they haven&#39;t entered into a contract?  You never will.  So how can one go about not entering into the contract and keeping their money from ever being withheld?  Is this where corporations which limit liability, write-offs, come into play?  If one starts their own business and doesn&#39;t submit a W4 then as the business owner they&#39;ll be liable for the taxes too?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cuz we&#39;re sheep...what do you think?  What kind of question is that?  Are you actually <em>looking</em> to antagonize the conversation here?  We as a population allow ourselves to be taken advantage of because 1) our indoctrination started at or even <em>before</em> our births (via our being medicated through our very own mothers even then), and 2) continued on through our indoctrination all through K-12 and beyond - college, etc.</p>

<p>By the time we&#39;re &quot;adults&quot;, most of us are so fully indoctrinated that we either don&#39;t question our serfdom or, even for those of us that do, we don&#39;t really have too much of the first clue as to how to really organize and fight that power.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an asshole by nature, brother.  I much prefer to get along and converse in a good manner with my fellow brothers and sisters, and will take most opportunities given to me to communicate cordially.  However, I also don&#39;t take shit, and am not afraid to snap in a moment&#39;s notice if it appears that someone is unwilling to be reasonable or is a shill.  You showed that you were cool, so it seems only right to reciprocate.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Very well-said.  This indeed is the great conundrum that we face.  There <em>are</em> indeed people that are awake.  It doesn&#39;t seem to have reached a tipping point yet, however, and the current numbers of those that are awake haven&#39;t converged together as one yet to combat the great influence TPTB present against those that are waking up to their nefarious influence.</p>

<p>The laws of the land and the armies and police are indeed very compelling influences forcing many to toe the line.  Unfortunately, that line is one of serfdom, subservience, and servitude that works to keep us as a civilization and as a people from reaching our true potential as beings.  It&#39;s a line that we should all fight <em>against</em>.</p>

<p>Easier said than done, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m loosing track of the threads that we are communicating on because we have multiple conversations going so I apologize if any of this is redundant.  But, basically, as it was stated elsewhere, the employer will be compelled to hold &quot;the imposed tax liability&quot; or else be subject to pay them their selves.  Thus, you would probably need some sort of legal order for them to stop or some written waiver from the IRS that they will not be liable.  Otherwise they probably won&#39;t take the risk.  Perhaps if one owns their own business or is incorporated there could be a work around?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though there is no law making individuals liable for a tax on their compensation for services, the IRS and the courts have the deck stacked against anyone trying to make the IRS follow the law. Even so, many people have managed to do it successfully. Especially if they are a low profile target. I remember during the 80s reading of an informal survey of San Diego attorneys and about 10% of them filed no returns and paid no &quot;income&quot; taxes. </p>

<p>You might read up on Irwin Schiff&#39;s <a href="http://www.paynoincometax.com/">website</a> and I recommend his books &quot;The Great Income Tax Hoax&quot; and &quot;The Federal Mafia&quot; (both free on his site). Also be aware that he&#39;s in jail because he was a high profile target, much like Wesley Snipes. Other high profile cases include Joe Banister, Sherry Jackson Peel and Tom Crier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through a bunch of material a couple weeks ago and that bit of information was one of the stragglers that stuck out in my mind. I don&#39;t remember at all where it came from. The reason I put in &quot;my understanding&quot; before the claim is because I might be wrong. Wit further investigation I expect to have this point of information either confirmed or denied. If I recall it was one of the Irwin Schiff bits (who should not be taken as an example of a successful position to take against the IRS for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>I have a full time job and my own hobbies and no car. Getting to a law library and reading legalese isn&#39;t as easy for someone in my position as I&#39;d like it to be. My movements tend to be slow and laborious. I feel no confidence that I&#39;ll get anything out of reading mere code. It&#39;s better to see how things operate in practice. Which means that I have to see how the IRS and the courts operate. Which suggests that I ought to look at examples that I will find worthy of repetition or emulation. Now we&#39;re getting into data filtering. I think I have a few cases worth examining and it&#39;ll take time to figure them out.</p>

<p>I would encourage you to look into Marc Stevens.</p>

<p>He talks about this stuff for a living. My understanding is he&#39;s highly successful. I&#39;m going to be doing a trial run of his technique in a month. This is a trial run because it&#39;s a traffic ticket; however this wil be a sort of dry run for the IRS. Both are going to be court cases and the same rules, fundamentally, apply to any assertion made by another in the context of a legal case. Claims must be backed by hard evidence. And so I&#39;m going to see what it looks like in a month to defend against accusations made without evidence. I will likely post the results as a thread for discussion.</p>

<p>This is all after-the-fact.</p>

<p>My question isn&#39;t about the back end. It&#39;s about the front end.</p>

<p>In order to compel a person to pay taxes there must be something on the front end.</p>

<p>There must be grounding.</p>

<p>Imagine that there are two people in a room and Person A asks for Person B to pay a tax to Person A. What are the grounds on which Person A may make such a request and how can he compel Person B to do such a thing? </p>

<p>This sounds idiotic, I know, but this must be something that the courts have an answer to. If there is no answer then I don&#39;t see how there may be legal grounds for requiring payment of Federal Income Taxes.</p>

<p>P.S. I revised my comment and added nine questions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s silly, but I would love to hear your thoughts to those questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would likely be a subpoena.</p>

<p>I would show up and humiliate them publicly so that others would have a chance to see what it looks like to exercise their rights.</p>

<p>Standing up to a bully is not a fun thing to do and I&#39;m well aware of how uncomfortable it can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so lets play the tape all the way through.  I&#39;m honestly not trying to be facetious, I&#39;m trying to learn.  So you show up at court to give testimony which I assume is what your saying you will do when you say you will humiliate them.  The alternative would be to perhaps plead the 5th?  In either case the judge is going to deem that there is sufficient evidence to indict? you on some sort of charge?  Then what?  Or what argument will you have that will maintain your freedom?  Looking at the track record of this approach doesn&#39;t seem to be to successful.</p>

<p>*Forgive me if my knowledge of the legal proceedings is inaccurate, I don&#39;t speak legalese.</p>

<p>I hate taxes. It&#39;s ridiculous tha we have to pay tax on the money we earn and then on the money we spend. Please someone help me get out of paying. If I didn&#39;t have income tax I could actually live halfway decent. </p>
