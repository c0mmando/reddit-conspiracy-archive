        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-10-21 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ZoinksJeepster.html">ZoinksJeepster</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was thinking about why JT&#39;s timeline was more accelerated than our own (even though some of his &quot;predictions&quot;, like the new Civil War are certainly taking shape now).</p>

<p>What if somehow, his returning to the past and &quot;warning&quot; us online in some way affected our timeline? In other words, people began &quot;waking up&quot; and in turn it delayed the NWO&#39;s planned timeline. For example, JT predicted 9/11 in that a major building would be missing from the NY skyline, but since 2001 his predictions (at least dates) have become more and more divergent. </p>

<p>So perhaps he succeeded in changing our timeline by waking people up?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>PS: Debunkers, please go away, we know your opinion(s). This thread is for discussion of John Titor and the topic proposed. Thanks for respecting that.</p>

<p>That cover art was created in June 2001....they had to pull it and completely redesign the cover art for the album&#39;s November 2001 drop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real/fake thing is a non-starter. We can&#39;t prove it either way, so why not take it as it is and treat it as a serious question and an opportunity for discussion?
Myself, I never cared about nor looked into the veracity. In my little mind this sort of time travel is impossible for reasons both primitive and modern. So I never cared. I just considered the prognostication as a What If, and I found it very plausible. Though I admit I think the timeline as presented was shockingly quick. 
Maybe we aren&#39;t slow. Maybe he rushed things to affect our path?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a weird story. I think about it from time to time. But mostly the small things he said, like in the future he watch all tv online. I do that now, but didn&#39;t see it as a possibility in 1998 or 1999 with the state if the entertainment/cable industry. But there were probably folks who did. </p>

<p>If I recall correctly he said we&#39;d be in full blown civil war by 2015. By the state of things recently, I&#39;d say it&#39;s possible. A couple earth shattering events and it&#39;s on. Perhaps another major terrorist attack, throw in a little martial law to quell food riots in an affected area that goes badly and turns into a massacre of a few dozen families and many more injured outside a grocery store or food distribution center. Of course the scene is repeated 24/7 on CNN. Militias decide enough is enough and get into the fray attacking the troops they think were responsible in a daring ambush. Government tracks and kills them and starts collecting weapons for our safety. That sparks a popular revolt based on pent up anger over corruption, inequality, and breakdown of government services, food and gas shortages. </p>

<p>I think Titor said sides in the civil war all came down to where you lived--which always struck me as so odd then. In that scenario who are the two sides? Rich and poor? Country vs. City? Now it makes sense weirdly enough and that is some scary shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we&#39;ll if you read up on Titor, he was really against giving out info that people would be able to use to avoid or alter their timeline. Yes, there were two twin towers, but if he came out and said &quot;two skyscrapers will disappear from NYC&quot; then everyone would know he meant the WTC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;ve seen the movie you got that from but the original quote is something about a butterflies wings flaping and causing a tsunami a thousand miles away. Thank you for your reply little drunk otherwise I would probably remember the quote better. Another enteresting thing is if ints not time travle and simpley just travel through multiverses then it wouldn&#39;t effect the timeline per say but it could hwve set fourth those events in our timeline/universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s from the short story (by Bradbury maybe?), A Sound of Thunder where some guy goes back in the past to observe and steps off the path and onto a butterfly...goes back to present and world has changed. Think they&#39;re making a movie now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a cheap like b movie that sounds a lot alike. If I remember the title was similar also. Good movie actually I loved it. Instead of just one guy its a group that does and they are archeologist or something like that. One guy steps off the path and on a buterfly.</p>

<p>Edit: looked it up and the movie I&#39;m talking about is the one based on the book you are refferencing also I was wrong the are time travling safari company. Been awhile sence I seen it and I imagine the book is better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vehicle was just a container for the time machine. The actual time machine was a box which has six self contained micro singularities kept slightly out of phase with the higgs field. With minor manipulations the singularities could be used to open virtual wormholes that can be used to go to different timelines with minor deviations from his starting point. He could have picked a trash dumpster and it would have made little difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I understand that I was just correcting things. First vehicle was indeed some type of firebird type car and then a 4x4 type blazer. Wasn&#39;t trying to say anything other than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am just stating that the vehicle is not the time machine even though time machine isn&#39;t the proper term for such a device. It was more like the probability drive from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy except it changed the reality of reference of the operator instead of changing the operator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah after I went back I realized the original statment I replied to said the vehicle was the time machine. So it was my misunderstanding of the original comment, my bad. Thank you for your reply.</p>
