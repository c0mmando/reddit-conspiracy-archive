       I was thinking about why JT's timeline was more accelerated than our own (even though some of his "predictions", like the new Civil War are certainly taking shape now).
      </p>
      <p>
       What if somehow, his returning to the past and "warning" us online in some way affected our timeline? In other words, people began "waking up" and in turn it delayed the NWO's planned timeline. For example, JT predicted 9/11 in that a major building would be missing from the NY skyline, but since 2001 his predictions (at least dates) have become more and more divergent.
      </p>
      <p>
       So perhaps he succeeded in changing our timeline by waking people up?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: Debunkers, please go away, we know your opinion(s). This thread is for discussion of John Titor and the topic proposed. Thanks for respecting that.

       Speaking of predicting 9/11...the rap group Coup famously had to pull this album cover after the events of that day.

       That cover art was created in June 2001....they had to pull it and completely redesign the cover art for the album's November 2001 drop.

       But do you think his warning could have in fact set our timeline off on a tangent, which explains the divergence in dates? Seems like our timeline is progressing way slower than events on his original timeline.

       I think that, theoretically, we could have diverged in a small way from Titor's proposal, and twelve years later the two degree change has resulted in our going "off course" as it were by hundreds of miles.

       Taking his veracity as given for the purpose of debate, of course.

       The real/fake thing is a non-starter. We can't prove it either way, so why not take it as it is and treat it as a serious question and an opportunity for discussion?
Myself, I never cared about nor looked into the veracity. In my little mind this sort of time travel is impossible for reasons both primitive and modern. So I never cared. I just considered the prognostication as a What If, and I found it very plausible. Though I admit I think the timeline as presented was shockingly quick. 
Maybe we aren't slow. Maybe he rushed things to affect our path?

       Well, some theories suggest that the dates he ave were somehow encoded... Or you ave to add a certain number to them to get the actual date. Not sure. It's an interesting theory but I've ever seen it fully fleshed-out.

       Sounds like a rule of thumb, the Coefficient of Titor. If it were 1:1, we'd be in a world as bad as his. As it is, it's 1.3:1 or so, maybe due to his actions - or the prescience of an pseudonymous author in our own time.

       Neal Stephenson's
       <em>
        Anathem

       There is also the posibility that he was from a diffrent universe and him comming here set in motion things similar to his in this universe but it has been slower to progress here as we had lots of books and reffrences far before him that gave us warning of what could come.

       I don't think his warning ever reached enough people to effect the planetary consciousness to the degree it could change destiny. I think it's more likely that the object he came back for is so much the same in so many universes, that it didn't matter to his mission whether he followed the precise thread back or not; their technology may not even be good enough to get the precise one if they needed to.

       This is interesting. Right, like if there really are SO MANY parallel dimensions (infinite), it wouldn't matter and yes, he wouldn't particularly care if he messed ours up. But wouldn't it make t harder for him to get back to his own 2036 original timeline?

       I suspect that reality branches in the vascular matrix fashion that seems to be a constant of nature, and thus would be much easier to navigate in the direction of flow, as that is what our consciousness (and by extension our technology) is adapted to. Titor may have been able to return with far more accuracy than he came with.

       Time was a little slower (two years and 2 months  slower) for Nostradamus when he predicted 9/11 in the year  1555
      </p>
      <p>
       He thought the 'king of terror' would 'descend from the skies' in 1999, sept, meaning 7th month.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interpretation of meaning is a little off here but the lines attributed to the writing of Nostradamus have been familiar to me since the 1970's

       It struck me how much inclined towards tea party ideology John Titor was.  In his timeline maybe Tea didn't really take off, and in our timeline the statements and interventions by John are causing this right wing populism to burn out before it became foundational in his new union.

       It's a weird story. I think about it from time to time. But mostly the small things he said, like in the future he watch all tv online. I do that now, but didn't see it as a possibility in 1998 or 1999 with the state if the entertainment/cable industry. But there were probably folks who did.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I recall correctly he said we'd be in full blown civil war by 2015. By the state of things recently, I'd say it's possible. A couple earth shattering events and it's on. Perhaps another major terrorist attack, throw in a little martial law to quell food riots in an affected area that goes badly and turns into a massacre of a few dozen families and many more injured outside a grocery store or food distribution center. Of course the scene is repeated 24/7 on CNN. Militias decide enough is enough and get into the fray attacking the troops they think were responsible in a daring ambush. Government tracks and kills them and starts collecting weapons for our safety. That sparks a popular revolt based on pent up anger over corruption, inequality, and breakdown of government services, food and gas shortages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Titor said sides in the civil war all came down to where you lived--which always struck me as so odd then. In that scenario who are the two sides? Rich and poor? Country vs. City? Now it makes sense weirdly enough and that is some scary shit.

       Yes, we'll if you read up on Titor, he was really against giving out info that people would be able to use to avoid or alter their timeline. Yes, there were two twin towers, but if he came out and said "two skyscrapers will disappear from NYC" then everyone would know he meant the WTC.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, please read the original post up top. This thread isnt for arguing the validity of Titor. It's to explore one theory about diverging timelines. So why don't you go make your own thread over in conspiritard and debunk all you want.

       He said ONE but conjugated the verb plurally. He worked cryptically with clues b/c, as he said, he didn't want to give people info they could use to escape death, avoid an earthquake or bombing, etc. but wanted to leave enough info that could be pieced together afterward to prove his claims.

       There is good reason for him to not want to give enough info for people do avoid dying as it could very easily end up in him never being born, if he was from our timline, a risk that could not be taken given the weight of the mission. All of that being said I have never heard of this before and now will spend some time resarching and will be back to join in further discusion.

       You realize there was an attack on the wtc in 1993 right? Everyone knew it was a target. And many of us knew this shit was all coming down the tracks for a long time. There is a large number of people, especially on this sub, who could have come up with convincing predictions such as the titor character.

       Even the 1978 firebird time machine....

       However I doubt many people would have had him coming back for an IBM computer from the 70s, that part is just brilliantly hilarious.

       I think I've seen the movie you got that from but the original quote is something about a butterflies wings flaping and causing a tsunami a thousand miles away. Thank you for your reply little drunk otherwise I would probably remember the quote better. Another enteresting thing is if ints not time travle and simpley just travel through multiverses then it wouldn't effect the timeline per say but it could hwve set fourth those events in our timeline/universe.

       No, it's from the short story (by Bradbury maybe?), A Sound of Thunder where some guy goes back in the past to observe and steps off the path and onto a butterfly...goes back to present and world has changed. Think they're making a movie now.

       There is a cheap like b movie that sounds a lot alike. If I remember the title was similar also. Good movie actually I loved it. Instead of just one guy its a group that does and they are archeologist or something like that. One guy steps off the path and on a buterfly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: looked it up and the movie I'm talking about is the one based on the book you are refferencing also I was wrong the are time travling safari company. Been awhile sence I seen it and I imagine the book is better.

       The vehicle was just a container for the time machine. The actual time machine was a box which has six self contained micro singularities kept slightly out of phase with the higgs field. With minor manipulations the singularities could be used to open virtual wormholes that can be used to go to different timelines with minor deviations from his starting point. He could have picked a trash dumpster and it would have made little difference.

       I am just stating that the vehicle is not the time machine even though time machine isn't the proper term for such a device. It was more like the probability drive from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy except it changed the reality of reference of the operator instead of changing the operator.
