       So in 1913 there were some major events that occurred in the United States, they I believe to have a high correlation.  The Federal Reserve was established as the central bank.  Income tax was authorized by the congress and also the Secret Service began protection of the US President.  So we gave the right to print money to a central bank.  Income tax was established to service the interest debt owed to the Federal Reserve, and the secret service who is supposed to protect the president probably holds him hostage.

       In medicine:
1913 - Rockefeller foundation was formed. It took control of the medical system, including medical education and the red cross.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediate umbilical cord clamping coincidentally started in 1913. This practice makes infants weak as they lose 1/3rd of their blood supply, stem cells, and white blood cells.

       I'm more surprised the secret service was founded as part of the treasury department.. than anything.

       That isn't too surprising in my opinion.  Counterfeit money is a huge deal because it essentially devalues real money by that equivalent.  Back then, all of the money were gold certificates that one could take to a bank and get that value in gold.  Someone had make sure phony certificates were being traded.  What I find more surprising is that they took over protecting the president.  I would imagine that since he is the highest person in the armed forces, that he would be protected by an elite group from one of them.
       <br/>
       Of course this is just an opinion.

       I was incredibly intrigued by your comment but I read that they existed to combat counterfitting  post Civil War. However it is VERY strange considering why they're now used as such.

       Prior to the Civil War, state banks issued their own bank notes, it wasn't until the civil war that National Bank Notes began to be created.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_Note">
        National Bank Notes

       It's my understanding that Lincoln went to the bankers to ask for loans to help fund the civil war.  When the bankers wanted high interest rates, Lincoln bypassed them by creating his own money.

       I think the death toll is highly exaggerated. I've been poor as shit all my life, so I'm not afraid a collapse. The people that collected massive amounts of wealth are the one's who lose the most.

       I think our society has some contract that if we as Americans keep paying

       The federal criminal code really began to expand in the Progressive era.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Act">
        Mann act
       </a>
       was passed in 1910 in response to allegations of conspiracies involving "White Slavery."
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <strong>
        1913
       </strong>
       the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law even though states and not the federal government previously enforced this type of law.   The court limited federal enforcement to interstate crimes though.
      </p>
      <p>
       By 1915 Wilson was demanding what would finally be passed in 1917 as the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917">
        Espionage Act
       </a>
       , further expanding federal police powers (and then an even worse Sedition Act is passed in 1918).  The first federal law prosecuting disclosure of federal government information, was [Defense Secrets Act](1911) passed in 1911 in the U.S., and modeled after the British Official Secrets Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1916 the Keating-Owens act prohibits interstate commerce of child made goods.  The Supreme Court later holds in 1917 this act is unconstitutional because it tries to regulate commerce and goes beyond the proper regulation of the Mann Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the early federal criminal code was concerned with using the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to enforce mostly economic crimes, but the Mann Act and then the Espionage Act and Sedition Act, and then the prosecution of Prohibition was used to justify an further expansion of federal police powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's no wonder the first federal police force was basically a division of the treasury department (except the U.S. Marshals have been around longer).
       <strong>
        By the way, this Wikipedia article claims Secret Service protection of the president began in 1902
       </strong>
       , and that Secret Service investigation of currency crimes began in 1865:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was commissioned on July 5, 1865, in Washington, D.C. as the "Secret Service Division" of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing counterfeiting. The legislation creating the agency was on Abraham Lincoln's desk the night he was assassinated.[15] At the time, the only other federal law enforcement agencies were the United States Park Police, the U.S. Post Office Department's Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (now known as the United States Postal Inspection Service), and the U.S. Marshals Service. The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime under federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began to investigate everything from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling. After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, Congress informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Bureau of Investigation, which later became the FBI, was interestingly
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation">
        started in 1908
       </a>
       before the Mann Act was passed even though that was its stated raison d'etre:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Bureau of Investigation (BOI) was created on July 26, 1908, after Congress had adjourned for the summer.[17] Attorney General Bonaparte, using Department of Justice expense funds,[17] hired thirty-four people, including some veterans of the Secret Service,[20][21] to work for a new investigative agency. Its first chief (the title is now known as director) was Stanley Finch. Bonaparte notified Congress of these actions in December, 1908.[17]
       </p>
       <p>
        The bureau's first official task was visiting and making surveys of the houses of prostitution in preparation for enforcing the "White Slave Traffic Act," or Mann Act, passed on June 25, 1910.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hoover began wiretapping people in the 1920s and engaged in a "war on crime" in the 1930s.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would put 1913 right at the heart of the expansion of the federal criminal code, but it would take war and Prohibition to expand it beyond the limits the Supreme Court was putting on federal laws in those days.

       Interesting about the legislation being on Lincoln's desk the night of his assassination.  Kinda similar to the Patriot Act being passed 20 days after 9-11.
      </p>
      <p>
       The protection of the president did begin before 1913, it was this year though that congress made it one of the secret services official responsibilities by passing legislation.

        Income tax was established to service the interest debt owed to the Federal Reserve
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, it wasn't. The Federal Reserve gets a very small percentage of the revenue from income tax. Before 1933, it got almost no revenue from income tax—it only bought a significant amount of U.S. government bonds during World War I.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 1947, the Federal Reserve has only received, on average, about 2% of the net interest on the federal debt, which means it gets much less than 1% of tax revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The peacetime income tax dates back to And the income tax dates
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%E2%80%93Gorman_Tariff_Act">
        back to 1894
       </a>
       , but that act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. So Congress passed the

        Sixteenth Amendment

       in
       <strong>
        1909
       </strong>
       . It took four years for enough states to ratify it so that it became part of the Constitution. So that's why Congress created the income tax in 1913.

       The income tax helped
       <a href="http://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=360">
        grow the federal government
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The story of the growth of the federal government can be divided into two parts: before and after 1913, when the 16th amendment to the Constitution, which permitted a federal income tax, was ratified. In 1913 federal spending was a mere 2.5 percent of GNP (today spending is almost ten times that level); so if the federal government is measured only by spending, little growth took place before the income tax. . . .
       </p>
       <p>
        [Growth after the Civil War focused on veteran benefits but] other groups were more interested in regulatory benefits. The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887, and the Sherman Antitrust Act passed in 1890.[] The transformation of the U.S. government continued as the turn of the century ushered in the Progressive Era. The Food and Drug Administration was created in 1906, the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the Federal Trade Commission in 1914. A government initially committed to protecting the liberty of its citizens now seemed to be just as firmly committed to looking out for their economic welfare.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Progressive Era was interrupted by World War I, during which federal power advanced in unprecedented ways. The railroads were nationalized, waterborne shipping was regulated, and the United States Food Administration, created in 1917, controlled all aspects of the food industry, from agriculture to distribution to sales. Similar regulation was applied to fuels, and eventually to the whole economy.[]  When the federal income tax was introduced in 1913, the highest tax bracket was 7 percent for all income above $20,000. Because of the demand for war-related spending, by 1918 the highest rate rose to 77 percent beginning at $4,000. This was the context in which Warren G. Harding was elected to the presidency in 1920 with the theme, a “return to normalcy.”

       This is the genius of the Federal Reserve and why it's such a large scam.  They took over a function of the Treasury Department, charge interest on it, pay themselves a salary, pay the stock holders a dividend, and then return those profits to the treasury.  They're lending us our own money and we pay them to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dividends are 6% which is a pretty nice return for not doing much.

       Would you mind explaining what that
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/D7TszAG.png">
        chart you linked to

       is supposed to represent?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it looks like it's been in the red since 2009, and the Federal Reserve's owners have been forced to selflessly dig into their own meager savings to finance our government - and that would just be sad.
      </p>

       I mean, by now those poor, selfless Central Bankers must be broke and starving. I feel guilty.

       The income tax helped
       <a href="http://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=360">
        grow the federal government
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The story of the growth of the federal government can be divided into two parts: before and after 1913, when the 16th amendment to the Constitution, which permitted a federal income tax, was ratified. In 1913 federal spending was a mere 2.5 percent of GNP (today spending is almost ten times that level); so if the federal government is measured only by spending, little growth took place before the income tax. . . .
       </p>
       <p>
        [Growth after the Civil War focused on veteran benefits but] other groups were more interested in regulatory benefits. The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887, and the Sherman Antitrust Act passed in 1890.[] The transformation of the U.S. government continued as the turn of the century ushered in the Progressive Era. The Food and Drug Administration was created in 1906, the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the Federal Trade Commission in 1914. A government initially committed to protecting the liberty of its citizens now seemed to be just as firmly committed to looking out for their economic welfare.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Progressive Era was interrupted by World War I, during which federal power advanced in unprecedented ways. The railroads were nationalized, waterborne shipping was regulated, and the United States Food Administration, created in 1917, controlled all aspects of the food industry, from agriculture to distribution to sales. Similar regulation was applied to fuels, and eventually to the whole economy.[]  When the federal income tax was introduced in 1913, the highest tax bracket was 7 percent for all income above $20,000. Because of the demand for war-related spending, by 1918 the highest rate rose to 77 percent beginning at $4,000. This was the context in which Warren G. Harding was elected to the presidency in 1920 with the theme, a “return to normalcy.”
