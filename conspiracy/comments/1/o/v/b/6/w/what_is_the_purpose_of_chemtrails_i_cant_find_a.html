    <div class="md"><p>My cut&#39;n&#39;paste stock answer:
(cue stock c&amp;p ad hom &quot;King-Hell is a shill!&quot; attack)</p>

<p>First of all, I don&#39;t simply write off every conspiracy theory as the work of paranoid nutters. Many conspiracy theories turn out to be true, like the CIA&#39;s guns-for-cocaine Black Ops in South America.. I don&#39;t accept the official line on 9/11 and I believe the probability is that WTC7 was brought down by a preplanned controlled demolition.</p>

<p>But I just don&#39;t buy into chemtrails. People say they&#39;ve only been happening in the last 20 years but I remember them from my childhood, and there are plenty of pictures on the Internet of World War II bombers turning the sky white with persistent contrails over France and Germany.</p>

<p>There is a simple scientific explanation for the trails you see criss-crossing the skies. They are plumes of ice which are left when a jetliner burns fuel in a cold wet atmosphere. A large persistent contrail may contain several thousand tons of ice and there isn&#39;t a plane ever built that could carry that amount of any substance to that height in the atmosphere. </p>

<p>Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin; it is a hydrocarbon. When it burns in air the carbon part combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (Dihydrogen Monoxide, H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes this steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is already saturated with water then these crystals will grow many times in size through a process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else.
Water is an amazing substance with some unique properties which defy logic. Suspended in air it can co-exist as vapour, liquid, and solid simultaneously. </p>

<p>It is important to realise that water does not freeze at zero centigrade. It will freeze at any temperature from zero degrees down to minus 40 (zero degrees is defined as the point where pure frozen water melts, not freezes). Liquid water, ice, and invisible water vapour (cold steam) are found together in clouds where the temperature is minus 40. Even clear air will contain a lot of siub-zero water vapour. It&#39;s not hard to see how a huge jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

<p>What nobody in the chemtrails camp seems able to do is to explain why and how they are happening. Just that &quot;they are&quot; and that it should be &quot;obvious&quot; to anybody who looks up in the sky (And if you don&#39;t see what they are seeing you are &#39;sheeple&#39; that needs to &#39;wake up&#39;, or you are stupid, or you are a government shill). If it&#39;s being done for rainmaking then &quot;they&quot; picked a peculiar time and place to do it earlier this year. After the wettest winter on record in Southern England, why would anybody want to make more rain when the rivers and reservoirs were already bursting their banks? If it&#39;s for some form of nefarious mind or population control then &quot;they&quot; are doing it to themselves and their families as much as to us. Where is the logic in that? Could it be a benign program to combat global warming? Probably not because that kind of seeding needs to take place in the stratosphere, way above the height that commercial airliners fly at. The theory that it is used in conjunction with HAARP to create tornadoes and earthquakes is intriguing, but again there is no solid evidence – just speculation.</p>

<p>&#39;How?&#39; also goes unanswered. If commercial jetliners are being loaded up with toxic chemicals to spray behind them as they fly then it involves a conspiracy of hundreds of thousands of people who own, fly, refuel, maintain, and design aeroplanes. With all those people and all this time do you think that not one person would stand up and blow the whistle? How how many tons of chemicals would it take to create a 20 mile long trail across the sky? Where is it stored on the aircraft? How is it dispersed? Who pays for it? And possibly the most basic question: Why not just do the spraying  at night when nobody can see it?</p>

<p>And who are the &quot;they&quot; that are doing it? The illuminati? The lizard people? Reverse vampires? The questions go on and on and never lead to any answers – just more questions.</p>

<p>All of these theories could be true, but there&#39;s actually no evidence to support any of them. What evidence is offered can often be traced in a big circle straight back to where it originated in the mind of a another paranoid conspiracy theorist, quoted and re-quoted until it takes on a life of its own. Just because there&#39;s 100, or 1000 people claiming the same thing doesn&#39;t make it the truth.</p>

<p>Nobody is doubting that geo-engineering is taking place. The Chinese use it extensively to control rainfall and it was used during the Beijing Olympics to target rain on the capital to help clear the smog. But it was done with specially modified aircraft, rockets and artillery, not commercial airliners. There are numerous patents for different methods of geoengineering, but no evidence for most of these ideas being taken beyond a proof of concept. Recent research into using a reflective heat shield to combat global warming suggests that it may actually make things worse.</p>

<p>Chemtrail campaigners claim that raised levels of aluminium and barium are evidence for artificial spraying, but these are chemicals naturally found in the environment and their raised levels can be explained by fossil fuel burning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are wrong about te freezing point of water. 0 centigrade is the temp at which pure water freezes <em>at sea level pressure</em>, namely 14.6 psi.
Increase the pressure, you decrease the freezing/boiling point. Like how a crock pot works.
Boiling water is cooler in Denver than it is in Hawaii.
That said, the trails seen in my childhhood and the trails from ill maintained ww2 oil burning aircraft are not the same type of trails we see today. they dissipated fairly rapidly not expanding to fill a quarter of the sky </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is you who are wrong, on two points. Zero centigrade is the point at which pure water ice melts, not freezes. Do a google on supercooled liquid water. </p>

<p>If you increase atmospheric pressure you raise the boiling point. This is how a pressure cooker works. </p>

<p>Decreasing atmospheric pressure lowers the boiling point, which is why you can&#39;t make a decent cup of tea in the mountains.</p>

<p>Increasing pressure will lower the freezing point, which is how ice skates work. </p>

<p>Lowering pressure will cause the ice to evaporate into water vapour without melting into liquid water first. Freeze-drying works by lowering the pressure to the point where the boiling point is lower than the freezing point, so water sublimates from solid ice to water vapour without passing through a liquid stage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great explanation for how CONTRAILS are formed. Most of these &#39;trails are NOT contrails though--not even close.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve sky-sampled them, I&#39;ve ground-sampled them--they&#39;re all the same--HUGE amounts of aluminum, barium, and glycol components with not a TOUCH of hydrocarbons in them.</p>

<p>&quot;Doubters&quot; only have to do this one thing...wait until your skies are COVERED with the criss-cross Chemtrails that would NEVER happen with &quot;normal&quot; air traffic and then make a note of the bearings of said chemtrails (their from-to directions). </p>

<p>Now look them up in a flight-tracking app or website. Chances are that less than 5% of what you find will be &quot;tracked&quot;--meaning...spray is from rogue military planes.</p>

<p>This is simple and foolproof...try it!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let anybody tell you that you are seeing &quot;normal&quot; contrails when the evidence is <strong>right over your fucking heads!</strong></p>

<p>Now look them up in a flight-tracking app or website. Chances are that less than 5% of what you find will be &quot;tracked&quot;--meaning...spray is from rogue military planes.</p>

<p>A plane flies through; leaves a contrail. 15 minutes later it has disappeared off the flight radar screen. But the contrail is still there and now there is NO TRACE of the aircraft on your computer screen. Spooky.</p>

<p>guess that the Manhattan Project never happened, huh? It would have taken SO much money, SO many resources, and SO many people knowing it could NEVER have been kept a secret</p>

<p>The Manhattan project only ran for a few years, and it was isolated in the middle of the desert with huge security and censorship. It&#39;s hardly a valid comparison to an alleged conspiracy that&#39;s been going on for 20 years involving every government on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>growing up in the early 80&#39;s in the washington dc area i regularly saw CONTRAILS persist in the skies. why would this be? the seat of government poisoning itself? unlikely. does the exhaust from jets contain chemicals? most likely, not unlike the results of any combustion that&#39;s simple science, is this a conspiracy to poison america and control the weather. unlikely. have there been efforts to control the weather, without a doubt. have cancers and other ailments increased in our ever growing industrial society of course. there are trade-offs for everything. we can only mitigate the effects of industrial production so much, so lets keep working to try and make it better, but remember unless you can fully support your own existence without outside help, including making your computer from scratch, (meaning digging the elements from the ground) we must accept the results of living in these technological times. so don&#39;t like pollution? do fly drive or even use a horse,(manure=methane) can&#39;t use solar power cause even the production of solar cells pollutes. in the end its as simple as that. its no conspiracy that what man creates produces  pollution and other byproducts</p>
