I need to go to a community of people that already exist or find people who will start one. I know there is a lot of people on the sub that are willing, but there&#39;s no leader or clear way to go about it. So I&#39;m offering this post to help organize these communities.

    <div class="md"><p>Make it &quot;chapter/city&quot; based.  Like, for example, you and I could in theory be like-minded souls, and we might have concordant ideas about what we could do to help change the world for the better.  However, we may live on different coasts (you&#39;re on the East coast, for example.  I&#39;m on the West), so it makes it more difficult if even possible for us to come together and share ideas or coordinate events, etc.  Perhaps you/we can set up &quot;chapter/city&quot; based regions where every individual from &quot;this&quot; city or &quot;that&quot; city can get together, discuss ideas, plan events, etc:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Maybe everyone can chip in on a communal garden where everyone can tend to it and eat from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe everyone can stage coordinated events of demonstration where everyone marches peacefully on the street for awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe a public speaking event can be staged where a relevant topic or issue can be intelligently talked about.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I feel that these are the kinds of things that would be more easy to do if members can meet and talk with one another in person, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I was thinking a similar thing as well. I would really love to have regional groups for people to organize and plan meeting of sort. I think it&#39;d be easier to go about this in many connected smaller groups than one very big one. The internet really makes all of this possible too, we need to use it as a tactical tool in every way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start a movement sharing skills, the problem is that many people don&#39;t have any skills to share or don&#39;t spend the time teaching to others. They don&#39;t invest their time, money or effort in sharing. Instead wait for others to do something, there is no shortage of people finding things to do with their time. Someone needs to take the first step by approaching or hiring space, advertising. To organise a community you need a purpose or reason to attract people. If you build it, they will come.</p>

<p>Buy a bullhorn, make a large sign and start parading the streets informing people. &quot;obama arms alqueda, AP, BBC reporting&quot; is a great way to start waking people up. talk about FEMA camps and the DHS, michaell hastings, building 7, anything really</p>

<p>my buddy and I protested in DC last weekend doing the same thing, just the 2 of us and we woke ALOT of people up. Unfortunately, he got spooked by something and deleted the youtube channel</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Should be completely focused on NY in my opinion, as a start. I live here and a lot of people aren&#39;t happy with NY state&#39;s rampant corruption. If we get those people informed on a movement, and there are a lot of them, maybe something could happen. I&#39;d suggest a protest at Albany, being the capital of New York and filled with corrupt to the bone politicians. </p>

<p>In reality though, you&#39;re trying to start something that will not happen. It just won&#39;t, not right now. Timing is everything, so get a feel for the general populations dissatisfaction and go from there. If it&#39;s worse a year from now I&#39;m sure people will be ready. Until then, we&#39;ll all have to wait. Any change or movement has to be backed by most of the population, or it&#39;s not an effective movement. Besides, I wouldn&#39;t want to start anything unless I knew I had absolute support, as otherwise I&#39;d consider myself a manipulator for my own personal agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should share this page with all like minded individuals we know, once we have enough people involved in the conversation we should arrange a meeting. Like some of the other posts said, timing is everything and I believe the general public are not yet ready to be woken up to the truths and pulled from the illusion of their lives. We need to organize and grow our numbers, maybe set it up as a &quot;workshop&quot; or a &quot;survival school&quot; anything that will allow us to gather while at the same time attracting outside people within our communities that seem interested, this way we can begin recruiting people that may otherwise be unaware, but curious about improving the current situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should make it an under ground movement and try to perfect our movement until we&#39;re ready. I think we should also create an anonymity within us, and not try to preach but to attract those who are curious. We should also make sure that what we teach are facts. And idk how anybody feels about protesting but if the group were to protest then I think we should have a dress code within the group to know who we are and if any &quot;intruders&quot; were to infiltrate the group and make us look bad then we would know right away. Sorry for blabbering, I&#39;ve been thinking about doing something like this as well, but not alone.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m talking to people, it&#39;s always helped to keep things civil to act like I&#39;m preaching to the choir. Stick to what they already know then subtly inject some thoughts that they might not have, but can accept easily.</p>

<p>Obviously you can&#39;t make the jump from something in the region of &quot;911 happened... and it was a conspiracy.&quot; It would be better to say &quot;911 happened, but I&#39;ve always wondered what made that third tower fell so I&#39;ve been reading some research articles done by independent entities and it&#39;s all very interesting.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you&#39;re saying as describing people similar to sales representatives in a corporation. You define your markets then approach them with psychologically acceptable pitches to create a relationship network.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say use organizations which have rational-minded ideas. This is somewhat off-topic, but I saw a documentary that stated the first coffee shops were centers of intellectual discussion and may have helped to form the American Revolution. A modern-day intellectual center that is accessible to anyone (like a coffee shop) could become a breeding and selecting ground for finding certain people to network with and then form action groups (like the Continental Congress). </p>

<p>The major hang-ups would be the capital needed for such an organization. A volunteer community organization that posts fliers to meet at a designated location would draw people in until a network was formed that could perform actions that meet the group&#39;s desired goals. </p>

<p>The mission statement would have to broad enough to bring in an adequate amount of rational-minded people, but also narrow enough to make the organization&#39;s goals known without being alarming or fear-based.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my goal at first would be to educate the masses, get over this political party bs, try to bring the people together on a few basic opinions that practically everyone can agree on. Then, if we have enough people, we could try and establish a political party of sorts so we could actually have a say in the government and or just a movement by the people, petitions and such that would be pushed by so many citizens that the government can&#39;t ignore. Also we would need some sort of diversion from the mainstream media because if this actually gets big they&#39;ll rip us to shreds. 
That&#39;s just a rough idea, obviously a lot more is at play. I&#39;m really open to all suggestions, help me neaten it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think waking people up and finding common ground is critical. Awareness is all we can spread. Wake people up, point of the fallacies, and offer reasoned explanations why news is bullshit, politics is a game, etc. However, I think we should expect zero coverage on television unless its negative.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I hope I don&#39;t sound too cynical, but I think we will not be able to legislate our way out of this. I think it&#39;s time to dissolve the federal government.</p>

<p>When I think about common ground, I think about healthy eating. Most people, even if they eat garbage, know that eating healthy is good. More and more, we&#39;re also finding out that supporting local food growers is not only healthier, but it&#39;s good for the community, the economy, etc. I think we need to look at everything on that level. Globalism got us to where slaves make our underwear and Nintendo 3DSs. My solution would be to bring everybody to this conclusion. Localize everything. Money, government, security, etc. Those things that your community can not provide for itself is when you begin trade partnerships.</p>

<p>For example, say there is a tech company in silicon valley that makes phones. However, their climate prevents them from growing a lot of vegetables. A neighboring state or city with better growing conditions doesn&#39;t have the infrastructure to make any tech. There&#39;s a natural partnership there.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to imagine because we&#39;ve drifted so far from this kind of set up, but that was how the world worked for a very large time, and in some places, it still does.</p>

<p>Corporations and government are what&#39;s destroying this planet. We need to eliminate them and humanity can realize its full potential. How many reports have I seen about how solar or wind could power the world for free, among other technologies. However, we subsidize Exxon and other dirty energy companies, who profit in the trillions. Why do they need a subsidy? Why aren&#39;t we subsidizing solar or clean energy? It&#39;s not republicans or democrats that are doing this. It is the unholy alliance of money, control, and power. If ever there is a center of power, psychopaths and predators will try to corrupt it in their favor. The only answer, is don&#39;t have overly powerful central authorities.</p>

<p>This is the same approach anti-gun people take. It&#39;s stupid in their case, because people will want to kill people and that may never end. One gun over another or a hatchet or whatever can handle that. It&#39;s hacking at the branches and not the root. If I felt more inclined to write more, I might argue that senseless murder is also a by-product of a psychotic, and far too powerful government. Next time. </p>
