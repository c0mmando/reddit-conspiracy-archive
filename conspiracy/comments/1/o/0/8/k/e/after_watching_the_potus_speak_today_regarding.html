       Who benefits from raising the debt ceiling when you have not, and will likely never, adjust the actual budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears to me that with all the shennanigans about battleing over this - it forces the debt ceiling to be raised - which if they attempted to do so without such a circus, people would be upset about extending our debt. This just makes it look like raising the debt ceiling is the ONLY option to move forward and as such, everyone acquiesces to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Compare these two videos, one from 2008 the other from today (Use of Legal Martial Law to force the appropriation of funds/raising of the debt ceiling)

       i couldve told you that weeks ago man, lol, but good on you for figuring it out. proof critical thinking is not dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, the shutdown is all for show. i believe the % of the government shutdown is only 17% and dropping. if you look at what is "shutdown", its painfully obvious that this is a act of power over the people. of all this talk, what is REALLY shutdown? monuments, parks, oceans and websites are the only thing shutdown. All of this stuff is the "face" of government in America, and by blocking it from the people, the impression is that america is on lock-down (when it couldnt be farther from the truth) is pushed onto the masses. Furloughed employees are getting retroactive pay and are slowly going to trickle back to work in the next few weeks too; mark my words.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is just as you said, its to scare the people back into the hands of government. The politicians are playing politics and YOU are the game piece.

       While I could have surmised this previously, and I already knew the shutdown was political theater - what I was not 100% aware/convinced of was that this was EXACTLY the same thing that Bush did with the

       Actually, they are in no way comparable.  That was a bank bail-out.  This is the default of a national currency.  If it happens, you will eat your words.  If the banks had failed, we would have been better off.

       Who benefits from the US extending its incredible debt?
      </p>
      <p>
       The banks - and the Fed. This is an extortion, just as was the bailout, this one though, is disguised as some political crisis and they have used a patsy republican group to create the problem, guide the narrative of the reaction and propose the solution; More money for the Central Bank.

       Seem perfectly comparable and an identical result.

       The Fed is greater than 80% owned by a certain conglomerate of banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those banks, in turn, are owned by people; all of those people have similar ties to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fed in NY can print 1 trillion dollars, loan it to the government or individuals via their banks and charge them interest on it!  A group of powerful individuals are profiting from nothing.  They add nothing; they just remove capital and liquidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but they can fund mayhem wherever they want!  This way, they can create threats and then finance the fighting that occurs on both sides!
      </p>
      <p>
       All of those people work in coordinated efforts to ensure that as few of people as possible ever gain enough capital to "join their club" in the elite.  Ever wonder why you know so many good people who work so hard, but still live month to month?  It's planned that way to keep you that way.

       I would say the majority are victims of not adhering to a budget. Carefully figuring out how much you earn vs how much you spend and then having the willpower to control your spending creates savings.

       true to a point. I only have 4 expenses: car loan, student loan, rent, gas/food. I dont go out, i dont buy anything that im not eating or will consume somehow and yet im still scrapping the bottom of the barrel the day before my next paycheck comes.
      </p>
      <p>
       While im not disagreeing with you, dont forget the system is designed to make us week and dependent. the dollar isw getting weaker and weaker and the prices are getting higher and higher.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        100 dollars in '93 is over 160 dollars today.
       </li>
       <li>
        gas in '93 was close to a dollar a gallon,
       </li>
       <li>
        someone making 32k (the poverty level) a year in *93 is the equivalent of someone making 52k a year in 2013.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is a system designed so that no matter how hard you try, you will never be able to get over the hump. and after all this pressure put on people, we are flooded and bombarded with long work weeks, distractions like football and Kim Kardashi-shit, the newest gadget, or whatever the case may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a system of oppression, and while there are irresponsibles out there, the majority are forced into this position, whether they realize it or not

       As they run the system from on high, they are able to extract everything.  I won't matter what they say while they are busy extracting, but nothing will change except in how they do it.  That's why the system has only changed in small ways to allow them more and easier "extraction".

       The Fed is greater than 80% owned by a certain conglomerate of banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those banks, in turn, are owned by people; all of those people have similar ties to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fed in NY can print 1 trillion dollars, loan it to the government or individuals via their banks and charge them interest on it!  A group of powerful individuals are profiting from nothing.  They add nothing; they just remove capital and liquidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but they can fund mayhem wherever they want!  This way, they can create threats and then finance the fighting that occurs on both sides!
      </p>
      <p>
       All of those people work in coordinated efforts to ensure that as few of people as possible ever gain enough capital to "join their club" in the elite.  Ever wonder why you know so many good people who work so hard, but still live month to month?  It's planned that way to keep you that way.
