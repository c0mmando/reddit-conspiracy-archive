<p>he was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Springmann">fired in 1989</a>. Do you know what year 9/11/2001 took place? </p>

<p>Passports?  Now the CIA is issuing Saudi passports to terrorists?  Do you mean visas?   In any case he was fired TWELVE YEARS before the date of the attacks.  No visa is valid for that time period.  Do you understand this?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah yes.    I looked at the &quot;toasted cars&quot; section of the site.  1) explains nothing.  2) simply shows a bunch of cars (and shockingly cop cars and fire engines) that have clearly been struck by falling debris and in some cases caught fire 3) this is the worst conspiracy web site I&#39;ve ever seen; completely incoherent.    </p>

<p>your full of shit</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it a coincidence that George W. Bush brother and cousin was head of the World Trade Center Security and some of the airports that got hijacked on 9/11 
 Also isnt it coincidence that same world trade center security director sold airplanes to the National Civil Aviation Training Organization (NCATO) in Egypt where the hijackers trained their flying </p>

<p>in 1993 Marvin Bush (George W Bush&#39;s brother) becomes director of the Stratesec, which was formerly called Securacom,A security contract company hired by the World Trade Center which maintained security for the World Trade Center Towers up until September 11, 2001. Stratesec also ran Airport Security between 1995 and 1998, tan ran security at the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, providing electronic security for Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport. Their security work included maintaining the airfield access systems, the CCTV (closed circuit television) systems, and the electronic badging systems. American Airlines Flight 77,one of the planes hijacked on 9/11 took off from Dulles. The Same Airport. </p>

<p>Mishal Yousef Saud Al Sabah, who is a member of the Kuwaiti royal family. Al Sabah is also chairman of an investment company called the Kuwait-American Corporation (KuwAm), and was business partners,co director with Marvin Bush at Stratesec, which was formerly called Securacom through 2001, was found selling airplanes to the National Civil Aviation Training Organization (NCATO) of Giza, Egypt, to &quot;the sole civilian pilot training organization in Egypt.&quot; Al Sabah was chairman of KuwAm and board member of the Commander Aircraft Company.” NCATO also has contractual partnerships with several US flight schools, including Embry-Riddle University in Florida </p>

<p>in 1999 Wirt D. Walker III (George W. Bush Cousin)Becomes CEO of Stratesec, which was formerly called Securacom. The Same Contract Security that Marvin Bush, George W Bush brother, was director of and was maintaining security at the World Trade Center and at the Airports some of the Highjacked airliners took off from </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This ^ comment is in jest, but in just the last few days I&#39;ve been contemplating non-revisionist history, and the fact that technically the French should be our closest ally, seeing as they were our first and best ally in our war to leave the English. We&#39;d still be called The Colonies were it not for men like Lafayette willing to take a chance on us (and donate vast sums of personal cash to us). 
From the perspective of today, our Revolution was technically a proxy war between the French and English, and, similar to us supplying/funding the Mujahedin in Afghanistan to undermine our then-enemy Russia, the French saw a chance to really fuck over their then-enemies England by backing us, so they took it. And I for one am glad they did.
If this view makes people see me as unpatriotic because &#39;MURCA, well, fuck them because they&#39;re ignorant of history.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say this is the best explanation for the insanity going on right now. Average Americans would be against any group who supposedly blows up a monument or two. Martial law, baby, just like World War Z. That movie made it seem necessary and cool to be under martial law, so it&#39;s coming and not many people are going to give a shit. </p>

<p>&quot;Daddy, what&#39;s martial law?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Martial law is like house rules, but for everybody.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blown up cars a mile away from the towers? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes. they were towed there.  this was just covered on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a week ago.  please keep up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hole in the pentagon smaller than a 757 plane? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>you mean <a href="http://publicintelligence.net/911-pentagon-damage-high-resolution-aerial-photos/">this hole</a>?  seems plenty big enough to me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zero court martials?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>who would be &quot;court martialed&quot;?  For what? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Michael springman fired after whistleblowing that the hijackers were given visas by the CIA? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>he was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Springmann">fired in 1989</a>. Do you know what year 9/11/2001 took place? </p>

<p>blah blah blah.  you aren&#39;t even good at cutting and pasting.  waste of time.  do your own research. learn to read. </p>
