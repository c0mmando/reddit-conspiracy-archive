        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m just curious, there are a lot of people here discussing these matters, and it is important that they are discussed to obtain objective information and fact-checking, and so forth.</p>

<p>But I have posted here to remind you that knowledge alone is not enough - where is the action? By spreading a message of fear we become further divided, further paranoid. Yes, we can all agree that certain people are not acting in the interest of the rest of humanity, however, they can only execute their plans if the populace allows them to, and continues to remain dependent. This knowledge is helpful because it represents a road, a road that we all must decide for ourselves if we want to take. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think violence is an answer. I think love, compassion, and the connection &amp; community that results are. I think we are called to get to know our neighbors, share, cultivate community gardens, be healthy individuals and reclaim independence from institutions. And though I&#39;m aware that there are many skeptics and science oriented folks, I personally feel that we can use the esoteric tools that are being used malevolently, to more constructive and uniting ends. </p>

<p>If we fight it actively it makes it more powerful. If we do nothing but read about it and continue our lives as normal, the inevitable bondage will ensue (barring the unlikely event of some unexpected phenomenon occurring). Now is the time to free ourselves, to simply show them that their presence is no longer needed or wanted. It is as simple as that. </p>

<p>And ultimately, we must thank and forgive these individuals who have shown us a very dark side of humanity. They are just reflections of society, and they are taking advantage of an unhealthy complacency, which any cunning predator would do. In a way they are society&#39;s greatest teachers.</p>

<p>We must help ourselves though, in the truest sense of the phrase. And at this dark hour, I feel it is important that we each find our spiritual path, whatever it may be. Yes, many spiritual ideas are myth but they are incredible psychotherapeutic tools. We can channel Christ in being of service to others, we can become Buddha in our non-attachment and rugged simplicity, we can become Gandalf in understanding wisdom and uniting people through it. We can utilize the Kabbalah, the runes, the tarot, shamanism and ceremony to restore balance with a concerted effort, through avenues that cannot be stopped. The point is, find your practice and express it. Magick works. Heal those around you so they may become more effective. Empower others with encouragement and excitement, don&#39;t piss on them with what will depress them and make them feel insignificant and powerless. Become a conduit of change within your sphere, your community. Share your tools, share your yards, host potlucks, <em>get people together in person</em>. Assemble!! Our most important task at this moment is independence of resources, so lets get to work!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the downvotes are because every week or so, someone here goes on a rant about taking action against the evil bad guys. I agree, action is needed, but as &quot;awake&quot; as we think we are, we&#39;re nothing as individuals. Group us all together and we&#39;re just a group of individuals. We still need a leader. A Hitler-Christ. Someone to pull us out of the darkness, battle the Behemoth, then crucify once we&#39;ve won or lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A sound question, as it would be silly and hypocritical of me to post such a message without some practice behind my message.</p>

<p>First of all, I went down the rabbit hole of the darkness of conspiracy. It made me stressed, depressed, a downer amongst my friends and an unhealthy partner in romantic relationships. I decided to reorient my life in the ways that felt authentic and valuable, to grow from the experience and to contribute in mitigating the cloud that shadows us.</p>

<p>I moved to an income-sharing community and operated within their successful organic &amp;amp; heirloom seed business, left on a bike trip to lease acreage to begin a homestead in Missouri, but got into an accident that rearranged my life. I find myself now at a different community within a town of conscious individuals. I don&#39;t own a car and use my cargo bike for transportation needs. I read the tarot professionally, which is more or less mystical psychology in practice for those I live with, acquaintances around town, and perform this art downtown at a coffeehouse. I&#39;ll be teaching a class at this coffeehouse soon on spiritual empowerment, the aim is to create a Mystic Cabaret that will be held a couple times a month for people to share their own practice. I garden. I bake organic, authentic Bavarian pretzels with my housemate and deliver them on my bike to local establishments as a way to finance myself and support the local economy. This business is growing rapidly and will provide energy to fund community projects and other small, budding businesses.</p>

<p>Am I some paragon of political action? Heavens, no. But I support local establishments and farmers, support the people within my radius of operation, produce things of value, reduce the level of institutional influence on my life and perspective, and so forth. </p>

<p>I find that perspective is incredibly valuable in this struggle, and in that way, spirituality provides ways that we can benefit ourselves and one another. In the war over consciousness, which is <em>the</em> war that is happening, people are falling into traps. They are waiting for someone or something to save them, be it Jesus, the Pleadians(sp?), the pole shift, 12/21/12, economic bust, etc. People must understand that the individual is the only one capable of healing themselves and becoming better, wiser, more complete. No one and nothing else can fill that role for us. We must help ourselves in every sense of the word. In a world where indigenous and authentic spirituality has nearly become eradicated, and the new spiritual movement is immersed in a drug-induced apathy and electronic dance music, we must reclaim the original outlook of sacred perspective. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s never cool to be told that you&#39;re not doing enough, that you are part of the problem. But my question is, if we acknowledge a conspiracy (which literally means &quot;to breathe together&quot;) why are we not creating one ourselves? One in which we work toward <em>our</em> vision, <em>our</em> goals. There is no need to fight, we must simply be free and act freely in accordance with what we know to be true. If you know these things, why wait for them to happen? Why not adjust our lifestyles to be more free, to live and love without fear? The lesson here, ultimately, is to overcome complacency. We can be mad as hell, but we have to live our lives in a way where we won&#39;t take it anymore, otherwise, we <em>will</em> take it. Ya dig?</p>

<p>What I&#39;m ultimately saying is that each and every one of us <em>must</em> conquer the fear of the looming darkness within ourselves if we are to defeat it. Idly talking about it and theorizing is not enough. Telling other people how fucked up things are is not enough. We must each work toward harmony and the solution. And the solution lies within the problem! Just stop feeding it your energy. Be aware of it, but channel it toward the world <em>you</em> want. Otherwise you are just spinning the wheel faster toward it by inciting paranoia and living your own life in fear and mistrust.</p>

<p>This community is the one that can make the most impact. You all are aware of the bondage we face if we allow it to transpire. You have the knowledge. Apply it in the form of wisdom within your life! We are all magicians living in a Mercurian society, we can all shape the world into what we want instead of allowing the will of some crusty old lineage to devour us. I seek to empower you, not berate you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are pooping. </p>

<p>Pooping yourself into a hole of fear and misery, your senses completely closed to compassionate wisdom that has been given freely with care, love and empowerment. You will continue to wallow in the poop of your own misery, questioning why life is so unfair, and living in eternal regret for your lack of action and meeting the responsibility you have to your loved ones, yourself, and the rest of the human race. You will come to realize that your trolling of sincere wisdom is, in fact, supportive of the status quo that you are so disgusted by. You will continue to poop your own power away until you realize that this is not a TV show, this is life, and this will come to affect you directly. Your remark sums up the complacency of the American people you likely find to be so ignorant. You are afraid - afraid that you may actually be a part of the problem and that you may actually have to do something about it. </p>

<p>Enjoy pooping in comfort while you are still able to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, that&#39;s reading into that comment a little heavily.  I poop also, nearly everyday, and I am a pretty happy go lucky individual.  My apathy in relation to &quot;what are YOU doing to change things?&quot; type questions is one of the cornerstones of my existence.  I firmly believe that things will not get better until they get worse; does that mean I should try to postpone what I believe to be inevitable and draw out this period of decline or that I should actively participate in the things I abhor yet have accepted as necessary to make the period of transition and pain as quick as possible?  Crushed between these viewpoints I have decided the most important thing for me to is persist in my happiness, spread a message of friendship, tolerance, and love and treat the people in my life in a fashion indicative of my belief system (ie, not to be a total hypocrite).  I am not miserable, I do not question the fairness of existence or regret anything, ever, other than the rare instances I say I will do something and then fail to follow through.</p>

<p>I am committed to a dark future, or at the very least a period of darkness before a coming new dawn.  I understand what it means, and I will mourn my family when the darkness takes them, but I will believe they died as martyrs for a cause more important than any individual life, maybe more important than most lives: a reorganization of the socioeconomic infrastructure, the end of the illusion of money, the disintegration of Old World style nation states, and the necessary escape from inevitable doom that is being a one planet species.</p>

<p>There is no stopping what is coming, and I wouldn&#39;t want to stop it even if I could.  I don&#39;t live in fear or paranoia or even day to day apathy; I am happy and pleasant in spite of the darkness rising, and I consider every day I can still enjoy modern amenities a luxury that could be torn away at any moment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice you believe this will happen without violence but I disagree.  I think violence and death, whether it be war, famine, disease, nuclear disaster, whatever, is necessary for humanity to proceed to the next stage of its development.  Love isn&#39;t going to resolve the problems inherent to culturally ingrained concepts of racism, sexism, justification for war and rape, the demands of a military-industrial complex, the greed of politicians the world over.  It&#39;s going to take a whole lot of dead bodies.  I hope I&#39;m not one of them but I&#39;m ok with it if I am.  I walk without fear into an uncertain future and though I hope for the best I am committed to the worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a much better answer than by responding with poop. I appreciate your time in writing this out.</p>

<p>I am not so naïve to think conflict is totally unavoidable. But I am hopeful that in the creation of an alternative model of society, the energy of the current one will be drained to the point of its inability to function, and that the alternative model will be appealing for those locked into the military-industrial complex, and other institutions. Ideally, people will walk away from their post to join in cooperation. I think that is the heart of my perspective. We are coming to experience the limitations of old ideas and perspectives, and for many people it will require a great shock for them to wake up. But the question is, can a peaceful alternative model be just as shocking as a violent, conflict-ridden one?</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/FalseTautology.html">FalseTautology</a> 2013-10-08</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I would certainly be shocked if it were successful.  Not meaning to be overly pithy but peaceful solutions would seem to be the historical exception to the rule; I can only think of a couple examples in history of a concerted attempt at a peaceful resolution that succeeded (off the top of my head, at least), the Indian struggle for independence led by Gandhi and the American civil rights movement championed by Martin Luther King Jr. and both ended less than ideally and not wholly without violence.  India ended up being split along religious lines and America is  still very much divided along racial lines, at least in some areas, to say nothing of the brutal assassination of Dr. King.  If there any examples you can provide of successful (or more successful) peaceful movements I would be very interested in hearing about them; I have a predictably ethnocentric view of world history.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that people will give up their lives of luxury and sloth and excess because they see some people from a demographic they probably don&#39;t like and don&#39;t respect singing songs together in the dark without electricity, not to mention that the media will not support such a movement in any way; you would be utterly reliant on the internet which seems a little difficult in a bunch of off-the-grid communes, not to even mention the hypocrisy of using computers and networking while espousing a worldview of returning to nature and simplicity.  To think people, let alone jaded, cynical middle class Americans, will walk away from their SUVs and 60 inch televisions to join an ideal that many view as having peaked decades ago is so unlikely as to be ludicrous, to me at least.</p>

<p>You say it will require a &quot;great shock&quot; to wake these people up, but what are they waking up to?  Presumably that they are tiny cogs in a massive machine run by the few to exploit the many, that they have been lied to their entire lives, that politics are a game of the rich, that finances are an magic trick performed by the same, that war and crime are businesses, that television is mind control, etc.  And how would they respond to this sudden shock?  Presuming that they would act calmly and rationally and then decide to trade it all in for a life of spiritual awareness seems more than a little optimistic; it would be more realistic to assume riots, looting, a breakdown of society as civilization reshuffles itself.</p>

<p>I have nothing against your particular brand of New Age spiritualism; it doesn&#39;t do anything for me and I see aspects of it as potentially detrimental to what I consider important.  Regardless it wouldn&#39;t bother me, probably, if your movement succeeded.  The problem, as I see it, is trying to pull it off now, with all these people doing pretty well for themselves, living in houses, eating fast food, watching cable, enjoying air conditioning, etc.  Strip them of all of that, kill off 2/3 of the Earth&#39;s population with a good old fashioned Wrath of God event while leaving our modern infrastructure behind, then imagine how much easier it will be to convince people of your viewpoint.</p>

<p>The real question has nothing to do with whether a peaceful model can be as shocking as a violent one, the question is how many people will die.  That is the measure of a societal paradigm shift.  How many died in the fall of Rome, how many died in the Mongol invasion, how many died in the revolutions against the aristocracies, how many died to end imperialism, how many died to end communism, how many died to achieve civil rights for everyone else?  How many will have to die to end the current era and usher in the next?  And which approach can minimize these deaths?</p>

<p>My view is that postponing the inevitable (recycling, conserving resources, humanitarian interventions across the world but especially Africa, resisting GMO&#39;s, reducing consumption, etc etc) will extend the period of decline, thus increasing the number of casualties and jeopardizing the survival of the human race and, by proxy, the survival of this planet.  If, instead, we exacerbate these problems, make them worse and worse until the breaking point is reached, we might be able to initiate the changes that will make a true long term difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious, so you&#39;re an accelerationist!!</p>

<p>I respect this viewpoint, it affirms a pattern. </p>

<p>Semantic as the following assertion may be:  For the record, I am not a New Age proponent. New Age philosophy is like easy-bake occultism, and is largely passive. I believe that love conquers all, yes, but that we can be firm in our circumstances and giving the world around us some tough love. </p>

<p>And maybe not so much that as much as cultivating a new paradigm with love and care. Yes, there will still be people performing their routines... But as people adopt new lifestyles, it will showcase a new potential. It doesn&#39;t have to be a publicized thing, and it shouldn&#39;t be. This is just a matter of individuals empowering their reality in simple ways. Performing action with intent, basically. It is really that simple. As soon as you intentionalize an action, you understand its implications in the world. You are no longer blindly accepting what is around you, you are <em>choosing</em>. We don&#39;t need to march, we don&#39;t need to rebel. We just choose!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding.  In regards to your intentionalization of actions and choice, I suppose this is something that I already do, but as part of a larger, more complicated (and probably borderline schizophrenic) life philosophy.   I am acutely aware of the implications of many of my choices and I choose, with great deliberation, the lifestyle I lead.  Some people look at it as me justifying the lifestyle I have chosen after the fact but this is not the case; I have simply chosen to live a life of optimistic cynicism.</p>

<p>I am afraid I misunderstood the intent of your previous comments.  I respect your viewpoint as well; it is very close to my father&#39;s.  He and I have debated at great length the merits of each other&#39;s belief systems and in the end it came down to this: mine is just too dark for him.  He doesn&#39;t argue it factually or logically, he simply doesn&#39;t accept it as the best case scenario.  We mutually respect each other&#39;s opinions and I think is the best one could ask for in such a situation.</p>

<p>I was also unfamiliar with the term &quot;accelerationist.&quot;  Part of me is glad others have the same worldview while another part is saddened to discover I&#39;m not as clever as I thought I was, ha.  I can tell from even a brief search that the definition is very close to my global perspective; I guess that will make discussing politics a little easier?  Anyway, thank you for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think sitting down and reflect upon ones inner self through spiritualism would help the society much, usually quite the opposite. Too much of spiritualism, &#39;tho not all, tend to be more egoistic rather than altruistic. Learning about social science and the structure of society, politics and law, and reflecting upon that, might be the way to bring about positive change in society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>have you looked into the &quot;project your awareness/reality&quot; part of spirituality? i started transitioning from conspiracies to new age spirituality last year. basically it says you create your own reality in your head. if you constantly surround yourself with such emotions, that is what will manifest in your reality. i think bashar (the channeler) talks about this, as well as many other people. needless to say, im not a big fan of new age spirituality either. ive learned over the past couple years to take everything with a grain of salt and an open mind. ive selectively taken what i wanted from all these conspiracies and spirituality and have made my life more worth while. i hope you all can too. namaste?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s some interesting aspects of New Age philosophy, I&#39;ve seen Bashar&#39;s videos and they are convincing. It depends on whether or not you truly believe you can transcend into another parallel universe. In a way I see this as dangerous, as it can promote reclusive activity and isolation. New Age philosophy, to me, does not handle the shadow aspects of psyche very well. It seems to ignore them. There is a lot of waiting - waiting for aliens, waiting for poles to shift, waiting for whatever. Though ultimately love and compassion, the heart of new age philosophy, is agreeable. Namaste :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think spirituality has its own &quot;rewards&quot; and punishments and that it&#39;s best to not use it as leverage to change the fact that the system can&#39;t crash without some death and destruction. We&#39;re on a path to a very grand, archetypal kind of destruction and an important thing we can do is just to be very awake to what is happening and <em>not</em> try to stop it. The best we can do is acknowledge that through inaction--or active particpation--we helped cause what is unfolding and, as you point out, also forgive ourselves for not being perfect.</p>

<p>I also believe that the universe or the God totality can take care of itself and doesn&#39;t need any more people trying to do a spiritual battle with the people we perceive to be evil. What we&#39;re seeing is the last desperate attempts of the elite to grasp onto control. They&#39;re losing it. someone wrote, &quot;when you stare into the abysss, the abyss stares back at you.&quot; (Something like that.) So don&#39;t worry about what &quot;they&quot; are doing. </p>

<p>All that being said, it&#39;s still important to try to act with compassion and with the needs of the community in mind. But I don&#39;t want to be part of some program where we&#39;re all supposed to be spiritual. There&#39;s always some wolf that takes advantage of those situations and decides to wear the cloak of holiness and lead people off to the jungle in Guyana. Or, a less dramatic and sinister scenario: people just start to edit themselves and get involved in groupthink when they&#39;re on a group spiritual endeavor. That&#39;s probably why the poster above said he/she is &quot;shitting&quot;. I too want to live in a world where it&#39;s okay for me to say, &quot;I&#39;m just shitting. Not sending white light. Not being heart-centered. Just shitting at the moment.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Above all, I am simply saying that sacred process, as part of our lives, has largely left the consciousness of the many. If nothing else, to view life and our place in it as sacred is an empowering thing, you know? It isn&#39;t about gurus, or churches, or any of that. It&#39;s about, quite simply, inviting what <em>you</em> hold to be sacred into your consciousness. That&#39;s all I mean, just getting in touch with yourself, others and the environment through a perspective that moves past materialism. </p>

<p>There is no &quot;program&quot; because the emphasis is removing the program and returning to an organic lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. If You have a lot of inner struggle, externalizing it might just spread negativism and hatred. But what you describe here is mostly selfish, because; learning to feel good about yourself by believing in &quot;magick&quot;, as you call it, and believing good thoughts alone can heal anything is just a way of internalizing positive energy without any real benefit to others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand magick, and this is my fault by not conveying it properly.</p>

<p>Magick: Causing change with the conformity of the Will.</p>

<p>How can this be applied? Most easily by applying it inward, to remove the inner obstacles that we face in self-expression. The enactment of psychodrama, for example, in morphing the subconscious. The subconscious is the mysterious source of our perspective, how we act and react through life. If we change how we perceive subconsciously, we simultaneously change how we act, react and thus are perceived. In the performance of a group ceremony or ritual, the participating individuals bind themselves to a purpose or goal, strengthening their resolve.</p>

<p>One step further, magick is attributed to Thoth/Hermes/Mercury, archetypal representations of communication. So by performing art, we perform magick. Look at how the Beatles affected the world. You might say they made music, but that music changed consciousness in ways that only they could have done. Look at Alan Moore&#39;s V for Vendetta, the Guy Fawkes mask as a symbol of revolution. <strong>Art is incredibly powerful in changing consciousness.</strong> </p>

<p>More mystical aspects of magick such as the famous story of the Kabbalist in Poland or the Battle of Mons in the UK are mysterious. Powerful as they might be, I can&#39;t claim to understand how they work or whether or not they work at all. The above is more or less what I&#39;m getting at.</p>

<p>So you see this isn&#39;t about sitting in one&#39;s room, being inactive and casting spells to themselves hoping to bring about change from a comfortable position. This is about fueling the fire of change within ourselves and others on a deep level, ya dig?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have anything significant to contribute to what you&#39;ve said, but would like to give you some sort of positive feedback other than an upvote. Yes, we <em>should</em> arise, &quot;get out of bed&quot;, and start living in a more engaged way. People need to take part in Life as a whole, and this means thinking outside of our small, individual lives and take the whole into account. I&#39;m preaching to the choir, of course. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll probably won&#39;t get much of a response to your post, but don&#39;t let that get you down. There are tons of people like me who feel like they are waiting for someone else to raise up a flag that I can get behind...looking for someone else to take the first step. But dammit, what will that get me? I believe that the fight for true freedom (whether the enemy is corrupt gov&#39;t, our laziness, hate from a fellow human being) is indeed spiritual in nature that the entire human race is enduring. There is Good, there is Decent, and there is Bad, but it all averages out to be the collective consciousness of the world that we know. When more people start following whatever higher principles they feel are worth aspiring to, that&#39;s when the world improves.</p>

By spreading a message of fear you divide yourself from others, or sow division in others&#39; lives. Take the stance of creation as opposed to destruction. What is <em>your</em> ideal world? How can you be an instrument in its creation? In action you gain satisfaction, you are recognized and no longer afraid. You become an inspiration to yourself and others. You have acknowledged the shadow, therefore it is for you to face. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. If You have a lot of inner struggle, externalizing it might just spread negativism and hatred. But what you describe here is mostly selfish, because; learning to feel good about yourself by believing in &quot;magick&quot;, as you call it, and believing good thoughts alone can heal anything is just a way of internalizing positive energy without any real benefit to others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>have you looked into the &quot;project your awareness/reality&quot; part of spirituality? i started transitioning from conspiracies to new age spirituality last year. basically it says you create your own reality in your head. if you constantly surround yourself with such emotions, that is what will manifest in your reality. i think bashar (the channeler) talks about this, as well as many other people. needless to say, im not a big fan of new age spirituality either. ive learned over the past couple years to take everything with a grain of salt and an open mind. ive selectively taken what i wanted from all these conspiracies and spirituality and have made my life more worth while. i hope you all can too. namaste?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think spirituality has its own &quot;rewards&quot; and punishments and that it&#39;s best to not use it as leverage to change the fact that the system can&#39;t crash without some death and destruction. We&#39;re on a path to a very grand, archetypal kind of destruction and an important thing we can do is just to be very awake to what is happening and <em>not</em> try to stop it. The best we can do is acknowledge that through inaction--or active particpation--we helped cause what is unfolding and, as you point out, also forgive ourselves for not being perfect.</p>

<p>I also believe that the universe or the God totality can take care of itself and doesn&#39;t need any more people trying to do a spiritual battle with the people we perceive to be evil. What we&#39;re seeing is the last desperate attempts of the elite to grasp onto control. They&#39;re losing it. someone wrote, &quot;when you stare into the abysss, the abyss stares back at you.&quot; (Something like that.) So don&#39;t worry about what &quot;they&quot; are doing. </p>

<p>All that being said, it&#39;s still important to try to act with compassion and with the needs of the community in mind. But I don&#39;t want to be part of some program where we&#39;re all supposed to be spiritual. There&#39;s always some wolf that takes advantage of those situations and decides to wear the cloak of holiness and lead people off to the jungle in Guyana. Or, a less dramatic and sinister scenario: people just start to edit themselves and get involved in groupthink when they&#39;re on a group spiritual endeavor. That&#39;s probably why the poster above said he/she is &quot;shitting&quot;. I too want to live in a world where it&#39;s okay for me to say, &quot;I&#39;m just shitting. Not sending white light. Not being heart-centered. Just shitting at the moment.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would certainly be shocked if it were successful.  Not meaning to be overly pithy but peaceful solutions would seem to be the historical exception to the rule; I can only think of a couple examples in history of a concerted attempt at a peaceful resolution that succeeded (off the top of my head, at least), the Indian struggle for independence led by Gandhi and the American civil rights movement championed by Martin Luther King Jr. and both ended less than ideally and not wholly without violence.  India ended up being split along religious lines and America is  still very much divided along racial lines, at least in some areas, to say nothing of the brutal assassination of Dr. King.  If there any examples you can provide of successful (or more successful) peaceful movements I would be very interested in hearing about them; I have a predictably ethnocentric view of world history.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that people will give up their lives of luxury and sloth and excess because they see some people from a demographic they probably don&#39;t like and don&#39;t respect singing songs together in the dark without electricity, not to mention that the media will not support such a movement in any way; you would be utterly reliant on the internet which seems a little difficult in a bunch of off-the-grid communes, not to even mention the hypocrisy of using computers and networking while espousing a worldview of returning to nature and simplicity.  To think people, let alone jaded, cynical middle class Americans, will walk away from their SUVs and 60 inch televisions to join an ideal that many view as having peaked decades ago is so unlikely as to be ludicrous, to me at least.</p>

<p>You say it will require a &quot;great shock&quot; to wake these people up, but what are they waking up to?  Presumably that they are tiny cogs in a massive machine run by the few to exploit the many, that they have been lied to their entire lives, that politics are a game of the rich, that finances are an magic trick performed by the same, that war and crime are businesses, that television is mind control, etc.  And how would they respond to this sudden shock?  Presuming that they would act calmly and rationally and then decide to trade it all in for a life of spiritual awareness seems more than a little optimistic; it would be more realistic to assume riots, looting, a breakdown of society as civilization reshuffles itself.</p>

<p>I have nothing against your particular brand of New Age spiritualism; it doesn&#39;t do anything for me and I see aspects of it as potentially detrimental to what I consider important.  Regardless it wouldn&#39;t bother me, probably, if your movement succeeded.  The problem, as I see it, is trying to pull it off now, with all these people doing pretty well for themselves, living in houses, eating fast food, watching cable, enjoying air conditioning, etc.  Strip them of all of that, kill off 2/3 of the Earth&#39;s population with a good old fashioned Wrath of God event while leaving our modern infrastructure behind, then imagine how much easier it will be to convince people of your viewpoint.</p>

<p>The real question has nothing to do with whether a peaceful model can be as shocking as a violent one, the question is how many people will die.  That is the measure of a societal paradigm shift.  How many died in the fall of Rome, how many died in the Mongol invasion, how many died in the revolutions against the aristocracies, how many died to end imperialism, how many died to end communism, how many died to achieve civil rights for everyone else?  How many will have to die to end the current era and usher in the next?  And which approach can minimize these deaths?</p>

<p>My view is that postponing the inevitable (recycling, conserving resources, humanitarian interventions across the world but especially Africa, resisting GMO&#39;s, reducing consumption, etc etc) will extend the period of decline, thus increasing the number of casualties and jeopardizing the survival of the human race and, by proxy, the survival of this planet.  If, instead, we exacerbate these problems, make them worse and worse until the breaking point is reached, we might be able to initiate the changes that will make a true long term difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious, so you&#39;re an accelerationist!!</p>

<p>I respect this viewpoint, it affirms a pattern. </p>

<p>Semantic as the following assertion may be:  For the record, I am not a New Age proponent. New Age philosophy is like easy-bake occultism, and is largely passive. I believe that love conquers all, yes, but that we can be firm in our circumstances and giving the world around us some tough love. </p>

<p>And maybe not so much that as much as cultivating a new paradigm with love and care. Yes, there will still be people performing their routines... But as people adopt new lifestyles, it will showcase a new potential. It doesn&#39;t have to be a publicized thing, and it shouldn&#39;t be. This is just a matter of individuals empowering their reality in simple ways. Performing action with intent, basically. It is really that simple. As soon as you intentionalize an action, you understand its implications in the world. You are no longer blindly accepting what is around you, you are <em>choosing</em>. We don&#39;t need to march, we don&#39;t need to rebel. We just choose!</p>
