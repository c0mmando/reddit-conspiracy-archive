       They want Social Security, have forever. Obama is working hand in hand with Boehner to set up the take. The looting has gone so overboard that the only way out (
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       it were actually about deficit) is to TAX THE MOTHERFUCKING SICK-AS-SLIME OBSCENELY COCKSUCKING RICH-AS-RICH-CAN-BE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't have that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they are going to take Social Security. It's nothing but an epic robbery. That multi-trillion dollar chunk of solvent cash that just sits there, driving the elite mad, not connected to the deficit... waiting to be used by poor people? Haha,
       <strong>
        FUCK NO
       </strong>
       . What else
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       it turn into in the end? It's always the take, always robbery. You can bet the night that America learns it has lost it's retirement safety net there will be some of the most disgustingly, unfathomably lavish parties thrown by the elite. I'm talking Eyes Wide Shut fucking creepy extravagance.

       Is this satire? What in the hell are you talking about? That money does not exist. There is no "social security" account somewhere with "multi-trillion dollar chunk of solvent cash" that is just ridiculous. That account is full of IOUs from the government. Its a ponzi scheme.

       They stole social security a long time ago.

       What maxabrazillion said.  It's called the Social Security Trust Fund.  Congress has 'borrowed' ALL of that trust fund money and spent it.

       Oh fuck off. I'm very aware it's not just 'the poor' you ass. My reference to the 'poor' was relative to the scumbags that sit on billions and only want billions more. Like from SS. Because it's there. Yes, to them, we are poor. Shit to them, lowly single-digit millionaires are poor. I don't watch Fox News, never have, who the hell are you to start telling people what their lives are like or summarily deciding where they get their info?

       First of all, you took one comment about one experience and spun it into I'm a paranoid schizophrenic?! It was either a virus delirium or my ex was feeding me Oxys, hoping I'd fuck his loser ass again. Thanks for the compassion, you hateful sad little man.  But either way, the poster has a warped view on SS. Poor or not, employed Americans pay in &amp; withdraw when it benefits them. It's not just welfare grannies...

       lol, what?  I'm sorry, you clearly are misunderstanding what SS is.  My father, age 67, has done pretty well for himself.  He has a nice retirement plan and plenty of assets and land.  The $2,200 he draws every month from SS is a small fraction of his monthly income.   He would be just fine without his SS.  Now, on the other hand, my grandfather is 86 and lives off his $2,200.  He doesn't have much else, so he lives very frugally.  If he lost SS, he would literally have nothing to fall into and would lose his home he's owned for 60 years.
       <br/>
       Now, I don't know what you're trying to say by pointing out that everyone draws SS, but it would ruin a lot of people's lives if SS was suspended.

       Yes, you have hit the nail on the head here. The UK/EU/1% want to further specialize the US function as a war machine so that the US takes the blame for all of the actions that it is directed to take by the Europeans. It is Colonization 2. The US is becoming a type of banana republic for Europe/UK/the ownership class again. You don't need healthcare because you are expendable anyway.

       The UK elite have never dropped their "we are superior" viewpoint, and they want to stick it to the US for having to be bailed out by the US during the WW2. It is kinda strange because there was a religious Jew vs. Christian fight going on while a protestant vs. Catholic fight while there is a UK vs. Everyone else fight going on, while a class everywhere war to boot. But, they kinda hate the US for having to have been bailed out by them (But perhaps they wanted Hitler to win over Stalin) But, anyway, the US is overreaching on the military budget. We might be able to get somewhere if we get some renewable cheap energy source quickly but as it stands now, the US is going downhill quickly.

       I tend to think it transcends national boundaries and is more of a 0.01% vs everyone else thing.  The sinfully wealthy have all gotten on the train of becoming part of either the rentier class, receiving public goods to monetize under the guise of privatization, or the financial class that is just a more sophisticated version of the rentier class.

       What they found is that America loves to pick fights and the easiest way to extract a lot of money from US taxpayers is by labeling it "military" spending when in reality large chunks of that are to support services run by contractors that are connected to politicians by the hip or for procurement of goods where the budget overruns on the development make the Big Dig look like a well run program.  Remember when the Iraq War could be won for a mere 100 billion?

       Definitely transcends borders, but the UK was the traditional leader and the aspire to regain the crown from the US. The 1% like to pal around with each other, but they also compete with each other too.

       They like to steal from the poor via the government. This is their major con. Control of mines, ag, and industries is a way to make bucks.

       The US does NOT love to pick fights. The US has traditionally been isolationist, and the people are against today's wars. Wall St., the 1% and the UK/EU are into wars because they profit.

       I agree that they generally do not care about the nation/people, but they do want to win against their peers.

       I think if there's one thing to say about the British, top to bottom, its that they covet a historical "special relationship" with the united states for both security, trade, and position. The UK has stepped away from Eurozone policies and increasingly isolated itself from Europe in many respects. There are absolutely not any European Elites manifesting control over America for European aims. There are no broad European Aims. The continent is a swathe of different politics and countries that, with the exception of hurdles leaped by the EU in trade and law, don't have a cohesive military structure or even similar aims. Every country has a different future in mind for Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why say I don't know anything about history, and then remark about his "decent theory". Its nonsense and made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course elites are going to think they're better then someone else - that's a merit of elitism!
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the British still upset about unpaid stamp taxes from 1774 and the loss of the war of 1812? Of course not, because its nonsense.

       I am sorry that my explanation of the past 100 years or so of history in 7 lines of text was a bit garbled. The UK were the leaders of the world for quite a long period of time, but their control was never really total. They were afraid of Russia because it is huge. Similar population to US and vast resources. So they got Japan to attack it in 1905. Russia defeated and 1rst revolution. Germany rising in Europe and WW1. Russia again defeated and 2nd Revolution. Soviets (largely poor Jews) take over European investments and kill the Monarchy. This pisses off the Capitalists and the European Monarchies. They feel threatened by a good example of a revolution. What if the workers took over in our country too? Germany defeated when Wall St (largely rich Christians and Jews) has US enter war on UK side. Balfour promises Jews Israel. UK also promises Palestinians Israel. Cue Hitler and a repeat of WW1 with better tech. The Capitalists (I G Farbin, IBM, Standard Oil etc.) supported Hitler and probably wanted him to win against the Soviet Communists Jews. The US supported Russia against Germany because they felt Germany was becoming too strong. The UK (later the US) always uses this ploy of having the 2nd and 3rd strongest powers fight to weaken them both. (that would be China vs Japan or China vs the US  (EU/UK is richer/smarter than US) in the next war for those counting.) So, this time Russia won and then UK generated the Cold War between the US and USSR via the Iron Curtain speech and the fact that the Soviets were assholes. The Cold War weakened and destroyed the USSR and the US. That is the explanation for our present situation.

       There will be no default, and if there is a default it will be massively propagandized as "reform." In 1971 Nixon defaulted on the American debt by unilaterally closing the gold window, but it became propagandized as "reform" and "free-market."
      </p>
      <p>
       Down the line? Monetized debt. This means massive cost inflation and loss of purchasing power, and the continued downsizing of the American dream. It will be wrapped in "green"-washing, and the government will continue to hand out a pittance (shrinking ever smaller due to inflation).

       i dont think so, i think they want to default in the worst possible way, they want a revolt, so they can finally disarm the people on the pretext that they revolted on the government and every shaky mind will approve. most of the lower class have been so dumb down by any means possible they dont even understand what their government is doing. it is starting to be really scary. people are still debating if 9/11 was an inside job, the people of afghanistan dont even know why the f*** usa came to their country even after 10 years, how is that even possible. they are writing in school books, AL CIA'DA attacked usa on 9/11. the building fell because a plane hit and the fire cause the building fall, RIGHT! they have bluffed all teh way and you guys have fold every time. when are us citizens going to play their card, because the game is very boring to watch.

       Hey now...you can't just group all middle class Americans into a generalization of brainwashed retards...I'm working my ass off for cotton paper that literally has no monetary backing whatsoever just so I can pay bills, feed my cat and keep my lady happy. But living in the middle of all of this shit is a little more complicated than ''folding every time''. There are a lot of us that realize the bullshit that spews from politicians mouths and the indoctrination that's happening...but until the government makes a mistake, there's not much we can do but sit on reddit and bitch to others about how stupid they are for falling for it in the first place.

       if you keep doing nothing, everything will stay the same, thats what most american think just like you, so nothing will change, it is stupid to think, you cant make a difference, a butterfly fap its wing in africa, can cause an hurrican in america, every actions have a result, fap your wings, show others what to do, if everyone keep doing this, maybe your country will change. I know its not 100% of americans, but a big majority arent doing anything to fix the problems, they dont even talk to their political leaders, they just watch it on tv and think, someone will do something. on friday, truckers are going to DC to shutdown highways and arrest some congressmen, see these guys growth balls and are doing something, why cant you?

       First off, your premise on the butterfly effect is flawed in that over 95% of the population in America has no influence at all when it comes to political decisions. The whole trucker thing is bogus as well...there is absolutely no chance that they will arrest anyone, it's just media hype to show people that others are doing something about it so the rest of the population can sit on their asses and feel better about what's actually going on. Just because you read some shit on the news doesn't mean that you know whats going on. I agree with you that a lot of people sit around and do nothing. But if you actually buy into the whole democracy bullshit about how everyones ideas and values matter, you are just as blind as they are. America is not a democracy. I'll reiterate again, the bottom 95% of income citizens have ZERO influence on what happens in any and all decisions related to the government. A vote doesn't change the outcome. Individual revolt only results in being picked off and marked a terrorist. The only thing that we can do is peacefully watch our leaders blanket the masses with lies and terror, we can inform those who are willing to listen about what is really going on, we can argue with others on the internet who we don't see eye to eye with, and for those of us who are keen on issues and skilled in navigating through all the bullshit on the internet and finding worthwhile content will remain the informed and will pursue the best course of action. Where, might I ask, are you from?

       thats where you are wrong. I think people can actualy have an influence. your government have been hijacked and you just sit and watch? we can see where american valor still are.... none. Doesnt me saying this offend you? In canada if we arent happy about something we say it and political leaders dont do it or change their plan, but in usa u guys just do nothing, nobody cares or they cares but do as you say, sit and watch. Anyway... 8 days left and ur country will fail miserably, i have my popcorn ready while u guys watch jersey shore

       It doesn't make me mad that you're saying this. I know you're wrong, but it doesn't make me mad. What irritates me is your poor grammatical skills...along with the fact that you think you are just going to 'sit back with popcorn' and watch the US fail. Canada, along with the US and every other large nation is based on the Central Banking system. If we fail, which is inevitable, yes...that means catastrophic effects across the globe. It doesn't make sense to argue with someone who generalizes Americans as all the same. It also doesn't make sense to me that you are talking down at me, when you're obviously a young kid who has read a couple of articles and bases all of you beliefs on mainstream media. Go read a book. Please...and then come back and talk once you figure out how to debate like a civil person.

       Yes it is essentially a false flag.

       Government is reeling from NSA revelations and  general push back.  Public begins to understand that the two parties are actually one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Use the lunatic fringe of one party to do something so monumentally stupid that everyone rushes to grab the pants leg of the executive and call him papa, and create a huge drama around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what's happening now.  It's all theatre so that Obama can save us from the debt ceiling, and everyone will love him again, and he can make it treasonous to question the NSA, and he can quietly go on persecuting the five real journalists we have left.

       Meanwhile everyone else turns into absolute sheep because they aree dumb as fuck and run to the safety of authority figures the instant the tv tells them the sky is falling.

       You are way overestimating their cohesion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The democrat and republican parties see themselves as enemies. There is no false dichotomy to them as you or I see it probably see it. This is just political posturing, apparently the Republicans have their heads stuck so far up their own asses they thought they could iwn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking that eitehr of those caucuses have enough brain power among them to pull some sort of diversionary tactic is just paranoid delusions. This will probably end in another 50 years of democratically a controlled house

       Man obviously the actual legislatures feel that way.  They're also dummies, and theyre bought off with a bit of bribery and a bit of petty power.  That's all they want.  The one's bribing them have the actual agenda.  These are large corporate interests, national security interests, and military/industrial interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not paranoid delusion either.  Look how fucking dumb these guys are on health care (this debate is allowed, within reason) but on the NSA issue it's lock step.  Curious, right?  The sphere of debate is defined ahead of time and as long as the stooges stay in line they can posture and whine all they want.

       Well they are worried about those issues becuase of getting re elected.

       It is much easier for me to believe that 6 corporations are doing a great job of controlling public perspective on policy, especially on national defense and Israel. Than it is for me to believe the entire Republican Party is throwing a fit to protect Obama's political legacy and the NSA's legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have problems centering around corporate power. In my opinion the "fight" against communism gutted our liberal class and all we're left with is a red and blue party with basically the same ideas. They are still fighting just no real good can come of it now

       Not a bad scenario. Theres dozens of very well thought out, highly plausible, and some nightmarish. It kind of reminds me of those Pentagon think tanks that do nothing but wargame ever conceivable scenario for a possible conflict then come up with OPLANs to counteract it.

       this is all leading to a new new deal.  The focus of funding is going to be on Americorps style civil service programs, military and education programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect we'll go about a week past the budget deadline and this will get worked out with a timeline to austerity (maybe another 1-2 years before services start being shifted)
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the banks are working out a deal to fund these programs if we turn the public education system over to them.

       You could be absolutely right, but I really don't see that playing out with our current banking crisis.  I'm thinking we raise the debt ceiling again without much immediate repercussion.  Greece was a victim of it's position.  In addition to being a pariah, the EU/Germany wanted a share of it's publicly owned energy business.  It was also an american strategic interest as the mediterranean gas fields opened up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "bankers' coup" is a balancing act.  How do we develop emerging markets, increasing demand and lowering the cost of labor, while maintaining the current power structure?  Security infrastructure in the US is in no way ready for the crisis austerity would bring to the streets.  The US economy is actually in a decent condition for now with the new trade agreements (TTIP and TPP) and a plan to sell gas in emerging markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll be cutting back on services, sure, but the ideal is to profit off of the human resources and provided services.  As we see the value dip in higher education (impending bubble) privatized  secondary schooling is looking like a lucrative area to shift attention to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new deal I'm suggesting will focus on graduates and attendees of privatized institutions, as a way to pay off the incurred debts of eduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you about a coming banking crisis.  We'll see another housing collapse coupled with an education bubble and subsequent bailout.  We may or may not even get downgraded again.  I'm guessing next year or the year after, but the resulting austerity will mimic the pain of the 08 crisis rather than being worse.  We have another 10 to 15 years before the real austerity hits.

       I think it is quite clear that they are pushing the shift from public service to private. Everything for the profit motive. The quality of the goods or service do not matter. What matters is the amount of profit that can be had.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I think we going back toward a type of slavery... perhaps the term feudalism would be better?
      </p>
      <p>
       Housing is in a new (fake) bubble. Education loans are in a new real bubble. Soon to crash. I do not see any bailout for the holders of the educational loans. That is the point. To put the people into debt sevitude. I think we SHOULD be downgraded again, but whether Moodys will have the guts to do it again, I doubt it. They got nailed when they did that. If intrest rates go up and the pain becomes intense, then it could happen in 5 years or so. Oil may peak in a few more years too. But generally, I agree with you that we have to look for more like 10 years before the big one hits.

       Hey now...you can't just group all middle class Americans into a generalization of brainwashed retards...I'm working my ass off for cotton paper that literally has no monetary backing whatsoever just so I can pay bills, feed my cat and keep my lady happy. But living in the middle of all of this shit is a little more complicated than ''folding every time''. There are a lot of us that realize the bullshit that spews from politicians mouths and the indoctrination that's happening...but until the government makes a mistake, there's not much we can do but sit on reddit and bitch to others about how stupid they are for falling for it in the first place.
