    <div class="md"><p>They want Social Security, have forever. Obama is working hand in hand with Boehner to set up the take. The looting has gone so overboard that the only way out (<em>if</em> it were actually about deficit) is to TAX THE MOTHERFUCKING SICK-AS-SLIME OBSCENELY COCKSUCKING RICH-AS-RICH-CAN-BE.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t have that. </p>

<p>So they are going to take Social Security. It&#39;s nothing but an epic robbery. That multi-trillion dollar chunk of solvent cash that just sits there, driving the elite mad, not connected to the deficit... waiting to be used by poor people? Haha, <strong>FUCK NO</strong>. What else <em>would</em> it turn into in the end? It&#39;s always the take, always robbery. You can bet the night that America learns it has lost it&#39;s retirement safety net there will be some of the most disgustingly, unfathomably lavish parties thrown by the elite. I&#39;m talking Eyes Wide Shut fucking creepy extravagance.</p>

<p>Is this satire? What in the hell are you talking about? That money does not exist. There is no &quot;social security&quot; account somewhere with &quot;multi-trillion dollar chunk of solvent cash&quot; that is just ridiculous. That account is full of IOUs from the government. Its a ponzi scheme. </p>

<p>They stole social security a long time ago.</p>

<p>What they want to do is take the IRAs, the 401ks, the private pensions, etc. </p>

<p>You are just angry and operating with slogans. not facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, what?  I&#39;m sorry, you clearly are misunderstanding what SS is.  My father, age 67, has done pretty well for himself.  He has a nice retirement plan and plenty of assets and land.  The $2,200 he draws every month from SS is a small fraction of his monthly income.   He would be just fine without his SS.  Now, on the other hand, my grandfather is 86 and lives off his $2,200.  He doesn&#39;t have much else, so he lives very frugally.  If he lost SS, he would literally have nothing to fall into and would lose his home he&#39;s owned for 60 years.<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to say by pointing out that everyone draws SS, but it would ruin a lot of people&#39;s lives if SS was suspended.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The UK elite have never dropped their &quot;we are superior&quot; viewpoint, and they want to stick it to the US for having to be bailed out by the US during the WW2. It is kinda strange because there was a religious Jew vs. Christian fight going on while a protestant vs. Catholic fight while there is a UK vs. Everyone else fight going on, while a class everywhere war to boot. But, they kinda hate the US for having to have been bailed out by them (But perhaps they wanted Hitler to win over Stalin) But, anyway, the US is overreaching on the military budget. We might be able to get somewhere if we get some renewable cheap energy source quickly but as it stands now, the US is going downhill quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to think it transcends national boundaries and is more of a 0.01% vs everyone else thing.  The sinfully wealthy have all gotten on the train of becoming part of either the rentier class, receiving public goods to monetize under the guise of privatization, or the financial class that is just a more sophisticated version of the rentier class.</p>

<p>What they found is that America loves to pick fights and the easiest way to extract a lot of money from US taxpayers is by labeling it &quot;military&quot; spending when in reality large chunks of that are to support services run by contractors that are connected to politicians by the hip or for procurement of goods where the budget overruns on the development make the Big Dig look like a well run program.  Remember when the Iraq War could be won for a mere 100 billion?</p>

<p>The top elites really don&#39;t care for the nations they come from except as a source of reliable large income for doing close to nothing in return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely transcends borders, but the UK was the traditional leader and the aspire to regain the crown from the US. The 1% like to pal around with each other, but they also compete with each other too. </p>

<p>They like to steal from the poor via the government. This is their major con. Control of mines, ag, and industries is a way to make bucks. </p>

<p>The US does NOT love to pick fights. The US has traditionally been isolationist, and the people are against today&#39;s wars. Wall St., the 1% and the UK/EU are into wars because they profit. </p>

<p>I agree that they generally do not care about the nation/people, but they do want to win against their peers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if there&#39;s one thing to say about the British, top to bottom, its that they covet a historical &quot;special relationship&quot; with the united states for both security, trade, and position. The UK has stepped away from Eurozone policies and increasingly isolated itself from Europe in many respects. There are absolutely not any European Elites manifesting control over America for European aims. There are no broad European Aims. The continent is a swathe of different politics and countries that, with the exception of hurdles leaped by the EU in trade and law, don&#39;t have a cohesive military structure or even similar aims. Every country has a different future in mind for Europe.</p>

<p>Why say I don&#39;t know anything about history, and then remark about his &quot;decent theory&quot;. Its nonsense and made up.</p>

<p>Of course elites are going to think they&#39;re better then someone else - that&#39;s a merit of elitism!</p>

<p>Are the British still upset about unpaid stamp taxes from 1774 and the loss of the war of 1812? Of course not, because its nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sorry that my explanation of the past 100 years or so of history in 7 lines of text was a bit garbled. The UK were the leaders of the world for quite a long period of time, but their control was never really total. They were afraid of Russia because it is huge. Similar population to US and vast resources. So they got Japan to attack it in 1905. Russia defeated and 1rst revolution. Germany rising in Europe and WW1. Russia again defeated and 2nd Revolution. Soviets (largely poor Jews) take over European investments and kill the Monarchy. This pisses off the Capitalists and the European Monarchies. They feel threatened by a good example of a revolution. What if the workers took over in our country too? Germany defeated when Wall St (largely rich Christians and Jews) has US enter war on UK side. Balfour promises Jews Israel. UK also promises Palestinians Israel. Cue Hitler and a repeat of WW1 with better tech. The Capitalists (I G Farbin, IBM, Standard Oil etc.) supported Hitler and probably wanted him to win against the Soviet Communists Jews. The US supported Russia against Germany because they felt Germany was becoming too strong. The UK (later the US) always uses this ploy of having the 2nd and 3rd strongest powers fight to weaken them both. (that would be China vs Japan or China vs the US  (EU/UK is richer/smarter than US) in the next war for those counting.) So, this time Russia won and then UK generated the Cold War between the US and USSR via the Iron Curtain speech and the fact that the Soviets were assholes. The Cold War weakened and destroyed the USSR and the US. That is the explanation for our present situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will be no default, and if there is a default it will be massively propagandized as &quot;reform.&quot; In 1971 Nixon defaulted on the American debt by unilaterally closing the gold window, but it became propagandized as &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;free-market.&quot; </p>

<p>Down the line? Monetized debt. This means massive cost inflation and loss of purchasing power, and the continued downsizing of the American dream. It will be wrapped in &quot;green&quot;-washing, and the government will continue to hand out a pittance (shrinking ever smaller due to inflation).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, your premise on the butterfly effect is flawed in that over 95% of the population in America has no influence at all when it comes to political decisions. The whole trucker thing is bogus as well...there is absolutely no chance that they will arrest anyone, it&#39;s just media hype to show people that others are doing something about it so the rest of the population can sit on their asses and feel better about what&#39;s actually going on. Just because you read some shit on the news doesn&#39;t mean that you know whats going on. I agree with you that a lot of people sit around and do nothing. But if you actually buy into the whole democracy bullshit about how everyones ideas and values matter, you are just as blind as they are. America is not a democracy. I&#39;ll reiterate again, the bottom 95% of income citizens have ZERO influence on what happens in any and all decisions related to the government. A vote doesn&#39;t change the outcome. Individual revolt only results in being picked off and marked a terrorist. The only thing that we can do is peacefully watch our leaders blanket the masses with lies and terror, we can inform those who are willing to listen about what is really going on, we can argue with others on the internet who we don&#39;t see eye to eye with, and for those of us who are keen on issues and skilled in navigating through all the bullshit on the internet and finding worthwhile content will remain the informed and will pursue the best course of action. Where, might I ask, are you from? </p>

<p>Government is reeling from NSA revelations and  general push back.  Public begins to understand that the two parties are actually one.  </p>

<p>Use the lunatic fringe of one party to do something so monumentally stupid that everyone rushes to grab the pants leg of the executive and call him papa, and create a huge drama around it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what&#39;s happening now.  It&#39;s all theatre so that Obama can save us from the debt ceiling, and everyone will love him again, and he can make it treasonous to question the NSA, and he can quietly go on persecuting the five real journalists we have left.</p>

<p>Meanwhile everyone else turns into absolute sheep because they aree dumb as fuck and run to the safety of authority figures the instant the tv tells them the sky is falling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is all leading to a new new deal.  The focus of funding is going to be on Americorps style civil service programs, military and education programs.</p>

<p>I suspect we&#39;ll go about a week past the budget deadline and this will get worked out with a timeline to austerity (maybe another 1-2 years before services start being shifted)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the banks are working out a deal to fund these programs if we turn the public education system over to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could be absolutely right, but I really don&#39;t see that playing out with our current banking crisis.  I&#39;m thinking we raise the debt ceiling again without much immediate repercussion.  Greece was a victim of it&#39;s position.  In addition to being a pariah, the EU/Germany wanted a share of it&#39;s publicly owned energy business.  It was also an american strategic interest as the mediterranean gas fields opened up.</p>

<p>The &quot;bankers&#39; coup&quot; is a balancing act.  How do we develop emerging markets, increasing demand and lowering the cost of labor, while maintaining the current power structure?  Security infrastructure in the US is in no way ready for the crisis austerity would bring to the streets.  The US economy is actually in a decent condition for now with the new trade agreements (TTIP and TPP) and a plan to sell gas in emerging markets.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ll be cutting back on services, sure, but the ideal is to profit off of the human resources and provided services.  As we see the value dip in higher education (impending bubble) privatized  secondary schooling is looking like a lucrative area to shift attention to.</p>

<p>The new deal I&#39;m suggesting will focus on graduates and attendees of privatized institutions, as a way to pay off the incurred debts of eduction.</p>

<p>I agree with you about a coming banking crisis.  We&#39;ll see another housing collapse coupled with an education bubble and subsequent bailout.  We may or may not even get downgraded again.  I&#39;m guessing next year or the year after, but the resulting austerity will mimic the pain of the 08 crisis rather than being worse.  We have another 10 to 15 years before the real austerity hits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is quite clear that they are pushing the shift from public service to private. Everything for the profit motive. The quality of the goods or service do not matter. What matters is the amount of profit that can be had. </p>

<p>So, I think we going back toward a type of slavery... perhaps the term feudalism would be better? </p>

<p>Housing is in a new (fake) bubble. Education loans are in a new real bubble. Soon to crash. I do not see any bailout for the holders of the educational loans. That is the point. To put the people into debt sevitude. I think we SHOULD be downgraded again, but whether Moodys will have the guts to do it again, I doubt it. They got nailed when they did that. If intrest rates go up and the pain becomes intense, then it could happen in 5 years or so. Oil may peak in a few more years too. But generally, I agree with you that we have to look for more like 10 years before the big one hits.</p>
