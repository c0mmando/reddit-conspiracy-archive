       Everything that happened is real. And only a fool will think that it can not happen again. As I see it, it will happen soon enough again. First with the concentration camps. Then with the inhuman treatment. Then with the separation of healthy and not healthy people. And in the end the dehumanization process will have turned back to the time of the 3rd Reich.

       There is a scene in the movie, where the Jews are talking about a rumor, that the Germans were accumulating them in Ausschwitz and killing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the responses (even from people, who were already in concentration camps and had see so much evil) were, that they can't imagine that anything like this is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is the scary thing, that feels like it is going to happen soon. Imagine one more 9/11, and every civil liberty is history.

       Divide and conquer.  Just like Al Queda does not represent Islam, the small faction that pretends to be Jewish, but actually contribute to the holocaust don't represent the Jews.

       David Cole's videos are not only very, very good and poignant, but what happened to him afterward and the response he got by the ADL, etc is even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       telling.  He recanted all his statements because his life and the life of his family continued to get threatened.  Simple as that.  He got taken down by threats by racist Zionists.  It's pretty deep when there is a group posing as and supposedly representing the "Jewish people" who perpetrate a lie on a "veritable hoax" scale that is designed to benefit
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       at the
       <em>
        EXPENSE
       </em>
       of that group they claim to represent.  It's pretty deep when this group perpetrates this lie to such an extent that they are literally willing to kill members of the very group they claim to be part of in order to maintain the lie about that group they've convinced most of the world to erroneously believe.

       I remember hearing of him being recently rediscovered as a GOP consultant or some behind-the-scenes activity. I often wonder what really became of him afterward and what was really done to him at the time of his relative fame.

       Yeah, me too as a matter of fact.  I've wondered what became of him also.  Apparently he got quite a bit of a significant scare put into him because where he was once
       <em>
        super
       </em>
       passionate about spreading the truth about what really happened during WWII and the b.s. lies being spread by Zionism, etc, he is now...pretty much nowhere to be seen - period.

       They continue to be more and more indistinguishable from one another.  Indeed they may have been one and the same all along with Nazism even being the

       Definitely give it a listen.  There's lots of information in it and in the other link in that OP.  Just listen to it with a open, critical mind.  Lots of crazy information on this planet.

       That first thing you said.. I read about that when it happened too. We should all be keeping a hawk eye on that situation. It's literally a trial concentration camp, where they concentrate and control the homeless. We should all watch for any new developments around this area, I think this is crucial.

       The only similarity between the movie
       <em>
        Schindler`s List
       </em>
       and the reality of Washington politics is that both rely on pure propaganda to get their message across.

       I think one interesting parallel is that during the rise of Nazi Germany, there were competing "factions" of the military... much like today, with DHS and other agencies with questionable allegiances

       Presidential administration has fired 12 high ranking officials in the last few weeks, many heads of nuclear programs.
