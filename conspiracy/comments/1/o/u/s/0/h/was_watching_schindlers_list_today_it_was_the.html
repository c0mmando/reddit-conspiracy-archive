    <div class="md"><p>There is a scene in the movie, where the Jews are talking about a rumor, that the Germans were accumulating them in Ausschwitz and killing them. </p>

<p>All the responses (even from people, who were already in concentration camps and had see so much evil) were, that they can&#39;t imagine that anything like this is happening.</p>

<p>And that is the scary thing, that feels like it is going to happen soon. Imagine one more 9/11, and every civil liberty is history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Cole&#39;s videos are not only very, very good and poignant, but what happened to him afterward and the response he got by the ADL, etc is even <em>more</em> telling.  He recanted all his statements because his life and the life of his family continued to get threatened.  Simple as that.  He got taken down by threats by racist Zionists.  It&#39;s pretty deep when there is a group posing as and supposedly representing the &quot;Jewish people&quot; who perpetrate a lie on a &quot;veritable hoax&quot; scale that is designed to benefit <em>them</em> at the <em>EXPENSE</em> of that group they claim to represent.  It&#39;s pretty deep when this group perpetrates this lie to such an extent that they are literally willing to kill members of the very group they claim to be part of in order to maintain the lie about that group they&#39;ve convinced most of the world to erroneously believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, me too as a matter of fact.  I&#39;ve wondered what became of him also.  Apparently he got quite a bit of a significant scare put into him because where he was once <em>super</em> passionate about spreading the truth about what really happened during WWII and the b.s. lies being spread by Zionism, etc, he is now...pretty much nowhere to be seen - period.</p>
