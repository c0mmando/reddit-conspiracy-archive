       The White House stenographer's audio was dubbed incorrectly all over the mainstream media. If this was orchestrated by the usual suspects, why would they need to censor what was said? I'm not saying I know what happened but maybe, as per usual, they only highlighted the portion that would make her look insane to the average consumer. Perhaps this was actual resistance....If it was, the message must be pretty important.

       There are two possibilities. Either she did this for money or was a mind control victim. She said "For the past 2 and 1/2 weeks, the Holy Spirit has been waking me up in the middle of the night and preparing me (through my reluctance and doubt) to deliver a message in the House Chamber," she told Fox News' Chad Pergram in an email yesterday. "That is what I did last night.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also pretty close to what Aaron Alexis claimed (DC shooter who killed a lot of high profile figures in the Navy just days after
       <a href="http://benswann.com/president-obama-fires-high-ranking-nuclear-chiefs/">
        Tim Giardina fired. He was the second-highest ranking officer at the U.S. Strategic Command and oversaw the military's nuclear forces, missile defense, and cyber warfare operations.
       </a>
       ) His boss was also fired.
       <strong>
        Alexis said he couldn't sleep because he was getting microwaves beamed into his residence.
       </strong>
       This could be several things;
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9ApmyCDcyQ">
        Bone conduction technology
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htweap/articles/20071217.aspx">
        LRAD, which was used in Iraq
       </a>
       as a voice of God weapon,

        Audio spotlights
       </a>
       , etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So claiming this is "mind control" is not far fetched. Pick one; paid or controlled. I also don't think we should be too focused on this story though. It almost looks like a designed distraction.

       There is another possibility that this is a false flag to further push the point that conspiracy theorists and religious extremists are idiots that no one should listen to. If you check responses on other places other than r/conspiracy, you will see that the people are hating on religious people and saying that she was obviously just someone who is a religious nut that lost it.

       Those are the
       <em>
        only

       possibilities? How about she actually believes these things and thought it was worth her job to speak out? Or, she's nuts.

       When I first saw the uncut video before anyone pointed out the significance of the man, I thought to myself, why is Jim Moran talking to her?

       I see a lot of people speculating a congressman, but it is possible it isn't. If this government was more transparent, we could obtain not only the isolated audio feeds but also the list of present people that day.

       Also maybe it it wasn't even the real lady, what's the deal with the changing name? Is it Molly, as they call her in the elevator video, or is it the name they use on MSM 'Dianne Reidy'?

       MKUltra. I swear. Find the silver haired man, find who he was texting. It seems obvious, to me anyway, that he was trying to hide the fact he was texting someone, low phone, behind the back of another guy, trying to get surrounded by a small crowd so he could blend in...
      </p>
      <p>
       Her posture, her gait, her immediate sense of urgency while remaining seemingly calm, rant with conviction....all after talking to this man. It's just too weird....

       I am well aware that the media uses drama for ratings but I am also aware that the major "news" outlets have an uncanny ability to give one very specific perspective while leaving out many others. I am also aware that people such as Amber Lyon have leaked information concerning government agencies paying to have a specific narrative....but you're right I shouldn't use critical thinking.

       I agree with this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       What she said on stage was not publicly released and was dubbed over by other recordings of her outside of the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was her original message something more significant to what we heard? Seems like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the other gentlemen who supposedly gave her the "ok", it appears there is too much controversy in this discussion. What his main intention was with that woman- we may never know- but we do know that he had an interaction with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some are connecting these strange acts to make it appear as if it was staged; and whether or not it truly was, I am not sure we have close to enough credibility to make that accusation.

       I would tell you my opinion on what really happened and it would explain all the confusion and put the puzzle together, but all the Atheists here would downvote me and you would never see it. Damn shame they bring all of their old agreed upon ideas and messages of hate to this great subreddit.

       Thank you for making blanket statements about all of us. I appreciate the fact that you can see we're all exactly the same, and preach the same old, tired stories with fervor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than getting into a theological debate on a conspiracy sub, I for one, would be interested in hearing what -Money- has to say. It doesn't matter whether or not I personally believe in god, if SHE (the stenographer) does, then that might be reason enough for her to end her career. I understand that God comes first in Christian eyes, even though I don't view the world through them...
