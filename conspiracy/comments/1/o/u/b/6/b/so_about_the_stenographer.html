If this was orchestrated by the usual suspects, why would they need to censor what was said? I&#39;m not saying I know what happened but maybe, as per usual, they only highlighted the portion that would make her look insane to the average consumer. Perhaps this was actual resistance....If it was, the message must be pretty important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two possibilities. Either she did this for money or was a mind control victim. She said &quot;For the past 2 and 1/2 weeks, the Holy Spirit has been waking me up in the middle of the night and preparing me (through my reluctance and doubt) to deliver a message in the House Chamber,&quot; she told Fox News&#39; Chad Pergram in an email yesterday. &quot;That is what I did last night.‚Äù</p>

<p>This is also pretty close to what Aaron Alexis claimed (DC shooter who killed a lot of high profile figures in the Navy just days after <a href="http://benswann.com/president-obama-fires-high-ranking-nuclear-chiefs/">Tim Giardina fired. He was the second-highest ranking officer at the U.S. Strategic Command and oversaw the military&#39;s nuclear forces, missile defense, and cyber warfare operations.</a> ) His boss was also fired. <strong>Alexis said he couldn&#39;t sleep because he was getting microwaves beamed into his residence.</strong> This could be several things; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9ApmyCDcyQ">Bone conduction technology</a>, <a href="http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htweap/articles/20071217.aspx">LRAD, which was used in Iraq</a> as a voice of God weapon, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect">Microwave hearing technology</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cef4DDQ-CEc">Audio spotlights</a>, etc. </p>

<p>So claiming this is &quot;mind control&quot; is not far fetched. Pick one; paid or controlled. I also don&#39;t think we should be too focused on this story though. It almost looks like a designed distraction. </p>

<p>Those are the <em>only</em> possibilities? How about she actually believes these things and thought it was worth her job to speak out? Or, she&#39;s nuts.</p>

<p>Either of those seem more likely than your possibilities.</p>

<p>What she said on stage was not publicly released and was dubbed over by other recordings of her outside of the room. </p>

<p>Was her original message something more significant to what we heard? Seems like it.</p>

<p>As far as the other gentlemen who supposedly gave her the &quot;ok&quot;, it appears there is too much controversy in this discussion. What his main intention was with that woman- we may never know- but we do know that he had an interaction with her. </p>

<p>Some are connecting these strange acts to make it appear as if it was staged; and whether or not it truly was, I am not sure we have close to enough credibility to make that accusation. </p>

<p>Rather than getting into a theological debate on a conspiracy sub, I for one, would be interested in hearing what -Money- has to say. It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not I personally believe in god, if SHE (the stenographer) does, then that might be reason enough for her to end her career. I understand that God comes first in Christian eyes, even though I don&#39;t view the world through them...</p>
