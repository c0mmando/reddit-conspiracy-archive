       It was definitely a dry run.  The program has been up for 10 years and somehow magically it glitches the moment the government shuts down.

       Come on, it's quite obvious there are no coincidences at this point.

       I've never heard of this program fail at that level before, and it seems the states involved were cherry picked, meaning, they werent in a cluster running on the same network, they were scattered across the country with states in between having no effect at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I cant make sense is people saying if it fails, grocery stores will be cleaned out, seems the opposite will happen since a gigantic chunk of grocery buying public will suddenly have no means to buy any at all.  If the EBT system went down and stayed down, the grocery stores would suddenly have an overabundance and not be able to clean inventory out at the same speed they have been in the past.  Huge sales loss for grocery stores around the country and overstocked shelves.  The immediate loss of sales would probably cause increased prices to keep up with costs, and layoffs of grocery store employees.  There will also probably be a huge loss in the sales of junk food, processed food, soda, and the largest "biggest loser" weight program in history will take place as the United states goes from 33% obese towards European levels.  I'll dig up the study that showed an unusual chunk of the obese population were the ones receieving these benefits and using the free money and lack of nutrition education to buy the worst "food" on the shelf.

       They weren't looters, they were reacting to the other "glitch" that shown they had unlimited funds which happened for about 2 hours if you looked at your balance online.   People were calling their friends and rushed to stores in droves to pack their carts to the brim, only to find out the unlimited funds thing was bogus and carts full of food were left behind in the stores all across the effected states.  There wasn't any particular case of massive wholesale looting with people stealing food out the door.  That never happened, the food was left behind in almost every case.  I havent even read a single story where they attempted to flee the store with their carts of food.  Instead we got a thousand photographs of walmarts around the country dealing with dozens of abandoned carts stretched in long lines overflowing with food.  Yes shelves were emptied, but the food never left the store either and the food items were restocked.

       Do you really think those people thought 'unlimited funds? the government must be giving me a bonus.' No, they were taking advantage of it. Same fucking scenario will happen if they ever do lose benefits again and have to go more than a couple of days without their grape soda and frozen chicken wings.

       So looters then? They knew it was wrong and took advantage of it anyway.
Its like checking your bank account and finding that your balance is twice what it is supposed to be then withdrawing all of the money.. you will get caught and be punished.

       I agree. mrzisme is assuming all EBT card holders will maintain law and order. Let me tell ya, when people (EBT or not) are hungry there won't be much law and order to go around.

       A power outage effecting the entire north east of the country is actually explainable.  Systems going down in random states all across the country while other states in between work totally fine looks like a deliberate test of cherry picked states to see how the public reacts in different regions.

       Always a possibility, but don't underestimate the surprising amount of population that will quietly starve at home, thinking they're helpless to the situation.  Or the amount of people that will sit around praying to whatever God they believe in for the answer.  The violent, let's burn down everything, I'm gonna steal all your shit- group of folks, will come from violent people who've been fed up with the system for years, particularly poor black communities, as we've seen them burn down their own backyard in the past.   You can pretty much overlay a graph of a bellcurve of education with the bellcurve of how likely you are to burn your own neighborhood down.  If you look around your block and see even a moderate amount of violent crime and lack of education, get ready for Armageddon, your block is about to go full retard when dependency programs get turned off.

       While looking up that study, keep in mind that crappy, processed, unhealthy food is cheap. Healthy food is normally more expensive.

       Basically all the food you need is on the outside isles of any grocery store in the country.  All the trash is in the middle.  On the outside you'll find all your produce, fruit, eggs, dairy, meat, fish, etc.  Making the rounds on the outside of the isles doesnt make your grocery bill cost more than the guy in the middle isles blowing money on captain crunch, little debbies, mountain dew, frozen pizza and potato chips.   Since our family learned how to shop correctly our grocery bill hasnt gone up at all, it's actually gone down since we all drink water, that transferred directly to more steaks in the freezer.  It only goes up if you insist on shopping from locations like "whole foods", which I prefer to call "whole paycheck", but that's just my personal findings, adjust as required for your own location.

       My grocery bill definitely went up when we started eating healthier. I guess it depends on where you live.

       Maybe it is a test to see how asleep we are. Looking for there time limit before people are in the streets. This appears a very orderly dismantling of our freedom while everone is taking a nap. I guess we see if people decide to wake up or keep sleeping.

       No one can fully predict whats going to happen next. I think the story is suspicious but I don't think we should be worried till November IF EBT shuts down.
      </p>
      <p>
       but so many other things could happen within that time, quite frankly I don't think we will see the mother of all crisis coming
