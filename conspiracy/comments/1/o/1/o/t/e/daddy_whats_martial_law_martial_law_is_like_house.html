       "I just wanted to thank you so much for the work you did on "World War Z". The advice you gave on the aircraft carrier was extremely important to us and quickly gave us the realism that we wanted. Your leadership and knowledge helped us organize a shoot of a deck full of civilians, aircraft and crew. I asked many questions but you always had the answers. You knew what proper military procedure would be no matter what the situation. Working with you was a pleasure."

       Actually, the way that scene was done made it look like a big deal.  But, Pitt's character, having lived through nightmare situations like that firsthand, probably wasn't too pumped about going into the very serious and deep topic which would've opened up a million other questions about life, death, government and countless other dreary topics with his very young daughter who may not have even had to deal with death yet over family breakfast.  Not everything is propaganda.

       Are you even aware of how this works? The movie gets cool stuff like aircraft carriers and assistance with the accuracy of the movie in exchange for the rights to edit the scripts. It is a fact that the Hollywood Liaison Office does not assist movies who portray the government/military in a bad light. So yes, this is propaganda. Go away.

       There is no conspiracy. All of that is legal and has been done since 1927. Allowing this to be legal guarantees that many movies, like TopGun, would surface and change the opinions and attitudes of the population.

       People follow celebrities' dress. In the same way, people follow the opinions and attitudes portrayed in movies, especially if they like the characters or find them attractive.

       The Hollywood Liaison Office practices are not the "conspiracy" to which I was referring.  I'm referring to your nonsensical idea that two lines in a movie, that really only state oversimplified (as if he were talking to a child) fact, constitute a post here.

       It absolutely could.  That's not the case here, however.  It is very clear, even in the OP that he's claiming the first two lines from the movie are propaganda to condition us for martial law.  He clarifies this claim throughout the thread.  If I'm wrong, I'd be more than happy to hear from the OP the reasoning behind posting this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's really unfortunate is that there are hundreds of examples of this actually happening.  The lines he cited are not.

       A conspiracy is when a group of people plan something unlawful or harmful.  I wouldn't consider propaganda to have anything to do with conspiracies.  People know propaganda exists and that government produces it so it's no secret at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as what the OP is claiming specifically, I have no idea, I just think you are a bit on the, "I know everything" spectrum.  When I read it, I didn't think he was implying some grand conspiracy.  I just thought he was trying to make a point about martial law.

       To me, the OPs intentions were clear.  Don't see why you are having such a difficult time grasping it.

       You're refusing to read this in context just for the sake of arguing with me.  He is of the opinion that this is a movie that tries to make it seem like martial law is no big deal.  He bases this opinion on two lines at the very beginning of the movie; martial law is not referenced again in the movie.  I disagreed with him and gave him my reasoning.  He responded not by giving the reasoning behind his opinion, but by attacking my post history.  And I'm somehow attacking free thought?
      </p>
      <p>
       This would have gone very differently if he had defended his idea instead of going straight to the attacks.  When someone presents an idea, it is rightfully expected that they also describe the thought process behind that idea.  When it is revealed that there is no thought process behind the idea, as in this case, the idea becomes meaningless.

       I see your point, and it is a good one.

       I haven't seen wwz so I didn't know that.  Either way, the way I read it made it just seam like a harmless quip about martial law.  I mean, we can all agree that martial law isn't ideal regardless of posts that may or may not make complete sense, right
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I will never argue for the sake of arguing.  It's petty and immature.  I didn't understand where you were coming from.  And as far as him going straight to attacks, he tried explaining his idea.  You then said his ideas were nonsensical and started the attacks...  So, don't pull that shit.  You literally acted like an asshat and then got all butthurt when he pushes back.  Stop being such a pussy.

       Literally his very first reply to me made absolutely no reference to whatever idea he was trying to convey, it was just an attack on my post history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And an idea with no thought process is nonsensical.  It just is.  Is there another word I should have used?

       Personally I got a different message from what he wrote than you apparently did.  To me it made sense.  When I don't understand something I don't default to, "what they just said is nonsensical".

       I'm guessing he was just offended when you questioned what he wrote.  I honestly didn't understand the exact context of the quotes, but from what I can see it makes sense.  If that's how he interprets the lines, good for him.  Some things are up for interpretation and I don't think either of you know for sure what the writers meant, so for you to say your version is better or correct is just bullshit.

       I understand what he was saying.  It's not confusing in the slightest and he clarified later in the thread, but it's based in paranoia rather than fact.  I said it was nonsensical because his first reply made it very clear that he was just regurgitating something that just popped into his head.
If one gets so offended by someone questioning their post that he can't even DEFEND his post, he's too sensitive to be posting here.  "Question everything" is kind of a theme here, no?
And here's what I have to say about knowing what the writers were thinking; this movie would have been a prime candidate for martial law conditioning.  They could have worked in tons of references and propaganda.  But you haven't seen the movie, so I'll tell you what they did instead.  They made this ONE mention of martial law, the one the OP quoted.  We'll go waaaay out on a limb here, and say they wanted to be subtle or something and that's why they only made the one reference.  Even if that were true (and it's pretty farfetched), why would they write that the adult in the conversation (the only one really capable of sending the message) abandons his opportunity to make a pro-martial law statement just to change the subject?  The answer's pretty clear to anyone who looks at this logically; they weren't trying to send a pro-martial law statement.

       If you are referring to your bit of rubbish, I'd agree. It's users who stymie other's imagination who are unwanted and not required.

       This post isn't imaginative, it's reaching for something that isn't there.  When we 0ost ridiculous, baseless claims like this, it lowers the credibility of the entire sub, especially when people rush to the defense of this garbage.  If we allow this, we devolve into a massive circlejerk that won't be taken seriously by anyone.  Ever heard The Boy Who Cried Wolf?

       You have made the mistake of assuming everybody is defending this guy because of a "claim" that he made. He made no claims, they are defending him because you either a: don't get it or b: are a troll.

       He very clearly did make a claim.  "So yes, this is propaganda.". Even if he hadn't said it outright, I have no idea how else the OP could've been interpreted.  If I'm missing something, or am misinterpreting the post somehow, it'd be lovely if someone (preferably the OP, since you know just as much about his intentions as I do) would explain it to me.

       Do yourself a favor, re-read my last post. Read the sideboard. Try not to be a complete tool the rest of your life. I'd be lying if I said I believed in you but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
