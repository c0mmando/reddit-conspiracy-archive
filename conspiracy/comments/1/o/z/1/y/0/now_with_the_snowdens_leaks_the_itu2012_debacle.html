        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A few quotes from some sites pre-Snowden leaks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real story here is a world in which there are two competing visions for the future of the internet -- one driven by countries who believe the internet should be more open and free... and one driven by the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121214/14133321389/who-signed-itu-wcit-treaty-who-didnt.shtml">Techdirt</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It may be tempting to interpret the post-WCIT divide as a type of “digital cold war” pitting the United States and its allies against Russia and China. But a key difference separates Internet policy from traditional diplomacy: This debate is not reserved for governments. Governments are only one set of actors in Internet governance, and civil society groups and the private sector have traditionally played a critical role</p>

<p>After Snowden&#39;s leaks American (and its allies mainly Israel, UK, Australia) position on a &quot;free internet&quot; is to say the least hypocritical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my point is that less than an year ago, America was claimed as the saviors of the &quot;free internet&quot;, internet companies (American of course) lined up behind US as their savior against oppressive tyrannical regimes of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, and the UN</p>

<p>While most here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have known for a long time the reaches and dangers of the surveillance state, by some reason the information reached the MSM, and finally the attention of the short-spanned public opinion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s again the illusion of freedom and choice, while despots clearly state their regimes and oppress dissidents, the &quot;Western Democracy&quot; simply de-legitimize opposition and maintain the illusion of freedom.</p>

<p>What would&#39;ve been of ITU-2012 if the leaks happened earlier ?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snojob sounds so fake. Like Assange who OPENLY sold Israel leaks to the jewish supremacist new york times.  Let me repeat for the slow learners:  Wikileaks OPENLY sold information so it could be covered up. Who did Assange work with to gain money? The media advertising him. The same media constantly lying to you and covering everything up.    Notice these clowns keep the debate on &quot;america is the terrorist&quot; when in fact the middle east wars are ALL Israel related at the root and I can&#39;t seem to find a single time the muslims attacked us before the Master race started killing them to expand israel. (in fact its often the master race attacking us dressed as muslims; like the mossad arrested on 9/11, the lavon affair, the USS liberty, etc etc etc)</p>

<p>The same master race who controls the media that Assange openly sold out to, and is advertising Assange and Snowden. The same master race who sucked us into ww2 when our sworn enemies (the UK) promised to capture and give away their fairytale bible land if they turned America into their slave nation to defeat germany. </p>
