       <p>
        "There were probably about maybe four, five or six photos," said Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Md. "There are just a couple body shots. He was like, in a white undershirt and a tan robe."

       If he saw four, five or six photos he would know exactly how many.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also have lawmakers that have seen the photos so that should be proof enough for everyone.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "This morning at the CIA headquarters I saw the photos of a dead Osama bin Laden. I am convinced that this was bin Laden," Bachmann said in a statement. "We got our man."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Upon viewing the photos, he believes that there should be no doubt whatsoever that Osama bin Laden is indeed dead," a spokesman for Lieberman said in a statement on Thursday. "Senator Lieberman also agrees with President Obama's decision not to release the photos."
       </p>

      <p>
       However...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Three Republican senators, including Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA), were apparently fooled by a photograph circulating shortly after bin Laden's death, which showed a photoshopped image purporting to show bin Laden after he was killed.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I saw a photo of him deceased, obviously he had been wounded....when you see the picture it clearly has his features," said Ayotte.
       </p>
       <p>
        When asked how he, a high-ranking member of the Intelligence committee, could have fallen for photos that might not be authentic, Chambliss replied, "I was shown a photo by an individual that was represented to me as a picture of bin Laden after he's been shot that appeared to be an accurate photo. It was not an official photo." He said the person who shared the electronic photo with him was not an administration official.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So in the end, having or not having people saying that they saw the pictures of Bin Laden dead cannot be taken as final proof at all.

      <p>
       And then we enter in the realm of ignorance:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports the 40 minutes it took to kill bin Laden and scoop his archives into garbage bags were all recorded by tiny helmet cameras worn by each of the 25 SEALs.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Officials reviewing those videos are still reconstructing a more accurate version of what happened. We now know that the only firefight took place in the guest house, where one of bin Laden's couriers opened fire and was quickly gunned down. No one in the main building got off a shot or was even armed, although there were weapons nearby.

        The White House has maintained that it does not intended to release any of the photos or videos, but their existence has stirred much controversy.

       Anyone who believes in the official story of how they got Osama bin Laden is frankly a fool.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole evidence of his death is based on "you don't need evidence... just trust what your leaders have told you". It's complete horseshit if anyone thinks that's enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget the fact they lied a lot about what happened.
       <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/2/us-osama-used-wife-human-shield/">
        They lied about how Osama used his wife as a human shield
       </a>
       . Then
       <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/05/03/osama_human_shield/">
        the lie was retracted.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/navy-seal-shot-osama-bin-laden-sight/story?id=17200191">
        there is this whole story that he was shot on site.
       </a>
       However, that contradicts the story told by Osama's 12 year old daughter, who said
       <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/culture/2011/05/04/bin-ladens-daughter-says-he-was-taken-alive-then-shot-front-family-members">
        that he was captured alive and then shot in front of his family.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah I really doubt that we caught all their lies but otherwise everything else is true. That's some major BS that people are willing to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget that after all this was over, they gave
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/21/us/bin-laden-burial/">
        a traditional burial for Osama bin Laden, to send him off.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And people believe all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the members
       <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/26/world/bergen-who-killed-bin-laden/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">
        of the seal team even admits that the story was complete BS.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the truth?
It's like that Osama would have told us that and they didn't want him to do that. So he was murdered so that we would never hear the full story from the "enemy". Propaganda only works if we don't hear the other side of the story.
       <a href="http://cgi.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/">
        Keep in mind that Osama actually even denied being involved in 9/11
       </a>
       , and his FBI's most wanted list doesn't even
       <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/usama-bin-laden">
        state it as a crime that he committed.

       When they give fuck all evidence on such a sensitive topic to the entire western hemisphere you know something is seriously wrong.
If any al quida people are reading this your organisation has been infiltrated, your  radical islamic beliefs are horseshit.
Devotion to the god Allah who you must pray to 5 times a week for you're inherent sin is fantasy driven manipulation of billions of minds to fear and be controlled.

       Nevermind sourcing the MSM, look at the story as presented. Full of holes and just plain silly. Plus, after all of that, still no body. So we're expected to just believe all of it.

       OBL died of kidney failure in mid-December of 2001 in Afghanistan, because the US forces trapped him in Tora Bora, preventing him from receiving kidney dialysis. Not sure why this is such a big deal... all you had to do is just read the news:

       It's interesting that some of those people talk about confirmed DNA evidence. Did we ever to to see it? Just because the government says they are in possession of it doesn't make it true...

       Once they provided one false appearance by OBL they needed to prove any further dealings with or about him. They did not. No evidence,  means no credibility.

       If this were true, its not the type of thing Obama can organize by himself. Too many people would know too much. The people who really run America would have to have organized and executed this. One thing I am really sick of on this sub is the amount of people that believe that Obama is the devil or a dictator. Don't give him so much credit. He is just working a figure head job.
