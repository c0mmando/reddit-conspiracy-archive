       I don't care for his delivery of information personally, mostly because it's fear-based and over-emotional, but a lot of what he puts out there is right in line with what a lot of members of this subreddit seem to suggest. I don't really buy that TPTB are all devil-worshippers or whatever, but that doesn't mean he's a shill, he's probably just very Christian, being from Texas and all.

       You will never hear Alex talk about Israel being a part of the problem. Only the government. He has a jewish wife and is more than likely paid to not mention Israel as the true problem.

       I agree Jones is a fuckhead, but he talks about AIPAC. He just doesn't believe that being Jewish automatically makes you evil. You guys are just regurgitating a lie just like Jones does. You're no better.

       He does talk about Israel, if somebody twists his arm, but he gets off the subject as quickly as he can. He never talks about the Jews -- for example, he won't talk about Jewish control of the American media. I've never heard him refer to it once. He has said that the Saudis control Hollywood, which is absurd, and that the Chinese control Hollywood, which is also absurd. But never that the Jews control Hollywood. Also, he won't talk about  Jewish control of Congress. He talks about the Rothschilds, but not the Jews.

       No, he just gets tired of the frothing idiots like the ones in this stupid fucking thread constantly browbeating him to say JEW JEW JEW JEW, ZIONIST ZIONIST ZIONIST every other fucking sentence and so he basically tells these fucking momo's to fuck off.

       Interesting. He just mentioned his wife was Christian 2 days ago on his show. Another time I heard him ranting about the "globalists" and he seemed to tie in Israel with that group, saying something pro-Palestine, but then he gave some statement like, "I've got nothing against Israel, but... " I thought it seemed as if he accidentally got too specific. He likes to keep things vague.

       Yea, my girlfriend is a Jewish atheist. I don't understand why more people can't understand this concept. BTW I do think Jones is a fuckhead, and that's why they leave him alone. He makes us look bad.

       I agree with this post. I'm sure that members of many ethnicities and idealogies are involved in the elite's agenda. The governments of the U.S. and Israel are certainly involved in some severe abuse of people all over the globe and especially in the middle east, but that doesn't mean that Jews are evil.

       he talks about israel as a foreign power with a mettling intelligence agency who war mongers in the middle east and has a serious effect on US foreign policy.

       His wife and him are both catholic.

       She is JEWISH meaning that Agent Jones is 100% eligible to Israeli right-of-return laws.

       Why is this the top comment? He talks about Israel all the time and in all the right ways that he would need to without being labelled a racist neo nazi.. Which every paid group is lined up to do. Honestly, the worst thing about Jones is he is slow to acknowledge all aspects of his ego.. And as a world-wide radio/tv/internet personality that's not too bad. It's just not true at all that he doesn't talk about Israel.

       Can we stop conflating jewish people with certain right wing elements of the Israeli  government. Ireland is Catholic, does that mean all Irish people are  blamed when the Pope does something? You can disagree with the Israeli government on things without resorting to racism and misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all Israelis are jewish and not all jewish people are Israeli. And not all Israeli people support every action of their government.

       Pretty sure all the Abrahamic religions (so roughly 50% of the worlds population) believe god is our shepherd. Jews are like gods favourite sheep (perhaps someone who is actually a practicing Jew can elaborate).

       He doesn't blame Israel because he is an isolationist.   Bill cooper even said that it's not Hsu the the jews.  Although there are some very powefur ones involved.  He never blames Muslims either Alex blames the big bankers.  Why the fuck would they want him out there telling people to excersize their rights and to stick to their oaths.

       No need to be a dick.  I just can't picture Alex Jones being controlled.  he mostly covers stuff that is entirety blacked out by msm.  He is constantly on the side of vets and oath keepers.  He calls out the cops.  He doesn't blame everything on Israel every day bfd. But he does call them out periodically.  and he calls out the Jew bankers every day.  He just skips generalizing them as jews.  And to your link, the swiss are not anti interventional.  the swiss financed Hitler, the swiss flag was on the panthers during the invasion of Poland.  All the German reparation money still flows thru Switzerlands bank of international settlements.  That bank may be the tip of the pyramid so to speak.

       I think he is just trying to put on an entertaining radio show that appeals to Libertarians. He is a crazy alarmist at times, but that is his whole schtick. That's why people listen. Weird stuff happens in the world and people get sick of the mainstream narrative and want to hear something more outside the box. The only shilling I hear from him is for gold, water filters, iodine tablets and prepper supplies.

       Because he is still going. He makes a shit ton of money off DVDs, doomsday gear, views etc.  If he were legit, he'd be shut down.  He puts fear into people to leave them feeling stuck and useless instead of empowering them to do something to change.  Sounds like a good agenda for the elite, fear is the ultimate control

       Or they would ignore his statements as to not show any reaction...he is much more known than other journalists that wouldn't be as noticed if shut down. Go to YouTube. Hundreds of ppl have their accounts shut down for reporting the same things but they're too small to notice. Can't give him credence by openly reacting...

       He is being blackmailed and threatened. He's putting on a show to please those who have power over him. He misinforms but also he does drop bits of truth. He wants the truth out because only when TPTB falls will he be safe, but he has to tread lightly. He's not crazy, or a shill, he is doing what he is told for his own safety.

       He isn't being blackmailed or threatened.  He says he's being threatened all the time but then he rakes in his millions and buys sail boats to cruise around on with his family.  That doesn't sound like a man who is under constant fear of death.  He is just a guy who is "crazy like a fox."  He knows where his bread is buttered so he plays to that audience.  He covers some things you won't find in the MSM that are actually important but he also wildly speculates about things and injects notions of conspiracy where they don't necessarily exist.  If somebody slips on a banana peel he'd call it a false flag.

       You basically confirmed everything I said. He gets a fat check because his job makes him money, but it doesn't mean he is not under threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, he treads lightly as not to piss off his bosses, so he misinforms and gives bits of truth. He leaves it up to us to wade through it. Someone under threat can't go out saying that,
       <em>

       How is he being blackmailed?  He's living the life of a rich guy.  So apparently they aren't asking for money from him.  As far as treading lightly, again, how is he treading lightly?  He goes on Piers Morgan screaming like a lunatic and in his personal life he is smoking cigars with rich guys as scotch bars and taking people out on his boat.  He NEVER misses an opportunity to name drop a celebrity who he is "friends" with.
  If you are saying that he is under constant threat so in order to fend this off he needs to keep up appearances and seem as though he is fine, you are basically saying he is the greatest actor/most deceptive person of all time... which if he is that deceptive, again, how can you believe anything he says?

       He treads lightly. He never associates events with Zionism or Jews, because it's off limits.

       He HAS to keep up appearances, if he just disappeared, that would give TPTB ultimate legitimacy. They can't "disappear" him, but his family and his paycheck are all game.

       See here is the problem with any disagreements people have in this sub.  It becomes "you just can't understand [insert shitty point here]."  I
       <em>
        get
       </em>
       what you are saying, but it doesn't make sense.  People who are in fear for their lives or the lives of their families don't hob nob with celebrities.  As far as the Piers thing goes, did I say his points were shitty?  No I said that he was screaming like a lunatic.  (However it was utterly ridiculous when he challenged Piers to a boxing match... what was the rational point he was making there?).  As far as not associating with Zionism or Jews, his wife is a Jew.  The reason he doesn't talk shit about Zionism is most likely because he doesn't want to upset/offend his wife.  And as far as "disappearing" him?  That would be ridiculous.  He is one of the best things that ever happened to the establishment media/government.  The majority of people who just catch of glimpse of his program or youtube a few of his clips wind up thinking he is a maniac so they throw away everything he says (even the things that are true).  I can filter his information, but can you look past your own tendencies to finding conspiracy in everything long enough to consider that maybe Alex Jones is just a guy who found a niche market full of gullible people willing to spend their money on whatever bullshit he is peddling and that's the whole basis of his show?

       I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  You have to remember that this is also a man who claimed that he literally punched someone so hard that their nose came off their face.  And he runs 10 miles a day and swims 50 laps around his lake and bench presses 400 lbs (and yet he is still fat).  The guy tries to make himself a superhero.  It's all the lying about unimportant stuff like that that makes me believe he isn't credible.  I still listen from time to time and check out his site and find some things that are real but he muddies the waters for people who only report facts.  A guy like a Glenn Greenwald gets hurt by a guy like an Alex Jones.

       I think your comments are some of the more reasonable ones here. I don't say that to put down anyone else here, but it is important to use some critical thinking and not constantly jump to conspiratorial conclusions. I don't think there's anything wrong with making some money, (I'm guessing SCG channel is monetized) but it seems like Jones begins to cross the border into exploitation. 
I wish there were some more solidarity among those who would consider ourselves "awake". Many of us seem more focused on propogating our own theories than becoming unified under common goals. I understand that we all have different ideas, but engaging in argumentative behavior doesn't help anyone but our enemies.

       Yeah this is a problem that I run into a lot when I debate the existence of a conspiracy or not.  People become attached to their beliefs over the evidence (or lack there of).  It's a habit that a lot of people in the conspiracy community have formed.  People tend to come up with a conclusion, and then work backwards towards trying to justify how their conclusion is right (rather than starting with the evidence and working towards a conclusion).  I get a lot of downvotes for disagreeing even when I try to do so respectfully.

       You jump to a lot of conclusions...I'm not trying to insult you or anything, but it's just as erroneous to assume that everything everyone says is a lie as it is to assume that everything everyone says is true. It's very important to use logical critical thinking to produce sound arguments on these subjects rather than just looking for conspiracy everywhere. I've known people who have gone from posing reasonable questions about our civilization's situation to becoming obsessed with conspiracy to the point that they believe all of Val Valerian's insanity.

       whether or not he works for Israel only history will tell, and his ideas aren't fully aligned with this subreddit. He is dangerous to anymovement with the way he acts, he is one of the reasons that people think conspiracy theorists are so "wacko" and probably why this page only gets 180k subscribers.

I think he's the conspiracy worlds glen beck, he puts out just enough info to be slightly credible, but still pushes people In the direction that TPTB want people to go, he's even gone so far as to show up and take over rallies in Texas, I saw it my self, and having met the guy, semis kinda sketchy, but that's my opinion.

       Some of what Alex Jones says is brilliant. It really is -- he can come out with some wonderfully insightful observations. He will say things almost nobody else has the guts to talk about -- for example, he is almost alone in criticizing the mainstream media for demonizing Constitutionalists as racists.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then Jones will come out with the most absurd, childish piece of drivel and I will ask myself why I'm bothering to listen to this idiot. He throws temper tantrums like a three-year old. He has some kind of Tourette's affliction that makes him repeat lists of things endlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a very mixed bag of nuts, put it that way. He can be brilliant and incisive, and two minutes later he sounds like an idiot and a lunatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason some people think Jones is a shill for the elite is his reluctance to talk about the role of the Jews in the New World Order. Jones basically avoids criticizing the Jews.

       What reasons do we have to believe that Jews are more responsible than other nations/religions for the state of the world's power structure? I'm not challenging the idea, it's something that I've heard a lot, but never seen direct evidence for.

      <p>
       Some examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       1-) Look at some of the Russian oligarchs that became rich overnight after the fall of Soviet Union: Roman Abramovich, Mikhail Prokhorov, Vitaly Malkin, Boris Berezovsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Fridman... From the wikipedia page of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarchs">
        russian oligarchs
       </a>
       , at least half are eligible to benefit from the Law of Return.
      </p>
      <p>
       2-) Widely accepted as a fact is that the Russian/Bolshevik revolution that dethroned the Czar was headed by jews, and, while most of its members were not Jews, they were certainly overrepresented on the group. With the notable exception of Lenin, who was only a quarter Jew, most of the leading communists who took control of Russia were Jews. Trotsky, Sverdlov, Zinoviev...
      </p>
      <p>
       3-)  Even less known is that Mr. Nathan Rothschild was instrumental in almost
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family#The_Napoleonic_Wars">
        single-handedly financing the British war effort against Napoleon Bonaparte, apparently
       </a>
       . It tells a lot when the largest empire the world has ever seen at the time, the British Empire at its peak, had to rely on a single man to finance its most important war effort and its greatest threat, who, again, was a Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       4-) Most of the mainstream American media is controlled by Jews, including Hollywood (media shapes the beliefs and culture of American people).
      </p>
      <p>
       5-) The largest financial institutions in the world are also owned or controlled by Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       6-) The largest contributors to the presidential campaign of both candidates of US are also Jews. If you know how campaign donations work, those who gave more money get special seats on key offices of the government (such as Monsanto getting the FDA).
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, the western world is controlled by people that belongs do the Jewish ethnicity. It will reduce as China and, to a lesser extent, continental Europe rises.

       Looking at this thread alone you can see that he is
       <strong>

       Alex Jones is a STRATFOR employee hired for the sole purposes of spreading disinformation, making 'conspiracy theorists' look like lunatics, and to further any and all Zionist agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a con, plain and simple. A "honeypot" if you will for the FAR less advanced 'conspiratards.'
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a slave to George Friedman--Zionist owner of STRATFOR--and for rabid Zionist Jeffrey R. Smulyan, chairman and CEO of Emmis (Hebrew for 'truth') Communications--which also happens to own Agent Jones' flagship station in Austin.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people cut Jones' checks and tell him precisely what to say, when and how to say it, and what adverts for shafty gold dealers, seed vendors, and ineffective diet products go in between his embarrassing disinformation rants--in which Zionists or Jews are NEVER called out. Some say that his Jewish Zionist wife, Kelly Preston Nichols, is his agency "handler."
      </p>
      <p>
       If Jones had the balls to talk about the REAL problem facing this country--organized Jewry--Smulyan and STRAFOR would have him off the air immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember this simple chain: CIA&gt;Trapwire&gt;STRATFOR (Israeli agents)&gt;Molly Maroney&gt;Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does NOT get any clearer than that. He is there to fleece the goyim while letting the REAL criminals, the Zionist Ashkenazi Jews, get a free pass every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to know who 'they' will look towards first when the revolution comes? That's right...the suckers that are subscribed to PrisonPlanet and InfoWars and comment. If you do, trust me, it's too late--you have already been put on a list of "suspected" domestic terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is TRUE information and a very quick Google/Bing search will tell you all that you need to know--if that fucking INSANE rant on cunt Piers Morgan's show didn't already school you a bit. AJ is NOT ineloquent and is NOT stupid. He fakes "passion" incredibly well and very convincingly.

       I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  You have to remember that this is also a man who claimed that he literally punched someone so hard that their nose came off their face.  And he runs 10 miles a day and swims 50 laps around his lake and bench presses 400 lbs (and yet he is still fat).  The guy tries to make himself a superhero.  It's all the lying about unimportant stuff like that that makes me believe he isn't credible.  I still listen from time to time and check out his site and find some things that are real but he muddies the waters for people who only report facts.  A guy like a Glenn Greenwald gets hurt by a guy like an Alex Jones.
