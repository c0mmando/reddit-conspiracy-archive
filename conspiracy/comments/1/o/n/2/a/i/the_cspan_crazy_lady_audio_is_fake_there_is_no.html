       I switched to a credit union a while back on the National Credit Union Transfer day!  So many people made the switch, the act made national news.  Another thing one may consider doing is changing their W2 to 4 exemptions and set up a direct deposit to ones savings account.  This way you hold onto the money through the tax year as opposed to giving it over to the government.  Then just pay what you owe during tax season through the savings account.  Anybody?  Anyone?

       Congrats! I just started a new job so I'm really hoping I can sign up for a credit union soon, I didn't even know there was "holiday" for it.  So you claimed 4 dependents on your work W-2 but you're single? I claimed one.

       I guess it makes more sense to have that money in an interest earning savings account then to have the taxes returned to you.

       The U.S. doesn't pay much interest to private banks. They only about 2% of U.S. Treasury bonds.

       The Federal Reserve owns another 12%, but they give almost all the interest back to the government.

       It's kind of like musical chairs. Let's say we don't borrow any more money. Eventually, all debt is payed off. Who is left holding all of that lent-out money? Is there even enough money to cover the debt? I agree with you, but if you dig a little deeper it becomes even more fucked up.

       The government only collects $1T a year in income taxes. Almost half of that goes to military. Total debt is over $100T.

       Income tax is not the only source of federal government revenue. Total revenue is about $6T, most of which goes to non-discretionary spending. I'm also not sure where you got your $100T figure from; the total amount of US federal debt is about $16T.

       That unfunded liabilities approach to debt is not a very reasonable approach to looking at government spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, most credible sources cite the unfunded liability total over the next 75 years to be closer to $70-80 trillion dollars.  That sounds huge until you realize that we're dealing with nominal dollars, not real dollars.  In real terms, that $70-80 trillion represents about 125% of what our GDP would be 75 years from now.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, the real debt burden of unfunded liabilities is substantially less cumbersome than you make it out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that mean that it's a sustainable path? No.  Does it mean that you're painting a picture that's out of touch with reality and causes people to dismiss your point outright?  Absolutely.

       Why is this crazy? It's only crazy if it doesn't work. It works. We can borrow money like this indefinitely, because people are willing to lend to us. Also, you'll note that this process converges - if my interest payments are 1% of my principal, I only need to borrow 1% more to make those interest payments.

       You must realize that devaluation isn't a negative or a positive thing, so saying it's devaluing the US currency is just stating the obvious without any message. Like saying "sky is blue". Yeah? Point being? It can have very positive effects, depends.

       Clearly you don't know how to read the wiki. You might want to re-read that again. It clearly states what is negative about it. Now do you want me to define "negative?" Economic collapse is negative... or is that too much to assume?

       You said that inflation can't be talked about as a positive or a negative. This is definitely not true when a collapse can result from it. That was my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a collapse can result from it, then it is possible of talking about devaluing money as a positive or negative thing and it isn't just like stating "the sky is blue" as you previously suggested.

       A collapse as you say is one of the outcomes, mostly in an uncontrolled economy. All I'm saying is that it simply depends on the circumstances - inflation can be vitally beneficial or equally destructive.

       What's wrong with devaluing the US currency? That's actually GOOD for the working class in the long term. We have a huge trade deficit right now that would be eased by devaluing our currency (which, in turn, would result in less US government debt). It would also make American exports and labor more competitive, which would bring manufacturing jobs back to America. A strong US dollar is good for Walmart, not America.

       Yes, it means that Americans cannot buy goods from China as cheaply. This means that Americans will instead prefer to spend money at home. That's good for America, because it means less money leaves the country, and there are more American jobs. Similarly, other countries will now say, "Hey, American goods are looking cheap, compared to China, now," and they will buy American goods. Again, good for American workers. There is an important class component, here, because it increases the demand for American working-class labor.

       Isn't devaluing the US dollar raising the price of the goods  i.e. decreasing purchasing power? How exactly is that going to convince us to buy more from here when things are more expensive here?
      </p>
      <p>
       It means we cannot buy things from others because they don't respect our currency. We will turn to our own products because no one really values our dollar and not from our own choice. How exactly is the working class labor prices going to reduce? You didn't really mention that.

       A high-value dollar is good for the American ruling class. They can buy assets overseas, go on European vacations, etc. It also means they can make use of cheap foreign labor and sell those goods to Americans. This results in a net transfer of wealth overseas - a trade deficit. The value of this trade deficit is currently around $600 billion. This means that someone - either the US public or the US government - has to lose $600 billion, net, a year. This is a major cause of government debt accumulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A weaker dollar means that American exports are more competitive - let's say a Chinese car cost 6000 yuan and an American car costs $1100 dollars. At an exchange rate of 6:1, the American car is more expensive, so people will tend to buy the Chinese car - including Americans. Good for China, bad for the US. At an exchange rate of 5:1, the American car suddenly costs less, so people will tend to buy the American car.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been complaining about how the Chinese are holding American debt and propping up the value of the dollar relative to the yuan for years, but the same people, paradoxically, keep talking about needing a "strong" dollar, even though these two concepts are literal opposites.

       The term respect was used because in a lot of things, the US dollar is considered as the currency of exchange. It is what is valued in transactions based on oil i.e. the petro-dollar as many say. BRICS is considering making a different currency as the standard just because the US currency is losing its respect.

       This isn't actually factual. The reason people buy a lot of product overseas is because it is more reliable. US products don't last as much and aren't made as well. So it is not just a simple "because it is expensive" reason. Again, the labor here is going to get more costly as the values of the products go up. So the things you are stating as the benefits of inflation cannot be seen so far. Currently our dollar has lost a lot of value already... do you see people buying more things or less? I would hope you don't say "more".

       Because you don't seem to understand that the reason Chinese holds our debts is not because we keep buying from them but because we keep taking their money to pay off our debts. So that's money we have to repay to them and it's not a debt accumulated by buying their products.

       Exactly, if the purchasing power of the dollar depreciates to the point where manufacturing goods here is cheaper than outside of the u.s., that's quite a depreciation in value.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the value of products stayed the same, there'd be a proportional increase in price while wages remain the same, and that's before we take into account the increased cost of doing business in the U.S.  The average wage here is 10-13x what it is in china or india.  Then you have to factor in the
       <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/03/26/smallbusiness/employee_costs/">
        42% in costs
       </a>
       on top of wages due to taxes, benefits, and what have you.  So that raises costs to 14.2x-18.5x the labor cost of china or india respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everything increases in price like that, there won't be much money to spend on anything non-essential, and you end up with an economic collapse and mass unemployment.

      <p>
       How exactly is inflation going to reduce the price of goods in the US? This is what you don't seem to explain yet. You have explained why the prices are high in the US but haven't explained how it is supposed to go down if we lose enough value for the currency. I mean we have lost a lot of value from the dollar and yet I don't see things getting more affordable but more pricier. Are you making that claim that there is magical point when things will start dropping in price?

       I think you may have misread my comment.  I'm not saying that prices would drop.  I'm saying the exact opposite.  I was explaining the consequences of the falling value of the dollar and what would happen at the point where goods are cheaper to manufacture here [as oppose to manufacturing them outside of the U.S. at that point in time] as a result of the value of the dollar relative to foreign currency.  (maybe that's the source of the confusion?)  I mean that it would be prohibitively expensive, at that point in time, to manufacture something in china if the value of our dollar falls enough relative to their currency.  Prices would rise as a result of the increased cost of production.  I didn't mention anywhere that prices would fall as a result of all of this.

       relative to in a foreign market.  That's the only reason they would be manufactured here.  If a product in a foreign market is a steady value, and if their currency is a steady value, than if the value of our dollar sinks, it'll take more from our end to pay them the same price that we would pay today, but at that point in time, it would be more expensive to manufacture or purchase goods outside the U.S. than it would to purchase relative to inside the U.S.

       Just remember how much credit we live under today. As the dollar drops in value the value of what's owed decreases as well. It becomes less advantageous to be a creditor (so interest rates rise to make up he difference). For EXISTING debt at fixed rates...as is the case for many people's homes, devaluation is a good thing and bad for the banks.

       Well, goods that are purchased from other countries double in price, yes. This means it is more expensive to buy stuff made in China, but not stuff made in America. This means people (worldwide) will switch from buying Chinese-made goods to buying American-made goods. This is good for America.

       America doesn't manufacture many goods (relatively speaking) presently and will not become a manufacturing power overnight. Also, American goods won't become cheaper for other countries. Other countries will continue getting their goods at the lower prices from the nations producing at a lower cost. People worldwide would not switch to buying goods from America, people in America would switch to buying domestic goods. Ever heard of the Corn Laws? Duties were imposed on foreign grain when the world price was lower than the domestic price to encourage people to buy domestically produced grain at the domestic price (which was originally higher than world price before duties). People are then spending more money than they would have, given access to cheaper foreign grain. Thus, people are worse off (although those who make rents (the wealthy land owners) from sale of domestic grain are better off. Kinda similar here. People don't have access to cheap foreign goods now as the price has doubled, but the domestic price is still higher than the original world price. So the user who said the consumer would have less purchasing power isn't wrong.

The interest payments on the debt are already enormous and will eventually be overwhelming. We're running huge deficits just to stay in one place - not sustainable.

       I just got done saying that the interest payments on the debt are the lowest they've been in decades.

       If the American government has a problem, it is the ballooning cost of health care, NOT some abstract problem with debt, and certainly not with the recent debt accumulation resulting from stimulus to stave off a depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to right the ship of state we need to bring health care costs under control. If we did what any other country in the developed world does in terms of health care, we would be running huge budget surpluses. Debt, to the extent that it is a problem, is only a result of this other problem.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, the interest on the debt is NOT crushing, $400b/year is a level of debt service that the US government has no trouble handling. This is very low compared to its historical levels. The nightmare scenario is it might go all the way up to the level it was in the 80s and 90s, gasp. See
       <a href="http://www.cepr.net/images/stories/blogs/interest-as-GDP-08-2012.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       graph.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for how things will look when investors actually want a return on US bonds: that will be a different economic climate. The reason the US is picking up debt right now is because there is a recession, and we need to fill in the demand hole created by the collapse of the multi-trillion dollar housing bubble. This is also why the US can pay almost no interest when borrowing, because people are willing to sink their money into safe, reliable government debt right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest payments will go up when there are better investments and other places for people to put their money. This, presumably, will coincide with moving out of a recession. That will mean (a) the government does not need to spend as much to stimulate the economy (b) tax receipts will be higher. Both of these will decrease the need for US borrowing, meaning there's no reason to expect a higher interest rate to crush us.

       The Feds are absolutely concerned about ZIRP coming to an end. They know it can't last. You're right that rates were a lot lower even within the last quarter century, and when it eventually resets to that level (or,
       <em>
        God forbid
       </em>
       , higher) where does that leave us?

       Our system needs a constant expansion of debt to stop from collapsing on itself. We're living in the middle of the so-called hockey stick moment on the exponential growth curve, and it will be interrupted by a massive crash

       The government can run deficits forever without the debt burden growing, because we have productivity growth. Unless something completely awful happens, odds are your kids are going to be living in a society that is far more productive than the current one. So long as GDP growth outstrips the rate of debt accumulation, the debt-to-GDP ratio will keep falling over time.

       Also if interest rate on debt is lower than inflation rate, we actually earn money by borrowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: I borrow 1,000,000 USD at 1% APY. That is, I need to pay back 1010000 USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use this money to buy a basket of commodities. Suppose inflation rate is 4%, this means that this basket of commodities is now worth 1040000 USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I got 30000 USD for free, by borrowing and investing.

       I live in Australia and I can tell you straight up mate/ette that most of the material things we buy come from China and the like. We are raping our natural resources in exchange for cold hard cash, then we give it straight back to them to buy products that were made using raw materials that came from here and the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our only saving grace is farming, we sell on livestock, wheat and other produce(guess who gets the smallest slice of the productive pie in returns) and the money stays in Australia. The thing that helps keep the money in Australia is jobs in Australia.

       Keep in mind that I am an athiest. Now, the deal is no one knows what she said at the podium except the people in that room. They quickly and deliberately falsely presented the podium speech. Now thier claims are even more dubious.

       That aside, even if she were ranting and calling them out on a religous basis, I would be THRILLED. People NEED to start giving them trouble and at this point I don't mind too much the method. Good on her.

       The youtube linked here is just a video feed which occurred prior to the recorded audio. The recorded audio happened later, when shes being ushered out. You can see that here:

       At 11 seconds left, "Molly" would appear to be the name of the blonde that they are trying to tell to get OUT of the elevator, not Diane.

       if you check the new submissions view from about 13 hours ago the soundcloud link was submitted very shortly after a question about what had happened on cspan. At the time i thought it came in a bit quick. Maybe the soundcloud clip submitter can explain where he found the clip.

       I was wondering about that. I saw this go down live on CSPAN and submitted the self post within a span of minutes (I had to explain to my wife what I was freaking out about first).
      </p>
      <p>
       The audio file submission(soundcloud link) was a VERY short time later. I had even just finished telling someone that I didn't expect any video to be posted for another 30 minutes.

       For that audio recording to be legit would require someone who had either been present or have access to the audio feeds in the chamber.

       But...the writers WERE primarily members of the Masons. How much that matters can be debated...but the fact remains. Also With half the body politic making god an issue I do not see how anything she said was that different from what half the body politic says. Except where it isn't in line with thier goals.

       "Crazy" is such an effective word to use on someone, though. It tends to discredit them immediately. Just like "conspiracy theorist".

       That's because the audio is not from the house floor...  Molly is a woman they are telling to get out of an elevator, because the audio MSM is pushing as "House Floor" rant, actually happened here:

       They turn them off during the voting, because you have a bunch of lawmakers gathered near the podium talking about stuff. If they left the mic on at best you'd just hear a bunch of crowd noise and at worst you'd hear some underhanded deals being made on the floor by corrupt politicians.

       You can clearly see in the video from the floor, that the gavel is heard and she isn't so obviously the mic was off (nothing unusual about that) the audio of her rant is from her being escorted into the elevator far away from the floor.

       Yeah, I don't see where that audio is coming from.  How does she keep talking after she leaves the podium?  Did she have a portable mic?  Why did she walk up to the podium and bend over as though she were speaking into the microphone there?  If it was a directional mic, why doesn't it pick up the hammer?  It seems that this has been edited.  By whom?

       Is it possible that they are trying to make "conspiracy theorists" into extremists and looneys? Just thinking possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean to us it makes sense why she would do this but to people who have no idea who free masons are or atheists themselves, this would look like looney talk.

       Just found this on a youtube video....... According to Ros-Lehtinen, Reidy "came up to the podium area beneath where I was standing and asked me if the microphones were on. I said that I didn't know. I assumed that perhaps I was chatting too much to the helpful parliamentarians around me. Then she suddenly faced the front and said words like 'Thus spoke the Lord.' And, 'This is not the Lord's work.'
      </p>
      <p>
       "I hammered to get control and hush her up. She said something about the devil. It was sudden, confusing and heartbreaking. She is normally a gentle soul."
      </p>
      <p>
       Moments later, Reidy was heard to say that America was not one nation under God because Freemasons wrote the Constitution as Capitol Police officers put her into an elevator. The disruption appeared to rattle members of Congress already jumpy after two weeks of partisan invective over the partial government shutdown and Thursday's debt ceiling deadline.

       Yup, never was; until the 50's when everybody was clamoring over themselves to prove they weren't "Godless Communists," the founding fathers were mostly enlightment-era idealists...

       The constitution has nothing to do with God, it mentions A non-specific "Creator", but other than that is mostly about how the government is supposed to work.

I am going to say unless this is a serious production from outside of c-span, then they just use the phone line to play it, you are wrong.

       You're correct.

       Most Masons only go to the third degree and never advance (the rest of the degrees can be advanced in a couple weekends). You have to pay dues when you join. So, the Masons are every bit the tax livestock the rest of us are. They're just as expendable as anyone.

       I guess my point is that freemasonry is directly linked to many conspiracies. So when someone such as this stenographer just starts shouting about them, then it is grounds for taking a closer look.

       They're like any organization, they accept you openly if you pay them. Keep dues in good standing and you're usually good.
Oh, that and also any Mason lodge worth joining makes your life hell until you are completely vetted by them. They traditionally do a background check on you that exceeds the FBIs standards, including coming to your home or workplace to unexpectedly interview people you know.

       I know some pretty stupid people that got accepted into Masonry.

       All I had to do was show up on a Wednesday for dinner and I would've gotten in.

       I'm sure there are powerful people within Masonry, but they're not powerful because they're Masons. And those people are billionaires on the other side of the continent. Who would never allow me to enter the same room as them.

       As mentioned in a couple of other comments, this is her speaking while being escorted at an elevator. It's not what she said at the podium, which is what everyone is curious about. Thanks for posting info, however.

       Isn't it funny that now that this has been called out, I can't seem to find 1 video clip anywhere with the audio on it?  The first clip I saw had here at the podium screaming about "God and Freemasons," but now that the elevator clip/audio has been released, all I can find is video of the house floor with ambient audio...
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr  Does anyone have the original video clip MSM was pushing with the elevator audio dubbed over?

       Nevermind, I found one...  Ask yourself, why would Fox News and MSM go through the trouble to dub the audio like this?  We are being lied to people...  skip to :48 seconds.  This is an obvious LIE.  Play all three files... They are all the same!

       Never connected the audio and MSM video of the house floor being dubbed until now.  Can we confirm the identity of the lady being pushed into the elevator as the same woman?  Could be or not.  My guess is she was saying some hush hush NWO stuff on the house floor, then they queued a stand-in actor "crazy christian lady" getting into the elevator to distract from what she really said on the house floor.  That's just my guess.

       stenographers have probably thought about words and meanings more than the average. her outburst was on the spur of the moment, probably imagined numerous times before, so maybe a little rambling, but i hear what shes saying. she got to where she got through hard work and dedication, the people she was spending her time recording were a mix of educated and popular. she was pissed at having the dumb dumbs use that microphone to spew bs over the electorate, she stood up.

       So it's pretty obvious, the audio being reported as the floor rant is actually from when she was outside the elevator. Is there any audio of what she said at the podium? Or descriptions from house staff or representatives of what she said?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, do we know anything about Diane? How long she's worked there? Her education? Where she grew up? If she's been going through stress lately?

       As far as not hearing the gavel in the background you can easily isolate audio and remove recurring sounds.  (Especially percussion sounds that are the same wave length).  You just isolate that wave and remove it.  This makes the other audio easier to hear.

       One of my best friends from college (we graduated 5 years ago) went to school for electronic media and now he films, produces, edits different media forms (short films, commercials, music videos, etc).  Anyways he said that with basic editing programs this is no problem at all.  People make audio deconstruction samples all the time where they will remove instruments from a song and just leave the singers voice (for example).  This really isn't much different from that.

       Yeah maybe it is possible if we all get the best version and work on it. First, we have to agree on an audio recording that we are sure was taken during that time.

       I'm telling you, she is CIA. As part of the ongoing war between the Presidency and the CIA, they plant hecklers periodically (you see this often with Obama) in high security, vetted crowds right in the front next to the powerful, then have them make an outburst just to say "Hey, see that? We can get at you anywhere, THIS close. Have fun, be seeing 'ya!"

       POTUS isn't the only target, oh no no no. You also have to target similarly those who fund your organization. Such as, hmmmm, The House.
And I'd also posit...how do you KNOW POTUS wasn't there? He was on hand to instantly sign the un-shutdown bill, for all we know he was waiting in the hallway for the vote to conclude, or doing blow in Boner's office, we don't know.

       I'm saying that based on her rhetoric about freemasons, I can tell she's a bible beater and I understand the evangelist propaganda that she has been exposed to.  Her "God" is an image that has been constructed by power brokers.
      </p>

       I'm not a Christian, but i relate and love the Truth that Jesus was/is fully identified with.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, regardless of this women's religious affiliation i think it's telling that she felt inclined to say what she said. If we get beyond her language/nomenclature.. it could be argued she is spot on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't worship two Masters. The Master of money/control and the Master of service to Truth. A government that serves truth and reality is the only truly useful government. As for the freemasons, if the government was founded on ideals that are not completely transparent and again serving truth over serving ego/self then there is an issue worth reminding politicians about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you can get past the language and into the message that can easily be acknowledged.. it's interesting. Peace!

       Don't you think she may be frightened or scared? She is committing professional suicide and who knows where she is now. This is why she is how you describe "screaming” I consider it to be an emotional plea, she was fired up. If she is just some crazy lady let her speak to the press. I am not saying I am buying into her statements but I am listening.

       Look, I'm not saying something else isn't going on.   I'm just saying from what we've heard, she makes no sense and hasn't said anything with any real message.  There are far better ways of getting a point across that someone who is mentally stable would probably employ before what she did.  She's acting like a person with problems.

       that's a good point.
      </p>
      <p>
       nietzsche's thus spake zarathustra and symbolism of the ubermensch is a good representation the more esoteric interpretation of "God" eschewed by the "priest class" in major religions.  The Kabbalistic/Masonic beliefs that god is an aspect of self and faith is a driver for creation and both personal and societal progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       What i was pointing out was that science and planning have surpassed the need for the "God" represented by organized religion.

       That's incorrect,  an entire conversation that was the first reference to the elevator video has been deleted.  I upvoted it and had the good sense to save the link/video and now that comment is gone and so would the elevator video link along with it...  explain?

       dunno, depends what the shrinks say. can they say belief in god is a sign of mental illness? lol, obviously the outburst is the symptom, but she can site stress of last few weeks as bringing it on, hard man to not sympathize, lots of hours focusing , maybe burnt out, not like she killed anyone !

       the part that gets me is I was here when the audio came out (before the video) and the faked audio was made before the event which would tend to make one think that they knew she would do that.

       Why does any acknowledgement of secret societies automatically turn people into 'nutjobs'?

       Do you really think it's so crazy to think that some things aren't done in open? That there may be groups who conceal their presence and power? We know for certain they have existed in the past; why is their existence today so laughable?

         Open audio on one browser window, video on another

       <li>
        <p>
         Set playhead of audio @ the 05:00 mark, the video playhead at 4:49, that's the moment she says 'Don't touch me!'. Audio and video can be seen synchronized there.

       <li>
        <p>
         THEN you can see the person sitting over them BANGING THE GAVEL and the sound matches the action.

      </ul>

       What I'm saying here is that some simple checking with zero tools can prove the audio matches, I'm not saying audio might not have been falsified. But please do this basic fact checking before commenting.

       Incorrect...  Check out these 3 clips... its obvious that this has been dubbed.  On the first clip, skip to :48 to see how MSM reported the clip, then check out the other 2 to see that that audio DID NOT come from the house floor but from her being loaded into an elevator...

       Have just seen the elevator video. The Soundcloud audio and the audio from this video are two different files. She is repeating things, that's why this version has no gavel sounds and the other has. AFAIK, the CSPAN feed had no discernible audio from her BUT she was recorded by the radio reporter.

       I synced the audio to the video and it matches perfectly. All of hammer hits are audible, they are just quieter than the video because they are using different mics. This is legit.

       Ok, I see now. I'm confused. But, I still don't get what the big deal is. Someone combined one audio track over another, but it wasn't a mainstream source, just a soundcloud account? Did any news networks air this? If not, what is the issue?

       She may be a small-minded fundamentalist government employee who just became privy to the fact that secret societies and private financial institutions have a lot of influence over her government, the effect of that sort of revelation on such a 'crazy bitch' would probably result in some sort of meltdown like this.

       Well it certainly isn't socially acceptable, and I wouldn't tell some elderly woman my thoughts on the subject.

       But if you told me you believed in unicorns and leprechauns then screamed about free masons I'd have the same qualms. It would just be harder to imagine how you came to those conclusions about unicorns and leprechauns. And it would be more than socially acceptable for me to tell you so.

       It is extremely shallow. You are blaming the actions and faults of man on a philosophy that speaks directly against such action. It's like when politicians go up and talk of getting rid of government corruption while taking lobbyists payments on the side. Just because the people have been corrupted does not mean the system or ideal is invalid; it is not being presided over correctly that is the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same can be said for most religions. If you strip out the Old Testament and Paul's bullshit, all you are left with is Jesus' parables and the golden rule. In a vacuum, those are actually pretty hard to argue from a humanist moral point of view. The philosophy of Jesus is very pure, but it has been shit on along the way (and very early along the way at that).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why these religions do not die; as much as they are full of bullshit, there is an element of truth to it that will not go away (love others as yourself). This is what keeps genuine Christians in the fold.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, the corruption of the church also draws in these corrupt types. People who love that shit love the church because it gives them a 'cover' and makes them feel more safe. The perfect analogy is the pedophile priest; it's the perfect situation for a type like that. They are not expected to get married, they are given blind trust by their congregations, etc. None of these things invalidate the teachings of Jesus, they invalidate the organization of the church, which are completely different arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you to not be able to differentiate between the two is what makes your view shallow; you are taking things for how they seem, not how they are.

       I don't know what Jesus said and neither do you. But we both know that what he said isn't anything close to what is portrayed in a poorly translated bible from a language Jesus didn't speak. Religion has been used as a tool for social control for a millennium

       You don't know if that woman was delusional and neither do I. You have no credibility or relevance either. You're just judging people based on your preconceived ideas. You are no better than the people you judge so harshly.
      </p>
      <p>
       My greater point was that hating the church can make some sense to me, but to blame people for ascribing to a certain philosophy in their life because of actions they themselves did not participate in is ridiculous. Blame people for what they themselves have done or not done; dismissing this woman just because you don't like Christians is the worse form of confirmation bias.

       You don't know what she thinks. Also, what you are claiming is not theologically correct in any way, shape, or form. You are like the person railing against Obamacare without knowing what Obamacare is; you're running with a half-retarded idea of how these things work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now don't misunderstand me - most christians also are running around with a half-retarded idea of how things work as well, and I understand that you are reacting to that more than anything else. However, from an intellectual/academic standpoint, taking the public's misunderstanding or resulting manipulation as if it were the basis for the underlying ideal is not honest. Hate the church for their actions all you want, but those actions do not speak to the philosophy underneath, especially when the actions are in direct contradiction to the tenets in place. People suck. We can all agree on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what you can say about this woman is that she obviously believes in the duality of good and evil. Do you?
