<p>I don&#39;t understand Ocare much but I did hear &quot;$900/month for 80% coverage&quot; somewhere a while back and it shocked the shit out of me.</p>

<p>Healthcare in the US need a <em>real</em> revolution. Profiting off pain, suffering and death is just wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would do your own research on your own options of your current insurance vs healthcare.gov options. $900 sounds ridiculous for one person, but maybe not for a family. This just sounds like Tea Party sensationalism. </p>

<p>Regardless, I laugh when people think Obamacare is a good solution for solving corporate greed in healthcare. If anything, it is only a thicker application of the current situation. Health insurance companies are going to make even more money, now that you are forced by law under threat of penalty to buy their services. To me, that only encourages more greed and more profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually even for a family it sounds fucking outrageous.  It&#39;s a genius way to get even healthy families who aren&#39;t even on medications to pay into the system even though they aren&#39;t going to the hospital for anything.  The whole concept of insurance has been perverted.         </p>

<p>A dear friend of mine has a bowel condition and the doc prescribed 30 days of enemas with some sort of anti-biotic in it.  Cost without insurance $2,400.  Cost with his insurance $30.  Does this mean his insurance company footed a bill for $2,370 to cover the difference?  No.  The $2400 was a fantasy land number to force people into getting overpriced insurance in the first place.  The insurance actually paid out $30 to match his $30 for a total of $60, so the original price tag of $2400 is a <strong>fake number</strong>.  So basically he&#39;s paying $500 a month to his insurance company, so they can pitch in $30 once a month on his prescriptions.  See the scam?  Its a fucking outrage.  Having mandatory insurance premiums required so you can artificially reduce a fake price tag at the pharmacy to a normal number is a racket.  Plain and simple.</p>

<p>Couldnt have said it better myself.</p>

<p>insurance used to be what it says: insurance. insurance that <em>incase</em> something happens to you or youre proporty, youve been slowly shelling out money to a company who agrees to pay for any damages or problems.</p>

<p>Today, UNLESS you have insurance, you cant function in society (legally, anyways). you cant drive your car, you cant go to the doctor, you cant buy a home in some cases.</p>

<p>in the 50s, the US had the best healthcare system in the world, as well as the cheapest. EVERYONE was able to receive medical attention, regardless of their spoke on the social ladder. What changed?</p>

<p>Government stuck its finger in the pie</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t work for an employer that offers subsidized health insurance (as the feds do for their employees) you have two choices. Change jobs to an employer that provides health insurance, or self insure yourself through the new insurance exchanges provided by Obamacare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Employers are not required to any such thing. They began doing it during WWII when wages were frozen as a way to entice workers. Companies are free to offer nothing in the way of healthcare if they choose - but it&#39;s become the norm to offer it so most do.</p>

<p>And another myth about Obamacare. Part time workers have NOT been increasing at a higher rate, in fact part-time employment has been steadily going DOWN over the past couple of years. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-myth-of-part-time-america/279300/">Source</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.politicususa.com/2013/09/30/republicans-claim-obamacare-created-part-time-america-naturally-true.html">Source</a></p>

<p>What you&#39;re seeing are cherry picked stories presented to make it appear like more workers are stuck with only part time options. It is still tough to find a good full time job, no doubt, but Obamacare is not turning us into a nation of part-timers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cool story bro, only they are free to select from 4 different government plans, aswell as the market. and all their plans offered SHIT on anything offered by Oshitcare or anything on the market.</p>

<p>we DONT get the same options, and the only option presented to us is another pyramid scheme that robs the american people. </p>

<p>what a cop-out answer.</p>

<p>If obamacare is as great as it says, then at least 1 elected official should sign up. Its like Steve Jobs trying to sell us his new iphone, and then pulling out his Galaxy s3 to text someone on stage while saying he doesnt have to use the iphone because he already has another one. the idea that they are rejecting any contact with the bill should scare you. the fact youre not and actually defending this scares <em>me</em>; knowing your vote influences my life.           </p>

<p>Good ideas dont need force. and theres alot of force for this &quot;good idea&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT: teaparty joke? because everyone who disagrees with the progressive agenda is instantly &quot;tea-party&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mom has pre-existing insurance and makes less than $50,000 a year.  She also gets to keep her pre-existing insurance.  Imagine that.  There&#39;s nothing to &quot;endure&quot;, as the entire system is designed to give people who never had insurance in the first place an affordable method of doing so.</p>

<p>Any bill the GOP sends to Obama that would &quot;require Obama and his staff to use Obamacare&quot; would necessarily require they cease using their currently provided insurance plans and go and buy one, which would be a reduction in pay for not only Obama, but <em>all of his staff</em>.  Those staff are most <em>certainly</em> not the 1%.</p>

<p>And neither are the people that couldn&#39;t afford healthcare and are now being forced to pay for insurance or being fined.</p>

<p>This is a ridiculous issue, but if the ACA is so great, let Obama and his staff suffer through it with the rest of America.</p>

<p>the fact that its done by force negates your point. If people are being forced into this, so much the elite. They are americans and people like us and deserve no special privilege.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, for one, believe that labeling a particular social or financial concept is useful for news writing, but not for actual thinking.  It compartmentalizes your thinking, we need out of the box ideas.</p>

<p>If most Americans read up on your system, and held a vote on a non-centralized online server with STIFF penalties for trying to manipulate it, I&#39;d venture to say that they&#39;d choose THAT over the current system.  Obama is a decent man but a horrible leader, and it seems like he&#39;s about filling the pockets of his friends not helping the people.  All rhetoric aside, of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing most people dont understand is having a &quot;socialized&quot; healthcare system does not mean a socialist government all around. I think they main benefit to a socialized system is that health insurance is a universal thing that everyone benefits from so why do we allow corporations to profit so much off basic healthcare. Everything about our medical industry is so fcked up its all build to be a money scam and nobody realizes it. It cost me $1500 (well not actually me but my insurance company) to go to the hospital for 20 mins and get my finger glued together from a razor cut. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this comment, thanks for posting it. What ticks off alot of people is they seem to worry about their own staff who only make $25,000/yr, when it comes to employer subsidized insurance vs non employer subsidized. Yet, the average person in my area makes just about the same. With non employer subsidized, meaning everything comes out of pocket. So basically, they only care about their own, screw the rest of the people who have the same problems. They are a different breed, anyhow.</p>
