    <div class="md"><p>Yes many ancient writings speak of &quot;gods&quot; comming from the heavens, not seen many refffrences to them being reptilian. I take most of that with a grain of salt though as the winners write the history, that is to say that this aspect was added in to help them, after all how could we beat space lizzards. Still just as possible as anything else though. My take on it is we have been beyond our current tech level before, sent out space missions, solar flare/comet/whatever comes along knocks us back to the stone age. Temples in other things that we can&#39;t replicate now were built with tech still around after the disaster. It would only take a couple generations to be back to cavemen. After some time the space shuttles come back, for the cavemen like people they would be gods. It could be these people who took advantage of that and started to shape the world as they see fit. Anyways thats my 2 cents take it as you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you conside how long the journey would have been to wherever they went and then came back would have time to evolve in to a sort of other branch of homosapien. What they gained I do not know but it seems to me important to get back out there for them. I belive the distuction of civilization is a natural cycle of types. They know this and fear it, I also belive there are 2 sides and they are loosing wich is why we se such desperate messures being taken by them now. The nsa is them searching for someone some group wich is obviously not terrorist. Again just my 2 cents and I am always open to others ideas. Thanks for responding and posibly reading.</p>

<p>I agree but also believe a lot of it was done by the behind the curtain rulers through war and destruction. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>how long the journey would have been</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe a stargate is possible. Quantum entanglement, resonance..I could talk physics in a long post, but I believe it is possible since all matter is just a grouping of a bunch of vibrational frequencies working together with an atom&#39;s fundamentals being 3 light frequencies in the terahertz range. This is called chromodynamics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>searching for someone some group</p>

<p>Or picture more than one foreign group fighting for control of earth, and maybe one group is far stronger than the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s frustrating too because David Icke is so insightful and lucid on his points and his research right up until he casually mentions stuff like &quot;The Queen is an alien space lizard&quot;, which comes so far out of left field that even the average conspiracy theorist automatically throws everything they&#39;ve read or heard from him out the window.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to think that maybe we could give him the benefit of the doubt... but then I look like a whack job mental case... and as much as I&#39;d like to support a cause like that, I cannot risk my reputation being active with such... unconfirmed claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also have a hard time rationalizing David Icke&#39;s lizard people theory, but it you look into the philosophy about the three levels of the souls, and think of them less as lizard people and more as having an overwhelming reptilian character to their soul. And that now we&#39;re in a development of consciousness involving the plant aspect of the soul and the idea of a universal consciousness. So while he did literally say things like the Queen is a Lizard Alien, I like to see it in more of a metaphorical light, and hope that he&#39;s crazy and not me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, this is one point where conspiracy theorists vastly differ.</p>

<p>When you start throwing words out there like &quot;souls&quot; and &quot;universal consciousness&quot;, then I almost automatically tune out anything you say regardless of relevance.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because it sounds like a cult. It sounds like it wants to be a religion and that&#39;s a massive red flag for me.</p>
