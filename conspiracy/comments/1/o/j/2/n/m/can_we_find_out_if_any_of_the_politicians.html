       I said this 2 weeks ago when I saw the market increase in what should have been a decrease (I think).  My conspiracy was that investors "in the know" didn't get in on the scam early enough and inflated values to make a little something extra before selling today and then releasing the credit downgrade info they kept from being released until today, that should have been made last week.  I think in a few weeks or perhaps even December or in the first week of January the marker will fall big time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I said would ensue would be a drop followed by little to no gain until a budget gets approved a few months from now, causing staggering growth after the deal and following improved credit stability.  Who will get the blame?  Neither republicans nor democrats.  Why?  Because they will both blame the small faction of tea party republicans.  This will work too, as regular republicans have been (vocally) against the shutdown and voters are silly enough to buy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My (probably crazy) conspiracy involves the republicans, tea party republicans, and democrats.  The tea party will sacrifice itself, all parties will probably pull huge gains from the market in the following months and the tea party leaders will retire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know anything about the market, but figured if I was going to rape the marker, this is exactly how I would do it.

       I thought it would be fun to play conspiratard for a moment just in case on a slim margin I was correct.  Although, I think futures may go up upon the agreement the entire thing just seemed a little off to me.

       I know very little about the market, but got the sense that something was occurring that shouldn't have.  Generally the market thrives on rumor, but this time they flat out ignored it. I figured I would toss in a karma lottery comment on the wild chance it does happen.

       I always considered the FED to be a private central bank separate from the government.  I'm still holding on to my outlandish hypothesis.  Late in the year if they pull back after the unemployment rises due to seasonal temp hires becoming unemployed after the holidays, they will cut it to 50 billion I'm betting.
