        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>tl;dr is my question, below is more or less a rant that&#39;s the reason for asking. I tagged this as serious because I can&#39;t imagine I&#39;m the only <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> viewer feeling the same way.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been frequenting this sr for over a year now, after watching the documentary Zeitgeist (sorry if anyone dislikes that one). It seems more and more like this is the only place I can get true news. This is mostly because every other political/news source minus a few get constantly debunked on here as phony (most recently CNN, apparently, but nothing new there honestly).</p>

<p>I have a life to live, things I need to get done, other pertinent things to worry about, but here I am wondering if I should even try. Japan&#39;s supremely fucked and the nuclear fallout is going to affect the U.S.. As an American, our own government will keep up its everlasting schemes. I don&#39;t want to say this sr has made me a negative person, but it has really started to peel back this big curtain, like the Wizard of Oz.</p>

<p>Before I would just say &quot;Oh yeah our government&#39;s fucked&quot; as a joke, hoping things would get better. I say &quot;Our government is fucked&quot; now with an actual sense of fear. I&#39;ve been considering purchasing a firearm or moving to Canada/Elsewhere when I am financially ready for either.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr and my question</strong>: How do you other normal viewers stop thinking about what&#39;s <em>currently happening</em> (Fukushima), <em>has happened</em> (9/11, all 10 amendments being squashed, Boston Marathon), or speculating about <em>what will happen</em> (Our worst fears)? Booze, Drugs, or fleeing to some far off cave aren&#39;t currently options for me. Does anyone here find peace in actively protesting or taking action of some sort? Does anyone else feel the same way? Should I just stop coming here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having spent the last five years on related subjects I feel your anguish.</p>

<p>I spent a full year being chronically depressed. I did graffiti on banks, went to every protest around and yelled at people who just didn&#39;t get it (I used to call them sheeple). Essentially I was an asshole. Then again, I was an asshole with a real feeling of unease in relation to my society.</p>

<p>I still have a lot of those same feelings.</p>

<p>I would encourage you to look into &#39;<a href="http://youtu.be/Hon3AzMO6vs">psychopathy</a>.&#39; This will teach you more about the self-appointed rulers than any Zeitgeist movie (Peter Joseph is kind of a tool - my opinion is based on four years of research). Psychopathy is a fucking game changer. My current model for the U.S. Federal government is the Charles Manson family. You have a psychopath interested in personal glory at the top and a lot of dupes, rubes and true believers following orders.</p>

<p>How do you deal with them?</p>

<p>You cannot combat them directly. In fact any engagement is a waste of time and energy. They are the ultimate energy parasites. They will come after you with guns, lawyers, assassins, police and whatever else they can find. They want attention. Engaging them in any manner is attention. Which is what they want. Ironically you have to ignore them to death.</p>

<p>In order to side-step a rattle snake you must know the behavior patterns, beliefs and values of a rattle snake. With knowledge they&#39;re no less dangerous, but you can deal with them in a way that minimizes hazard. Study them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Without-Conscience-Disturbing-World-Psychopaths/dp/1572304510">http://www.amazon.com/Without-Conscience-Disturbing-World-Psychopaths/dp/1572304510</a></p>

<p>I sleep at night because I&#39;m designing a personal life style to disengage from the current psychopathic government system. I don&#39;t give a shit if some are Masons, Illuminati, Zionists, Jews, Satanists, Republicans, atheists or whatever. I just don&#39;t fucking care. I want to live my life and I want to be left alone. This is the exact tactic you must employ with a psychopath. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve personally known a total of eight psychopaths - this is actually kind of a big number. Anyone that I identify as a psychopath is dead to me. I will not give them audience, I will not discuss them [unless it serves education purposes] and I will destroy anything in my life that has anything to do with them directly.</p>

<p>The life plan is to be a good human.</p>

<p>By being the best human you can be you help others to be good too.</p>

<p>If you are a part of the world and you make yourself better -</p>

<p>You are the world, itself, making itself better.</p>

<p>Do something small.</p>

<p>Plant a garden, help someone and learn as much as you can so you can pass it on to others.</p>

<p>Baby steps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We seriously need to push the psychopathy thing. It&#39;s fucking scary that &quot;authority&quot; careers (police, politicians, lawyers, etc) are like flames to moths. Not all psychopaths are deranged murderers and rapists. Let&#39;s start linking studies, papers, journals, etc regarding psychopathy/psychopaths when commenting about cops and politicians. </p>

<p>I recently tried reading a bunch of books on psychopathy to better understand the enemy. After the first book I got so disgusted with the whole thing. It&#39;s sick to think that they&#39;ve taken over the planet when they only make up about 4% of the total population. Oh, and they&#39;re almost always male. There&#39;s very few female psychopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be careful about calling them &#39;the enemy.&#39;</p>

<p>Please hear me out; by calling them &#39;the enemy&#39; there is a tendency to think of them as a type that must / ought to be engaged. Be extremely careful about engaging a psychopath. I was very very lucky to have never engaged any of the psychopaths I knew formally. I had minor disagreements with them, but nothing that incurred their wrath. The wrath of a psychopath is not like the wrath of a normal person.</p>

<p>Mind you, I understand completely what you&#39;re saying and fundamentally agree.</p>

<p>Now that you mention it, the psychopaths I&#39;ve known have almost all been male. There was one person that I suspected was a psychopath and I&#39;ve never seen her again (by coincidence the last time I saw her she saw me reading a book on psychopathy). Otherwise, I&#39;m inclined to, on an anecdotal level, agree that my experiences have been primarily male psychopaths.</p>

<p>An important thing that I&#39;ve been thinking about are the people who follow psychopaths.</p>

<p>Think of the Manson Family. They were all soft-headed emotionally weak people. They had low self-esteem and were easily manipulated through fear, punishment and reward. Many people in media and politics will resemble psychopaths without actually being psychopaths. This is because they&#39;ve emulated the aspects of the people they serve.</p>

<p>The control is subtle.</p>

<p>We&#39;re in a tricky situation. There are non-psychopaths that can be rehabilitated to normal human empathy. And there are shifty manipulators who are essentially Komodo Dragons in human skin.</p>

<p>. . . I say this partly for you and partly for people who don&#39;t know about this topic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice to see someone in here hip to the jive.</p>

<p>I totally agree with this. Kinda puts the whole &quot;shape-shifting reptiles&quot; thing into a new perspective, doesn&#39;t it? As for the non-psychopaths, one of the things that happened (as it does when almost anybody starts researching mental disorders) was that I took the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. I scored abnormally high on it with the exception that I actually feel empathy for people. There&#39;s a lot of debate on what exactly makes a person a psychopath.

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just very careful i how I think about and personally respond to a given situation.</p>

<p>I want nothing to do with them so if they shut down and leave me the fuck alone . . . all the better.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% convinced it&#39;s hereditary or genetically based.</p>

<p>Frankly I haven&#39;t found a convincing argument regarding how they manifest. The closest I heard was from, funny enough, a quasi-psychopath named James Fallon. I can&#39;t remember where I heard it but it went something to the effect that a child with a certain genetic predisposition experiencing a certain trauma was moe likely to develop psychopathy and other subjects. Obviously this isn&#39;t 100%, but it&#39;s interesting.</p>

<p>Fallon, himself, was raised in an amazing family and there seems to be a subtle hint at a kind of childhood &quot;cure&quot; for psychopathy. There&#39;s another guy named Kevin Dutton (or something) who has a friend who runs a a school for children psychopaths. I&#39;m waiting to hear more about it as it&#39;s only a year or so old. What I heard was a &quot;mixed result&quot; report. I haven&#39;t looked into it for several months now and feel like it might be worth checking in on (I forgot the name of the school and will have to look it up - it&#39;s in the U.K.).</p>

<p>The point is that we don&#39;t know why psychopaths occur on a physical level.</p>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to think there may be some possibly metaphysical implications here.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are correct.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t know they&#39;re pawns.</p>

<p>Most of them need approval or emotional supplication.</p>

<p>Psychopaths can spot a victim a mile away.</p>

<p>I already know you&#39;re not a psychopath.</p>

<p>One of the features is that they have a low-functioning amygdala. They don&#39;t feel fear or anxiety. You felt fear and anxiety. You had an internal response that was negative in a self-reflection sense. This is completely outside of what a psychopath would feel. </p>

<p>I mean, we&#39;re al hard-wired with the same things psychopaths have, it&#39;s just that a normal person has more function than a psychopath. You have that function because you have fear.</p>

<p>Also, psychopaths tend to be narcissists and feel themselves better than others. Your revulsion suggests that you do not wish to be apart from the normal person. A psychopath would say to him/herself, &quot;Oh, that&#39; why I&#39;m so much better than the fucking idiots around me!&quot; . .  If they thought anything at all. They&#39;re mostly biological reflex machines.</p>

<p>I went through a similar thing and I powered through.</p>

<p>I think you should do the same.</p>

<p>And never test yourself; most people are harder on themselves than they should be.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hare wrote a book about that.</p>

<p>Watch enough movies and you&#39;ll note that most movie villains are psychopaths. I seriously doubt that the writers have studied the subject. I think there&#39;s some archetypal or prototypical thing that everyone just &quot;knows&quot; about. We know what&#39;s scary and psychopaths are the ultimate in scary.</p>

<p>Now that I know about them I&#39;m far less afraid.</p>

<p>They&#39;re dangerous, but now I know what I&#39;m dealing with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a <a href="http://youtu.be/OqaATPAnTZQ">direct impact</a> on the rest of humanity by being you.</p>

<p>You have the largest impact on those with whom you personally interact.</p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;re aware enough to even know any of this is a hell of a thing.</p>

<p>Billions of years ago there were fields of plants with some insects and no large animals. Those plants were just plants with leaves. One day a single flower popped up. And then another ten thousand years went by with no flowers. Then two or three flowers popped up for no fucking reason. The insects, if they could think, would&#39;ve wondered what those three strange colorful things were. Another couple thousand years went by and then there were a few hundred flowers. And then there were fields of flowers.</p>

<p>You are a flower happening.</p>

<p>This is a good thing. Help others and they will blossom on their own. You cant do it for them. They have to do it on their own. But with you around they will see a single example of someone blossoming. In some sense you become a kind of blue-print that others get to see, interact with and experience.</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;d direct you to the Sermon on the Mount, the Tao te Ching and the Upanishads.</p>

<p>What you impart is a gift to others. The glory isn&#39;t for you. </p>

<p>It&#39;s for everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t stop thinking about it. Not a day goes by where I don&#39;t at least once think about how shit&#39;s gunna go down, or is going down. The way I deal with it is by accepting it. I know which side I&#39;m on and am prepared to die for it. I&#39;m not a violent person, I would never get a gun to defend my family, but I do plot what I can do to make it easier for my family. I have watched YouTube vids on how to make a fire ( better do a test run) and how to collect water when you have none. I am also going to buy a tent and some fishing rods after Christmas and some swags. I&#39;ve been meaning to make a little survival kit, y&#39;know- lighters, first aid kit, tweezers, knives, toilet paper et cetera but I think shelter is the main thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with that feeling, as i have it myself.  But i don&#39;t see this as a bad thing.  It&#39;s a shock for sure, to have your eyes opened and have your brain start making connections that you never even thought possible.  I frankly love that feeling.  It makes me feel somewhat less powerless, although why i don&#39;t know, but like GI Joe said, knowledge is power.  If you feel like you&#39;re becoming too cynical, take a few days off.  Get back to the days before you discovered this thread.  Turn off the news, spend time with the people that make you happy and remember that although all this is going on constantly, it doesn&#39;t have to affect you constantly.  Breaks are great. And then when you&#39;re ready, come back to us, refreshed and with maybe a different angle of perspective.  Thats what i did a few weeks back and it felt great.  As for moving or getting armed, whatever makes you comfortable, friend.  Sweden, Norway and Finland all seem like alright options, or shit, New Zealand ( you know what they did to their bankers when their economy collapsed, right).  </p>

<p>[EDIT]  But i&#39;m sure wherever we go there will be dicks.  It&#39;s just a matter of learning to live with that small portion of the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t want to say this sr has made me a negative person, but it has really started to peel back this big curtain, like the Wizard of Oz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If &quot;peeling back the curtain of global bullshit that causes you to wake up and see the bullshit world of lies we live in and have been manipulated by&quot; is something that causes you to be a negative person, then maybe being a negative person is actually a <em>good</em> thing and is actually <em>better</em> for you...for all of us/everyone.  What I mean in saying this is that I personally value truth above lies AT ALL COST - even if that truth ends up being detrimental to me.  I feel this because I know that the detriment will only be temporary, if there&#39;s even any real detriment at all.  Truth is always better than <em>not</em> truth.</p>

<p>An alcoholic will definitely experience a lot of pain and discomfort going cold turkey, for example, but going cold turkey and no longer being an alcoholic is DEFINITELY better than actually <em>being</em> an alcoholic.  In other words, truth often jars the &quot;ignorant comfort&quot; of our previous perspective awake, and that often makes us feel very uncomfortable and exposed.</p>

<p>It is STILL always better to accustom yourself to living in a world of uncomfortable truth, however, than to sleep on a bed of comfortable lies, for lies will always, <em>always</em> sooner or later eventually come up, rear their ugly heads, and bite you in the ass...<em>hard</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before I would just say &quot;Oh yeah our government&#39;s fucked&quot; as a joke, hoping things would get better. I say &quot;Our government is fucked&quot; now with an actual sense of fear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t fear, my man.  Be strong.  Easier said than done, of course, but true success and achievement in these hard times that we live in comes as you begin to understand that the intelligent energy that is responsible for your current physical life on this planet WILL NOT perish or go away upon the elimination of that physical bag of flesh and bones you look at every day in the mirror and call your &quot;self&quot;.</p>

<p>What you have to do is stop seeing your <em>real</em> self as that thing that you call &quot;Jake92&quot;...because you are more than just that.  Much more.</p>

<p>The more you get to know this greater energy that <em>made</em> &quot;Jake92&quot;, the less scared the physical bag of meat and bones currently called &quot;Jake92&quot; will be.</p>

<p>And no.  Don&#39;t confuse anything just said here with any religious, doctrinal indoctrination type of thought.  It doesn&#39;t necessarily have any direct attachment to anything like that whatsoever.</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s easier said then done, but know that this tumultuous world we live in is only a school that we are in/that we are going through...to learn how to be bigger and better than we currently are.  All the problems and difficulties that exist - with the government, with the shadow government, the MIC, TPTB, etc - are only challenges designed to help us be able to better decipher what&#39;s <em>not</em> important (all those things I just mentioned here) from what <em>is</em> important (development of your mind, your heart, your body, your spirit/<em>real</em> self).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve been considering purchasing a firearm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cool.  Purchase away.  Me and my gf are planning on getting a master blaster (shot gun) soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or moving to Canada/Elsewhere when I am financially ready for either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That might not be a horrible idea either, but realize and keep in mind that the problems that exist...are actually <em>global</em>.  They&#39;re not merely national.  The US sucks - for sure.  We are the nexus of the world&#39;s cancer right now.  However, everywhere is effected right now, and you won&#39;t necessarily get entirely away from it - if away from it <em>at all</em> - going somewhere else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you other normal viewers stop thinking about what&#39;s currently happening </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, those in this sub probably aren&#39;t looked upon as being &quot;normal&quot; by a lot of society.  If normal&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for (normal as in the &quot;possibly more indoctrinated and sheep-like&quot; sense), then you&#39;re more likely to find it elsewhere.</p>

<p>Secondly, I personally actually don&#39;t <em>try</em> to stop thinking about what&#39;s currently happening.  For me, it&#39;s about simply understanding that we live on a fucked up, <em>fucked</em> up planet.  As I&#39;ve said before elsewhere, humanity on planet Earth is going through the galactic equivalent of middle school.  We&#39;re smart, intelligent, and complex thought-forming enough to no longer be &quot;elementary school&quot; types as a species, but we&#39;re WAY too immature still to be in the equivalent of &quot;galactic high-school&quot; - to say <em>nothing</em> about being ready for the college or the university level of development.</p>

<p>We&#39;re experiencing growing pains here on this planet because we are 1) so generally ignorant, and 2) so extremely, <em>extremely</em> manipulated by (possibly) outside forces more powerful than us.</p>

<p>Shit is difficult here, to be sure.  Knowing that this is what this planet is, however (i.e. a difficult, difficult school...or a prison for wayward souls...one of the two), ALONG with knowing that we&#39;re just learning as a species - and also knowing that we are also much greater beings than the physical bodies we see - often helps me to look at all the trials and tribulations that are going on in this world, all the vicissitudes and difficulties, as just part of the shit that I/we have to go through right now in the process of growing and developing into better, more advanced beings.</p>

<p>All this is to say that I don&#39;t try to &quot;stop&quot; thinking about all these world problems.  I simply think about them PROPERLY/in terms of what they are most likely a part of and a sign of.  That allows me to understand them better and keep from letting them overwhelm me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Booze, Drugs, or fleeing to some far off cave aren&#39;t currently options for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Good</em>.  Make sure and <em>keep</em> it that way.  Don&#39;t ever <em>let</em> them be options for you.  Those things will only make things worse, because they will keep the REAL you from being able to handle and look at the issues and problems soberly and objectively....which is EXACTLY what you need to do in order to learn from any given situation you&#39;re in as best you can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does anyone here find peace in actively protesting or taking action of some sort?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure many do.  We all take action in different ways.  I, for example, have marched and demonstrated, and will likely do so again, but I find my biggest solace in simply being able to actively contemplate and THINK about the issues at hand on my own and, as often as possible, discuss them with someone decently receptive enough (whether it be here or w/my gf).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Should I just stop coming here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na, man.  Continue educating yourself.  As crazy as this sub can get sometimes, you already know that this is pretty much one of the best places in this entire website for every now and then actually getting some REAL FUCKING NEWS about what&#39;s <em>really</em> happening on the planet.  It helps open your eyes to some of the things that are going on in this crazy world.</p>

<p>Hell if you want a <em>real</em> mind fuck, read <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">this</a> and <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018">this</a>.</p>

<p>The rabbit hole goes <em>deep</em>, brother.</p>

They are trivial by comparison. But you and most others here have been so well brainwashed by the media and the school systems, you can&#39;t even conceive that it is happening, even though the evidence is all around you, in your face, and undeniable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Accepting Christ is the way out of the world which is passing away. The moment I truly accepted God was when the worry about my future vanished, because I have secured my future with eternal truth. Have faith and hope always. </p>

<p>John 16:33</p>

<p>&quot;These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.&quot;</p>

<p>1 Corinth. 13:8</p>

<p>&quot;Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away.&quot;</p>

<p>Always align yourself with love, do everything in love and always remain hopeful, seek truth and you will know and love God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I went to church this past Easter for the first time since my Catholic high school days I had a newfound appreciation for the overall themes and messages of the Church. My only discretion was that most &quot;true Catholics&quot; (teachers and priests) at my high school would always harp that you can&#39;t <em>pick and choose</em> which parts you liked about the religion. I always hated that the most, and fell out from calling myself Catholic because of that reason mostly. If you care to share your denomination and why it&#39;s worked for you to follow that path I&#39;d be intrigued to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was raised Protestant, didn&#39;t believe in God for most of my life. When he called me again I was incredibly hurt, pretty much at the bottom. Now I am Catholic and I love the faith. I love reading about the Saints, reading history of the Church, learning the liturgy and seeing Christ in everything. Anything inspiring or edifying is worth the walk for me. It is all in renewing the mind, putting on love and hope in an eternal truth, eternal love, eternal joy, eternal peace... I can&#39;t see a downside to any of it. I continually lay down preconception and just go for it. I may not like the answers I receive, but I know I am being remolded into someone that will stay hopeful even in the worst times. I hope that makes sense. Work on a pure relationship with God, talk to him, read his book and get to know who he really is. I seek him out and I am always rewarded for doing so.</p>

<p>I do have a couple resources, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re heard of Fr. Robert Barron but I enjoy his YouTube videos, also Fulton Sheen. </p>
