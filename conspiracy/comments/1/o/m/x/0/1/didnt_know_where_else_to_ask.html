She was a tribal elder and any ways... during the viewing the FBI showed up and seized her body.  They said we could go on with the funeral but she did not  come back till the actual burial.  But none of our family was allowed to confirm that it was her in the casket.  She died of natural causes- a stroke.  I nhave never heard of anything like this before and we got very little information from the feds...does anyone have any ideas why this happened?</p>

<p>Sorry, first i want to send my condolences. </p>

<p>But, why the hell would the fbi want her body? Especially without the consent of family members? Is that even legal? Ive never heard of anything like this. </p>

<p>Is it possible to file charges on grounds of emotional damages? Im sorry for your loss...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly... right?  The only thing I know for sure that deaths of native americans are infact investigated by the fbi since we are &quot;protected&quot;  but this still seems a little far fetched.  Since it was natural causes and she had a history of strokes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you mean when you say &quot;protected&quot;. But, forgive me for my ignorance, because i dont know much about native american sovereignty rights or anything. But, it seems weird and i feel, personally, the fbi would be overstepping their jurisdiction by investigsting anything that has to do with native americans (unkess, of course, it has a direct effect on the US governments sovereignty, which a personal death is not..) itd be like the fbi confiscating the body of a mexican or canadian during the viewing with no reason or explanation. I always thought the fbis jurisdiction stayed within the US governments borders...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If feds show an interest in her body, it&#39;s because it contains some sort of evidence - you can be sure of that. Evidence of what? If the government &quot;confiscates&quot; the body, it&#39;s a government cover-up for sure, and what have the government done to the natives, since the cholera blankets?</p>

<p>My guess: A proper autopsy would show poisoning from a &quot;medical&quot; program performed 
with natives, under CIA guidance. Probably something with ingested nuclear material, since natives got that a lot.</p>

<p>You should have the body examined for heavy metals, if you have the money, time and care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you that would be great. My own father claims to have been followed by the FBI for a period of 3 or so years. No one believes him and thinks he is schizophrenic. Also he was drinking a 1.75 daily during that period. He claims it was due to the stress the FBI was putting him under. He is not drinking now and still claims the FBI had followed him but no longer is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, my condolences on your loss.
Next, did the feds provide any documentation when they came to claim the body?  Did they ever say they were acting on behalf of another federal agency like say the CDC?  Did she ever have any involvement with the feds (as in assisting federal agents) while she was a tribal Elder? And finally; what tribe is She from?</p>

<p>Pardon the questions, I mean no disrespect and am not intending to grill you with her passing so fresh to you.  My Father worked for the USPHS at clinics on reservations across the western US and there were a couple of times that he had to seize a deceased tribal members.  But that was due to possible infectious out break (this was during the Honta virus outbreaks in the early 80&#39;s in the southwest).  But that seems hardly the case with your aunt.</p>

<p>I would look for a connection in her past.  The FBI is a shady bunch in relation to Reservations.  Even more so than they are normally.</p>

Where is the best possible place to turn for an explanation because I am still confused as hell.  So far nothing has made sense.  No my Auntie wasn&#39;t a criminal.  As far as I know she has never had a major criminal record.  She was a devout shaker and as I know we are straight as a Christian can be.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for your loss.  I would say try to ask around locally, maybe ask a lawyer for advice.  If you just approach it in a straight forward way I bet you can get an explanation.  It could be something normal like there&#39;s a law from way back requiring them to do certain things to ensure it was natural causes.  </p>

<p>When it&#39;s personal like this it&#39;s always better to hope for the best and seek a rational explanation, especially if it&#39;s causing you pain.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you mean when you say &quot;protected&quot;. But, forgive me for my ignorance, because i dont know much about native american sovereignty rights or anything. But, it seems weird and i feel, personally, the fbi would be overstepping their jurisdiction by investigsting anything that has to do with native americans (unkess, of course, it has a direct effect on the US governments sovereignty, which a personal death is not..) itd be like the fbi confiscating the body of a mexican or canadian during the viewing with no reason or explanation. I always thought the fbis jurisdiction stayed within the US governments borders...</p>
