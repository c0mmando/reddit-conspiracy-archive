       You know what they need to do. A week before October 1st. They should lock all political budget committees, and the President in a room with no A/c, no beds, no comforts, and say you don't come out until a budget is agreed upon and lock them in. Add medical attention should they start physically fightin als. Tough if you get hurt. Get it done on time.

       We want to work, but we can't work because Americans need $160,000 per year plus benefits and pension just for walking in the door at 8am. I guess we should just all go back to school so we can all get something like that. I understand that a lot of people work very hard and its not fair, but the fact is most Americans don't work hard. It's just like a Mexican Drug Cartel here in America, the little guys that take all the risk get pennies while the guys higher up get the lion's share just because that's the way it goes. Stop acting like your system can be perfect. You have to understand that America purposefully locks of millions of its citizens &amp; creates a large criminal class just so their unemployment rate can look good and hundreds of thousands of people can make six figures just by showing up at work on time so they can surf the internet &amp; socialize until 5pm.

       Food Stamps for the whole country is $84 billion a year. They have already spent seven times that just to design, not build, design a fighter jet. If you think social programs are what is bankrupting this country &amp; the solution is to let them starve so we can design these planes you need to get real.

       I think that the elemenation of one program to fund another is the answer. I don't care about defence or social programs really. They don't need to starve but they do need to learn self worth and stop with the generational food stamp dependence. That money can go to provide a smarter way to get there food like learning to grow it or nutrition planning hell anything but just giving it to them.

       They aren't giving it to them, they are giving it to Wal-mart. The shit would go bad anyway if they didn't sell it. Is that what you prefer? They lock up millions of people to keep the unemployment rate looking pristine.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could work for a good company like Amazon but with the way Amazon chooses to do things at the lower level you are better off with $800 a month government assistance and staying home.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to admit , like we can all see plain as day , that millions of people are paid handsomely to do nothing, for status reasons.

       You should care about defense programs because those suck the treasury dry. You have two kinds of people side by side in a war zone, one is a soldier getting $500 per week and another is a private contractor getting $120,000 every six months. And you want to talk about "deserve" and "self-worth"? Get outta here. Go find the subreddit that goes after the low hanging fruit, in

      </p>
      <p>
       Or it tells me that you just burn your account and can't keep them too long cause you get banned for this or that. Piss off either way! I know what the real problem is you are trying to defect from it with this shit of defence spending and we gotta protect ourselves lol.

       We have to protect ourselves. From what? Information? The Defense budget is bigger than the biggest countries combined. The second biggest defense budget is China's and it doesnt even come close to the USA's by a long shot.

       Your government gives almost everyone that approaches it a blank check of your tax dollars, that is why your government gets overcharged for everything it asks for, including healthcare. You think people are going to sit around &amp; starve and sleep in the rain while everyone else who knocks on the government's door gets sent away with a bar of gold? Please.

       Ok this is the last comment I will make to you tonight. You didn't answer my question to your validity to being a lurker or just an account burner seeing as you said you known about reddit since 2005 in a previous coment about your deepest darkest secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I am going to address the comment of "your government" I am going to take that as you are not American so you really have no idea how shit works here and you should just mind your own affairs or get more familiar with our social system before you say anything else. I don't mean read some dribble you find somewhere online. I mean go into a human services office and get humiliated by dealing with someone who tells you just don't work that way you can recive all this asstance and just sit at home we will pay the bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason our healthcare is so fucking high is cause we as americans don't get the option to find the best deal for medical care or shop around. It is so goddamn high costs even with insurance that we don't go there till we have to. By then you lose your bargaining power cause you need treatment.

       We actually don't get overcharged for out military anything honestly. How are you going to compare it to anything else last I checked we had exclusive tech and stealth not to mention other toys that we don't even know about. So how can you say we are overcharged in all reality for anything. Is it just cause you think we are or did you compare our costs to another county of our standing and military side by side.
      </p>

       Betting you didn't cause there isn't one. The only thing out of control I know of is social services. You would know that if you were American but I am pretty sure you are not. The government actually goes thru a budget then gets bids appropriates money gets the bid interviews the contractor. and pays there is all kinda shit that happens isn't like they say hey we need this lets go buy it. Learn this before you start chiming in.

       On that final note I am going to bed and I will answer you in the morning. I have to support the masses you know.

       I misread some of your comments so sorry about that. I agree that many of minimum wage workers/ benefit employees are lazy hypnotized people. What i mean by this is that their actions are being manipulated and movements can no doubt be predicted.
e.g joint/drink then getting on the computer =&gt; dopamine rush listening to music from youtube or =&gt; drinking. Media, youtube related videos pushing sexual thoughts these can almost be guaranteed to infiltrate subconcious and concious elements of minds more than they usually would. Complete distraction. How original are these people acting in the spirit/mind sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       But (no offence to you) the job market is pretty shity at the moment unless you've got maths/ engineering/ programming or banking skills. Retail store Management/sales and general customer service arn't very furfilling jobs but will cut the funds to live and prepare as you've said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any ideas of other industries that might be possible avenues to go into? Thanks

       Do what i did keep looking. I found this job by luck i love it yeah the hours are long buti feel i am making a differance and keeping people safe. I myself have no degree just experiance. The job market is shitty cause people accept it. That is the only reason it is this bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people doing these jobs should just leave or demand better that is what i did and if i didnt get it i found something better. Now i make 60k a year next year i will make 100k and it dont even feel like a job cause i enjoy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best advise i can give you is not to settle. If you dont just live on welfare fine i understand people need help. Hell i did at one point. What we need is a system to make people accountable.

       Lol this sub is full of so many people that are so full of themselves. They stand up on there soap box and make waa waa comments of oh the people are so mistreated. FUCK THAT! I have had shit jobs and know what I kept working till I got what I do now and I am able to support a wife kid myself 6 chickens a ferret and a dog. Very comfortable I might add. Yeah I needed help before from snap and know what before I even recived it I already had a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Took them two weeks because I had to prove that I was indeed in need of help. Still I didn't wait I kept looking doing what I could to make money to keep us going. This whole people in America thinking they are worth something is bullshit get with the real way the world works. If you don't like your situation change it easy as that.

       Dude, if it bothers you that some people get $250 in free groceries every month or enough money from the government that make sure they don't sleep in the rain, then you can't be helped.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you completely understand the other folks that get paid handsomely to do nothing simply because they listened to an alarm clock &amp; walked through a door on time &amp; stayed the whole eight hours even though they surfed the web and shot the shit all day.

       No matter how you want to delude yourself, if social program money is 50 cents, defense spending &amp; government spending is $7. You just saw how almost a million government employees were given a paid vacation but you aren't crying about that.
Every day for them really is a paid vacation in terms of productivity, but you aren't crying about that. 
The people born in this country are citizens too, you have to placate them if you want to continue your relatively lavish lifestyle in peace.

       You don't like your situation change it easy as that also you known about reddit since 2005 and got an account that is 2 months old why is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have separate accounts for your different emotions you go thru? Besides what is to say they can't get a better job I looked for a job and always found one pretty fast. It wasn't the best but always strive to make your good better and your better the best and all but one of my past employers wouldn't hire me back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only cause I cought the regional manager stealing and didn't stand for that shit. Gave my 2 weeks notice and was told to leave immediately. You are upset cause you think people are helpless they are not. What they are is lazy and they have been made that way by a population that busts there ass for there money just so they can sit there and get it for nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is the way I feel about it. You expect the best and plan for the worse. Always I don't care if you were raised in the ghettos or in Beverly hills people know this. It is part of that thing that they just know and if they don't well then they do not belong. I mean really what good are they to us. None really sept baby makers for the meat grinder. I would rather suggest they be tought how to do things themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole they get 250 a month thing don't bother me but when they get it for years and years that is when it does. We give so much away and don't hold them accountable in any way. Then give them subsidized housing and they destroy it. Turn that shit into a place where cops with mraps won't even go.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think that is cause they just were pushed into selling drugs? BULLSHIT it is cause they are lazy and think they can't just kill and steal to get ahead. Yeah works really good when you are just a recycled 9 digit number. Plus someone spills out some alchol when you are mentioned.

       I hope you can put things in context, welfare is $85 billion a year, the government sells that many bonds for extra cash per month. You are working against yourself, you are petitioning for solutions to the people who planned to create the problem. Everything in America is exactly the way America wants it. Your Congress just showed you that they had 15 days to get anything done, anything. What did they do? They got the one thing done that they were already supposed to have got done a long time ago &amp; they got it done at the last minute. That's what you should be pissed about, thats the real fight. But you dont want a real fight, you want to fight the guy that knows to take a dive in the 3rd round.

       like yourself is a solution? Maybe building up a society they can count on will give them a reason to adopt the standards necessary to maintain that culture. Obviously a bunch of disenfranchised individuals are going to have a hard time appreciating the little support the do receive.

       Have you ever considered that self-worth could be derived from something other than your accomplishments and failures? Your ideas aren't irrational, they are dated. What's going to happen when you, and all those "lazy" people, are out of the job because it can be automated?
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is coming soon, whether you like it or not. It's time to move on. Stop trying to rationalize your shitty life. It was already wasted as a slave. You are being fooled by the slave-owners into cherishing your servitude. It's a fucking scam buddy.

       Your family deserves more time with you. Your body deserves more time to rest. You deserve to have shelter and nourishment, even if you value your family more than being a wage-slave.
