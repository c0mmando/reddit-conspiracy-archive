<p>We need to start a very basic and easy to understand movement. Not to radical and simply to light a fire up under everyone. Advertise, print flyers, talk to community leaders, police officers, anyone....Just to spread the word.</p>

<p>It has to be above all...Peaceful. </p>

<p>I know it varies by region, but here I openly carry my firearm just about everywhere legally possible.</p>

<p>Sure, I could conceal it but why should I? Open carry is also fastest draw if I do happen to need it. But I also like it as a reminder that our rights exist.</p>

<p>Similar to when dealing with police. Don&#39;t just bend over and take it, refuse searches, politely decline to answer questions. Taking it laying down is a good part of the reason we&#39;re in this situation. Don&#39;t let them erode our rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This just perpetuates the cycle. The ends don&#39;t justify the means, the means determine the end. Those with power only get it through compliance. Compliance is acquired by instilling fear through the threat of future loss. Fear is dissolved by letting go of attachment to everything, even your life. Once the people achieve that state of mind then they are free to operate as they please outside the system. The ruler then no longer has compliance, nor the ability to force compliance through fear. He becomes obsolete and shunned. He cannot imprison an entire country. He cannot kill us all or he has no one to rule over. How long before the military realizes they are killing their own brothers and sisters who have simply opted out? </p>

<p>Be the change. The revolution has been won many times on the battlefield but it does not exist in the battlefield. The revolution exists in your mind. That is why we have never won. Violence never had a chance</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is why it won&#39;t work when one man does it. First we group together. Then we peacefully opt out publicly to whatever extent we have agreed upon or perhaps to his or her own extent. If the result of a massive peaceful governmental boycott is martial law then that will exponentially increase the amount of participating. No one will believe that a peaceful boycott is actually a bunch of domestic terrorist. I doubt the govt would even attempt that, if they did it would only work to our advantage</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said opt out. I was just using your example to illustrate a point. Just in case you didn&#39;t hear, the <a href="http://rt.com/usa/fbi-assassination-ows-sniper-227/">FBI had plans to assassinate</a> supposed leaders of the OWS movement. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/14-specific-allegations-of-nypd-brutality-during-occupy-wall-street/260295/">This is the crack down</a> I&#39;m talking about. Were you born yesterday, or just haven&#39;t read a newspaper in the last 10 years?</p>

<p>[edit] From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>The FBI is really just targeting ordinary people going about their daily lives as potential terrorists</strong>, and now people, who are participating in peaceful protests, are also characterized as domestic terrorists. So, I think the FBI is really picking and choosing who it categorizes as the type of civilians it wants to protect,” added Miller.</p>

<p>Commenting on the trove of documents, The New York Times reports, “<strong>The records show little evidence that the members of the movement planned to commit violence.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways, you think government knows the language of peace, especially the <em>US government</em>, then you are delusional. When has the US ever tried peace? If it weren&#39;t for Putin, you guys would be ankles deep in yet another war. So go ahead, try to &quot;peacefully&quot; object to any government action, or try to start a &quot;massive peaceful governmental boycott&quot;. I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll work just fine. Just make sure to buy a bullet proof vest first.</p>

<p>Our Ultimate Goal:</p>

<p>To restore true democracy in the United States by pressuring our State Representatives to pass a much needed 28th Amendment to our Constitution which would end corporate personhood and publicly finance all elections in our country. There are only 2 ways to amend the Constitution. (1) Go through our federal government  (2) Go through our State Legislators via an Article V. Convention of the States. </p>

<p>Wolf PAC believes that we can no longer count on our federal government to do what is in the best interest of the American people due to the unfettered amount of money they receive from outside organizations to fund their campaigns. We point to the failure of the Disclose Act as rock solid evidence that this would be a total waste of our time, effort, and money.  We also point to the recent decision by the US Supreme Court to not even hear a case filed by Montana claiming it did not have to abide by Citizens United, as proof that state legislation is not a suffient measure to solve this problem.   We believe that we have no choice but to put an amendment in the hands of our State Legislators, who are not, at this moment in time, completely blinded by the influence of money and might actually do what 87% of the country wants...take away the massive influence that money has over our political process.  </p>

<p>Second we need to find a way to get people interested- may I suggest youtube as a medium seems that stormcloudsgathering has a large following. I think it is cause they are easy to digest for the sheeple. Lots of fire and pretty flashing pictures.</p>

<p>Last we need to keep this &quot;movement&quot; going now most of us have jobs and lives to live. So are you going to be the leader of this circus? Also are you ready for the rejection cause there will be much resistance to this so don&#39;t lose your moral compass.</p>

<p>This last one is what I am damn near positive is what ends up being as effective as a fart in a fan factory. </p>

<p>So what you wanna do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Band against: I guess the root of all evil would be corruption in our society(specifically in the government and big corporations), and I realize that it is natural human behavior, but the least we can do is inform people of it. And maybe that will open some eyes.</p>

<p>Your suggestion of youtube videos is a great place to start informing, possibly starting some sort of viral marketing campaign or something similar to gain interest. </p>

<p>As far as being a leader to a circus; I am ready for that and I can put in a lot of time for the cause. I have always dealt with rejection well. The only thing about myself is that I am not good at putting thoughts down into writing(if you cannot already tell) , so there is that downfall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok let me start here. People know the system is fucked up. They don&#39;t care cause it doesn&#39;t effect them. Gotta find a way it can relate to them directly. None of the well if you read this and I interpet it like this you will have a zombie at your door and your cat will turn on you and eat your eyeballs out of your face while you sleep.</p>

<p>I was summarizing alex jones dribble. Now no theories only proven or able to prove facts. This part will be hard cause the way shit is worded matters cause you got other people in here that will tear you apart if you don&#39;t know what you are talking about. They being assholes just wait to prove there superior intelligence just to make themselves feel better.</p>

<p>Now the youtube idea was based on the whole premise it wasn&#39;t some guy just yappin about this and that. You will need to know how to edit add pictures and what not, but don&#39;t steal an idea you need to actually focus on your idea. </p>

<p>Also don&#39;t tell someone everything all at once gotta spread it out thruout the presentation. Humans really like to investigate shows them satisfaction in the ability to figure something out. </p>

<p>Try and pick something not every other mofo is going after like ummmm well I haven&#39;t seen anything on Monsanto for a while. The old adage that everything stays on the net is true just gotta know where to find it.</p>

<p>I think you are being a bit over paranoid here,  if there are thousands,  even hundreds of people forming a group that is against the current agenda of the government,  there is nothing to worry about. Especially because we are scattered throughout the country the likely hood of the events your are worried about is extremely small. </p>

<p>The cases in which you are probably referring to is when one (or a few)  already developed and recognized people make claims that the govt has tried hard to suppress. When they mysteriously die or disappear is where skepticism should come from,  but this skepticism shouldn&#39;t not be applied to our effort to form a peaceful awareness group </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much agree with this. </p>

<p>But one thing I have been thinking about lately is: What would we do if we got our wishes? What if the government was finally brought down and violently scrubbed clean? What if a political movement WAS successful?</p>

<p>I think it is very important at this point to not only educate the population on the wrong doings of the state but how to get away from ever giving them as much power as they have in the first place. People need to begin learning to be more self-sufficient moving forward in life. Things like growing their own food and committing to ways of life that are both good for the environment and (nearly) nontaxable. </p>

<p>My personal motive in life right now is to reach a point where I can supply myself with most everything and attempt to get out of taxes as much as possible. Once I reach that point I would be able to help out needy families and individuals as well as help educate others on self-sufficiency to reach the same point as myself. Once enough people can help themselves and their family/community everyone can begin to get on the same &quot;level&quot;. </p>

<p>This in combination with the breakdown of the material mindset and proper influence of intelligence and aspirations would begin to have the population working together towards a personal and overall golden age for the us all.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>One of the biggest forms of participation is paying them.</p>

<p>I would also say that growing your own food counts since you&#39;d be off the industrial food system.</p>

<p>At this point almost anything is &quot;disobedience.&quot; </p>

<p>Please contact me. I am an Online Marketer and I am sure that I could contribute in creating a community of people who take action. We just need to talk things through at first and create then the compass.</p>

<p>I personally am tired of information. It is time to gather our resources and develop a consistent plan to proactively work for a better community.</p>

<p>Of course there are already communities out there, but not a single one, that came out of Reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. We must independently define our own codes based on our own morals united only by non violence. As individuals we will foster as much love and compassion in our personal lives and if/when the state imprisons you for the inevitable conflict of morals, you must ask those who are closest to you whether they are willing to continue to endorse, advocate, and pay for your imprisonment. If you have been a truly virtuous and compassionate human, then it will be clear who the victim is.  We can only affect those who are closest to us. Show them where the line is and make them choose where they stand. Show them the gun in the room and make them hold it to your head. </p>

<p>This is the only way to spread change. Extreme integrity. Challenge those around you as you lay your body down. If they won&#39;t pick you up then then accept a world unwilling to be free and accept your physical slavery, for at least you have achieved it mentally no matter how small the cage.</p>

<p>This is violence of 2 people ganging up on one.  The idea of a state is just like God... it&#39;s all in your head.</p>

<p>Imagine if you had not been &quot;educated&quot; by a state?  What solution would you offer to a problem that does not have to be enforced violently?</p>
