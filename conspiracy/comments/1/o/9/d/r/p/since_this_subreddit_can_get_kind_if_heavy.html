Do not give your energies to the lower vibrations of fear, hate, anger and resentment. And if you do, for whatever reason (scenario, conflict), allow it come up to be released and let it go. Embrace love, compassion, and appreciation for oneself, all life, and the world you live in. Choose love over fear.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There ARE, this is true. There truly are people who are out there in the world conspiring together to make the world a better place for <em>everyone</em>, not just for themselves or for their families, because they care about <em>principles</em>, not just themselves and their own petty/shallow self-gratification. </p>

<p>These people are always easy to pick out, just like the sociopaths on the <em>other</em> end of the human scale are easy to pick out. Good causes growth and emanates out through people like the sun&#39;s freely given energy goes through entire ecosystems causing &quot;goodness&quot;(life/positive growth) - it is legitimately rationally possible to talk about this as an analogy for people. You radiate love/warmth/kindness/compassion(the things that make people grow and which they in turn pass on to their own social systems and their own kids), you create good things and potential. You care for no one but yourself/getting resources for yourself/satisfying only yourself and those who you immediately need to get to do what you want - you create a system of death like a black hole - sucking everything in it&#39;s gravity well that can&#39;t resist the pull into it.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever met someone who is a diagnosed sociopath or borderline, you&#39;ll know that this is very much how they are - like black holes - non-existent except for the happenings on the shallow level of their lives, the event horizon, sucking everything into them but <em>giving</em> nothing back to cause growth potential, emanating <em>nothing</em> except a subtle or overt pulling inward toward themselves in every action and interaction. They cause death/lack of growth for as long as you are stuck in their clutches(and they aren&#39;t &quot;evil&quot;, they just don&#39;t have any other way to be, they are human black holes). The good people who get sucked into their gravity-well are stuck there until they see past the lies of the sociopath or borderline person who are simply feeding off of these people and their energies/life forces(that&#39;s what it really amounts to) - they need to think for themselves to get out of it, certainly no need for violence or any other problem like that. Just try to get people to think for themselves.</p>

<p>Human beings are a part of nature, and just like the other parts of nature, there are positive/growth-inspiring systems of action and their opposite. You have to be the former, not the latter. We are living in a world with a bunch of mini-black holes called people, or sociopaths, who care for no one but themselves and their own feelings/their own direct benefit in every situation - this is like a bunch of trees together in a forest, unless they all come together and naturally realize that working together, cooperating, &quot;loving&quot;(as humans would describe their positive, mutually beneficial/BALANCED, co-operative actions) one another, and sharing resources to promote growth while maintaining the equilibrium of their resources - a few big trees will come in and try to rob all the others blind, the big trees will grow and grow until they have deprived and degraded the rest of the forest into death, and unfortunately for them.. they will no longer have anyone or anything to feed off of, and they too will eventually be their own destruction. Working together/eg &quot;morality&quot; is logically indicated for all of life. Nature itself is working against you if you try to do the opposite, although sometimes periods of &quot;the opposite&quot; can be necessary for promoting the growth that will come after - you&#39;re free to be either, but if you go out and try to rob people blind with guns, chances are you&#39;re going to be killed by other people out there trying to rob people blind with guns. If you try to love and give, people will see that and be happy and try to love and give back to you.</p>

<p>Maybe humanity needed the power-mad and hungry psychopaths to bring them up from the level of cavemen, to be motivated to form societies, to bring about change via a self-service-oriented system of individual profiteering - from the one little guy who &quot;wants to be a fighter pilot&quot;, or &quot;wants to be in charge of people in the army&quot;/&quot;desires to profit personally&quot;, to the oligarch at the top, to the guy who wants to prove himself as a #1 star athlete and make tons of money for himself while buying Lamborghinis - until we could all get to a point where we evolve on our own to a better way, keeping all the good things the psychopaths&#39; personally-oriented insanity inspired the building of. This is what I think. Nature has a plan, look at the solar system, look at your body and all the atoms forming it - you are made by nature, you are part of nature just as much as all the stars and galaxies are, and nature has a very well organized plan in every level of itself, from micro to macro. It just takes time to flow out of the current potential for it all, and we get to play a part in that. Enjoy yourselves, don&#39;t be so down - it&#39;s just a cosmic/natural show that you are allowed to play a part in. You&#39;re as much the whole universe as an apple is the whole apple tree, as in, the apple is grown out of and by the tree as an expression of the fullness of it&#39;s true underlying nature. Enjoy yourself, you are free!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Doug Casey may have this correct when he says</p>

<p>What&#39;s going on here is an instance of Pareto&#39;s Law. That&#39;s the 80-20 rule that tells us, for example, that 80% of your sales come from 20% of your salesmen or that 20% of the population are responsible for 80% of the crime.</p>

<p>As I see it, 80% of people are basically decent; their basic instincts are to live by the Boy Scout virtues. 20% of people, however, are what you might call potential trouble sources, inclined toward doing the wrong thing when the opportunity presents itself. They might now be shoe clerks, mailmen or waitresses – they seem perfectly benign in normal times. They play baseball on weekends and pet the family dog. However, given the chance, they will sign up for the Gestapo, the Stasi, the KGB, the TSA, Homeland Security or whatever. Many are well intentioned but likely to favor force as the solution to any problem.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t end there, because 20% of that 20% are really bad actors. They are drawn to government and other positions where they can work their will on other people and, because they&#39;re enthusiastic about government, they rise to leadership positions. They remake the culture of the organizations they run in their own image. Gradually, non-sociopaths can no longer stand being there. They leave. Soon the whole barrel is full of bad apples. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening today in the US.</p>
