       The constitutionality of it is questionable, at the least.  It is a tax that the government gets away with every year without questioning. Why does everybody accept that the government has the right to take from their paychecks?

       Are people seriously that gullible..or do we just feel useless as a nation to change anything?

       Fear of the IRS and what they can do to you....My buddy has a small car paint shop. They made him put a sign on his business saying he was closed and that it was a felony to take the sign down. I still don't think he payed his taxes. The sign has been there for a while....It was funny to watch it play out because all they could do is force him to put a sign up and I guess close his business, in the hopes that he would magically come by the back tax money without working.

       I'm fairly certain from 2006 until now there has been a huge number of people not paying or have not ability to pay. The mainstream media is told not to report that, because the last thing they want is the riffraff getting any ideas about 'protesting with all the other non-payers.'

       Its very close to 50% of the US isnt paying taxes. If you get a refund of any kind, you arent paying in. You may be contributing to Medicare and SSI but you arent paying taxes.

       "private" prisons are a symptom. The politicians who accept the money from lobbyists to
       <em>
        allow and write legislation

       for them to exist is the problem.

       It's exactly appropriate.  I'm making a moral argument.  If we can agree that we are against violence, then we must remain ethical in our enforcement of that.

       I understand that you are trying to persist on this morality principle but you are ignoring the fact that the comments you debate are not in favor of aggression, they are simply stating that aggression exists.  I made this point to you yesterday and you never answered it so I'll try again because I genuinely want to understand this.. If I say "There is a war in Afghanistan" is the appropriate response "Why are you for that war of aggression?"

       So you are saying that your answer to aggression is more aggression?
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of attitude perpetuates the problem rather than offering any logical sort of solution.  What you are arguing for is
       <strong>
        your

       kind of aggression.

      <p>
       You should examine this contradiction in your worldview thoroughly.

       Oh, pardon me. I didn't mean to make that distinction, tho I suppose the list could be endless, but the guy with a gun on the street is in all probablility a cop, therefore a more violence-prone agent of the very same apparatus as the IRS auditor.

       you can work it out with your employer to have no tax withheld from your paycheck; you then have to sort it all out yourself at tax time. that's the only way to keep the government's grubby hands off your money for any length of time. but most of us are too stupid/lazy/apathetic/complacent to do their own taxes, and also many are afraid to provoke the IRS.

       And how would we organize this massive movement? Since many people have their taxes automatically deducted from their paychecks, how would we hope to educate AND convince them to with hold that money past tax time?

       It sounds BRILLIANT in theory, because IT WILL WORK, but yeah, nigh-impossible to put into practice. anyone who actually gets up on the national stage to push this will be immediately and mercilessly demonized, doxxed, hacked, harassed, audited, raked over the coals, and likely assassinated, because our tax dollars are the lifeblood of the Machine.

       Income tax is structured in such a way that those who think they are clever can pat themselves on the back and tell themselves that they have worked the system to their advantage, and received perks that their next door neighbor isn't getting. It allows them to feel superior about themselves. These loopholes in the tax code are not mistakes or oversights -- they are part of the structure of income tax extortion, without which there would be a general uprising against the tax. But as long as those who think they are smarter than the rest can tell themselves that they received exemptions that the rest are not getting, they will allow themselves to be financially raped year after year. After all, they didn't get raped as deep as those other guys, right?

       Our laws are based on consent.

       Offer and accept.

      <p>
       <strong>
        1.) Most people choose to accept the claim that the Federal government has authority.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We are better than cattle in the sense that cattle needs a shepard or a dog or something to tend the flock; we tend ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bring up taxation and nine out of ten people get super hostile when I say I don't want to pay Federal Income Tax. They don't even hear that I've made a distinction between Federal and state. Most people don't know where tax money goes or how Federal budgets are paid. They actually think that Federal Income Tax dollars go to Federal programs. This is the level of thought you're dealing with.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they're the police, your family and your neighbors. They won't turn you in, but someone who really really believes who finds out will surely turn you in. The funniest thing is that they won't get shit from the Feds. They'll think they're doing some duty and the most they'll get is a pat on the head by the Feds. It's sort of sad when you think abut it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2.) In order to pay taxes you have to volunteer them.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, I've been looking into the legalities of this and it seems they have no right to claim your money. You must volunteer your money. All of the audits and so on are really consensual at the end of the day. They only have authority if you step into their arena.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a highly abstract concept. Hell, I only just found out about it this year and I've been totally into this topic for years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can only commit purgery and lie about taxes if you've done some lying. Fifth amendment. If you don't tell people about shit then they have nothing on you. So, obviously, you just don't say anything to the IRS. They're a body that can be lied to so don't lie. What I mean by that is: say nothing. You don't know their codes. For Christ's sake
       <em>
        they don't know their codes
       </em>
       . The codes are so lengthy and convoluted that the average IRS agent has never read them and doesn't know what codes you may or may not be breaking. So simply don't say anything. Don't file.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seen another way, it's a vampire at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vampires can only come in if you invite them.

      <p>
       Never invite a vampire into your home.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3.) You are not a citizen because the is no state.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, that was a bit of a shocker for me as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It boils down to the definition of a citizen:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A citizen's or subject's obligation of fidelity and obedience to the government or sovereign in return for the benefits of the protection of the state.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In return for protection. There is no duty, on the part of government, to protect anyone. This has been upheld in multiple court cases. One very recently, in fact, in New York. If there is no duty to protect then there is no state. If there is no state then there are no citizens. If there are no citizens that have allegiance to a state then the codes being enforced are by a bunch of ideologues who simply want to fleece what they regard as tax livestock; and, of course, their dupes, rubes and true believers who know no better (go to r/atheism, r/politics and r/news for examples of such people).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitution is not a binding document from a legal standpoint except by those bodies that claim it as a binding document. For example, the judicial system claims the Constitution as the guide for their procedures. But
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are the ones bound by the Constitution; not the people they're judging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the language of the Constitution and it only talks about what the government can or can't do. The Constitution has zero to say about what a given person can or can't do. So, not only is it non-binding it's also irrelevant to the average person.
      </p>
      <p>
       When anyone talks about how laws apply due to the Constitution this is intellectual trickery. Laws do not apply through the power and authority of the Constitution. Laws only apply if you're a citizen. Which doesn't exist because there's no state because there's no duty to protect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm not saying that you get to do whatever you want, including murder, rape and rob. Those are unlawful, but more importantly, they're violence. This is unacceptable in any country and in any context. I actually  do think that court proceedings are reasonable if there is an injury to be redressed. Rape is an injury. Murder (of spouse, child, friend) is an injury to the survivors. In such cases this isn't about 'law' so much as punishing the responsible party. In such a context the courts have some claim to legitimacy if only to be relatively impartial to a disagreement between two people. The alternative is that we settle our disputes with duels in the streets. Which I don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you're only a citizen, in some sense, if you think you're a citizen. If they offer a claim that the laws apply and you accept their claim that the laws apply then you are acquiescing to their will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Offer and accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is contract law.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have yet to go any further into this area as I'm currently reading up on the subject. I'm reading an essay by a guy named 'Lysander Spooner' that talks about the nature of the Federal government from the perspective of someone who just watched the Civil War. This is some meaty text and I think anyone talking about taxes needs to read this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, those are some thoughts I thought I'd share to those who may or may not find them interesting.

       Hence the "mass" ...they can't arrest thousands of people for not paying a tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I see what you mean...But The Federal Reserve Act was passed by Congress. The Federal Reserve is still a government entity, it is just independent. Though Congress still gives the Fed power and still oversees the activity and make changes to the Fed's role.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, guess who gets the earnings leftover from operational expenses?...The U.S. treasury does; and they are highly correlated with the Federal Reserve since the fed controls the interest rate and money supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, given their grant of power from Congress and still be considered a government entity (though, independent), the Fed is still accountable to Congress, and more importantly, the People.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, please explain to me why you think the Fed has nothing to do with government? If you can't, I suggest reading up on what government actually is and what the Fed's role in government is.

       Muckraker's argument of it funding terrorism has nothing to do with the ACA. You'd be better off making the argument that the 10th amendment makes the ACA unconstitutional, which has nothing to do with the 16th, or whether income tax itself is legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to argue that the war on terror is itself including acts of terror you might be able to form a reasonable argument. If you wanted to talk about black-budget funding of radical elements in other countries and the overthrow of democratic governments being acts of terrorism, you also might be able to make some good points.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the 16th amendment made income tax itself legal, and the constitutionality of the income tax itself can't really be questioned since it was passed by an amendment to the constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might argue that in passing funding that went to certain foreign groups Congress has committed a crime - but that crime is not about the income tax.

       You missed Article I, Section 9, Clause 4: No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.
Also- you're wrong. In order to make taxation legal Congress needed a 2/3rds vote, which they did NOT have, but they passed anyway. The taxation laws, as they stand, are wholly illegal since the process to make them legal was, in short, fraudulent.

       .....? The british empire did not impose income taxes on the colonies.  There were mostly market taxes and tariffs like tea, stamps, food, etc. They were still taxes nonetheless but I meant the taxes our government has been imposing on our paychecks for a century with no question.

       For fiscal years 1995 through 2012, the total revenue from the individual income tax was $16.5 trillion. During those same years, the total amount paid in interest on the debt was $5.3 trillion. About 10% of that, $534 billion, went to the Federal Reserve. However, during the same period, the Federal Reserve paid the U.S. government $638 billion. That's right, the Federal Reserve has paid the government more than $100 billion more than the government has paid the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, the net interest on the debt was just 23% of the amount collected for individual income taxes. There was no net payment to the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>

       The government borrows money by selling Treasury securities (Treasury bills and Treasury bonds) at auction. Investors buy these and can resell them. The Federal Reserve buys a portion of those on the Open Market in order to add to the nations money supply (the monetary base). The Federal Reserve gets the interest on the Treasury securities it owns, but it gives all of its profits to the government after a dividend to its member banks, so it ends up that the portion of the debt that is owned by the Fed is essentially free money to the federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has made
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of profit from other activities, such as mortgage-backed securities. Those profits go to the government, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve only owns 11 to 12 percent of Treasury securities. The interest that the government pays to the other bondholders doesn't come back to the government :-(.

       No, the Federal Reserve pays to the Treasury all of its profits after a dividend to the member banks. Historically, this has been slightly smaller than the interest that the government has paid the Federal Reserve, but in the last few years, the Fed has made massive profits from other operations, such as the emergency loans and mortgage-backed securities.

       If I provide numbers you can just stand back and call bullshit like I did with yours....all one needs to do is look at the state of the "union" and one see's exactly what is going on and who is in charge....Not only that, I'm a "whistle blower" and "insider" you can say what you want, for now fathers and his mens money is still good, but soon you will see, this Jew will take down his Zionist father and I will make him let my people go. I will use his own weapon against him, his money and his people

       Well, let's see them and let us all judge for ourselves. Or maybe you don't have numbers. Of course, you don't, because it's a big myth. Maybe you know it's false and yet you keep repeating it. Or maybe you're just starting to doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe you're still in full denial mode. Think back about where you learned this information. What were there sources? There's a good chance that they were just repeating stories that they heard without checking on them, just like you're doing. But if you trace back the information, there's no basis to it. It's not true that most of the money from the income tax goes to the Federal Reserve. It's never been true or even close to true. It's a big lie.

       wait, what? sales and property taxes are state-levied, nothing to do with federal income tax...also who's a shill? looks an awful lot like you're obfuscating and misdirecting...even got some one-world jingoism at the end, and bringing the zionists into what was previously a no-zionist discussion.

       perhaps you are mistaken...one said " why no revolt against INCOME tax {federal}....then one said "what about fire dept" ... then I pointed out fire dept are paid for with apportioned taxation...ie. equal pay, pay per use taxation....buy the soda, pay the tax, don't, don't....own a house, pay property tax, don't don't and the fee you pay will be the same as the guy next to you...not based on how much money you make...ie INCOME tax....everything is about the Zionist...Did you know that I was born a Zionist?, a very powerful one, but now I'm just a Jew, I gave up my ownership of you so I could try to set you free

       The government borrows money by selling Treasury securities (Treasury bills and Treasury bonds) at auction. Investors buy these and can resell them. The Federal Reserve buys a portion of those on the Open Market in order to add to the nations money supply (the monetary base). The Federal Reserve gets the interest on the Treasury securities it owns, but it gives all of its profits to the government after a dividend to its member banks, so it ends up that the portion of the debt that is owned by the Fed is essentially free money to the federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has made
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of profit from other activities, such as mortgage-backed securities. Those profits go to the government, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve only owns 11 to 12 percent of Treasury securities. The interest that the government pays to the other bondholders doesn't come back to the government :-(.

       You missed Article I, Section 9, Clause 4: No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.
Also- you're wrong. In order to make taxation legal Congress needed a 2/3rds vote, which they did NOT have, but they passed anyway. The taxation laws, as they stand, are wholly illegal since the process to make them legal was, in short, fraudulent.

       I understand that you are trying to persist on this morality principle but you are ignoring the fact that the comments you debate are not in favor of aggression, they are simply stating that aggression exists.  I made this point to you yesterday and you never answered it so I'll try again because I genuinely want to understand this.. If I say "There is a war in Afghanistan" is the appropriate response "Why are you for that war of aggression?"
