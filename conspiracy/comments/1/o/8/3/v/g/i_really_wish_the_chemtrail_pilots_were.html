    <div class="md"><p>Reddit needs to get the story straight on chemtrails (AKA: geoengineering, solar radiation management). THEY OPENLY ADMIT THEY ARE DOING THIS! If you ask sincerely I can assure you that there is tons of data on the difference between a chem and a con. I would like to ask you for your common sense. If a chemtrail and contrail are the same &#39;stuff&#39; how can they exist in the same airspace, at the near the same altitude. Why is 1 trail 6-12 times the length of the plain and the other spans from horizon to horizon. Also look into the way water interact with the atmosphere and there will be zero doubt about this phenomenon. &quot;what&quot; is it? (small nano particles aluminim barium and others used to: A: combat global warming B: interfere with brain chemistry to make use us fight with each other C: ruin self efficiency, as the environment is contaminated, the will send in GMO to &quot;save&quot; us. and &quot;who&quot;: neocons from the UN and other global warming tyranical elites. BUT that is not as important as using the laws of science, as applied to water, water vapor, and atmospheric pressure to determine that these horizon spanning streaks are 100% not water. Also I am a studied micro-meteorologist, pilot requirement.

<blockquote>
<p>The Boeing EA-18G Growler is an American carrier-based electronic warfare aircraft, a specialized version of the two-seat F/A-18F Super Hornet. The EA-18G will replace the Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowlers in service with the United States Navy. The Growler&#39;s electronic warfare capability is primarily provided by Northrop Grumman. The EA-18G began production in 2007 and entered operational service in late 2009.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone on this site ever seen how many airplanes are flying in the sky at any one time?  Does anyone here understand the principles of how water vapour/molecules adhere to particles - especially at altitude and low temperature.  The likelihood of a government body or anyone else out there spiking jet fuel to produce some chem trail is so unlikely it is preposterous.  I am a conspiracy theorist my self but this one is so unlikely and so easily explained that it just is not true.  Have a look at the link below to see how many airplanes are flying at once over North America alone and you may be able to appreciate how that all that exhaust (not chem trails) can literally block out the sun - nothing needs to be added to this to produce cloud.  You know -  during 9/11 it was documented that when all aviation was shut down, world pollution levels when down by 5%!! - that&#39;s just from shutting down aviation and the skies were more clear than they have been in 30 years.  So stop blaming the government for &quot;chem trails&quot; and start looking at our selves as we pollute our environment to the point it can not sustain us any longer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you all fail to understand is that there are different types of contrails. When they form carlton very high altitude they instantly freeze and longer for longer as ice doesn&#39;t evaporate and doesn&#39;t melt at -40 degrees. These are dispersed through sublimation which is why they last longer. Lower level contrails only last a few minutes because they evaporate. Aerodynamic contrails last only a split second. </p>

<p>There are more contrails now than when we were kids because there are more planes in the air and more high flying planes.</p>

<p>Saying they&#39;re &quot;chemtrails&quot;, based on NO credible evidence is like saying Thor is responsible for lightning because you don&#39;t understand it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure ill get downvoted because people hate having their deep seated beliefs a debunked but whatever.</p>

One quick look <a href="http://www.flightradar24.com">here</a> shows most aircraft in the sky in near real time.

<p>You think a government program would be run using civilian transponders and aircraft easily monitored by anyone on flightradar24.com, huh? I disagree, but spastic vulgarity and temper tantrums do give one a &quot;bad name.&quot;</p>

<p>Another quote from the site you think could sort this all out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blocking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For security and privacy reasons information about some aircraft is limited or blocked.</p>

<p>If there is a military or governmental (AKA non-civilian) operation being conducted secretly to geoengineer the sky, wouldn&#39;t those aircraft be amongst those &quot;blocked&quot;? </p>

<p>It seems like you contrail experts pick and choose your battles carefully. Unless you can explain the odd behavior of the contrails in the above video, we all have to assume it is exactly what it looks like: a classified program to spray chemicals out of planes to observe and control the weather.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show me evidence that chemicals arein those contrails. How hard is that to understand, that evidence is needed to back up a claim. </p>

<p>Clouds are made of water vapor and ice crystals, contrails are made up of the same material, which form from the water vapor content in the exhaust of jet engines. The reason they stick in the air is due to temperature/pressure/other water content in the air. Clouds do not disperse immediately after being made, they linger in the air, exactly like contrails. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you see how the contrail formed before the cloud, turned off while the plane passed through, then turned back on again after it passed the cloud? If what you say is correct, the conditions for lingering contrail formation should have increased as the plane passed through the cloud, not disappeared altogether. It certainly appears to me to be left deliberately to view by satellite.  </p>

<p>So when we see start-stop contrails that mostly appear in a straight line like this: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eA0sA0s.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/eA0sA0s.jpg</a> , it is always due to natural atmospheric conditions and never are they left deliberately. Also, when we see start-stop contrails like this: <a href="http://imgur.com/4BkJhjV">http://imgur.com/4BkJhjV</a> it is due to deliberate spraying of chemicals controlled by the pilot. According to you, there is no possibility in between of experiments going on that you are not informed of. If that makes sense to you....ok. </p>

<p>Show me evidence that this plane is spraying some harmful chemical to hurt citizens. I don&#39;t understand how every chemtrail conspiracy theorist does not understand that those of us who doubt them only want to see evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the official definition of chem-trails anyway? 
If there&#39;s a trail of exhaust smoke in the sky, wouldn&#39;t that technically be a trail of chemicals or &quot;chem-trail&quot;. This is where I get confused, I dont believe contrails are as prevalent as some will claim. They didn&#39;t linger so much when I was a kid. Cloud seeding or thick exhaust smoke = chemtrails then, right? Or is that too broad of a statement?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a simple scientific explanation for the trails you see criss-crossing the skies. They are not exhaust smoke. They are plumes of ice which are left when a jetliner burns fuel in a cold wet atmosphere. A large persistent contrail may contain several thousand tons of ice and there isn&#39;t a plane ever built that could carry that amount of any substance to that height in the atmosphere. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin; it is a hydrocarbon. When it burns in air the carbon part combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (Dihydrogen Monoxide, H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes this steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is already saturated with water vapour then these crystals will grow many times in size through a process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much, &quot;chemtrails&quot; are the deliberate spraying of chemicals in the atmosphere to create harm to the citizens below, or for unknown &quot;covert&quot; purposes. </p>

<p>I would not say exhaust/contrails falls under that, as there is no intent to do harm to people from these, and the reasons are pretty well known, along with cloud seeding. People claim &quot;chemtrails&quot; are used to create health problems, or psychological problems such as aggression and all that.</p>
