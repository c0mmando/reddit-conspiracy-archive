       Radicals are brave and disciplined, usually highly educated, too. Why is Snowden a hero, and Jesus is the "mythological agent of crowd control"? Can we discuss this without y'all logging into your MANY accounts to down vote, to reinforce your own opinions?

       When someone uses their faith (and I don't care if they have it or not) in a mythical figure as the basis for their ideas, their actions, and/or their perspective, I can't take them seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't care if it's God, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster, it's all the same to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, does Christianity (and other religions) have some positive aspects and/or messages? Sure, they do, but it's also common sense - stuff like don't kill people, don't steal, respect your parents, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does someone need a mythical figure and the promise of something beyond death in order to live by those principles?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why does someone feel the need to justify the actions of people who do what even I would consider evil acts as brought about by the mythical antithesis of their chosen mythical savior?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another solid reason is the Church itself. One only has to read a history book to see the abuses of people the Church sanctioned in the name of their God.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you have many believers using their faith in a mythical being as enough evidence to reject legitimate science dating the earth, showing evolution, etc. And they try to inject that ridiculousness into the education of all children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether faith itself is a bad thing, I won't debate. But people use that faith in the guise of the Church to commit what can only be called atrocities against the people of the world and our future generations.

       It may seem like common sense now.. but the reason most of those things were written down and preserved long enough for you to be aware of them is because they were profound given the context and time.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the significance. We don't have volumes and volumes of significant stories that have made it through the years that still hold so much significance. It's hard to discount it given the amount of attention it still gets to this day. Love it or hate it..

       I'm waiting to see what Snowden releases.  So far nothing really has changed as a result.   Lavabit closed down..as did some others.  Everything is still tapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Jesus, if that isn't one of the biggest conspiracy/frauds of all time, I don' know what is.   There's no historical evidence for a Jesus, while there is evidence that the myth was created to placate the messianic cults, and have them worship Caesar as a god - hey.. maybe that is a lot like snowden too.

       Obviously Christianity influences us, but many of the core values of Western civilization come from Roman law, common law, and classical philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pope, ostensibly the leader of Christianity, is still called the
       <em>
        Pontifex Maximus,
       </em>
       the old title bestowed on Roman Emperors (It originates as the title for the spiritual leader of Rome's Pagan religion).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our republican democracy is a legacy of the Ancient Greeks and the Native Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our more modern ideas of equality and egalitarianism come from the Enlightenment (when the West began to unshackle itself from Christianity), whereas slavery and wife-beating are not condemned in the Bible. The scientific method also dates from around this period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, many of the more rules-based parts of the Christian bible predate Christianity by at least several hundred years, as it already formed the basis of Judaism.

       The pope is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the leader of christianity, but of the sect coopted by roman government, when the belief system got too large to control. As an entity it has committed and endorsed more crimes against humanity than any other organization that i am aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything roman catholicism is the state sanctioned control system turned corporation and global dominator that serves to further blight the name of christianity by association. As such, the organization should be thoroughly rejected and denounced, while ill admit that there are some who follow its tenets that are actual christians, they are few and far between.
      </p>
      <p>
       If i had to wager a guess, id say that the roman catholic church is the great harlot who whores herself out to the kings of this world. Observe her actions and you will see that she stains the name of christians and serves only to draw those who believe her down in to sin with her. You will also see more in the future of her purporting false doctrine to deceive and divide the Church of Christ.

       Both? I mean, I was raised Catholic, but didn't get a real understanding of Christ until I explored and practiced other religions. I KNOW much about Christ has been manipulated (he had a wife and the church switched to celibacy to prevent inheritance rights of church properties, etc) , but I believe nuggets of truth do exist in the popular narrative.

       I agree that Jesus (the character) had some good teachings.  The Sermon on the Mount was pretty solid.  But he also contradicts his own words all over in the Bible so most people just accept the parts that they enjoy/relate to and ignore the stuff they don't or say that it's taken out of context or misinterpreted etc.

       Alright, but keep in mind that these were taken straight from the Bible.  The problem with the Bible is that even if you do believe that Jesus was real and the Bible is the perfect word of God, the New Testament was written decades after the events took place by people who didn't speak the same language and only knew the stories through oral story-sharing.  It was a decades-long-multi-language game of telephone.  Then after it was written (all by hand) it had to be transcribed (all by hand) to make copies - an endeavor that surely would result in errors.  This occurred hundreds of times in dozens of different languages (some of these languages have the same word meaning different things so the scribe was left to guess which way to best translate).  THEN Kings and elite class gathered to pick their favorite stories and eliminate the stories that they didn't want included, so large chunks of what was originally written was left on the cutting room floor.  All of this happened before anybody even got to hear what was in the Bible (nobody was allowed to own it at first because the church didn't want anybody to interpret it in any way other than the way they were instructed in church -- also it was only originally allowed to be printed in ancient Latin because hardly anybody but priests knew how to read/speak that language so this way even if somebody did get their hands on the Bible they wouldn't know what it said).  This just doesn't seem to me like the best vehicle for an all-knowing God to use to spread the good new that Jesus Christ has died for our sins.  Seems more like an idea that was born in the brain of man who had no idea what sort of technology would eventually exist that could disprove how the Earth was created, etc.

       I have no problem with Jesus or god. I believe in god, or at least something very much like god. I do not know whether Jesus was a real historical figure or not, but then I also don't know whether it matters or not if he actually existed. I do not have a problem with Christians
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have a problem with people that claim to be Christians but somehow don't let the fact that they are Christian affect their behavior in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, people that seem to feel that the fact that they think of themselves as Christians means that they somehow automatically occupy the moral high ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, this type of Christian, which I like to call Chinos (Christian In Name Only), from my experience, seems to make up the vast bulk of those that identify as Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I downvoted your post. Partially because this is a conspiracy forum, and if I wanted to hear about Jesus I'd go to Church, but mostly because I think it is hilarious to do so.

       Christianity has been under a sustained attack in the media, the schools, the universities, for many decades. The purpose is to destroy the people's faith in Christian moral values, so that they will accept an increasingly perverse, corrupt, evil living environment for themselves and their children. If you have strong Christian moral values, you can't have casual lying and fraud on all levels of authority. You can't have casual abortion or full acceptance of homosexuality. The people have been trained by the media to believe that abortion, homosexuality, and lying are fine and dandy, a part of everyday life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people seeking to destroy Christianity are the same people seeking to promote a culture of greater perversity, corruption, and soullessness. They are trying to remake the West, which is and always has been Christian, into their own image.
      </p>
      <p>
       To respond to your question, the common people recoil from Christianity because they have been conditioned to recoil from Christianity, by their masters, the elite who control ever facet of their lives, and who tell them what to think and what to believe. It's not a decision the people have made for themselves. It was made for them.

       I don't trust organized religion. I will attend church with family if they ask, but I'd never join a church. Im very spiritual, walk my own path. That being said, I still love Jesus and want to be like Him, I just can't believe what the Church has become in general. Coming from a small town, all I really see here in the way of Christians would be bigots. Now I liken the religion to that and don't want to be associate with it. Jesus was NEVER that way. In fact, Jesus was exactly what these hardcore Christians would deem a "terrorist" today. They wouldn't even know the difference, because they wouldn't give him the time of day. Forgive the rant, their ignorance and lack of love troubles me.

       If we did have magic powers then at least 1 out of the billions of people born after him would have turned water to wine at least a few times and everyone would know about it.

       I see Jesus as a Hugo Chaves or Rafael Correa, leftist/revolutionary/for the people and wanted by world powers (jewish wannabes)

       I think it is because it is purposefully demonized by our culture. It gets muddled in with the argument of "All wars are because of religion etc".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also purposefully perverse as well. We must always remember that Jesus does not equal Church, or Catholicism, or denominations, or anything like that. It is purposefully made out to be a bad thing.

       I find it fascinating the amount of attention given to Jesus after ~2000. The actual words attributed to him (fictional character or not) were profound given his time and context.. which lends to the persistence of the story. Whether you believe it to be historical or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Mythology there is something specific about the information that is timeless, in that the way it was and is communicated is persistent. It's like a seed, some might call a cultural virus.. regardless there is something that continues to demand attention. People get mad and try to derail the attention and the significance which only lends to the persistence of it. No one can get rid of it's significance on a broad cultural scale.. try as they might. Perhaphs personally.. but on a wider scale, no group or individual has succeeded and many have tried and continue to do so. Research, books, entire movements around the insistence of what Jesus isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mankind has one history, made up of every single life before this moment. Lives of all the different cultures, all the myths and history.. Jesus's (life or story or myth) holds a significant position in our shared history. Even if you don't personally place any meaning or attention on it.. it is still true that the majority of people alive right now are aware of the story, have some opinion on it and place some attention to it.. whether negative or positive. Isn't there a conspiracy there somewhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a school of thought for the last couple of decade's that insists that some people SMARTER than us were able to craft this tale in such a way that it would persist for millennia. Well whomever did that will hold an extremely novel place in time.. There is no other Jesus, whether fabricated or not. How did they do that? 2000 years and look at ALL the attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask this honestly, if there was some unit of measure for attention.. Is there any one person, fictional or real, whom has garnered more attention for the last 4000 years? If you calculated the units of attention spent from 4000 years ago up until this moment?

       You mean like how time is measured BC &amp; AD? Maybe because the Church was the first organized scientific, educational &amp; literacy power?
