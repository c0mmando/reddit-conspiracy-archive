<p>It will divide the country, there will be settlement camps (possibly fema) that people who are in need will be willing to migrate to, and those that are not willing to migrate will be coerced. </p>

<p>That is why there is such a push for gun control, if WE don&#39;t have guns to protect what is ours when shit hits the fan, then we really will feel the NEED for martial law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the sense that we are in the midst of a silent civil war right now.  And not to say &quot;the sky is falling,&quot; but the budget crisis, government shutdown and debt ceiling may lead to the people in need not getting the food/subsidies they are used to getting, sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>When the politicos talk about prioritizing payments after a default, part of that is how far down the list do we put food (SNAP, WIC, TANF?)   This is  is a dangerous and not insubstantial thing.  Hungry people are dangerous people.   Food should be at the top of the funding priority unless the people in power <em>want</em> violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, many people, including those on food stamps, feel entitled to a hearty well rounded meal. Rice and beans with some seasonings can actually be really tasty. Not the heartiest of meals but a meal nonetheless. If you can afford a bag of boneless skinless chicken breasts once a month you can throw half a cooked cut up breast into your rice and beans a couple times a week. If rice werent so annoying to cook I would make it more often. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. </p>

<p>A food crisis also lends itself nicely to a &quot;cooperation&quot; between Monsanto and the gov. They will get huge grants, but the food belongs to the government. It will then be rationed out. In the not too distant future, it is not out of this realm to envision bread lines, soup kitchens, etc. access to these &quot;establishments&quot; will be regulated by a barcode-esque tattoo or a microchip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a point many miss.  We are paying the 40+ million to not riot over hunger.  For those saying they need to just not be parasites, you are not really paying attention to the larger trends.  WHERE exactly would 40 million people find well paying, self sustaining jobs?  Even if every single one of them got taught some skill, what exactly would all those people do?  We are actually reaching the crisis stage of capitalism where technology makes &quot;jobs&quot; meaningless.  We could have more make work jobs like the Soviets did (in the US, make work jobs are not as obvious, but the exsist all over.  From middle management to HR to finance, as in people who are paid to literally produce nothing.) but that is not a REAL solution.  I agree with personal responsibility,but there are much greater forces and trends at work here, all of which no amount of boot strap pulling will solve.</p>

<p>Those advocating no food stamp funding really want chaos.  Why not just be honest about it?</p>

<p>This is western capitalist propaganda. Do you realize how many time zones of undeveloped land, minerals &amp; other assets made up the Soviet Union &amp; somehow we are supposed to believe they were making jobs of little consequence for the citizens? Americans always spout this kind of nonsense, because they learned it in &#39;college&#39;.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised to find out that the Bush family with their CIA/Contra/Oil/Middle East connections are the greatest drug lords of all time.  It would actually explain a lot about the use of the US government trying to track down Pablo Escobar, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this an exciting time to be human? I personally think TPTB have been too slow and God has woken up too many of His children. Every day, more people wake up and start stock piling food and weaponry. I know countless people who do it. The entire Mormon church are doomsayers—they&#39;re supposed to stock two years of food. Most Protestants are aware of what&#39;s happening. There are shows on cable dedicated to prepping for this, because of how many are doing it. Humanity is either about to be enslaved, or freed. As a believer in salvation through Jesus Christ, I&#39;m not at all worried. God woke me up last December with Sandy Hook and since then, He&#39;s prepared me for whatever is next. Isn&#39;t it exciting?</p>

<p>Any time you find yourself irrationally refusing to look for the truths in something—<em>especially</em> an ancient Holy Book—you should take pause and ask yourself what is causing you to turn your head away from truth. I would <em>never</em> &quot;stay away from&quot; an ancient civilizations&#39; Holy Book just because I believe most of it&#39;s &quot;nonsense.&quot; Again—that sounds like demonic (or, as David Ike or President Obama would say; &quot;reptilian&quot;) influence in your decision making. Repulsion to truth is a sickness. Notice, you admit that the world is just as full of nonsense, yet you&#39;re not telling me to stay away from it. I&#39;m sorry if my spirituality offends you and prevents you from speaking cordially, but you should ask yourself what makes you so hostile toward the most beautiful story on earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologise for telling you to kill yourself OP.
I was angered by your theory because of the following:
-&quot;keep US SAFE for when those that have had handouts for their whole lives suddenly have nothing and no productive way to acquire it.&quot;</p>

<p>Coming from a low-income family, far from the middle class, and having depended on food stamps and federal financial aid for my education, I see that many of these &quot;handouts&quot; are needed because of the exploitation and inequality caused by the business models of many corporations and the lack of unions and worker protection laws. A great part of our population struggle to afford housing or pay rent because of the rising costs, costs that rise far faster than wages. What we need to avoid your theory is more policies that protect the individual and promote distribution of wealth. </p>

<p>So blaming the little guys that are being crushed by policies that take care of corporations instead of individuals, then saying we need gun rights to protect ourselves from the backlash of decades of political decisions that lead to said backlash is just outrageous. </p>

<p>So please, do not kill yourself, but put yourself on the shoes of &quot;those that have had handouts for their whole lives&quot;. They did it and do it because of necessity.</p>
