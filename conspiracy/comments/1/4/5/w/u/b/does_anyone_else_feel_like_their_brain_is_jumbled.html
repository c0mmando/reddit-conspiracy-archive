        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know that this sounds extremely weird. I don&#39;t mean to detract from any important issues on the board. Lately (over the past year) I have been feeling unfocused and I wanted to see if anyone else felt the same. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I read books, magazines, other online articles all the time. But I swear to you that the moment I find an interesting article on r/conspiracy that makes me want to learn more about or something that would open my eyes to another truth, it is like my brain shuts off. My eyes can&#39;t focus on what I am reading, I become so unfocused to the point of feeling hopeless about understanding what I am reading and most of the time I end up closing the article in hopes that someone has paraphrased what it is about in the comments. 
 I feel like this has increased within the last year of me getting heavily into finding truth rather than accepting lies told to us. I don&#39;t mean to sound paranoid or like &quot;the Russians are in my television&quot;, but seriously...what the heck is going on with me? Is anyone else feeling this way? Am I overreacting? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has truthfully been happening to me a lot on all of Reddit lately.  </p>

<p>From this sub reddit or other ones such as TIL I&#39;ll find a post the catches my eye and one in which I have a genuine interest in.  </p>

<p>Click the link, read a paragraph and then go to the comments hopefully for a summary.  Never check sources, or credibility.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad really. I don&#39;t get blurry eyes or  headaches or anything really. I just lose the will to read about the subject matter.   </p>

<p>I have noticed this happening about 3 months ago.  It just seems like such a chore now.  Whereas before I was consuming news and information all day.  </p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>:  Too much internet will destroy your concentration. The reason why is because stimulus from the internet rewires your brain and makes it difficult to focus on long pieces of writing. The best way to fix this is to cut back on your internet usage and spend more time reading actual books. Reading books helps you rewire your brain back to being able to concentrate.</p>

<p>Myself, I very recently noticed that Reddit in particular was having noticeably negative effects on my concentration and mood, so I cut back on my time here. After cutting back, I&#39;ve felt more balanced and motivated. I have an easier time getting myself to do work. I strongly recommend that everyone take an internet diet for at least a week or two. <a href="http://www.frugalskills.com/stop-procrastinating-7-tools-that-limit-your-internet-use">Here&#39;s a list of plugins that allow you to limit your time on certain websites</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the author, the reason why reading websites frequently hurts your concentration is because &quot;extras&quot; like links, pictures, videos, and advertisements distract you from the words. Even if you have no intention of clicking on anything or watching any embedded videos, your brain still sees these things and has to process them for you to make a decision on whether or not to click. Although it doesn&#39;t feel like it, this takes a lot of mental processing power, and the quality of your read-through suffers because of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest I have been feeling this way for over a year now myself. But it&#39;s more so where I feel like I&#39;m out of place or my brain is fogged up. Could be that I suffer from anxiety/panic attacks but I don&#39;t really know. My doctors say I suffer from paranoia as well so could be that to. I have been diagnosed May 5th 2011. Every time I come across an article that interests me the most or may seem more factual than conspiracy I get this really weird feeling then my brain starts getting dumb and a really weird feeling that orbs around me as well. Sounds weird huh? But it&#39;s true. Once I start to read more into the article that&#39;s when my anxiety gets the best of me. I have stopped watching television or listening to music for over 18 months now and just mainly read. Every time I read something that Is important to the truth that&#39;s when it occurs. Also, I would like to add that I read more books that I stay on the Internet. I will spend around 1-3 hrs per day on the Internet really. Anyways thanks for reading.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes when things that go against our prejudices and what we believe to be the truth in this world our brain shuts down. When you observe you tend to use confirmation bias and only observe the facts that coincide with your predetermined notions and reject all others. In a subreddit like r/conspiracy where the perceptions tend to not be mainstream you will often run across things that go against your biases. This is a subconscious function, and you should continue to try to gain perceptions that challenge your view of the world and search for answers to the questions that arrive. I am not saying this is what is happening to you per say, but may be a factor in the equation. It may be smart to see medical profesional to make sure it&#39;s not ADHD or another mental illness.    --&quot;it&#39;s not about living in the know, it&#39;s about living in the mystery.&quot;-- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair the majority of articles are completely useless.</p>

<p>Sure you can hear about some atrocities and some nefarious things,but after your 1000th article of that type just paint them as cthullu and be done with it.</p>

<p>In this reddit I only look at the title and skim over the article for details. Information that doesn&#39;t enlighten is useless which coincidentally the Illuminati knows very well.</p>

<p>What is more interesting is things like WHY they are doing this and that,filling up the jigsaw puzzle, but you don&#39;t get this kind of things here.</p>
