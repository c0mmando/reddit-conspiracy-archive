<p>JACOB TYLER ROBERTS = TERROR ACT BY JOBLES</p>

<p>if you don&#39;t know what im talking about... in the LAST large shooting .. James Eagan Holmes...</p>

<p>if you rearrange the letters of his name.. it spells &quot;Assh*le Name
Game J&quot; .. NO joke.. Holmes name .. rearranged anagram.</p>

<p>ASSHOLE NAME GAME J</p>

<p>this got me looking into past famous shooters... and victims... to play the
&quot;asshole name game&quot; starting with the letter J.</p>

<p>Jacob Tyler Roberts , mall shooter
James Eagan holmes, batman shooter
Jared Lee Loughner, gabrielle giffords shooter
James Earl Ray shot Martin Luther King
Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey who Shot John Kennedy, John Connelly, and Jackie Kennedy (all J names),
John Hinckley Jr. shot Ronald Regan,
J. Charles Guiteau shot President James Garfield
John Schrank shot President Theodore Roosevelt,
John Wilkes Booth shot President Abraham Lincoln,</p>

<p>Im sure there are more.. but these are just the ones I can find doing a presidential / famous shooting search.</p>

<p>Why is nobody asking why an apparently suicidal shooter would wear a full body disguise for his rendez-vous with death? Nor are they asking how this man shot himself with a jammed gun, and why, conveniently there are no witnesses to his demise. </p>

2) toasted marshmallows? </p>

<p>Wake up. We do not know the true identity of these killers. The suspects presented to the media on a plate (or slab) by the police are obviously patsies. </p>

<p>We cannot, at this point, rule out the possibility that the Aurora and Clackamas shooters are THE SAME PERSON, and this person is very much still alive and part of a wider conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly couldn&#39;t think your way out of a paper bag, but even someone more stupid than yourself (they must exist!) knows that deranged killer shootings are a real phenomenon. However, Clackamas and Aurora, and even the Colorado/Giffords shooting appear to be something slightly different.</p>

<p>Here we have apparent culprits which don&#39;t fit the lone shooter profile, and have no apparent motive. They are also people with no experience of guns. The police reveal the identity of these &quot;culprits&quot; immediately after the shootings, which the media doesn&#39;t question. There is then an lockdown of real information about the shootings, and the individuals&#39; real backgrounds. </p>

<p>In James Holmes&#39;s case, his court appearances show an individual drugged out of his mind, clearly incapable of defending himself, and yet his court case continues. You presumably have no problem with that either?</p>

<p>No. Criminals who don&#39;t want to be identified wear masks. The Aurora and Clackamas killings were not the handiwork of crazy people.</p>
