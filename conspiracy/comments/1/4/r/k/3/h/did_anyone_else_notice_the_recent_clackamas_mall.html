       I know a lot of people on SSRIs.  You probably do too.  Not a single one of them has shot up a mall or schoolyard.  Some of them have even benefitted, side-effects aside.

       I'm not ruling it out completely, but it seems unlikely.

       If you're planning an attack, a gun-free zone would be your ideal target. I don't see how that "doesn't add up" - the killers just did their homework.

       Like a lot of meds, you cannot cold turkey SSRIs.  It's best handled under a doctor's direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not laying blame anywhere.. just saying that meds aren't as evil as everyone seems to think (in my experience and research).  But then there's mind control...

       Even more likely, they should have been on SSRIs but weren't due to America's inadequate mental healthcare system, hence how their issues were able to develop to the point where this happened.

       This was posted on Dutchsinces Facebook.... Probably nothing but interesting coincidence
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Shooter.. his name...
       </p>
       <p>
        what are the chances.. another one? Jacob Tyler Roberts.. the mall shooter...
       </p>
       <p>
        His name.. rearrange the letters.. you get
       </p>
       <p>
        JACOB TYLER ROBERTS = TERROR ACT BY JOBLES
       </p>
       <p>
        if you don't know what im talking about... in the LAST large shooting .. James Eagan Holmes...
       </p>
       <p>
        if you rearrange the letters of his name.. it spells "Assh*le Name
Game J" .. NO joke.. Holmes name .. rearranged anagram.
       </p>
       <p>
        ASSHOLE NAME GAME J
       </p>
       <p>
        this got me looking into past famous shooters... and victims... to play the
"asshole name game" starting with the letter J.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jacob Tyler Roberts , mall shooter
James Eagan holmes, batman shooter
Jared Lee Loughner, gabrielle giffords shooter
James Earl Ray shot Martin Luther King
Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey who Shot John Kennedy, John Connelly, and Jackie Kennedy (all J names),
John Hinckley Jr. shot Ronald Regan,
J. Charles Guiteau shot President James Garfield
John Schrank shot President Theodore Roosevelt,
John Wilkes Booth shot President Abraham Lincoln,
       </p>
       <p>
        Im sure there are more.. but these are just the ones I can find doing a presidential / famous shooting search.

       So we have (yet another) mass shooter wearing a suitably creepy, full body disguise.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this particular case, a few minutes after the shooting, the police conveniently deliver up the dead body of a man which happens to be dressed in the same disguise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has nobody heard of misdirection?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is nobody asking why an apparently suicidal shooter would wear a full body disguise for his rendez-vous with death? Nor are they asking how this man shot himself with a jammed gun, and why, conveniently there are no witnesses to his demise.

       This is like pulling teeth. How about a simple multiple choice, I'll make it really easy for you.

      <p>
       Question: Why do people normally wear masks?
      </p>
      <p>
       1) To keep their true identity hidden?
or:
2) toasted marshmallows?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake up. We do not know the true identity of these killers. The suspects presented to the media on a plate (or slab) by the police are obviously patsies.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot, at this point, rule out the possibility that the Aurora and Clackamas shooters are THE SAME PERSON, and this person is very much still alive and part of a wider conspiracy.

       People normally wear masks to pretend they are a monster to scare people.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't normally wear masks to hide their real identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are they obvious patsies?  Why would the police select these people with uninteresting back grounds except for their mental health issues.  Why would the police shoot up a theatre or a mall?
      </p>
      <p>
       LOL you're fucking dumb.  Seriously, you have mental issues.  Go sort them out.  The whole world and every action in it isn't part of a conspiracy.

       You clearly couldn't think your way out of a paper bag, but even someone more stupid than yourself (they must exist!) knows that deranged killer shootings are a real phenomenon. However, Clackamas and Aurora, and even the Colorado/Giffords shooting appear to be something slightly different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we have apparent culprits which don't fit the lone shooter profile, and have no apparent motive. They are also people with no experience of guns. The police reveal the identity of these "culprits" immediately after the shootings, which the media doesn't question. There is then an lockdown of real information about the shootings, and the individuals' real backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       In James Holmes's case, his court appearances show an individual drugged out of his mind, clearly incapable of defending himself, and yet his court case continues. You presumably have no problem with that either?

       What is the lone shooter profile to you?  What makes these cases not match it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are all the other shooter gun nuts?  If the identity is obvious why wouldn't they release it?  And if they didn't I promise you would be right here claiming they were hiding the truth.  There is no pleasing people like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is there isn't much info about most people in the world easily available but that said what lockdown took place?  The media reported about them extensively.

       He's had a mental snap and incident clearly he's going to look confused.  Go volunteer at a psych ward some time or with patients and talk to them about what it's like.

       Aha, an expert on crazy people!

       So tell me, do you think these crazy people have a sudden moment of lucidity when deciding to disguise themselves before their mass murder spree?
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone having a psychotic episode just decides to sport a hockey goalie's mask, just in case someone recognises him?

       No. Criminals who don't want to be identified wear masks. The Aurora and Clackamas killings were not the handiwork of crazy people.

       Adoption is tricky. I believe I've read many children who are adopted already have attachment disorders from their preivious parents. (espeacilly foreign children from places like russia) You can find whole articles on the subject.
