        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The propaganda machine has done it&#39;s deed well.</p>

<p>5 short years ago, even the most liberal of my friends would argue in support of the 2nd amendment.  Today they call me antiquated for possessing firearms.  I feel, perhaps wrongly, that they supported the 2nd amendment only as long as Bush was in office. Now that Obama has another term, they no longer have any reason to &quot;fear&quot; the government.  (I&#39;m a libertarian so we hated Bush together)</p>

<p>Free speech zones really pissed them off back then, but once again, now they don&#39;t seem very rattled about it.</p>

<p>The NWO (New World Order) under the Bushes was a totalitarian nightmare, but now its a global progressive revolution that will bring the USA back up to speed with &quot;basic rights&quot; like firearms bans, smoke free public space, free education and healthcare.  The funny thing here is that we&#39;ll get all the bans real fast and easy, the free stuff however will always be &quot;just around the next corner&quot; or &quot;coming real soon guys! Just one more election!&quot;</p>

<p>I really need to know that I&#39;m not alone on this roller coaster.  We have, as a nation, lost our motherfucking minds over this left versus right bullshit.  We have sold ourselves out.  We have allowed our runaway government to take away all of our best tools and replace them with &quot;we the people petitions&quot; that simply get ignored.</p>

<p>I feel like that kid in the movie <em>The Never Ending Story</em>, watching the world crumble away beneath my feet.  </p>

<p>“Our youth now love luxury. They have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for their elders and love chatter in place of exercise; they no longer rise when elders enter the room; they contradict their parents, chatter before company; gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers.” - Socrates</p>

<p>Too bad the aged have been saying this of the youth for 2000+ years and yet through that entire time period humanity has done nothing but progress.  It&#39;s almost as if.... the young eventually become older, more mature, and then draw on that wisdom to make decisions in middle age.  Crazy.  That&#39;s the reason you see people like Justin Amash and the Occupy Wall Street crowd which unfortunately lost all of it&#39;s strength.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the 2nd amendment is concerned, I think you have it backwards.  Not only is gun ownership at an all time high, but most people on reddit seem to be liberals who support gun rights.  Just head over to r/guns and you&#39;ll realize that many of them, like reddit in general, are liberal.  Even when guns are brought up elsewhere you usually see gun control supporters getting massive downvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/guns">/r/guns</a> is an obvious heaven for pro-gun people so I don&#39;t really think that counts.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that we isolate ourselves.  There definitely is not anything in the constitution that would authorize our joining a world court that is higher than the highest court of our land.  I&#39;m all about mutually beneficial trade and travel but we don&#39;t need anyone helping craft our laws and policy.</p>

<p>People should be allowed to have whatever rules they want within their private businesses or homes.  The government shouldn&#39;t interfere. </p>

<p>I&#39;m happy you agree with me on left versus right.</p>

<p>Such as the right to protest without state sponsored violence breaking out systematically after the 11oclock news is over.  The right to be secure from unwarranted searches and seizures.  The right to buy the products we wish (even drugs and guns).  The right to information.  State secrets are nothing more than a tool for the corrupt.  The right to not be arrested on bullshit charges like &quot;interference of an investigation&quot; when all you&#39;re doing is filming.</p>

<p>Not to mention there are some serious regulations that need to be put in place within certain industries. (Media, medical, pharmacy, military, money)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey flytape.</p>

<p>For the record, some of us are going the other way. I have never been anti-gun, but I had never owned a gun until about a year ago. Now I have several and I practice fairly often.</p>

<p>I am still a &#39;liberal&#39; but I don&#39;t really know what that means anymore. I don&#39;t support Obama policies really at all (the idea of universal healthcare is rad, the reality is fucking stupid, etc). </p>

<p>Anyway, several years ago I would have probably said &quot;guns are cool, but you don&#39;t really need one&quot;. Now a days, I hang out over in r/collapse.</p>

<p>In closing, I also completely agree with you about the Bush/Obama thing. Bush was so clearly a &#39;vilain&#39; that the left was quick to protest. The left is however, currently snowed to think that Obama actually represents them. So it is not time to protest anyone. Meanwhile, OWS sure got its ass kicked under Obama, didn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So show me these stats.  If gun control lowers gun violence, then we should see very little gun crimes in Chicago, D.C. and New York, where pistols are illegal (except D.C. just changed the law I believe).  Quite the opposite, these cities have very high rates of crime.</p>

<p>Wrong again.  These are comparable because many drug addicts commit crimes to fund their habit just like some people with firearms use them illegally.  The majority of drug users and gun owners do not commit violence against other people and are law abiding citizens (except for possession, in the case of drugs).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do I think about it?  Personally, I like the Glock 21, it&#39;s got a nice light trigger pull. Americans have the right to bear arms - it&#39;s in the Constitution because people thought it important enough to establish that right.</p>

<p>Now, do I think it&#39;s too easy for civilians to get guns in America?  Yes.  Do I think that small arms contribute to high murder rates in U.S. cities?  I definitely do.  Do I think that high capacity mags and assault rifles are overkill for civilian fire arms?  Yes.</p>

<p>What pisses me off the most is the economy of arms in America, and how arms sales are tied to the fear tactics of motherfucking asshole cocksuckers like the NRA and the gun faggotry of Wayne LaPierre.  The waves of sheep buying up weapons when Obama was re-elected are the perfect example - Obama&#39;s administration has done NOTHING to restrict access to guns, yet the propaganda machine that propagates throughout the conspiracy wing-nut crowd drives demand with straight up lies and obfuscation. - all the while in the employ of the arms manufacturers - you know, proud members of the military industrial complex.</p>

<p>How do you create a market for a tool that isn&#39;t going to be used 95% of the time and just sits in a drawer?   Hunting (which I support unless some it involves running game with a dog-pack and GPS collars) is a different story.  Then again, I&#39;m not hunting game with a .44 mag or an AR-15 with a suppressor and a 100 round mag.</p>

<p>As far as my liberal friends go... they are liberals, and they are my friends.  There is no pose here.  Just expressing myself.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the 2nd amendment as a right to hunt wild game.  That is pure nonsense from my point of view.  I hunt, rarely, and with a bow when I do.  The 2nd amendment to me is a declaration of independence from any power foreign or domestic that would deprive me of liberty and/or freedom.</p>

<p>This guy probably has a giant american flag on his ford f150 with a sign under it saying &quot;if you&#39;re offended by this, fuck you&quot;.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a paranoid fighting a battle against enemies who don&#39;t exist. Of course, because we tell him he&#39;s a nutjob and that he just might be wrong, we&#39;ll be downvoted and called shills, or sockpuppets, or whatever the term of the day is for people who disagree with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fail to see how OP said free education was a good thing. He points out that the &quot;Crazy New World Order&quot; has promises that they try to sell the public. Mainly, the promises will be the removal of basic rights and privacy first and foremost. Free education? L-O-L
They claim free education. Will they provide it? No. If they do, it will be the education to place people on their side. 
Free health care? Ha!
An obvious system to inflate currency and secretly create economic crisis. </p>

<p>And worst of all you claim to know the system is corrupt but, you stopped there. You found out that things are fucked up and stopped there. You stopped your own education. Why? For what? So you can go into this subreddit and embarrass yourself? 
How about you make claims we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about, IN OUR OWN SUBREDDIT, find out what the corruption in the system wants. </p>

<p>And if you want a legitimate conversation, take your own advice:
How about you try not insulting the people you&#39;re talking to. </p>

<p>Show me a single instance of the American government promising free health care.  Show me where our government promises free education.  Or are you bloviating about the United Nations and their mighty unchecked power?  Show me where the UN promises free education to Americans, or free health care to Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does the UN have to say it when the US administration says it? Did you sleep through obamacare? That&#39;s the beginning of &quot;free healthcare&quot;. Free education: public school system. 
I guess you&#39;re right. They aren&#39;t promising it any more because its already here. 
It&#39;s quite obvious you don&#39;t belong here because communities should not fight amongst themselves. If you wish to continue acting this way I suggest you take it to <a href="/r/ienjoybeinganass">/r/ienjoybeinganass</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t beliong here because I don&#39;t agree with your fantasies?  Do you understand just how ridiculous that makes you sound?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a little reality for your oxygen-starved brain:</p>

<p>free education = public school.</p>

<p>Public school in america has been a reality since <strong>DAY ONE</strong>  First public school in America was opened in 1635, and not only that still exists!  Watch out for that New World Order, when you&#39;re dodging Algonquin insurgents on your way to His Majesty&#39;s socialist indoctrination center in the Colonies.</p>

<p>Obamacare!?  Ain&#39;t nothing free about Obamacare, son, it was compromised by corporate interests from HMOs to unions to Big Pharma during the entire process.  Real reform in the form of single payer?  That was taken off the table immediately and media blacked it out, Congress refused to discuss it, and Obama would no longer mention it due to political weakness.  There&#39;s no case for Obamacare, which makes people BUY insurance leading to free healthcare.  It&#39;s another loosely constructed talking point fed into the conspiracy network (which is now entirely compromised by corporate and government activities.)</p>

<p>As far as the idea that communities shouldn&#39;t fight amongst themselves, I beg to differ.  Every community is driven by the honesty with which it is willing to address the voices that compose it.  My voice is here to specifically be a counter to all the lazy-brained, unsupported, baloney salad sandwiches which everyone seems to be scarfing down with glee and calling it information.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a fly in the buttermilk, a wrench in the gears, i&#39;m the cog that doesn&#39;t fit, i&#39;m that song you hear in the frakkin ship!  And I&#39;m not here to be lovey dovey with operatives or intellectual opportunists who prey on the newly-illuminated like Scientologists at a plane crash site.  I&#39;ve been following these affairs since the mid-Eighties, sir, and I&#39;m seeing a rigidity of opinion derail good information practices.  I oppose it.</p>

<p>A legitimate conversation can&#39;t take place when the entire premise is rigged.  Fake nostalgia</p>

<blockquote>
<p>invigorating our youth with any allegiance to history</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An ambiguous statement written by some thirtysomething meant to evoke trumped up emotions of the Illuminated Outsider. The Never Ending Story?  It&#39;s a fucking joke of a sentiment, sir or madam, and I dismiss it as such.</p>

<p>In fact, this entire post is psy-ops designed to shift the allegiances of the conspiracy movement away from supporting their traditional allies, the environmentalists.  As is the Agenda 21 anti-movement.  It&#39;s anti-movement because it derives entirely from corporate disinformation tactics as opposed to real movements that involve people&#39;s actual personal opinions and grass roots actions.</p>

<p>I speak against it.  Strongly.  And I will continue to call out this propaganda when I see it.</p>

<p>Fine, be an opponent. Be and ass. Be some one who thinks that just because you don&#39;t see the blatant evidence, you don&#39;t believe the &quot;fantasy&quot;.</p>

<p>Did I claim obamacare was free? No, I said it was the beginning of &quot;free healthcare&quot;, a system to create inflation and economic stress.
The public school system is an example of free education. Now, the idea of such would be fine if the history books weren&#39;t obviously censored and skewed, full of propaganda. </p>

<p>One last thing, if you want to help people by pointing out propaganda and lead them to truth; calling them and idiot and being rude, as well as, brash is not the way to do it. You can oppose a view point without belittling people. </p>

<p>Thank you for having an opposing view point. 
Thank you for your time. Have a nice day. </p>
