       what happened to america's morality. A majority of americans support drone bombings, torture, etc. I remember hearing that george washington said any soldier who tortured should be executed, why has our society degraded so much that people especially americans, just don't care. Example, the media showed people protesting the vietnam, when the iraq war happened you barely saw people protesting. Heck right now you don't see any americans protesting the afghanistan war, america's longest war. I remember people like bill ayers actually bombed federal buildings to stop the vietnam war, what happened to that. i mean when abu ghraib happened people were making excuses for the soldiers, and there was barely any outrage.

       Uhm, if so, I'd say
       <em>
        good riddance
       </em>
       . I have experienced a wide range of these christian values, and I studied their manifestations when in university. I can't talk for anyone else, but I'd regard these "values" as a manifestation of a deepseated tribal instinct in established cultures. Most religions, especially old and conservative religious bodies, are about cultural hegemony and consolidation, if not de facto manifestations of fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect cultural identity (as long as it isn't coercive), and I am a big fan of hobbies and folklore, but (especially) what Catholicism and the Evangelical movement espouses is riddled with Dominionism. It's a world view riddled with imperialist victors, and with racism, and with contempt for what is alleged to be "barbarians" and non-conformists. These religious systems are inflexible and persecutory.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If you aren't with them, you are against them
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We have seen where that ends. Progress and affluence is served with empowered, educated and most of all free people. If you want none of that, I suggest you find someinspration in Afghanistan, where fundamentalism, stupidity, superstition, desperation and backwardness reign supreme.

       You appear to be conflating the church and religion with actual Christian moral values (eg: do unto others, love thy enemy, judge not etc.).

       I see no functional difference between the church and what is alleged (or supposed) to be its values. I judge it by its actions, and so would you, if it were pertaining to some remote, outlandish belief system in some far away country.

       The church does not represent true Christian moral values.

       Once you understand the folly of your dependance upon collectivism to rationalise your ideology, you may arrive at a similar conclusion.

       America didn't loose it's morality.  It never had it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's happening is that the morality it never had in the first place - starting with the lack of morality upon which this country was initially founded and upon which it continued to perpetuate itself - is just now finally beginning to become blatantly apparent to more and more people.

       You should be scared. It's going to take a groundswell of revulsion against our present corrupt ways and a return to a more traditional set of moral values, before things get better. That can't happen until people see the cause of the problem -- we are all being deliberately corrupted by the media.

       large corporations took over america generations ago.  since that time moral values have been consciously, scientifically and analytically deconstructed using social engineering and have been  replaced with fake ones such as consumerism, war culture, mass distraction and a tainted legal system.
this artificial environment retards the expression of any human, natural values on a large enough scale.
iow most people became weak, fearful and are a hostage of the corporate system on many levels of their existence.

       Actually, Deism was the central philosophy of many founding fathers and played a significant role in the Constitution (such as establishing religious freedom and the lack of a state-sanctioned religion).  One does not need religion in order to have morals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity, like most religions, has both its merits and its detriments.  A theocratic society heavily based on Christianity in its current interpretation would destroy whatever is left of the U.S. (and that's not hyperbole).
      </p>
      <p>
       Christians for the most part have not acted Christ-like for hundreds of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       America was not solely nourished on Christianity, but rather from ideas and religions that came from across the world.  America is not, and has never been "a Christian nation."

       America has always been a Christian nation, and is still a Christian nation, although the war against Christianity has weakened the Christian nature of America over the past several decades to a serious degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Founding Fathers were overwhelmingly good and faithful Christians. They never expected that the United States would be anything other than a Christian nation, and never wanted it to be anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity is not perfect, but then, nothing is perfect. It is, however, the best moral foundation a society can possess.

       Wrong on almost every account. The founders intended the US to be a secular nation as evidenced by The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution:
      </p>
      <p>
       DoI:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights..."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No mention of the Christian god in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitution
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. (1st Amendment)
       </p>
       <p>
        The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. (Article 6)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Looks pretty secular.  A large part of the reason that the colonists escaped Europe was to avoid religious persecution.  While many of the founders were Christian, they did not codify it into law.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the merits of Christianity, I support your right to believe in it as you see fit.
      </p>

       You are correct on both points. It is so true and sooo politically incorrect. Too bad we are too far down the progressive slippery slope. It all over but the crying now.

       I'd like to go off sideways and bring up the topic of 'shame'.
When I was young (in the 60's) people seemed to think that shame was really a bad thing and that we needed to get rid of or get past it.  At the time,I thought that we could probably do with less shame.  Shame seemed to make people feel too badly about themselves.....  Time passed and shame seemed to become passe.
These days I see the awful things governments, as well as individuals, do  and it is amazing to me that there is a complete lack of shame. People are completely shameless, do shameless things and others just accept the shamelessness. I can't understand this.  Bradley Manning, for example.  Why aren't Americans outraged? Horrified and ashamed of their government? My answer? Gutless, TV-fed, preferring to remain unconscious. I have come to believe a bit of shame is a good thing.

       I'd like to think there was still a ray of hope somewhere behind the gray clouds, waiting to burst forth and show the way. Despair is not a useful response to problems.

       Notice the only argument which has been brought forth to counter your claims (aside from ad hominem) is in regards to the "founding fathers".

       Brainwashing like:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the moral code of the nation is the moral code of Jesus Christ
       </p>
       <p>
        This happens to be the best moral code this world has ever managed to come up with, and it is one of the reasons America flourished for two centuries and became wealthy and powerful.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Christian value system is so good, America was nourished by it.

       <p>
        They want to destroy Christianity and they want to obliterate white Christians as a race.

       Nobody here is defending the founding fathers. In fact, you were the first to mention them.

       To suggest that Christian morals did not shape the moral compass of the United States for centuries is naive.  Even or laws are based upon these values.

       Our laws were actually initially based on English Law and were highly influenced by Ancient Greek and Roman concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Christian morals, I've seen them shaped and interpreted scores of times in order to fit certain agendas that Christ would surely condemn.
