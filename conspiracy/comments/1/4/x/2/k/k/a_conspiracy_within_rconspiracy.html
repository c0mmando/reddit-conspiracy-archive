       Yes, I believe reddit has been targeted by government shills. I'm setting up a private forum for people worried about our disappearing freedoms. If anyone wants a place to discuss the state of the country more openly and share important information send me a private message for membership.

       Its pretty obvious at this point...... the best way to "pick them out" is to take a look at how they structure their " rebuttal". If you make 5 points, they pick out one, the weakest one and that is the ONLY thing they concentrate on. You could make a billion points in whatever you're trying to prove and it will all fly over their head, they refuse to adress you pointing out there mistakes and have no bearing on your actually topic just what they can prove you made a mistake on, even if it is as little as an un capitalized letter.

       Just for the record, in verbal conversation that is a very common and strong debate strategy.  It may not seem to translate well to the internet, but that does not make it illegitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't expect a discussion with a skeptic where they "aren't allowed" to just blow off how laughably stupid one or two of your tenants are.  Why don't you just stop believing patently stupid things?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the first step in the process, in an honest debate you are supposed to take this time to concede to your opponent that they are correct, and now that becomes an axiom for furthering the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       However,
       <em>
        most people on the internet will never admit they are wrong for any reason ever
       </em>
       . If I indicate extremely weak beliefs in someones theory, debunk them, and am not received or rebutted on those points, you have established the discussion is not going to progress properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR classical discussion =/= shill

       Nothing. You guys keep predicting the martial law we have planned, and then we have to delay it a little, so it doesn't look like you predicted it, but then you predict it again, so we have to delay it again, and so on. America is kept safe only by the neckbeards of

       We were going to destroy the entire world on December 21st, 2012, using a Death Star that President Obama ordered. Now we gotta wait until at least 2014. Is there an Olympics that year? Maybe we can combine the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll note here that, contrary to popular (with you guys) belief, the American President actually
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       in charge of everything. We do what he wants. That's why our nefarious plans keep changing all the time. Clinton wanted America to turn Communist, but then Bush wanted it to turn Fascist, and now Obama wants it to be Socialist... this shit gets confusing but it keeps us on our toes.

       Not to insult your intelligence, but you pretty much just screwed up your 2014 chances.

      <p>
       To what degree are the elections themselves under your control?  Do you at least try to pick the candidate which moves to your rhythm?  It would explain the incumbency phenomena; I feel like its more of a "mad with power" predicament anyways.

       We control everything about elections, except the votes. Whoever wins really is the most popular candidate. All of them are made aware that the NWO is a real thing before they're ever allowed on TV.

       Believe it or not, must of us at Bilderberg/NWO Headquarters were rooting for Ron Paul. He had the most nefarious (and kinda pervy) ideas for us to try out, and the population would've suspected him the least.

       Anyway, keep an eye on the 2014 Olympics opening ceremony. The symbolism we told the Illuminati to include will give away part of the plot for Star Wars Episode VII.

       It won't be a super important plot point. Just the part where DNA testing proves that Darth Vader was wrong about being Luke's father. Just kidding. I won't tell you what we reveal. If any of the top-level codebreakers who for some reason post blurry videos on YouTube instead of getting high-paying jobs for their considerable skills do figure out what's revealed in the Olympic opening ceremony, let's just say the PlayStation 4 is about to get a whole lot sweeter.

       I am beginning to doubt the veracity of your claims! How do you explain Bush winning his first election if the most popular president gets the white house?

       The 2000 election was a debacle we did not anticipate. We were happy to see Bush win, though, because he's a lot more entertaining than Gore, even though Gore's plan for post-9/11 was way crazier than Bush's. He wanted to blame Canada, and slice the CN Tower in half with a giant sword President Carter had made, that's been hidden in our giant warehouse since the 70s.

       As for the PlayStation 4, I'm a bit old for video games (and I enjoy sex too much to have them dweebing up my living room), so it's hard for me to say. The younger guys here are all excited about the possibilities, though.

       Question! Would you exile or kill your children if you know they wouldn't conform to your NWO, and believed in equality over a financial monarchy? Do we have any hope that once the boomers and generation X die off or the power is transferred to generation Y/Z, that things will be better?
Maybe the collapse/SHTF is coming before that?

       Everyone conforms to the NWO. Generation Y/Z was raised to love it via Project Turn Hulk Hogan Evil. Basically what we did was, we turned Hulk Hogan evil, and called his new bad-guy team the... wait for it... NWO. But we also gave him a dirty-looking beard, so that deep down inside, all the dirty-bearded dudes of

       (whose existence we anticipated in the early 1990s, when I personally oversaw PTHHE) would feel a deep-down kinship with the Hulkster - and us - so they'd never actually kill us if they found the secret,

       We did think of everything - except for one thing. The groundbreaking, visionary research of uneducated amateur YouTube filmmakers keeps defeating the lifelong professional scientists whose experiments we secretly tamper with to keep 9/11 under wraps. All these random gas station employees and art history dropouts keep knowing more about physics and structural engineering than any Ph.D I've had to replace with an NWO doppelganger. It gets frustrating at times.
