If you make 5 points, they pick out one, the weakest one and that is the ONLY thing they concentrate on. You could make a billion points in whatever you&#39;re trying to prove and it will all fly over their head, they refuse to adress you pointing out there mistakes and have no bearing on your actually topic just what they can prove you made a mistake on, even if it is as little as an un capitalized letter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for the record, in verbal conversation that is a very common and strong debate strategy.  It may not seem to translate well to the internet, but that does not make it illegitimate.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t expect a discussion with a skeptic where they &quot;aren&#39;t allowed&quot; to just blow off how laughably stupid one or two of your tenants are.  Why don&#39;t you just stop believing patently stupid things?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the first step in the process, in an honest debate you are supposed to take this time to concede to your opponent that they are correct, and now that becomes an axiom for furthering the discussion.</p>

<p>However, <em>most people on the internet will never admit they are wrong for any reason ever</em>. If I indicate extremely weak beliefs in someones theory, debunk them, and am not received or rebutted on those points, you have established the discussion is not going to progress properly.</p>

<p>TL;DR classical discussion =/= shill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 2000 election was a debacle we did not anticipate. We were happy to see Bush win, though, because he&#39;s a lot more entertaining than Gore, even though Gore&#39;s plan for post-9/11 was way crazier than Bush&#39;s. He wanted to blame Canada, and slice the CN Tower in half with a giant sword President Carter had made, that&#39;s been hidden in our giant warehouse since the 70s.</p>

<p>As for the PlayStation 4, I&#39;m a bit old for video games (and I enjoy sex too much to have them dweebing up my living room), so it&#39;s hard for me to say. The younger guys here are all excited about the possibilities, though.</p>
