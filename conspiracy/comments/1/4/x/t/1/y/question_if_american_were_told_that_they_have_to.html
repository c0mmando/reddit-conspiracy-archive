    <div class="md"><p>So you have decided the second largest and second most culturally diverse state is boring, but don&#39;t really have any reason for hating Texas (except of course, how BRAVE it makes you look).</p>

<p>As for secession, we would love too.  However, Texas is one of the few states that would most certainly NOT be allowed to secede, because it quite literally is successful as its own country, as well as a tax donor state (Secession would immediately make Texas richer and the US poorer).  </p>

<p>Beyond that, Texas holds some critical cards: NASA, Oil trading hub, most successful medical industry in the US, just to scratch the surface.</p>

<p>That said, It is fine for you to not like Texas, or Texans, but you best recognize it would be negatively impactful for you if secession actually became a possibility.</p>

<p>Also, it would be nice if you could rationally decide why you hate Texas, chances are it boils down to be about as irrational as hating Iraq because 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you&#39;re butthurt. I have been to Texas and I just don&#39;t care for it. From the inbred rednecks to the pseudo-happening &quot;cities&quot;, they can all go to hell.</p>

<p>Those are all fine reasons to be proud you are from there, but that doesn&#39;t matter to me at all. Doesn&#39;t that just tan your hide?
That&#39;s not &quot;brave&quot; it&#39;s honest. Or, actually, it&#39;s my opinion.</p>

<p>Now tuck your bottom lip in and shut the fuck up, pussy. You act like this is the first time someone on the internet offended you with their opinion. I remember <em>my</em> first time on the internet. Of course, I was well aware that there are different opinions. On the internet....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Butthurt? You may be projecting a little bit here.  Reread my post and fail to seem where I come off as less than informative (other than parentheticals about how BRAVE it is to hate on Texas).  </p>

<p>Inbred rednecks? Where do you get this information?  Psuedo-happening cities?  What makes a city &quot;happening?&quot;  Texas is home to three of the top ten largest cities in the country.</p>

<p>When did I say I was proud to be Texan/from Texas?  I live here, but I wasn&#39;t born here; furthermore I find pride to be a detestable, dangerous trait.</p>

<p>Oh, and I am the butthurt one. XD  </p>

<p>My main contention is that you do not have a personal opinion, you have other people&#39;s opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no. You are the one with the issue. I just can&#39;t stand Texas. I have other people&#39;s opinions? How is that? I even said I have actually <em>been</em> to Texas. Stayed a while too.</p>

<p>What makes a &quot;happening&quot; city? Nothing in Texas, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>Where do I get inbred rednecks? Gee, I don&#39;t know where anyone would get that, would you? Except for the fact that Texas executes more inmates (and mentally retarded ones too. It&#39;s ok, I rip on Georgia for that too) than any other state, besides perhaps Florida. Which is full of rednecks too, the northern part anyway. South Florida is pretty badass, actually.</p>

<p>There. Is that a good enough opinion for you, ya butthurt pussy?</p>

<p>Now quit being a pussy about it. It&#39;s just the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I understand all the anti gun control  liberty stuff, I pretty much agree, but, realize gun control is a big deal mostly because its a wedge issue. </p>

<p>It&#39;s something for people to fight about that politicians can take sides on. It&#39;s the same as abortion or gay marriage. </p>

<p>These are things that only actually matter in a real way to a tiny portion of people. Yet... they can decide elections... People feel so strongly about it that they&#39;ll flip over the Risk board over it. </p>

<p>Yeah I know it&#39;s some sort of fundamental philosophy, whatever, it&#39;s dumb... It&#39;s about 1/10 as important as people act like it is. You certainly shouldn&#39;t be choosing who to vote on based on that, that&#39;s playing into their hands.</p>
