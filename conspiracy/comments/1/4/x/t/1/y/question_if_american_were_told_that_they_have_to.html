       While the definition of 'win' is subjective, we can safely assume that the government has some pretty evil technology at their disposal.  There is little doubt in my head that if things were to come to blows, the elite would hide underground and unleash military hell on the civilian population.  A few AR's and your survival knife only go so far against drones with thermal/x-ray imaging.

       So you have decided the second largest and second most culturally diverse state is boring, but don't really have any reason for hating Texas (except of course, how BRAVE it makes you look).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for secession, we would love too.  However, Texas is one of the few states that would most certainly NOT be allowed to secede, because it quite literally is successful as its own country, as well as a tax donor state (Secession would immediately make Texas richer and the US poorer).
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, Texas holds some critical cards: NASA, Oil trading hub, most successful medical industry in the US, just to scratch the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, It is fine for you to not like Texas, or Texans, but you best recognize it would be negatively impactful for you if secession actually became a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it would be nice if you could rationally decide why you hate Texas, chances are it boils down to be about as irrational as hating Iraq because 9/11.

       Ok, you're butthurt. I have been to Texas and I just don't care for it. From the inbred rednecks to the pseudo-happening "cities", they can all go to hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are all fine reasons to be proud you are from there, but that doesn't matter to me at all. Doesn't that just tan your hide?
That's not "brave" it's honest. Or, actually, it's my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now tuck your bottom lip in and shut the fuck up, pussy. You act like this is the first time someone on the internet offended you with their opinion. I remember
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       first time on the internet. Of course, I was well aware that there are different opinions. On the internet....

       Butthurt? You may be projecting a little bit here.  Reread my post and fail to seem where I come off as less than informative (other than parentheticals about how BRAVE it is to hate on Texas).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inbred rednecks? Where do you get this information?  Psuedo-happening cities?  What makes a city "happening?"  Texas is home to three of the top ten largest cities in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       When did I say I was proud to be Texan/from Texas?  I live here, but I wasn't born here; furthermore I find pride to be a detestable, dangerous trait.

       My main contention is that you do not have a personal opinion, you have other people's opinions.

       Where do I get inbred rednecks? Gee, I don't know where anyone would get that, would you? Except for the fact that Texas executes more inmates (and mentally retarded ones too. It's ok, I rip on Georgia for that too) than any other state, besides perhaps Florida. Which is full of rednecks too, the northern part anyway. South Florida is pretty badass, actually.

       Not really. I just think you're a pussy and don't want anyone to mess with Texas. I like on you getingt upset at the notion that there is someone different than you that has a different opinion on your homeland. And if it isn't where you live or are from, WTF do you even care?

       And the reason for calling you names is because you are in fact being a pussy about it. You are getting mad because a random person said they didn't care for Texas. And here you are, not emotional at all over the fact I hate Texas.

The Civil war would probably be inevitable though I am optimistic. 2012 is turning out to be a game changer, regardless of any theories and prophecies.

       Yeah I know it's some sort of fundamental philosophy, whatever, it's dumb... It's about 1/10 as important as people act like it is. You certainly shouldn't be choosing who to vote on based on that, that's playing into their hands.
