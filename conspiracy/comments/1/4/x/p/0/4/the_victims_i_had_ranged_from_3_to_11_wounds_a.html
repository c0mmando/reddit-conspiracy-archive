        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>During a press conference (watch the video <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/2038036117001/autopsies-completed-on-children-killed-in-sandy-hook-tragedy/?intcmp=trending">here</a>), the CT State Medical Examiner said that the only weapon used, as far as he knows, was &quot;the long gun&quot; (and then clarifies &quot;the rifle&quot;). This exchange starts at around 4:35 in the video. </p>

<p>He then goes on to state, and this is verbatim: &quot;I only did seven of the autopsies. The victims I had ranged from 3 to 11 wounds a piece, and I only saw two of them with close-range shooting&quot; (around the 5:20 mark)</p>

<p>From an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/connecticut-shooter-adam-lanza-mothers-guns/story?id=17984499#.UM19SIVPObI">ABC article</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle at close range to kill children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on Friday.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe everybody was hit more than once,&quot; said Dr. H. Wayne Carver, the state of Connecticut&#39;s Chief Medical Examiner. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The medical examiner said he saw <strong>two</strong> victims with close-range wounds. Two. Like: 2. </p>

<p>So of the seven victims he examined, only TWO had &quot;close-range&quot; wounds, and yet all of the wounds were from a .233 Bushmaster? What does that mean? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fair question. But don&#39;t you also think, regardless, that ABC took his comments completely out of context (the article I link too is specifically citing him). </p>

<p>In the interview he says that he has been working as a pathologist for 30-some years, and knows a good deal about weapons. I guess the question really is, would shooting someone 10 feet away with an AR-15 be considered &quot;close range&quot; or not? I don&#39;t know the answer. But if a Bushmaster has an effective range of 400 meters or so (according to wikipedia), 10 feet seems pretty &quot;close&quot; to me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“He forced his way into the school,” Vance said. He did not provide specifics and said that <strong>broken windows at the school</strong> may have been shattered by police who responded to the emergency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best part of that sentence, of course, is &quot;may have&quot;. The police &quot;may have&quot; broken some windows? So they&#39;re not sure who broke the windows? Hm. What does <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/15/15926718-newtown-gunman-forced-his-way-into-school-police-say?lite">ABC say?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dressed in black combat gear, he broke a window at the school, which had recently had a new security system installed</p>

<p>So there were shattered windows. But the media is having a hard time deciding why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They certainly could be. We don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>But why bring up the broken windows in the first place? It must have been in response to a question by a reporter. As in:</p>

<p>Reporter: How did the shooter gain entry?
Police: We can&#39;t elaborate, but he forced his way in
Reporter: I see a lot of broken windows. Did he hop through a window?
Police: broken windows <strong>may</strong> have been shattered by us</p>

<p>Note, too, that the ABC report explicitly says that the shooter used a window to gain entry........could the shooter also &quot;shoot&quot; through a window? It&#39;s speculation, for sure, but it doesn&#39;t seem like a huge stretch. Especially if you take the medical examiner&#39;s comments into account. Here&#39;s another interesting bit, from the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/12/15/connecticut-school-shooting.html">CBC:</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early reports suggested that well-liked principal Dawn Hochsprung — who is among the dead — <strong>had buzzed in the shooter because she recognized him as being the son of one of the school&#39;s substitute teachers.</strong></p>

<p>Police confirmed that was not the case on Saturday.</p>

<p>&quot;He was not voluntarily let into the school,&quot; Vance said. &quot;He forced his way in.&quot;</p>

<p>Newtown education officials said they had found <strong>no link between Lanza&#39;s mother and the school, contrary to initial news reports that said she was a substitute teacher there.</strong> Investigators said they believe Adam Lanza attended Sandy Hook Elementary many years ago, but they had no explanation for why he went there on Friday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lanza had no meaningful ties to the school, so obviously the &quot;voluntarily letting him in&quot; story wasn&#39;t going to float for long. </p>

<p>Again, yes: speculation. But I feel like the official story is inconsistent and in some respects not particularly compelling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think what you want to consider here, is that why would the State Police spokesman know for sure whether Lanza had broken the windows or a local police officer had? you&#39;re implying that there would normally be perfect knowledge of this. if you want to speculate, speculate as to how this spokesman could possibly have taken all the detective&#39;s notes on the crime scene to give you a complete picture of shooter and police&#39;s movements from only 24 hours before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely. However, the fact remains: there are broken windows. Multiple ones, at that. </p>

<p>ABC says that at least one of the windows was broken by Lanza. </p>

<p>NBC says that the police can&#39;t elaborate on how the windows (plural) were broken, but says that they may have been shattered by police. </p>

<p>There is obviously some confusion as to how the windows were broken. </p>

<p>The only reason I even brought up the windows was because, as an earlier commenter pointed out, there would have to be broken windows in order for the &quot;only two victims had close-range wounds&quot; comment (from the medical examiner) to have any real substance or deeper meaning (aside from the media sensationalizing the story by claiming all the kids were shot at close range). </p>

<p>If you watch the video of the press conference (and I urge you to do so), the examiner seems hesitant to elaborate on the subject -- and when a reporter says &quot;how could that be? the rifle was found in the car?&quot; the state police mutter something and then move on to the next question. That exchange starts around 5:20 in the video.  </p>

<p>All this being said, I readily admit: this is speculation. But not entirely without cause. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>understood, i&#39;m just trying to sort it out with you</p>

<p>anyway, he said 2 of the 7 he examined had close-range wounds, and disclaims that in that he has not yet reviewed in detail the reports of the bodies he did not personally examine -- even referring to his observations as &quot;just a sample&quot;. </p>

<p>i think the examiner&#39;s hesitation to argue the location of physical evidence is understandable, at the beginning of the briefing, he gives you his timeline, his department has been doing postmortems on more than 20 victims all morning. it is unlikely that he has any first-hand knowledge about what evidence was gathered in the parking lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree completely. </p>

<p>That being said, I think it&#39;s <strong>more than fair</strong> to say that the media narrative right now is &quot;All the children were shot at close range!&quot; Here is one glaring example, (again) <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/12/15/connecticut-school-shooting.html">from the CBC:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>All the victims</strong> of the Connecticut elementary school shooting were shot several times at <strong>close range</strong> from a rifle, said the state&#39;s chief medical examiner. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? That is 100% complete bullshit. There is no way that you can listen to what the medical examiner said and then write that, without being completely dishonest. But again, this is the prevailing narrative, if you check other sources. The problem is: it&#39;s just not true. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s overwhelming evidence for a sniper or what have you -- but why push the &quot;close range!!&quot; story so hard when it&#39;s very clearly inaccurate, at least from what reliable information we have? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the first ABC link has: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All the wounds that I know of at this point were caused by the long weapon,&quot; Carver said, and many were shot at close range. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could have been better worded, but I grant that it is not really inaccurate. </p>

<p>The second ABC article you link to is the one I originally linked to. It says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle <strong>at close range</strong> to kill children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on Friday. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, that is not what the medical examiner said. Not at all. There&#39;s no way that statement can be construed as accurate, given the information provided by the examiner. </p>

<p>The CTV and NBC article are clear that only &quot;some&quot; of the victims were shot at close range. I also found a few other articles that acknowledge that. But there are just as many that claim (or imply) that *<em>all</em> of them victims shared this fate. Examples: </p>

<p>An ABC (them again!) article, <a href="http://gma.yahoo.com/school-shooter-killed-close-range-060155509--abc-news-topstories.html">&quot;School Shooter Killed At Close-Range,&quot;</a> begins: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Connecticut school shooter Adam Lanza used a semi-automatic rifle to shoot Sandy Hook students and staff at close-range and may have also used three others guns, which were found at the scene and nearby during the massacre, sources told ABC News. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s interesting about this article is that it was written (I believe from the timestamp) before the press conference with the medical examiner. So who were their sources? </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mother_made_kid_slay_madman_ojfQG64P9S35iQz9x3BmTJ">NY Post (granted they&#39;re crap)</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The victims of the slaughter were killed at close range by rifle shots, according to the state’s chief medical examiner. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I can tell, all the initial reports said that the victims were shot at &quot;close range&quot; or &quot;execution style&quot;. Only after the medical examiner spoke did some networks backtrack on that. Some still didn&#39;t, though. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s a mixed bag, but a bag that was filled with bullshit before anything close to factual came to light. And let&#39;s both be honest: we all know what sticks the best: the shit that is slung first. </p>

<p>Again, that being said, you are correct: there are many networks/news sources who now claim that only &quot;some&quot; of the victims were shot at close range. But this was not the prevailing narrative 24 hours ago. And that&#39;s damaging, to say the least. (Although not necessarily conspiratorial. Just shitty reporting.) </p>

<p>The takeaway here though should be: of the 26 killed, we know of <strong>only two</strong> with &quot;close range&quot; wounds. Okay, that&#39;s &quot;some&quot;, but &quot;some&quot; is a super-vague word, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unfair to say this whole &quot;close range&quot; stuff has been incredibly sensationalized, given what we know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he didn&#39;t, they found it next to his body. when media reports said it was found in the car, they simply had no way of knowing that. you are left with assuming that they got that from a law enforcement officer, certainly no parents opr students were searching the shooter&#39;s car.</p>

<p>if they are getting it from police, consider that they are likely getting it by overhearing police, as opposed to having some mole on the inside.</p>

<p>then consider, that the media reported every unconfirmed thing came across, and got it all wrong. people are cherrypicking entirely inaccurate media reports, and effectively deciding that while almost everything they said in the first 12 hours was verifiably wrong, anything that conflicts with the state police statement is somehow evidence of a coverup.</p>

<p>over 200 rounds? how did he stop and reload? especially if they found the rifle in the car...? I am having trouble with this.</p>

<p>Even if he had large mags for his pistols, 200 rounds is insane without reloading. 60 - 100 rounds per mag on the AR, 9 - 14 for the pistols. So he had to reload. While shooting toddlers.</p>

<p>However, I believe the number is difficult to really put together, as the medical examiner stated that he only saw seven of the victims.  Who examined the other 19?  I am not sure and I think it should be brought into light who exactly is.</p>

<p>EDIT: As well as the shootings, the official claim is that he shot his way into the school, bypassing the security doors.  That&#39;s more ammo used.  I think this number of ammunition really needs to be investigated further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They certainly could be. We don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>But why bring up the broken windows in the first place? It must have been in response to a question by a reporter. As in:</p>

<p>Reporter: How did the shooter gain entry?
Police: We can&#39;t elaborate, but he forced his way in
Reporter: I see a lot of broken windows. Did he hop through a window?
Police: broken windows <strong>may</strong> have been shattered by us</p>

<p>Note, too, that the ABC report explicitly says that the shooter used a window to gain entry........could the shooter also &quot;shoot&quot; through a window? It&#39;s speculation, for sure, but it doesn&#39;t seem like a huge stretch. Especially if you take the medical examiner&#39;s comments into account. Here&#39;s another interesting bit, from the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/12/15/connecticut-school-shooting.html">CBC:</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early reports suggested that well-liked principal Dawn Hochsprung — who is among the dead — <strong>had buzzed in the shooter because she recognized him as being the son of one of the school&#39;s substitute teachers.</strong></p>

<p>Police confirmed that was not the case on Saturday.</p>

<p>&quot;He was not voluntarily let into the school,&quot; Vance said. &quot;He forced his way in.&quot;</p>

<p>Newtown education officials said they had found <strong>no link between Lanza&#39;s mother and the school, contrary to initial news reports that said she was a substitute teacher there.</strong> Investigators said they believe Adam Lanza attended Sandy Hook Elementary many years ago, but they had no explanation for why he went there on Friday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lanza had no meaningful ties to the school, so obviously the &quot;voluntarily letting him in&quot; story wasn&#39;t going to float for long. </p>

<p>Again, yes: speculation. But I feel like the official story is inconsistent and in some respects not particularly compelling. </p>

<p>here&#39;s all the GE bigwigs <a href="http://www.ge.com/company/leadership/executives.html">http://www.ge.com/company/leadership/executives.html</a></p>

<p>note that there are several ge capital officers listed, but not him.</p>

<p>here&#39;s the GE Capital leadership</p>

<p>note that he&#39;s not on it - note that nobody from his division (Energy) is on it. If he was the head of the energy division of GE Capital, he wouldn&#39;t even be one of their top 20 executives, and with a title like Tax Director he&#39;s not even the head of that division.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In large brokerage firms and investment banks, there are usually several Vice Presidents in each local branch office, the title being more of a marketing approach for customers, than denoting an actual managerial position within the company.</p>
