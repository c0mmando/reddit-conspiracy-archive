       i sure would like to know who's ass you pulled 31,595,000 people from. I was taught in school roughly 11 million people (non military) died. 6 million jews, 5ish million gays/gypsies/etc. and if you take into account only 4.5 million jews even existed in any part of nazi control and we know a lot escaped, i would say your completely full of shit. OH and one more thing....where is the US' kill count?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Rudolph Joseph Rummel is professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii. He has spent his career assembling data on collective violence and war with a view toward helping their resolution or elimination. Rummel coined the term democide for murder by government (compare genocide), his research claiming that six times as many people died of democide during the 20th century than in all that century's wars combined. He concludes that democracy is the form of government least likely to kill its citizens and that democracies do not wage war against each other (see Democratic peace theory).

        FAQ

       on his website.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example Q/A:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Q: What about people dying because of government neglect? Isn’t this democide?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         A:
        </strong>
        I do not restrict democide to just directly killing people, as by shooting them. I use the civil definition of murder, where someone can be guilty of murder if they are responsible in a reckless and wanton way for the loss of life, as in incarcerating people in camps where the may soon die of malnutrition, unattended disease, and forced labor, or deporting them into wastelands where they may die rapidly from exposure and disease.

       I think you're confused here son. There are two different type of "Jewish" people out there. A lot of fake ones at the top who are your typical politicians pretending to be Jewish like Natenyahu who practice satanism just like the ones in the US. The only question is why are you defending these people and supporting racists?

       First off, I'm absolutely APPALLED at what you just said. You just called a bunch of Jewish people "fake Jews" because you disagree with their political actions. They are not "pretending" to be Jewish and what the fuck does them practicing satanism (There's NO evidence of this, what the FUCK? Really?) have to do anything? Where are you getting your news from, Alex Jones or Adolf Hitler? (Their views are pretty much the same though, white supremacists)
      </p>
      <p>
       I defend Jews because I hate racism and the people who I'm defending are legitimately Jewish. Meanwhile you're using a select group of Jewish people to justify fascism and white nationalism. Go back to the ramzpaul comments page you racist.

       Lol what? So apparently if someone makes a 'certain' handshake and they're Jewish, THEY'RE EVIL SECRET MASONIC SATANISTS WHO SACRIFICE CHILDREN. Typical conspiratard logic, sees a funny handshake, jumps to ridiculous baseless conclusions. Also, my great grandfather was a freemason and I'm appalled at you for making up ridiculous bullshit. And also, when is every single jew a freemason, what the fuck? (Just for reference, I derive my argument of "freemasonry" from you mentioning that Jewish people initiating a masonic handshake means they are freemasons and support child sacrifice)

       First off, let me say that you're an idiot. Ron Paul's ideas are legitimately retarded and would destroy this country. He would send us back to the 19th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second off, I did read what you said. You said that some Jews use freemason handshakes and therefore sacrifice babies. You openly said that some Jews practice satanism and you even pissed off fellow members of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . You have SERIOUS mental issues, you deny things that you just said. You need to talk to a therapist or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       About calling my great grandfather a freemason, fuck you for your baseless conspiracies. You have no legitimate facts about what freemasons do and I bet you've never even talked to a real freemason. You just sit there in your grease coated RAWN PAWL shirt every day and hypothesize that freemasons = evil because they are "secretive".
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding your last sentence, you openly mentioned that some Jews are actually secret freemasons because they "practice the handshake" and therefore "sacrifice babies". Oh yeah, are you going to post this to NLW and send in your tinfoil hat-wearing buddies?

       Freemasonry does not distinguish or discriminate between religions. A person of any faith can become a Mason.

        Also, there's no such thing as a Jewish mason. You can't practice Judaism while practicing Masonry since they kick you out for that.

       Freemasonry does not distinguish or discriminate between religions. A person of any faith can become a Mason.

       First off, let me say that you're an idiot. Ron Paul's ideas are legitimately retarded and would destroy this country. He would send us back to the 19th century.

      <p>
       Second off, I did read what you said. You said that some Jews use freemason handshakes and therefore sacrifice babies. You openly said that some Jews practice satanism and you even pissed off fellow members of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . You have SERIOUS mental issues, you deny things that you just said. You need to talk to a therapist or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       About calling my great grandfather a freemason, fuck you for your baseless conspiracies. You have no legitimate facts about what freemasons do and I bet you've never even talked to a real freemason. You just sit there in your grease coated RAWN PAWL shirt every day and hypothesize that freemasons = evil because they are "secretive".
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding your last sentence, you openly mentioned that some Jews are actually secret freemasons because they "practice the handshake" and therefore "sacrifice babies". Oh yeah, are you going to post this to NLW and send in your tinfoil hat-wearing buddies?

       It's been X days since CowzGoesMooz has agreed to post the research about certain Jews being satanic child-killing freemasons.
