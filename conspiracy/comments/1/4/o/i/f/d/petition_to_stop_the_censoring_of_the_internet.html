    <div class="md"><p>Right now there are no set plans from what I gather- we just need to make it known that there are plenty of us that know what is happening. Usually, decisions such as this can be made without public awareness with ease. The internet makes so much information available to us; we need to take part in this decision and not turn a blind eye, leading to a handful of a few to decide for us. They have the power to censor it however they like, we need to raise awareness of the fact we can participate. </p>

<p>I have no idea who currently manages censorship of the internet, or how this petition could possibly influence their decision, but any first step is a step towards progress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. If there is a decision being made without common knowledge, that is when we need to take part. Why let so much happen behind the scenes? What is wrong with standing up for the human-right of free, uncensored information? You honestly see this stance as misguided or ill-informed? That&#39;s kind of crazy. It&#39;s pretty simple- we don&#39;t need our information filtered above our heads. We are not neanderthals that can&#39;t decide fact from fiction ourselves. </p>

<p>If anything, we should at least know what is going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes actually, using avaaz! In my state, there is a piece of land sacred to the Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota people (Pe Sla). The people who owned this land were about to sell it to the highest bidder for commercial use, but the petition raised awareness on the issue. This caused phone calls, emails, all different kinds of communication being exchanged for the sake of this land. The family did end up not going through with the auction and made a deal with a few reservations.</p>

<p>Now on a global scale, petitions are a good tool for spreading information. People will think &quot;Wtf? Censoring the internet??&quot; and then look into it themselves- they might not have known anything was even happening.  It&#39;s better for people to be angry about their freedoms being unjustly taken from them, THEN learn the rest, rather than not being interested at all and letting higher authorities decide for them. Let&#39;s catch an issue before it becomes the law.  </p>

<p>I know that a lot of native american tribes had a &quot;third gender&quot;, but that is not really homosexuality per se. </p>

<p>I know that the aboriginals in australia had a somewhat gender nonspecific hierarchy. </p>

<p>I know that asian culture has long standing taboos against homosexuality.</p>

<p>I know that arabic culture has long standing taboos against homosexuality.</p>

<p>I know that white/christian/jewish/american culture has long standing taboos against homosexuality.</p>

<p>I know that Greece, at one time, accepted a quasi-sexual relationship between male teacher and pupil, but that was not necessarily &quot;homosexuality&quot;. </p>

<p>I know that there are tribes still today where the young male has to consume the jism of the old, but that is also not homosexuality. </p>

<p>I disagree. </p>

<p>I do not hold the same opinions about the holocaust as ttttttotttttt, but I do think he has every right to share his opinions.</p>

<p>Suggesting that his opinion is &quot;bigotry&quot; is unfortunate. He has an opinion that is outside of the dominant narrative, so he is met with scrutiny and sanctions (being called a bigot, for instance). </p>

<p>However, simply stating that one believes in an alternative version of history, in which the holocaust has been exaggerated or at very least given disequal time in school etc, is not &quot;bigotry&quot;. Not in the slightest. </p>

<p>If he wrote &quot;well, I believe all jews are scum&quot; that would be bigotry. He might even think that or have posted it elsewhere. </p>

<p>The issue however, is that you (and others) can&#39;t put down your own version of history long enough to even entertain his. Again, I am not saying he is right, but I am saying that dismissing him as a bigot (rather than engaging with him in discussion) does no justice for you, him, or the holocaust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fascinating how quickly public opinion about homosexuality was changed. We&#39;re talking about a deeply-rooted social taboo that has endured for thousands of years, but almost overnight is swept away by a media blitz campaign. It shows, perhaps better than anything else ever could, the power of the media in shaping and controling the minds of the general population. And yet many people refuse to entertain the possibility that the media is engaged in deliberate social engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is frustrating, is that there are people (most people, it seems) out there who would get mad at me for agreeing with you, while still remaining pro-queer myself. </p>

<p>You are absolutely correct that it is an example of the power that the media has over people. I happen to agree with it (well, parts...different discussion but maybe I will add a bit below) but I still recognize the power you are referring to, and the speed with which the change happened (I would not say overnight, but pretty damn fast. &quot;Overnight&quot; compared to the rest of human history, no doubt). </p>

<p>And it is frightening what power the media, and really society, has over the individual. I have many times in my adult life had to stop and ponder whether or not it is <em>I</em> who likes a thing, or the <em>I that was programmed</em> to like a thing. </p>

<p>In regard to media representation of queer sexuality and my worldview (just because you might like to understand my point of view, but of course I am not assuming you would take it):</p>

<p>I believe that homosexuality (the act and desire) is natural, and can be socially positive. I believe that the desire to experiment may be wide spread, whereas actual &quot;hard&quot; (lol) homosexuality may be smaller, less than 10% of the population. These two groups are often conflated, which is part of the problem I am hoping to outline.</p>

<p>The media, while pushing for gay rights, has pushed very specifically for a certain set of gay rights. For instance, the right to adopt, or for gay protection bills aimed at stopping hate crimes. While doing so, the media has portrayed a very narrow version of what it is to be queer. Think &quot;Will and Grace&quot; if you ever had the misfortune of watching that abortion.</p>

<p>On these shows, the only acceptable type of gay is: wearing khakis, having a job, not being political, maybe being flamboyant. </p>

<p>Left out are the rest of the actual queers, who are potentially rallying for any number of different progressive changes. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the media uses its power to forward controlling personas for gays - so if you think you are gay, you have a script to follow. Lets say you decide, as a boy, you might like boys - well society says you must act femme in a certain way, dress in a certain way, etc. </p>

<p>What if it truly is, for you (in our scenario), an experimental phase? I endorse and support this phase! However, it sucks that society says &quot;no no, you sucked a dick, once, you are a faggot for life now&quot; and dictates that person continue to construct and inhabit a persona and identity that is not their own. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell you how many time I have met &quot;the same gay guy&quot; over and over and over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what?</p>

<p>Dude I am not ttttttt0ttttttt. Jesusfuckingchrist.</p>

<p>I was roboticpressure on this stupid forum until about 3 months ago. Now I delete and recreate accounts. Why?</p>

<p>Because of trolls, doxxing, anti-anonymity practices, and the fact that you can&#39;t have a conversation this board without being accused of being a shill or sockpuppet.</p>

<p>It is completely outside of the realm of reason that I could just have an opinion, huh?</p>

<p>Hey, ya know what, sherlock? Why not read the rest of my posts from today. You will find me debating queer acceptance with tttttt0tttttt. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you disagree with me must be a sockpuppet</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you actually even read my fucking post.</p>

<p>with it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are we talking about instances of homosexuality or homosexual lifestyles including homosexual life partnerships and zero heterosexual contact?</p>

<p>Just peeling grapes, maybe, but I really want to push the issue. </p>

<p>While I totally accept the presence of homosexual instances, I am having trouble with the full on acceptance of homosexuality as it stands today. </p>

<p>Pro queer, btw, just pushing the issue.</p>
