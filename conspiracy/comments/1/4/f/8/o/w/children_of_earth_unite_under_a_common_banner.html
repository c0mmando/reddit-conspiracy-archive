<p>I find that revolution speeches (like above) tend to use phrases that are universally known but lack a universal meaning. </p>

<p>For instance, I may think that &quot;freedom&quot; means being able to marry my gay lover. Or I may think that &quot;freedom&quot; means being able to beat up my gay neighbor.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course this is what we as a global community <em>should</em> do.  Problem is that that global community has been indoctrinated since birth for generations and generations to see one another as <em>different</em>.  We&#39;ve been indoctrinated since birth to view those differences in antagonistic ways - to NOT see one another as as family.  We&#39;ve been indoctrinated from birth to forget who and what we are.</p>

<p>As a result, the things that would have to happen FIRST before we as a people and as one family combat and do away with the deceitful power that has taken over this civilization...is see one another as one.</p>

<p>How possible is that?</p>

<p>How likely is it for you and me and all of us to see one another as one family?</p>

<p>How likely is it for everyone to see past all the many differences we&#39;ve been raised to focus on and keep us from coming together?</p>

<p>It seems we are very far from arriving at this necessary level of togetherness before we take over the ruling oppressors.</p>

<p>The ruling oppressors would be easily able to be taken over IF we all gathered as one human family.</p>

<p>We have not, however.  We are all separate - full of hates and jealousies; full of seeming differences and disagreements; full of stupid, close-minded indoctrinations that make us see one another as different, &quot;less than&quot;, worthy only of fighting against.</p>

<p>No.  There is a LOT we would have to do before we get to where we need to in order to be strong enough to overcome our oppression on this planet.</p>

<p>Who knows.  It might be the very reason the comment was downvoted.</p>

<p>We humans are not only ignorant, we are also generally arrogant, hubristic, and self-centered.  We don&#39;t like to hear that we aren&#39;t as great and as smart as we like to think we are.  We really have very little idea about how to consistently work together - much as our existence on this planet seems to prove this fact over and over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>One Ruling Family of The New World? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally wouldn&#39;t look at it in this way at all actually.  Why pander to the paradigm &quot;The New World&quot;?  Those words tend to already carry a particular connotation and association in the minds of most people that is definitely <em>not</em> the same as what I myself am meaning or talking about here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So would they all have to think as one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;think as one&quot;.  You can have a group of people that all acknowledge one another as parts of The Whole - of The One - and who honor and respect one another and their differences from this perspective and point of view.  This, of course, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they all <em>literally</em> &quot;think the same things&quot;, of course.  We&#39;re not talking about an organism like The Borg from Star Trek or whatnot.  We&#39;re talking about a people that are as different and unique as ever - as they&#39;ve always been - but that abide by a standard of cooperation, respect, unity, equality, and an acknowledgement that, again, everyone is part of a greater reality.  Respecting that Greater Reality necessarily means respecting each part of that greater reality - i.e. every human (and non human for that matter).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if people don&#39;t want to be part of the ORFTNW?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re asking what would happen if a cell didn&#39;t want to become part of the body that it&#39;s part of already.  It&#39;s a question that doesn&#39;t really apply.  Perhaps the question would be better stated as follows:  &quot;What if people don&#39;t want to acknowledge the ORFOTNW?&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder why it is that one WOULDN&#39;T want to acknowledge one&#39;s universal connection with everything and everyone.  If you are being kept in a state of servitude and you found out that part of the way to combat (and beat) that servitude and those oppressors that have put you in that state is by coming together with your fellow brothers and sisters and put aside your differences then I wonder why one <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> choose to look at things in this way and work their way out of their state of enslavement and servitude.  Understand also that looking at things in this way in no way necessarily means no longer look at things or life in the manner that you did <em>before</em>, but to, instead, acknowledge that such a way is not incompatible with that of others&#39; perspectives, and should never be used as any reason to have animosity against anyone else.</p>

<p>If one, as you asked, still doesn&#39;t want to acknowledge their union with everything/everyone, then I guess that would be their choice and prerogative.  That being said, they might still end up in the state of abject servitude that they were previously in while everyone else goes toward a better way of being.  I, therefore, wonder why anyone <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> want to improve their lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will they be safe to live their lives differently or be accused of breaking the Family&#39;s Laws?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the difficulty with this hypothetical question is that I&#39;m not certain that one could &quot;safely live their lives&quot; <em>without</em> breaking free from those clutches of TPTB that, in part, have indoctrinated a sense of &quot;separateness&quot; in almost everyone.  Regardless of how &quot;safe&quot; people on this planet right now think they are, we really are living in times of great fluctuation and uncertainty. a time when it seems everybody kind of feels that things in almost <em>any</em> area of the planet almost could get very unstable very fast.  In other words, <em>no one</em> is really too &quot;safe to live their lives&quot; right now.  This truth, of course, certainly applies a LOT more to certain people than others.  Difficulty in the United States nowhere near even <em>compares</em> to difficulty in Syria or Palestine (to say nothing of Africa), but the point stand none the less that everyone is under a state of greater tension as a result of this &quot;paradigm of separateness&quot; that exists and is perpetuated by certain forces on this planet.</p>

<p>It would seem that part of what is necessary, as I said initially, for the the &quot;Children of Earth&quot; to actually be able to overcome the rule of the elite few is for ALL those children to come together...or at least the vast majority of them.  Those that <em>don&#39;t</em> want to?  Those that say &quot;Na.  We don&#39;t want to be part of that unity&quot; and end up staying right where they are and <em>don&#39;t</em> move forward as one against TPTB with everyone else might presumably fall by the wayside and become casualties if and when TPTB decide to try to fight back.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say, hypothetically speaking, that the 99% break free from the tyranny of the 1% AND there are still some survivors from that group that said they didn&#39;t want to join everyone else.  I definitely question the intelligence of ANYONE who at this point still doesn&#39;t see or understand the effectiveness of accepting a better, more inclusive perspective on humanity, but if they <em>still</em> choose to be on their own, then, again, I would say that this is totally fine and okay so long as they don&#39;t do anything to disrupt or undermine anyone else.  This, of course, is something that should apply to <em>everyone</em> anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are the leaders of the ORF called the Head of The Family?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why call anyone anything of this nature in the first place?  Not only that, but - while in one sense I could answer this query in the affirmative and say &quot;yeah sure, if they want, they can be called the &#39;head&#39; of the family&quot; - I think it would actually be more accurate to understand that the &quot;head&quot; of the family could be composed of not only more than one person...but THE ENTIRE FAMILY in general.</p>

<p>I think the point I&#39;m trying to make here is that the &quot;leader-follower&quot; paradigm is one that we would do well as a species to break our minds from.  Understand and acknowledge that we are ALL leaders and followers.  It might sound corny, but really the best leaders are the best followers, and the best followers are also the best leaders.  The roles can interchange and undulate so long as everyone is working from the perspective of the mutual respect and honor discussed initially.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the other sects?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that everything and everyone is fine and okay so long as everyone understands and realizes that everything and everyone is part of a Greater Whole and everyone, as such, should honor and respect one another&#39;s differences as PART of that Greater Whole.</p>

<p>I know this might sound like some stupid, hippie, pie in the sky kind of thing, but 1) I am <em>not</em> in any way, shape, or form, a &quot;hippie&quot; (blach), and 2) what I initially said - although it may be an idea that I&#39;ve stated in more broad and general strokes without having really gotten into the particulars of just HOW something like this would be implemented in the real world - is still the foundation upon which I feel that any real forward movement in the way of freedom away from the ruling elite would be able to take place on the part of the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well my questions really stem from post-war victory for this hypothetical situation. </p>

<p>My questions stem from historic proof that revolutions, after having overthrown their governments, almost 100% install a government that&#39;s far worse then the one they overthrew.</p>

<p>But I suppose my questions could also apply during the supposed world-wide struggle.</p>

<p>Personally if you want total freedom from corruption and government rule, you&#39;ll have to disband the governments entirely and let the people govern themselves. In simple terms, anarchy.</p>

<p>But reality is that it wont happen. You&#39;ll always have people depending on one another, as you say, in order to achieve victory and live their lives without fear. This means that if left to govern themselves, they&#39;ll eventually start to form local, then state, and eventually national levels of government and then history will repeat itself all over again.. whether for good or worse.</p>

<p>Personally, and don&#39;t get me wrong here as I&#39;m sure what I&#39;m about to say will get a lot of hate. But I&#39;m all for a one-government world. History has shown that borders create conflicts and needless war with millions upon millions having died for just for land and resources.</p>

<p>And in reality? I think it&#39;s inevitable that this world will eventually have a single government at some point down the road. Most likely not in this lifetime [too much opposition] unless some great event happens, but it&#39;s a definite. Hopefully that government will be respectful of it&#39;s people if it does happen.</p>

<p>Your questions, therefore, stem from a human race that has worked from a paradigm of separation, which is far, far different than what I here refer to.  The two scenarios do not match or apply to one another because the &quot;historic proof&quot; that you speak of comes from the workings of an absolutely broken paradigm.  I&#39;m not speaking from that particular paradigm or perspective.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This seems fair and, indeed, recommended.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In simple terms, anarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must here make sure that you even understand what the word anarchy even means.  Do you?  I know I actually didn&#39;t initially.  And why is that?  The reason I didn&#39;t know initially is because I was always under the (mistaken) impression that anarchy meant &quot;chaos!&quot;, &quot;no rules!&quot;, &quot;no one ruling!&quot;, &quot;destruction!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you mean by your use of the term here right?</p>

<p>Well, the fact of the matter is that this particular perspective is one that has been indoctrinated into the public so that the TRUE meaning of anarchy would not be understood and get undermined.  Anarchy actually means a form of government where there is no specific head or leader.  In no way, shape, or form does this necessarily mean or imply anything negative, violent, or chaotic.  As a matter of fact, a people properly educated and properly working - properly responsible and autonomous - would actually DO BETTER when working amongst themselves and <em>leading</em> themselves without any form of patriarchal &quot;head&quot; or &quot;leader&quot;.</p>

<p>Understand that a properly functioning anarchic world is actually indicative of the absolute <em>height</em> of individual and collective evolution because it signifies a people that are EACH AND EVERYONE their own leaders <em>without</em> infringing upon one other&#39;s freedom.</p>

<p>So yes, sir.  In simple terms, <del>anarchy</del> a world where everyone leads themselves and come to their own decisions.  Mind you, nothing here actually precludes or prevents the individuals in this type of society from deciding that they would be better off if they all cooperated together to achieve certain ends.  This has to be understood to not be compulsory, however.  That is the crucial difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But reality is that it wont happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  Reality is that <em>it seems unlikely</em> to happen - this is far different than saying it definitely &quot;won&#39;t&quot;.  That being stated, it ultimately doesn&#39;t matter whether it is or isn&#39;t likely to happen.  The fact of the matter is that it certainly seems that if the people of this planet are incapable of autonomously leading themselves <em>and</em> coming together as one, then they (we) will likely continue to be ruled over like sheep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ll always have people depending on one another, as you say, in order to achieve victory and live their lives without fear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you&#39;re not understanding is that this, as I implied above, is in no way precluded by a state wherein which everyone functions off of their own, individual prerogatives.  There is nothing keeping that individual prerogative from realizing that it wishes to cooperate with its fellow beings.  Indeed this seems like a wise thing to do.  The difference, however, is that - as I mentioned above - such a thing is not <em>compulsory</em> or mandatory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This means that if left to govern themselves, they&#39;ll eventually start to form local, then state, and eventually national levels of government and then history will repeat itself all over again.. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.  Incorrect/not necessarily.  While people absolutely <em>could</em> form collectives, such collectives need not function in the same way that things currently do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m all for a one-government world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You continue to not understand that this is part of what I&#39;ve been okay with from the beginning.  You just have to further grasp that the TYPE of one world government I personally advocate is one wherein that governance is spread powerfully throughout the entirety of the population and doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be relegated to one head or a few small groups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>History has shown that borders create conflicts and needless war with millions upon millions having died for just for land and resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems to be the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s inevitable that this world will eventually have a single government at some point down the road.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would certainly hope so.  However, I would further hope that it is a single government whereby the people are ruled by one principle of collective togetherness and not necessarily by one nefarious group or entity as seems would be the case if things continue as they have been on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hopefully that government will be respectful of it&#39;s people if it does happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re not realizing that we&#39;ve been saying <em>very</em> similar things this whole time.</p>
