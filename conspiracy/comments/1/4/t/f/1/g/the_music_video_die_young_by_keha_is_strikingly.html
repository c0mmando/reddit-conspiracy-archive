    <div class="md"><p>This had come up about 100 times on this subreddit so... yeah we&#39;ve noticed. But you only noticed the most obsvious overused symbols in the music industry. This song had 1 symbol used that in conjunction with the song&#39;s title (die young) and lyrics is the most significant.</p>

<p>Many of you may not have noticed but the most important scene in this video comes in at [1:30]. Notice kesha picks up what appears to be the devil tarot card. Actually in the beginning she is pulled out of herse, branded &#39;evil&#39; [0:14], and carried around in the position we commonly see pictures of the baphomet, arms out to the sides. </p>

<p>In saying that she is the Baphomet (I&#39;ll explain what the Baphomet is later) she is just another temptation of earthly desires to sway us from good. Hammering the lyrics into our heads that keep us thinking about the mundane and trivial aspects of life to ensure humanity never rises out of the pitiful state we are in. After all no one ever does anything productive living as if they will die young. Sex, drugs etc, are not fundamentaly wrong and by themselves really pose no moral enigmas. The issue lies in the fact that sex, drugs really stand for mindless lust and addiction and these things steal a lot of opportunity from the yourselves and the world. This will lead to regret for wasted energy and time, regret can destroy a man like nothing else. The elite even dangle the whole scam infront our faces with celebrities, but people still flock to it like flies on shit. You see because <strong>the elite know that they must keep us knees deep in our selfish desires and keep us all wanting things so that they can step in and provide us with those same things.</strong> In this way they become our masters, and only because we let them... no we want them. In this way <strong>we give them the power</strong> we&#39;ve allowed the bourgeois to control all the things we need and think we need. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying our souls are being dammned because that&#39;s superstitous crap, our lives and future of humanity is being damned for the gain of an elite few and you know how they do it? By keeping everyone seperated and worried about their own gains. Never knowing that a better life lies in our ability civilize and fortify our communities, really through socialism. They shower us with this filth in their fight against altruism, they narrow down your vision of the world until all you see is yourself. The video pretty much says that all her fans are the fools spoken of in the story of the devil tarot card below...</p>

<p>What is the Baphomet/devil tarot card? Well the creature is defined in this story of the fool...</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>*&quot;Basic Tarot Story </p>

<p>The Fool comes to the foot of an enormous black mountain where reigns a creature half goat, half god. At his hooves naked people, linked to the god&#39;s throne by chains, engage in every indulgence imaginable: sex, drugs, food, drink. The closer the Fool gets, the more he feels his own earthly desires rising in him. Carnal desires, hunger for food and power, greed and selfishness. &quot;I have given up all such desires!&quot; he roars at the Goat god, resisting the beast&#39;s power with all his might. He is sure that this is a test of his new spirituality, one where he must prove that the temptations of the material world cannot sway him. </p>

<p>The creature responds to his defiance with a curious look. &quot;All I am doing is bringing out what is already in you,&quot; it responds mildly. &quot;Such feelings are nothing to fear, nothing to be ashamed of, or even to avoid. They are even useful to helping you in your quest for spirituality, though many try to pretend otherwise.&quot; </p>

<p>The Fool gestures angrily at the chained men and women, &quot;You say that even though these are clearly enslaved to the material world?&quot; </p>

<p>The Goat-god mimics the Fool&#39;s gesture. &quot;Take another look.&quot; The Fool does so, and realizes that the chained collars the men and women wear are wide enough for them to easily slip off over their heads. &quot;They can be free if they wish to be,&quot; the Goat-god says, &quot;They remain here because they want to be controlled by their base, bestial desires. There are, however, others….&quot; </p>

<p>At this the Goat-god gestures upward, toward the peak of the mountain. &quot;…Others who have used these same impulses to climb to the highest heights. If they had denied their desires they&#39;d never have gotten there.&quot; </p>

<p>On hearing this, the Fool sees that he has mistaken the Goat-god. This is not a creature of evil as he thought, but of great power, the lowest and the highest, both of beast and god. Like all power, it is frightening, and dangerous...but it is also a key to freedom and transcendence.&quot;*</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>She gets a devil Tarot card and responds with euphoria to the thought of humanity being controlled by their basic desires, it&#39;s kind of scary is it not? She is the face of the elite with a fiendish grin at the thought of people wasting thier lives on meaningless crap (living like they&#39;ll die young) to stroke our own egos, while they profit from the whole phychological torture. The problem with living as if you are dying young is your not preparing for the furute, disaster... But it&#39;s a recipe for creating debt slaves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know but we gotta use the $ to avoid those nasty trolls. That dollar sign is the first sign that Ke$ha act is bullshit and the whole thing is a legal racket.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s a bit out there but the tarot card&#39;s meaning isn&#39;t a secret its very public knowledge. If you consider the content of the her song plus, the filth we see the elite class pouring into society and finally combined with what we know the devil tarot card means... The message of the song (in my crazy opinion) is that people who like this music are fools that will waste their lives and the elite will try to gain from this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok then... I&#39;ll humor you, and consider for a moment that Ke$ha legitimately is either a member (is that what you call them?) of, or somehow being handled by the &quot;Illuminati&quot;. So with this knowledge, assuming it is true... why?</p>

<p>You just said yourself that she is &quot;of the lowest common denominator&quot;, and I doubt anyone would argue that her <em>true</em> fans are of any finer caliber than she in society. What this says to me is that the Illuminati, or whoever your villain in this bullshit is, somehow manages to control the entire global economy, influence the shape of nearly all geopolitics, and control the entire world&#39;s population, has decided to use a shitty, forgettable, and talentless pop &quot;singer&quot; to further advance their agenda of dominance, by influencing her fans, most of whom will likely never become influential or powerful in any way, other than possibly the 3rd shift assistant manager of a 7-11.</p>

<p>Really?? Why? What the fuck could they possibly have to gain by doing this? What is this &quot;message&quot;, and who could they possibly be trying to reach or convey it to by conveying it through a medium who is the most perfect embodiment of the term &quot;no-talent ass clown&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you should read the original parent comment then.</p>

<p>&quot; The elite even dangle the whole scam infront our faces with celebrities, but people still flock to it like flies on shit. You see because the elite know that they must keep us knees deep in our selfish desires and keep us all wanting things so that they can step in and provide us with those same things. In this way they become our masters, and only because we let them... no we want them. In this way we give them the power we&#39;ve allowed the bourgeois to control all the things we need and think we need. &quot;</p>

<p>And as George Carlin said best...</p>

<p>&quot;They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests.</p>

<p>Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!</p>

<p>You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fucking place! It&#39;s a big club, and you ain’t in it!  You, and I, are not in the big club. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt that there are an &quot;elite&quot; class of people who pull the strings in this world. I don&#39;t doubt that they may even use media to sway public opinion, whether music or whatever medium of propaganda you choose. I also don&#39;t doubt that there are a lot of people in this subreddit, and just in general, who will be able to find &quot;evidence&quot; they can use to insinuate a conspiracy in just about anything. So many things in fact, that I honestly can&#39;t think of one single thing that someone might not be able to read too much into and find something that they can draw some parallel to regarding a grand conspiracy.</p>

<p>For example, and just off the top of my head, right now, in front of me on my desk I have a pint glass with the logo for Fat Tire Beer from New Belgium Brewery. One could just pull out of their asses that &quot;Fat Tire is a tool of the global elite, because they make an alcoholic beverage to keep people lazy, complacent, and numb to what they are doing to the world. Then to top it off, they have the audacity to use the imagery of a bicycle with two wheels, which symbolizes we are all just spokes in their &quot;wheels&quot; of control, and they&#39;re rubbing it right in our faces!&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes, I realize how stupid that sounded, but frankly that&#39;s what people who insist the Illuminati killed Michael Jackson and recruited Jay Z and Beyonce, and apparently now Ke$ha sound. It&#39;s easy to find evidence of anything if you look hard enough for it, but that doesn&#39;t always make it so. </p>

<p>Also, sometimes I think a lot of you guys give whoever is running things too much credit, and maybe even WANT them to be so mysterious, powerful, and evil. For some, maybe it&#39;s because their lives are so boring, a grand conspiracy that they believe they are hip to gives them some excitement in life. For others, maybe it&#39;s to justify their paranoia to themselves and the people who they&#39;ve discussed this kind of thing with. Either way, I just don&#39;t buy that we are &quot;enslaved&quot;, but I&#39;ll buy &quot;distracted&quot;. There is a reason the media tells people to give a shit about the British royal family, or whatever the fuck Justin Bieber did yesterday. It provides commentary to the populace, lest people think a little bit and start asking questions, of each other no less. If they did though, I don&#39;t think they would find any answers that lead to dark masses and eyes of Horus. At worst, greedy bankers and multinational conglomerates. Those people still want to stay hidden though, and bullshit pop culture and &quot;news&quot; helps them do that. It&#39;s the curtain they hide behind, and they funny thing is, people fucking <em>LOVE</em> watching that curtain.</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t want to search for information, they want it delivered to them. They don&#39;t want to learn, they want to be taught. Media facilitates that, whether it be CNN or MTV. That doesn&#39;t mean that these companies are interested in taking your rights away though. They just want to keep the largest demographics they can reach entertained so they will &quot;stay tuned&quot; and they can capitalize on advertising revenue. Sleazy and sneaky? Yeah, but hardly a &quot;take over the world&quot; plot. It&#39;s all about money and resources, and at that level, the two are the same.</p>

<p>There are most certainly things going on that aren&#39;t on the up-and-up, but to claim with such certainty that there is an evil cabal that aims to create a one-world government and kill us all with eugenics or lock us in FEMA camps, and they have a thing for occult symbolism and cast magic spells and the like, is one hell of a stretch. The annoying thing to me though, is that when someone like me questions <em>your</em> version of the story, <em>I&#39;m</em> the one being unreasonable? I thought this was a &quot;thinking ground&quot;. I&#39;m not saying your wrong, because I can&#39;t. I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t think you&#39;re right though. I simply don&#39;t fucking KNOW... but neither does anyone else here. We&#39;re all &quot;conspiracy agnostics&quot; here, it just seems that only some of us can admit that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with almost everything you said, especially the last part...I don&#39;t know shit, no one does!  I will however argue with your &quot;Either way, I just don&#39;t buy that we are &quot;enslaved&quot;&quot; comment, as we&#39;re all slaves to the monetary system the banks have created, and we&#39;re all slaves to consumption.  It seems that our rights have slowly been stripped away from us and it&#39;s getting to the point where pretty much everything we do is illegal.  We&#39;re all at risk of being labeled a criminal, or a terrorist, if the powers that be say so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t accept that though. You are no more a &quot;slave&quot; to the banking system or consumption than someone is a slave to the restaurant industry. They are all, in some way, mechanisms that capitalize on people&#39;s addiction to convenience and unwillingness to sustain themselves. They also all rely on people to continue to exist. Granted, living without participating in a monetary system or buying and using goods would be an extremely inconvenient lifestyle by comparison, but far from impossible. It&#39;s just too easy to participate and not rock the boat.</p>

<p>As far as liberties being taken away, it too is all about money. If you are referring to drug laws in the US, they are legislated by people who take contributions or private sector positions offered by lobbyists on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry, who have no interest in any &quot;cures&quot;, only treatments and being able to manipulate patent laws. </p>

<p>Now, if you break those drug laws and get caught, you stand a good chance of going to a privately owned for-profit prison, which I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to learn that are also owned by a company that lobbies to pass legislation like mandatory minimum sentencing and probably has a buck or two on those drug laws too.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets face it. This girl doesn&#39;t have much talent and isn&#39;t even that good looking. She must have been making rounds with the same retards that green lighted the whole Nicky minage debacle. I haven&#39;t seen the video but I do have ears and have heard her previous attempts at music. 
The only shame is that the record companies now own the radio stations and they will play this so much that the dumbass kids that don&#39;t know any better will mistake this for something that is entertaining and we may have to hear her make more tries at whatever it is she&#39;s trying to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the symbols are there (being that all of those symbols are pretty much ingrained into popular culture because like all good symbols THEY LOOK COOL) now what? Does that mean satan will get me now that I&#39;ve watched it? Are 15 year old girls gonna start doing blood sacrifices? Where is the conspiracy? All I see is a pop act using popular imagery to make her video &#39;look cool&#39; so she can earn her label more money...</p>
