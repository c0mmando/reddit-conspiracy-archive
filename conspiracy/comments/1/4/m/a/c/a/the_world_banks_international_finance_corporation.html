        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is from the new <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/the-future-of-money-its-not-in-your-hands/#ixzz2Eg5VLLGy">Digital Trends article</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;A few hours later, over a mountain of beef bulgogi and across a sea of pickled Korean side dishes, Powell explains his earlier business selling virtual goods from video games when he receives a text. “A guy” from the International Finance Corporation – the investment arm of the World Bank – wants to join up with him for some drinks.</p>

<p>“We’re talking big league dudes here,” says Powell. “I met the guy earlier today. He seemed interested in Bitcoin. Want to go?</p>

<p>We pay the bill, grab a cab, and head to the Social House, an absurdly upscale sushi restaurant next door to the Aria.</p>

<p>When we arrive, the four-man IFC crew is seated around a giant dark wood table, closed menus in front of them. Powell and I wave at the group and they slide over to make room for us. We take seats on either side of the table.</p>

<p>“Hey guys, this is Jesse,” says one of the men in a German accent, extending his arm in Powell’s direction. “He does Bitcoin.” Everyone nods to Powell. “Hello.” “Hi.” “Hello.”</p>

<p>“And you are?” asks the German. The whole mean crew looks at me.</p>

<p>“This is Andrew,” Powell says. I waved at everyone, awkwardly.</p>

<p>“And what do you do, Andrew?” asks the German.</p>

<p>“I’m a journalist,” I say. Someone mumbles something about “off the record” as I dive into the cocktail list, avoiding the group’s prying gazes.</p>

<p>The German is Kai Martin Schmitz, a dapper “senior investment officer” for the IFC. Sitting to my left is Andi Dervishi, a soft-spoken Albanian and a member of the IFC’s Global Information and Communication Technologies Department. To Schmitz’s right sits Paul Jozefak, managing director of Liquid Labs GmbH, a Hamburg, Germany-based venture capital firm. The guy across from Paul doesn’t say his name.</p>

<p>“Jesse, tell us about Bitcoin,” says Schmitz, taking his McCallan 12 from our waiter.</p>

<p>Now is Powell’s big chance, I think. These guys have the power to throw money at the thing he cares about most. I hold my breath, curious how he’ll spin it.</p>

<p>“Well,” says Powell, “it’s an entirely digital currency. Right now, people only use it to buy drugs on this site called Silk Road – that and child pornography. I think it has a lot of potential.”</p>

<p>That’s his pitch?! Drugs and kiddie porn? I can’t believe it – this acid-soaked fool has blown his big chance in one sentence. Who would invest in a thing like that? I look up to see the whole table recoil, their faces blank, not knowing how to react. Suddenly, Paul laughs. “Tell us more!” he says, and the rest of the crew nods in giddy agreement.</p>

<p>Unshaken, Powell goes on to exalt the benefits of Bitcoin while admitting the pitfalls of a small, volatile market that is regularly targeted by hackers. The money men around the table appear entirely undeterred by the risks. I can see dollar signs in their eyes.</p>

<p>Weeks later, Powell tells me that the IFC guys decided not to invest, though they are “very interested in Bitcoin.” That was, however, before WordPress began to accept Bitcoin as payment for website hosting, before Europe gave a French Bitcoin exchange the same status as a real-money bank.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Digital Currency.</p>

<p>Complete Control, Easy for fraud.</p>

<p>Without Cash you are even more dependet to your Bank.</p>

<p>Also they would probably add some sort of Tax for transactions.</p>

<p>What are you doing when this little plastic card(or whatever) says no?</p>

<p>You pay cash, what are you doing if there is no cash anymore?</p>

<p>I am sure with a digital currency the goverment could this Fiat Money Scam last some years longer than now.</p>

<p>Also the bankers could rape you more than they are doing now.</p>

<p>The take over of Bitcion would also benifital because its the biggest alternative currency beside precious metals</p>

<p>(gold etc.)</p>

<p>This doesen&#39;t surprise me at all.</p>
