       "A few hours later, over a mountain of beef bulgogi and across a sea of pickled Korean side dishes, Powell explains his earlier business selling virtual goods from video games when he receives a text. “A guy” from the International Finance Corporation – the investment arm of the World Bank – wants to join up with him for some drinks.
      </p>
      <p>
       “We’re talking big league dudes here,” says Powell. “I met the guy earlier today. He seemed interested in Bitcoin. Want to go?
      </p>
      <p>
       We pay the bill, grab a cab, and head to the Social House, an absurdly upscale sushi restaurant next door to the Aria.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we arrive, the four-man IFC crew is seated around a giant dark wood table, closed menus in front of them. Powell and I wave at the group and they slide over to make room for us. We take seats on either side of the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Hey guys, this is Jesse,” says one of the men in a German accent, extending his arm in Powell’s direction. “He does Bitcoin.” Everyone nods to Powell. “Hello.” “Hi.” “Hello.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “And you are?” asks the German. The whole mean crew looks at me.
      </p>
      <p>
       “This is Andrew,” Powell says. I waved at everyone, awkwardly.
      </p>
      <p>
       “And what do you do, Andrew?” asks the German.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’m a journalist,” I say. Someone mumbles something about “off the record” as I dive into the cocktail list, avoiding the group’s prying gazes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The German is Kai Martin Schmitz, a dapper “senior investment officer” for the IFC. Sitting to my left is Andi Dervishi, a soft-spoken Albanian and a member of the IFC’s Global Information and Communication Technologies Department. To Schmitz’s right sits Paul Jozefak, managing director of Liquid Labs GmbH, a Hamburg, Germany-based venture capital firm. The guy across from Paul doesn’t say his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Jesse, tell us about Bitcoin,” says Schmitz, taking his McCallan 12 from our waiter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now is Powell’s big chance, I think. These guys have the power to throw money at the thing he cares about most. I hold my breath, curious how he’ll spin it.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Well,” says Powell, “it’s an entirely digital currency. Right now, people only use it to buy drugs on this site called Silk Road – that and child pornography. I think it has a lot of potential.”
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s his pitch?! Drugs and kiddie porn? I can’t believe it – this acid-soaked fool has blown his big chance in one sentence. Who would invest in a thing like that? I look up to see the whole table recoil, their faces blank, not knowing how to react. Suddenly, Paul laughs. “Tell us more!” he says, and the rest of the crew nods in giddy agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unshaken, Powell goes on to exalt the benefits of Bitcoin while admitting the pitfalls of a small, volatile market that is regularly targeted by hackers. The money men around the table appear entirely undeterred by the risks. I can see dollar signs in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weeks later, Powell tells me that the IFC guys decided not to invest, though they are “very interested in Bitcoin.” That was, however, before WordPress began to accept Bitcoin as payment for website hosting, before Europe gave a French Bitcoin exchange the same status as a real-money bank."

       Without Cash you are even more dependet to your Bank.

      <p>
       Also they would probably add some sort of Tax for transactions.

       You pay cash, what are you doing if there is no cash anymore?

       I am sure with a digital currency the goverment could this Fiat Money Scam last some years longer than now.

       Also the bankers could rape you more than they are doing now.

       You do not understand. This is not possible. There is no system to change. That is like saying that the movie industry could "change bittorrent". No one has
       <em>
        control
       </em>
       over bittorrent, it is just a protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin is easier to destroy than it is to change, and destroying bitcoin would take tens of millions of dollars at present (and much more in the future).

       There are many, many developers all working on different clients and projects.

      <p>
       If one of the developers was compromised and started changing their version of the client, people would simply stop using it and/or fork the code into a proper version.

       Its about the Goverments use of the digital currency system.

       If the Goverment would use it the people will follow and i am sure the goverment could sell this new system to general public.

       It's true that they could create their own virtual currency with whatever rules they liked, but they couldn't change Bitcoin.

       I've been skeptical and suspicious of bitcoin right from the first time I read about it. It just seemed to be exactly what the banksters might have come up with if they had thought of it first. It is, plainly and simply, just one more example of fiat money and therefore will eventually be controlled by the same people that control all other fiat money.

       It's not entirely correct to classify bitcoin as fiat.  Fiat is by decree of one single point of control.  Bitcoin is more by agreement, than by decree.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't persuade the miners to run your set of issuing rules, they don't get run.  If you can't persuade the users of the money to accept the blocks issued by the miners, what the miners issue is worth nothing.

       You do not understand. This is not possible. There is no system to change. That is like saying that the movie industry could "change bittorrent". No one has

       over bittorrent, it is just a protocol.

       Bitcoin is easier to destroy than it is to change, and destroying bitcoin would take tens of millions of dollars at present (and much more in the future).
