    <div class="md"><p>Making a tool easily available to someone with mental conditions is part of the problem too.  The current gun laws allow for people with mental issues to fairly easily acquire these weapons.</p>

<p>The people with guns are doing nothing but sitting around talking about how they need their guns while complaining about an oppressive government.  No one in the US is going to rise up in any meaningful way and your guns clearly aren&#39;t keeping the government honest so whats the point?</p>

But more and more people are waking up to what is going on. More people I talk to the more I see that we the people are coming to our senses. I dont keep guns to fight the Gov I keep them because I enjoy shooting and hunting and the piece of mind I get from living out in the country but knowing I have enough firepower to fight of most anything till the cops can arrive or till I can post it on reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of this still is only dancing around the subject. Inanimate objects do not kill people. I own a clip fed rifle and have for years. it has never killed any person. Now does that mean i just got a &quot;Good Gun&quot; that does not kill people? no it means I am not a fucking nut job. The real issue here is not the mechanism used but the why? No one wants to go after that. no one wants to talk about how fucked up our society is! Going after guns after a mass murder is like going after a coffee table because you stubbed your toe. It not the coffee tables fault it is your own! for not paying attention, which is the same thing that happen here. No paid attention that the youth is becoming more violent. No one was armed in the school that could have defended these kids. The problem is not we have to many guns but that we do not have enough informed people that responsibly carry a gun. No one is talking about the off duty cop in San Antonio that killed a guy walking into a moving theater with a clip fed rifle! Why because fear sells and people are willing to give up their freedoms to feel safe. When in reality there is no such thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When was the last time a public &quot;killing spree&quot; (read: not a crime of passion) happened outside a Gun-Free Zone?</p>

<p>They happen in churches, or schools, or other Gun-Free Zones such as in Aurora.  No one goes on a killing spree at the sheriffs department or the firing range.  In situations like that, you are lucky to get just one; hardly a &quot;spree.&quot;</p>

<p>The only lines that exist today are ones enacted by federal, state and local governments in violation of the 2nd amendment. These &quot;laws&quot; are gradually being overruled and declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_v._Chicago">McDonald v. Chicago</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> with more pending.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the wording means it can be limited without changing the constitution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted above, SCOTUS has been and will continue to be dealing with that issue. So far advocates of gun control have been shown they cannot place limitations the 2nd amendment. It should also be noted some of those justices have no compunctions about disregarding the constitution when their political agenda is at stake.</p>

The deaths of those children is purely on the shoulders of their leader who hoarded wealth and food to supply to his elite.

<p>I have yet to see a credible source for &quot;so many people are starving in NK&quot;. The North Koreans have been one of the US&#39;s pet boogeymen for 60 years and, as such, have been demonized in the MSM for equally as long.</p>

<p>If the US/UN have placed sanctions on NK then it would be very likely that those sanctions have had a significant negative effect on the population.</p>

<p>I am not going to back down, you are very dangerous. You are the perfect link to keep people with mainstream ideals from believing in anything that is important.

Humans can defend anything if they think it is right, but some people have no &quot;right&quot;. They are just good at seeing from a lot of possible perspectives.

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize your first source is degrading the West and their &quot;help&quot; to Africa, right? When using a source properly, it completely backs up what you meant in the first place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It gets worse, because we’re not talking about one trillion given in one year, but over half a century. Peter Singer does the maths on this in The Life You Can Save: Divide that $2.3 trillion into five decades, and you get $48 billion. Divide that by the number of people living in the affluent world, and it amounts to $60 per person per year</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh. The BLOG you posted points out how the aid you were backing up really doesn&#39;t help them in any way at all. Good job.</p>

<p>Second article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the public in poor countries have little voice, aid agencies and the IMF and World Bank have an incentive to create a splash with headline-grabbing initiatives at home, rather than proving their ability to deliver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also shows how the West uses these charities to gain profits and get peoples&#39; attention, rather than genuinely trying to help; not to mention, your source is from 1996...academically, that wouldn&#39;t be acceptable. </p>

<p>What makes you dangerous, friend, is you are refusing to believe anything that attests your beliefs. Ignorance lies within the person that believes they know everything, people who seek knowledge know that they know nothing (props to Socrates). You really think you&#39;ve got the whole world figured out? That everyone is lesser than yourself? In that case, I feel horrible for you.</p>

<p>Yesterday I did go off on you, I&#39;m sorry about that. You just really pissed me off because a: You were in every single thread I looked in in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> yesterday, spreading your bs, and b: You were trying to justify third world countries putting themselves in the positions they are in. That is my line that you crossed. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll stop being so harsh to you, but I highly recommend if you are open to conspiracies you need to expand your mind a bit. All you&#39;re trying to do is misinform people. It is almost like when you&#39;re bored, you have nothing better to do than to degrade people that attempt to expand theirs, and you&#39;re not really into conspiracies at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t even notice you said counterpoint, my mistake. Do you realize how abusive you are being? People abuse others because they are unhappy with themselves. I&#39;m only pointing this out because you don&#39;t stop. Regardless of how you&#39;re treating me, I&#39;m still learning something I am passionate about from a different angle than my own.

    <div class="md"><p>This title seems to have erred in not one, but two ways.  Firstly, it erred by even asking where the outrage for the many other children is given that America, for the most part, simply doesn&#39;t give a flying fuck about any other children from abroad.  Hell, the children HERE are barely even sought after properly.</p>

<p>Secondly, the title erred by assuming that what happened was a result of &quot;lack of proper US gun regulation&quot;.  It would seem that this is EXACTLY what TPTB want you and the rest of the public to think so that the 2nd amendment can be completely trampled upon.  It is not certain that what happened here in this case and in the other recent public murders didn&#39;t involve some significant psyops.</p>

I grow up with some good old boys out in the country and all of them have shot since they were 8yrs old. None of them have ever shot anyone. But I do have friends that have shot someone. They never grew up hunting, never had good guidence and never understood the value of life. These mass shootings, if not orchistrated by the gov, then are crys for help. Rage that boils over b/c they cant find the help they need. Peopl are emotionally damaged. Our parents are fucks, that only cARE ABOUT THEMSELVES. I understand why colombine happened. I absolutly disagree with it but i get it. I understand. We isolate each other, never taking the time to ask how someone feels without being ready to interject with our own bullshit story we feel is better. it humans that need a change not gun laws. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guns are harder to get a hold of then you think. It not like every drug dealer also sells guns. Not to mention its all interlinked. If drugs were legal and controlled gun violence in that case would be decreased. As for parents shooting their kids, well, people are just fucked up. If they did not have guns they would have used some other method. Look at Casey Antyhony. Also I knew  guy that did not have a gun but killed his GF with a samari sword. peopl are going to kill no matter what the weapon. No amount of laws will ever stop that. guns are just the exscape goat because people dont want to face thier own inequity and change for a better. its easier to push it off on some other bullshit. Guns do not kill people! People kill people. I am a long time gun owner and my guns have never killed anything other then deer and targets. If its the guns fault then why have I not been posessed by my guns to kill peopl? Because guns dont kill people, tools do not kill people. People kill people. Its an issue with our race not our tools.  </p>

But you do not see anyone outside BK or McD&#39;s screaming and yelling we need a band on double cheese burgers. Why do you think that is? do you think the Gov really cares about you? Hell no. this all about popularity. If the gov really cared for our children then they would teach proper nutrition. Not that bullshit pyramid that says bread should be the bases of ever meal. Bread! Bread! If the Gov really cared for our kids then why the fuck was pizza made a Veggy?!?!?! I mean come on. They dont care and people are stupid.
