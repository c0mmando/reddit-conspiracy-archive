        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">82</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-12-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/axolotl_peyotl.html">axolotl_peyotl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been researching the anomalies surrounding the events of 9/11 for 10 years now...and never before have I come across such damning information regarding the occult nature of the Mega-Ritual that was carried out on that fateful day.</p>

<p>9/11 was <em>so</em> effective that it literally incapacitated the majority of the world&#39;s population. The event was so diabolical, so <em>grand</em>, that it literally brought about an alchemical transmutation in the minds of the populace. </p>

<p>The events that day polarized the world more than any before: some people were thrust further into the blindness of their &quot;matrix&quot;, and others were catapulted directly out of it, being forced into Chapel Perilous.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come a long way in my research surrounding this event (as have many of you), but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the revelations in this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Dangerous-Book-World/dp/1937584178/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355502572&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+most+dangerous+book+in+the+world">&quot;The Most Dangerous Book in the World: 9/11 as Mass Ritual&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>So, why are the flight numbers on 9/11 so important? </p>

<p>11...175...77...93...</p>

<p>...and what do they have to do with &quot;the wickedest man in the world&quot;, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">Aleister Crowley?</a></p>

<p>If I ever had a doubt about the ritualistic nature of 9/11 (and the sheer degree of planning that went into it), I couldn&#39;t be more convinced now.</p>

<p>The Twin Towers, the Twin Pillars of Hercules, the Gemini of astrology, Joachim and Boaz of Freemasonry (with the &quot;Salomon&#39;s&quot; Temple Building 7 accompanying them)...were they constructed with the foreknowledge that they would be brought down in a fiery sacrificial cataclysm?</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with the infamous Aleister Crowley? And what does the number 11 have do with all of this?</p>

<p>In Crowley&#39;s own words: the number 11 is &quot;the number of Magick in itself [and] therefore suitable to all types of operation. [It is] the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon [the Aeon of Horus, Crowley&#39;s name for the new age, with himself as the prophet, of course.]&quot;</p>

<p>What better way to start a Mega-Ritual on the 11th day of September (111 days before the end of the year) than to have Flight 11 crash into the tower on the 93rd floor (the significance of that number will become apparent, if it isn&#39;t already).</p>

<p>And the second plane? Flight 175 would soon smash into the <em>77th</em> floor of the other tower. We&#39;ll get to the 77, but for now what&#39;s the significance of 175?</p>

<p>Since we&#39;re in the realm of Crowley, let&#39;s see what he had to say about 175.</p>

<p>&quot;There are three main methods of invoking any Deity...The &#39;First Method&#39; consists of devotion to that Deity...a perfect instruction exists in Liber 175. This is the book of uniting to a particular Deity by devotion.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libri_of_Aleister_Crowley">Here&#39;s the Wikipedia page for the Libri of Crowley</a>. Note that 175 says &quot;On uniting oneself to a Deity.&quot;</p>

<p>Before you start to think this is getting way too esoteric, I&#39;ll give you three guesses as to which Deity was being invoked (and the first two don&#39;t count).</p>

<p>Again in Crowley&#39;s own words: &quot;I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word. I wanted to get hold of him personally and become his chief of staff.&quot;</p>

<p>So, is there an unusual event that might give us an idea which Deity was invoked when 175 supposedly hit the tower?</p>

<p>If you recall what the Commander in Thief at the time was doing, well then it should become painfully obvious.</p>

<p>The moment the 2nd plane hit the tower George W. Bush was reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Pet_Goat">&quot;The Pet Goat&quot;</a> in Sarasota, Florida, strangely enough just 10 miles away from Venice, the location of the flight school Mohamed Atta and another &quot;hijacker&quot; trained at. What a coincidence!</p>

<p>This &quot;reading&quot; of The Pet Goat was essentially a &quot;Black Mass&quot;, a &quot;satirical ceremony, a Commander-in-Chief that wouldn&#39;t leave his seat until the reading of a story about a pet goat was completed (&quot;I read this book that I may study the nature of my Deity,&quot;) during which time hundreds of his fellow Americans were in harm&#39;s way, many of them meeting horrific ends as they burned alive or plunged to their deaths from the towers (&quot;Yet also may he deliberately practise cruelties&quot;)--conjuring the image of <a href="http://www.rootwerx.com/tarotdecks/bosch/the-tower/images/Rider-Waite_The_Tower_large.jpg">The Tower tarot card</a>--all taking place in...&quot;Paradise,&quot; the city of Sarasota&#39;s unofficial yet widely-used nickname. Well How about that?&quot;</p>

<p>For those who still are unsure what Deity was being invoked, <a href="http://kkoagulaa.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/baphomet.jpg">here&#39;s an image that may give you a hint</a>.</p>

<p>If you <em>still</em> think all of this is a stretch, hang on, it gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it)!</p>

<p>AA77 was supposedly piloted by an individual who, according to one of his instructors, &quot;could not fly at all.&quot; And yet he was able to pull off an <em>incredible</em> stunt, and instead of attacking several more strategic points in the Pentagon, he just so happened to choose the very wing were the DoD&#39;s accounting division was located...and conveniently enough Donald Rumsfeld had announced the <em>day before</em> the attacks they they couldn&#39;t account for $2.3 <em>trillion</em> in transactions. The records of this and interest in this announcement all but disappeared after the attacks.</p>

<p>Is there significance to the number 77? You bet your occult-deciphering ass there is. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4">A∴A∴</a> is a magical order that was created by Crowley in 1907. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/A.%27.a.%27._seal.png">Here&#39;s their seal</a>.</p>

<p>AA77 anyone???????</p>

<p>From The Book of Lies: &quot;7, the septenary; 11, the magical number; 77, the manifestation, therefore, of the septenary. Through matter, because 77 is written in Hebrew Ayin Zayin (OZ), and He-Goat, the symbol of matter, Capricornus, the Devil of the Tarot; which is the picture of the Goat of the Sabbath upon an altar.</p>

<p>Black Mass anyone?</p>

<p>Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, lists 77 &quot;infernal names&quot; of the &quot;Gods and Goddesses of the Royal Palace of Hell.&quot;</p>

<p>It gets better: the Pentagon, which is 77 feet tall, is located on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77th_meridian_west"><em>77th meridian west!</em></a>. Oh and George H.W. Bush, who first announced his plans for a &quot;New World Order&quot; on September 11th, 1990 (11 years before...well shit this is just getting too obvious), well daddy Bush was...77 at the time of the attacks.</p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;m not demonizing <em>any</em> of these numbers. Symbols can be used for good <em>or</em> evil, I don&#39;t believe a number can be inherently &quot;evil.&quot; After all, &quot;Symbols don&#39;t kill people; people with symbols kill people.&quot;</p>

<p>Any more 77&#39;s we can add to this already overbearing occult script? You bet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure most of you are familiar with the &quot;mystery plane&quot; that was spotting in New York and above the Pentagon during the attacks. The plane has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4#September_11.2C_2001">since been identified</a> as the E-4B, a highly secretive and advanced plane also referred to as the &quot;Doomsday Plane&quot;.</p>

<p>A FOIA request <em>finally</em> got more information from the FAA in 2008 about this extremely unusual plane that should <em>not</em> have been there (unless it piloting the attack aircraft by remote control, but that opens a whole new can of worms. The call sign of this plane that was spotted above the Pentagon during the attack? VENUS77!</p>

<p>For those that are astrologically-minded, the conjunctions of the planet Venus against the Zodiac <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m4vuo4c01W4/ULUX7nPQdBI/AAAAAAAAA74/7kuCnP21xYk/s1600/Example_Venus_pentagram.jpg">form a pentagram!</a>...Venus invokes the pentagram (plenty of information available on this with a simple online search).</p>

<p>So Flight 77 eliminates Rummy&#39;s dirty laundry (along with anyone else who knew too much) by hitting the 77-foot tall Pentagon (with 7 floors!), on the 77th meridian west, while the Doomsday Plane, call sign Venus77 (Pentagram 77!) circles above. Oh, and flight 175, the plane that evoked the &quot;Deity&quot;, hit the 77th floor.</p>

<p>And what about that final number? Flight 11 hit floor 93...the final fateful flight that day was...drumroll...flight 93!</p>

<p>For those who are familiar with Crowley, this 4th flight is by far the <em>easiest</em> to associate with the diabolical individual.</p>

<p>In fact, there&#39;s an entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/93_%28Thelema%29">Wikipedia page</a> on the importance of the number 93 to Crowley and his religious philosophy Thelema. In fact, Thelemites ofter greet each other with &quot;93&quot; or will sign correspondences with &quot;93/93&quot; at the end. Flight 93...flight AA11 crashes into the 93rd floor...is this starting to make more or less sense?</p>

<p>There is a great deal of information out their on Building 7 as well, including it essentially being an occult-Masonic construct (Salomon building anyone?). It&#39;s 47 stories and trapezoidal shape can attest to that (the 47th Problem of Euclid, also known as the Pythagorean Theorem, &quot;represents a perfect symbol of Freemasonry&quot;).</p>

<p>There is of course a <em>whole</em> new can of worms to open with respect to the <em>astrological</em> importance of the 9/11 Mega-Ritual, but there is far too much information on this topic to delve into here, as this is already becoming long-winded.</p>

<p>However, more information can be found in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkwBjLG1ULA&amp;feature=player_embedded#!">well-made series of Youtube videos.</a> In a nutshell, Saturn and Pluto achieved a position of powerful opposition on September 11th, 2001 (they are both considered to be &quot;Lords of Death). Any astrologer can tell you that this alignment does <em>not</em> bode well for the people on Earth.</p>

<p>Whether or not you believe in astrology is irrelevant...what <em>is</em> relevant is that TPTB <em>do</em> believe in this stuff and they flaunt it in our faces because they <em>can</em>.</p>

<p>For those of you who <em>have</em> been studying these occult scripts, it should come as no surprise that Sirius would get dragged into this mess as well. </p>

<p>From &quot;The Most Dangerous Book&quot;: &quot;Today&#39;s Coptic calendar (also called the Alexandrian calendar) is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar and is still used in Egypt, and also by the Coptic Orthodox Church. The first month of the year is named Thout, after Thoth, and thus the first day of the New Year is the 1st of Thout. On the Gregorian calendar, this date coincides with September 11th--so that date is not only New Year&#39;s Day, but, more importantly, it is the symbolic, or observed, date of Sirius&#39; heliacal rising.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, the precession of the equinoxes has shifted this a bit, and today that date has shifted 45 days...now the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs on August 5th.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll never guess which date <em>both</em> the Statue of Liberty (really an homage to both Isis and Lucifer) and the Twin Towers were &quot;initiated&quot;...August 5th! (Oh, and the Pentagon was initiated in a Masonic ceremony on September <em>11th</em> 1941.)</p>

<p>The occult importance of Sirius is beyond the scope of this post, but just trust me that it&#39;s important! Did TPTB do anything to associated the event with the word &quot;Sirius?&quot; You betcha.</p>

<p>Do a search for 9/11 and Sirius and you&#39;ll find that the only K-9 (K=11...11-9...9-11...maybe I need to slow down a bit) who died on that fateful day was named.......SIRIUS. Sirius was dog number 17...17 is The Star in the Tarot...which according to occultists depicts the star of SIRIUS. cough.</p>

<p>If you think it&#39;s overkill that they would name and sacrifice a dog merely to add another layer to their occult script, well then you still don&#39;t really get how these events work. The <em>more</em> symbolism they cram into the rituals, the more powerful the ritual becomes.</p>

<p>For more information on the occult significance of the numbers and astrology behind the events of 9/11, I recommend <a href="http://intothefaerywoods.blogspot.com/2011/09/aleister-crowley-core-layer-of-matrix.html">this article</a> and <a href="http://vftb.net/?p=3984">this interview</a> with the other of another book on this topic (which I haven&#39;t read) &quot;Prophet of Evil: Aleister Crowley, 9/11 and the New World Order&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More info because I got cut off:</p>

<p>SO...what does this all have to do with Phoenix and Christmas? </p>

<p>S.K. Bain, the author of &quot;The Most Dangerous Book in the World&quot; from which I got most of this information from, has added a 2nd section to his incredible book. It&#39;s even more surreal than the first part, if that&#39;s possible, as it refers to a false flag nuclear attack against Phoenix on 12/25/12 <em>in the past tense</em>!</p>

<p>In other words, Bain is so confident in his deciphering of this occult script that he claims the attack is inevitable (unless we yell <em>really</em> loud enough, perhaps). He even ties together the Gabrielle Giffords attack (in which a girl was killed who was <em>born</em> on September 11th, 2001), the &quot;Joker&quot; massacre, and the XXX Olympics Illuminati Mega-Ritual with the upcoming event in Phoenix (perhaps the massacre in Connecticut today is part of this pre-programming as well).</p>

<p>So why Phoenix? Not only is Phoenix the largest capital city in the nation, but you seriously can&#39;t have more occult connotations in a city&#39;s name than the word &quot;Phoenix&quot;. Phoenix is located on the 33rd parallel (the Masonic significance of which I won&#39;t go into here). Guess what else is located on the 33rd parallel? The Georgia Guidestones, Charleston, South Carolina, birthplace of the Freemasonic &quot;Mother Lodge of the World&quot; (and site of the start of the Civil War), the Trinity nuclear test site in New Mexico, and <em>both</em> cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. I should mention that Harry S. Truman, a 33rd-degree Freemason and the <em>33rd</em> president, was the one who ordered the bombs dropped on the two innocent cities. </p>

<p>I have no interest in fear-mongering or spreading false conspiracy theories, but without going into the extensive amount of evidence Bain offers for this prediction, I feel uneasy enough to both make this post (11 days before the purported attack) and to urge anyone I know <em>not</em> to be in Phoenix on Xmas.</p>

<p>After a quick search for certain keywords, I found the following: <a href="http://www.zengardner.com/phoenix-false-flag-nuke-back-on-the-table">Phoenix False Flag Nuke Back On The Table?</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another article, complete with the observation of the &quot;33rd parallel&quot;: <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2011/09/phoenix-the-false-flag-nuke-target-1087471.html">Phoenix: The False Flag Nuke Target?</a></p>

<p>And in further into the realm of speculation/crazy, I found this (heavily Christian) collection of prophecies (which are interesting but should be taken with a grain of salt, obviously): <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/52109795/Phoenix-Arizona-Nuclear-Destruction-Prophecies">Phoenix Arizona Nuclear Destruction Prophecies</a>.</p>

<p>So what does this all mean? What do we do with all of this information?</p>

<p>My only advice is to let it <em>empower</em> you, not intimidate you. They thrust these images and symbols and connections into our faces <em>because</em> it terrifies and intimidates those that are actually paying attention. If we stand up to them, call them out on their bullshit, then their power with these rituals is <em>significantly</em> weakened, creating an atmosphere where it will be increasingly difficult for them to continue their tyranny and successfully carry out anymore of these diabolical occult rituals.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope we don&#39;t experience this &quot;Black Christmas&quot;, and part of my motivation for this post is to spread this information as quickly as possible. Cockroaches don&#39;t like it which you shine a light on them.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this, I truly appreciate it. </p>

<p>I love all of you guys, keep on fighting the good fight and I&#39;ll see you on the other side!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, you reminded of one of the most important points!</p>

<p>&quot;The Mass of the Phoenix&quot; was one of Crowley&#39;s creations, a perverse counterpart to the Lord&#39;s Supper.</p>

<p>From the book:</p>

<p>&quot;The abominable Mass of the Phoenix was first printed as Chapter 44 in Crowley&#39;s &quot;The Book of Lies&quot;, and later as &quot;Liber 44&quot;. In the ritual, a bell is rung a total of 44 times...Liber 44 invokes Ra, the Sun God--with the sun beginning its annual upward journey on December 25th--and wouldn&#39;t you know, 44 is also the sacred number of Horus. Furthermore, in what might to the uninitiated seem an unrelated coincidence, Barack Obama is the 44th President.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, however, in the occult worldview, the spilling of blood is absolutely necessary for regeneration and renewal, and the New World Order was born out of the blood, and ashes, of Phoenix--a mass sacrifice to the one true bringer of illumination, Lucifer.&quot;</p>

<p>Will they perform a black mass, the Mass of the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, <em>in</em> Phoenix <em>and</em> on Christ&#39;s birthday?</p>

<p>Oh, and &quot;44 Monroe&quot; is Arizona&#39;s tallest residential structure.</p>

<p>eep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that this is extremely wide-eyed, high-octane speculation.</p>

<p>But as for someone leaking info, someone has literally written a <em>book</em> on the subject, you don&#39;t get more leakage than that.</p>

<p>And for the record, William Cooper went on air a few months before 9/11 and said that a false flag was about to occur, probably in New York, and that Osama bin Laden would be set up as a patsy.</p>

<p>Cooper was killed a month later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018">this</a>, sir.  Read through it.  I would say it is very relevant to everything you&#39;ve written thus far.</p>

<p>EDIT (SPOILER ALERT, btw):  To give you a quick overview of some of the information contained in the link and why it&#39;s very relevant to some of the information you address in your OP, part of what&#39;s talked about in it is an order of beings on this planet that 1) are not <em>from</em> it, 2) have a pretty absolute and vice-like grip of control and power over a great deal of the goings on here on Earth, 3) derive all of their power from the vast amount of knowledge that an elevated member of their council known as &quot;The Illuminated One&quot; gives them (that illuminated one also known as &quot;The Light Giver&quot;, aka &quot;Lucifer&quot;), 4) are an extremely advanced race of beings, the least member of which vastly overshadows in ability and intelligence even the most gifted genius from planet Earth, 5) are the beings who happen to be responsible for exacting the hate, crime, debauchery, heinous evil, and atrocious, unspeakable cruelty on this planet, but 6) the actual reason why they have come here to exact all this hate, violence, and fear on this planet is because (wait for it, here it comes)…they actually <em>love</em> us.</p>

<p>Oh. And that planet they happen to come from? It&#39;s Venus. Yeah. The one you&#39;ve already mentioned as having great significance in all of this.</p>

<p>All this might sound crazy and far out, but I found that part of what can be understood in the link is an interpretation of the state of things on this planet that I&#39;ve found in only <em>one</em> other source that is actually COMPLETELY unrelated to it.  The fact that neither document likely references the other (the author of one DEFINITELY not knowing about their counterpart, as that particular author <em>died</em> before the publishing of the other work), both works being authored decades apart, and both having main points that - although shockingly paralleled to one another - are worded so differently as to almost not even be saying the same thing (even though they actually <em>are</em> once one actually understands what exactly they&#39;re saying) seems to me to give great and <em>very</em> interesting weight and import to the information contained in the link I sent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s said that the energy/the being that created this planet and humanity along with it provided an oasis of sorts here on this planet, but because no conflict was provided and things were so easy here, those beings (humans) never had a need to search beyond the circumstances they found themselves in. They never came to realize that the place they were in (Earth), although pretty cool and nice and lush and had nice food to eat and nice places to rest and sleep, etc, was NOT the end all and be all of existence…and so long as this human creation stayed in this ignorant state of &quot;limited bliss&quot; - this state that it never needed to look past or outside of because things were so &quot;blissful&quot; and easy here - it would not evolve and become a more advanced entity. It would remain limited to its state of &quot;low bliss&quot; if you will.</p>

<p>If I may continue explaining all this in extremely pedestrian ways, I will further say that these advanced beings that came from Venus convened with a &quot;Great Galactic Council&quot; - a &quot;Galactic UN&quot; of sorts - that oversees The Milky Way and all the billions (&quot;B&quot;, not &quot;M&quot;) of beings and other planet-creators in the galaxy. It was decided here that the beings from Venus would be allowed to come to Earth and try to help the humanoids on it. Earth&#39;s planet-creator had great ambivalence about this, as it actually liked its little &quot;human experiment creation&quot; pet thingies and wanted to keep them as just that: It&#39;s little sea monkey pet things. It didn&#39;t want this pet to become an independent thinker with the ability to actually question its surroundings. It was taking care of them nicely just where they were. It made sure they were nice and comfortable and had as much as they wanted to eat and drink and were relaxed. It did NOT want them to become independent, though. This Earth planet-creator was, in other words, a &quot;jealous god&quot;.</p>

<p>All that being said, it was still ultimately decided by this Greater Galactic Council - and begrudgingly accepted by the Earth planet-creator - that the Venusians would be allowed to come to Earth and help the Earth planet-creator&#39;s pet (humans) try to evolve and become more aware of what&#39;s actually out in the universe and in existence.</p>

<p>The way that it was decided this would be done was by presenting the Earth humans with the diametrical opposite of what they had been shown/how they had been living up to that point. They had been given only a &quot;good&quot; existence by their Earth planet-creator god, but, because they had not been shown a &quot;bad&quot;, they had no other conception of that greater reality that exists that is indeed beyond both good and evil - the TRUE reality…and so long as they didn&#39;t have any awareness or understanding of the OTHER end of the spectrum (so long as they were entirely ignorant of the bigger picture and didn&#39;t have &quot;the knowledge of good and evil&quot; <em>both</em>) they would have an extremely difficult time evolving and advancing beyond the shallow confines where they were kept. Therefore, according to the information in the link I provided, the Venusians - in their universal compassion for humanity and in their interest in helping humanity grow and evolve - sacrificed themselves in a great, great manner by coming to this planet and doing something which was completely against their real nature: They provided the diametrical opposite of the &quot;shallow good&quot; perspective that the Earth planet-creator-god was too afraid to let Its little pet creation (humans) get an understanding of. The Venusians were allowed to show humans a world that was more than the one they had been created into and kept in which was pretty purely safe and was &quot;consistently good&quot;, but that was also ultimately shallow and did not provide much of any room for &quot;upward growth or momentum&quot; as a spiritual being - a being that could become more and more self aware and more evolved.</p>

<p>It&#39;s said (in the link) that the Venusians are going through with a great sacrifice because they are the very opposite of the evil beings they have come to this planet to be. They have only become such on this planet so that humanity can actually get to see both all the good and all the bad that exists on this planet and can - as a result and more importantly - THEN come to finally realize that true development and evolution, true growth, involves going beyond both of those dynamics on this planet; going beyond BOTH good and evil.</p>

<p>We would not be able to actually DO that and go beyond and evolve if we didn&#39;t even know what evil was in the first place, however. It&#39;s said that the problem with all this was that the Earth planet-creator god that created us didn&#39;t want its little pet humans to ever actually <em>see</em> evil. This is something that shouldn&#39;t be faulted all too much, but in doing this, this creator was ensuring that its creation (humans) would definitely never grow and evolve any further. This Earth planet-creator-god was being the equivalent of the obsessively over-protective parent that actually stunts its kid&#39;s growth and development by trying to protect it <em>too</em> much and keeping it closed up from the outside world.</p>

<p>The Venusians wanted to remedy this by allowing the Earth god&#39;s pet-creations (humans) to get a full understanding of the full spectrum of both good and evil on this planet, and, in that way, humans could come to slowly acquire the presence of mind to see BEYOND the trappings of both good and evil dynamics and could then graduate to the next level of existence and being.</p>

<p>It&#39;s said that on this coming Friday 12/21/12, a vibrational, energetic shift will happen, and the time will be ripe and ready for a phenomenon to occur that is called &quot;The Harvesting&quot;. The energy of the souls of the beings on this planet will be assessed, and depending upon whether those energies - those souls - are more of the &quot;service to others&quot; type, or the &quot;service to self&quot; type, or somewhere in the middle, they will go to different areas to continue their growth and development as beings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s said the the Venusians and the philosophy of their Great Teacher - the light giver &quot;Lucifer&quot; (the being that the Earth planet-creator-god in it&#39;s upsetness and general jealousy made it a point to completely vilify in a book that the human pet creations were given to read, worship, and abide by) - have come here to help humanity understand not only that 1) evil is not the way (a thing they illustrate by bringing as much of it to this planet as possible so that the humans here, practically bombarded with it, come to truly understand that the temptation therein is unadvisable and should NOT be striven toward), but also (and perhaps even more importantly) to understand that 2) the limited good that we&#39;ve seen on this planet is ALSO not the way you want to go or what you want to strive for either.</p>

<p>Both of these things are trappings that cause the being who attaches themselves to them to fall into the hole of &quot;service to self&quot;. In other words, it doesn&#39;t matter if you go toward the bad or you go toward the good because both can be said to be manifestations of a type of &quot;service to self&quot; - which ultimately causes one&#39;s growth and evolution as a greater being to be stunted. It is only in being of &quot;service to OTHERS&quot; that it&#39;s said one can evolve and advance to the next &quot;grade&quot; or level of evolution as a true cosmic entity. This service to others way of being, it has been surmised, can ONLY come about by getting the entity in question (in this case humans) to go BEYOND the limited rungs of their own self-interested desires; by going beyond existing in the way that many humans were - in the shallow and limited bliss of that &quot;garden of eden&quot; that the Earth planet-creator god had brought into creation for its pet humans. It&#39;s said that staying in that state of &quot;limited bliss&quot; <em>exclusively</em> was NOT going to allow them (us) to grow further. Humanity had to be shown the full spectrum of both positive and negative existence on this planet in order to evolve and move beyond both.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why, again, the Venusians stepped in and were willing to undergo what they call their &quot;great sacrifice&quot; of bringing evil in to this world…so that humans could see it, and overCOME it/move passed and <em>beyond</em> it, thereby becoming stronger and greater, more evolved and advanced cosmic/universal beings in the process.</p>

<p>Call it a work-out for our evolution as universal beings.</p>

<p>…I did not anticipate that this would run so long. Sorry. I came in only attempting go give a brief explanation of what was in the link, and ended up writing almost as much here as is IN the link itself. lol. Oops. Sorry.</p>

<p>Ha.  Yeah.  Definitely.

That&#39;s when I initially responded with the link only, and afterward, decided that it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to at least give a &quot;little synopsis&quot; of what&#39;s in the link - as opposed to just posting it dry like I initially did.</p>

<p>Next thing you know, I created my own wall of text.  Again, sorry. :)</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely interesting information though.</p>

<p>Yes sir.  This is pretty much the impression that I kind of got out of it as well.  Every opportunity I get that&#39;s appropriate to mention the talks in the link, I take.  Even if some people will go &quot;This is stupid and you&#39;re stupid for posting it&quot; it doesn&#39;t matter to me.  Enough of the information is absolutely (as you said) mind-blowingly amazing.  It really does get you to look at things from a different perspective.</p>

<p>The way I see it, if one takes out of the information what, I feel, is actually intended by the author, then it&#39;s kind of all good either way you look at it/whether what&#39;s said is factually real or the case or not...because the ultimate lesson that the author imparts is to work on IMPROVING yourself.  Work on looking at the bigger picture of existence and reality.  Work on getting to understand that even when things seem bad or horrible, there&#39;s a part of you that is above it and that you can call upon and be one with and end up coming out of the experience being better for it.</p>

<p>It also gets one to look at &quot;evil&quot; a bit differently as well - from a &quot;bigger picture&quot; perspective.</p>

<p>Again, ultimately - even if it&#39;s all fake it doesn&#39;t matter because the lessons that one can take away from it can still be <em>very</em> much real.</p>

<p>And honestly?  I don&#39;t think the information is fake.</p>

<p>Peace.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zecharia Sitchin in his translation of ancient Sumerian cuneiform tablets, details the exploits of a race of off world beings that created humanity to mine for gold on Earth.</p>

<p>The king of this other world - who actually couldn&#39;t care less about the humans and saw them as less than cattle - made a book that the humans were to regard as paramount; a book where he was a superior god who was &quot;loving&quot;, but who was to be feared and unequivocally listened to, and where his brother - who the king didn&#39;t get along with, and, while the king stayed on the home planet, was the one who went to Earth and did the foot work to actually create the humans and who ended up actually <em>liking</em> them and wanted to help them evolve as much as possible - was portrayed as evil, always to be mistrusted, and always to be stayed away from.  The king wanted to keep the humans servile, and the brother didn&#39;t mind them developing more.</p>

<p>This here, in a <em>super</em> fast nutshell, is a big portion of Sitchin&#39;s translation of the &quot;Lost Book&quot; Sumerian clay tablets.  When I read this, I was a bit floored because - even though Sitchin himself makes NO outright mention of the following - what&#39;s essentially being said is that the Christian Bible is an indoctrination manual written by a king from another planet for a slave race that he had his brother go to Earth and create so that the slaves could mine for gold…and the book was specifically designed to keep the slaves absolutely servile and in check.</p>

<p><strong>O_o</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, the king not only couldn&#39;t care less about the slave race, but 1) he and his brother <em>really</em> didn&#39;t get along, and 2) his brother actually <em>liked</em> this genetically-created slave race - especially since it was <em>him</em> and not his brother the king that went to Earth and did the actual foot work to create the slaves themselves.  Didn&#39;t matter though.  The king, being the king, had the final say, so he was the one who wrote the book/indoctrination manual.  In that manual, he made himself out to be the good guy - &quot;god&quot;, even though he was in actuality the <em>asshole</em> in all of this - and made his brother out to be the evil bad guy (the devil) to be absolutely stayed away from - even though it was the brother that actually <em>liked</em> the slaves and wanted to see them get more knowledge and do better.</p>

<p>Are you seeing where this interpretation is going with this?</p>

<p>It literally COMPLETELY flips the script with regard to the Christian Bible and makes up=down, right=left, black=white, and good=evil.  Remember now, this isn&#39;t <em>me</em> talking or saying any of this.  This is the interpretation that Sitchin&#39;s work necessarily leads to.</p>

<p>Okay, now…Regarding the information from the link I initially included, the author is, in his own way, essentially saying a <em>very</em>, very similar thing in that the evil that is happening on this planet is a result of a race of beings known as &quot;The Light Givers&quot; -  who come from Venus, AKA <em>The Morning Star</em>/the Luciferian Principle - and these beings, even though they are seen as utterly evil and negative, are (like the king&#39;s brother) actually interested in doing nothing but providing the humans on this planet with an understanding and an awareness of &quot;the knowledge of good and evil&quot;…AKA they&#39;re interested in giving humans the same fruit (of that knowledge) that the devil in the Christian Bible (also known as the king&#39;s brother - the one that actually <em>liked</em> humans - in Sitchin&#39;s translation of the Sumerian clay tablets) offers Adam so that Adam can develop and learn more…something that the god of the Christian Bible (AKA the king who wanted the slaves to remain slaves) did NOT at all want.</p>

<p>Both Sitchin&#39;s work and the HH document are basically presenting Lucifer as THE GOOD GUY and &quot;God&quot; - i.e. the being who&#39;s idea it was to create humans in the first place (aka the king) - as either the &quot;bad&quot; guy (in the case of Sitchin&#39;s work), or a bit of a selfish, low-level, over-protective guardian god that doesn&#39;t want its creation to become independent of it (as is the case in the link I provided).</p>

<p>The way that each work goes about arriving at these conclusions is something really so ultimately unrelated to one another in their respective approaches that it seems extremely unlikely that one work is at all related to or referencing the other.  Sitchin was at least NOT influenced by Hidden Hand&#39;s work, as Sitchin died long before HH&#39;s work was even posted on the net.  HH&#39;s work, again, seems so distant from Sitchin&#39;s in its style, writing, and thought process that it seems very difficult to make a case that one influenced the other.</p>

<p>Additionally, one must remember that the conclusions that I drew here regarding what it all actually means are actually MY conclusions alone.  Neither author actually out and out <em>says</em> the very things I&#39;m saying here.  Neither come to the &quot;therefore&quot; conclusion that their works necessarily lead to in relation to the Christian Bible.  <em>I</em> am the one that came to those conclusions regarding their works - not either of the two authors themselves.  This further shows the unlikelihood that they referenced one another.</p>

<p>The flipping of the Christian Bible paradigm here, as well as the manner that both of these very unrelated works are in their own, separate and individual ways, saying the same core things, absolutely does <a href="http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mind_blown.gif">this</a> to me.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I already thoroughly responded to this very question - as it was actually asked by another poster beforehand.  Read through <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7idtl6">this</a> please.  It&#39;s not short, and you will have to use some brain energy and critical reasoning skills in order to understand it, but it gives, again, a very thorough and very vivid reason and understanding behind why simply telling someone something is greatly insufficient if you want them to learn, grow, and move forward.</p>

<p>All the same and that being said, I would agree with you.  You <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> trust them.  However, you shouldn&#39;t actually trust too many things in this life really.  Don&#39;t &quot;trust&quot;.  What you should do, instead, is think critically and discern responsibly every situation you come across so that you can make an intelligent assessment or choice about what to do and how to act regarding your life and the choices you have in front of you.</p>

<p>Peace,</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It teaches one how to strive toward a type of good that goes <em>beyond</em> the personal, self-interested ego-identity.  You see, the ego-identity is the one that is tied with the limited, physical self/identity.  The closer you get to understanding existence <em>outside</em> and independent of this limited, physical body-self, the closer you get to understanding the integral connection that ALL beings have with one another <em>as</em> one.  The only way you can understand the <em>true</em> identity of your smaller, physical self (i.e. how limited it really and truly is 3rd dimensionally, but how eternal and connected it is to everything else on a cosmic level) is by relinquishing it - letting it go - and realizing that there is an animating identity that is greater still than the one you are attached to here on this planet and think is &quot;the real you&quot; when you look in the mirror.  That little identity is tied with (and <em>as</em>) a Greater Identity that many/all other identities are also one with.  You directly access that Greater Self only by relinquishing the attachment to the smaller, ego self.</p>

<p>Servicing others is a way that allows one to slowly but surely (sometimes faster for others) understand that the person you are helping is, in fact, just as much a part of your own Greater Self as you yourself are.  In that way, when you are helping others, you are, in fact, helping your own Greater Identity.  The point in servicing others, therefore, is to get you CLOSER to an understanding of your true identity not as the smaller, physical self, but as that Greater Self that makes up the little thing you call &quot;the physical you&quot;.  Among other things, it helps acclimate you to the understanding that we are all tiny individual sparks coming from the ONE GREAT FIRE.</p>

<p>Be that great fire, in other words, not just the individual spark that came out of it.  You can only be that ONE GREAT FIRE, however, when you stop thinking that all you are is that tiny, individual spark - that ephemeral spark known as an individual identity that occasionally flies off that Great Fire and, for a fleeting fraction of a cosmic spell, twirls around for a few years, and then fizzles out into darkness as the True Fire from which that little identity came continues to rage on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why don&#39;t they just tell us this stuff instead of killing us to send a message?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Various reasons.  First of all, it can be said that if they merely told us, we wouldn&#39;t learn the lesson as well - if at all.  You can&#39;t, for example, teach someone how to ride a bike by just TELLING them how to do it.  The person has to actually physically GET ON THE BIKE and EXPERIENCE the activity.  They&#39;ll fall and make mistakes - get hurt and scrape their knees and elbows.  Eventually, they&#39;ll get it and finally figure it out though.</p>

<p>It was only in actually DOING it that they finally got it, however...not in someone merely telling them.</p>

<p>You can only tell someone so much about proper penmanship or writing skills, as another example.  If the person is to learn how to actually write, then they have to pick up the writing utensil and DO IT themselves.  They won&#39;t get it or understand it by just you telling them how to do it.</p>

<p>Telling someone something by itself is often not nearly enough to impart a particular lesson.  The person in question has to actually EXPERIENCE the lesson - from the inside out often - in order to really get it and learn from it.  Lots of times, the lessons get learned only at the cost of lots of pain and discomfort, but the lesson might not be properly learned - if learned at all - otherwise.</p>

<p>And what is the lesson that it&#39;s said these Venusians came here to impart?  That evil and good are BOTH nothing that one should ever, ever get attached to.</p>

<p>Merely telling us this and expecting us to understand or &quot;get&quot; it, however, is nothing.  It won&#39;t stick.  It won&#39;t sink in.  We learn this lesson by experiencing the vicissitudes of both evil and good over, and over, and over again...lifetime after lifetime after lifetime..and <em>then</em> we finally start getting it.  <em>Then</em> we finally start understanding the trappings of fame or luxury or money or this or that, etc, etc . . . Most people cannot understand the problems with doing or not doing a thing until and unless they themselves DO or don&#39;t do the thing and experience the failings and the pain and the suffering and the hurt that such a thing causes in them and in others...</p>

<p>It is also through direct experience that we come to learn about the benefits associated with working and concentrating toward helping others, etc.</p>

<p>Part of how these beings show us just how bad things are is by PRESENTING US <em>WITH</em> THAT BAD.  &quot;Tough love&quot; kind of thing, perhaps.  This, I imagine, is one reason why they often &quot;kill us to send a message&quot;.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m not advocating with this understanding that we accept with open arms the whips of our oppressors.  No.  Fight away if that is what we&#39;re going to do.  Fight hard.  Fight strong.  However, also realize that the True Self is beyond all the fighting and the hate and the bickering we do here on this plane...so fight without attachment to the trials and tribulations of this tiny Earthly enclave.</p>

<p>&quot;It never stops...</p>

<p>If you hear about a supposed lone-gunman shooting that takes place in Happy Valley, Oregon, at a mall located on Sunnyside Road, and you don&#39;t immediately know that it&#39;s a psy-op/public ritual, then you should really take a look at my book.</p>

<p>The small community of Clackamas (in Happy Valley) where the December 11th shooting occurred takes its name from an Indian tribe that used to live in that area--but that&#39;s beside the point.  Why Clackamas? It&#39;s almost Christmas:  Christ-mas, Clacka-mas ... and &quot;clacka&quot; is slang for, you gotta love it, ass (or anus, depending on who you ask).&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder what he&#39;s going to have to say about my &quot;Sandy Hook&quot; theory?</p>

<p>Clackamas, Sandy Hook, one shooting occurring the <em>11th</em> and one occurring <em>11</em> days before this supposed event...this is almost too much...</p>

There&#39;s a <a href="http://themostdangerousbookintheworld.com/index.php/blogging/item/20-the-lost-chapter%E2%80%94you-have-been-warned">&quot;lost chapter&quot;</a> on his website talking about...<em>a sacrifice of children by fire that occurred on Christmas day in Connecticut.</em></p>

<p>Specifically, 3 girls who died in a house fire last year...one year before Black Christmas?</p>

<p>And now another sacrifice of children in Connecticut?</p>

<p>Edit: HOLY SHIT. I&#39;m not sure if anyone is even still reading this post, what with everything that&#39;s gone down today, but <a href="http://shenandoahshes.sharpschool.net/home">take a look at the website for the Sandy Hook Elementary school in Virginia!</a></p>

<p>I can&#39;t seem to find a website for Sandy Hook in CT, but I&#39;m assuming the name means they are connected somehow.</p>

<p>LOOK AT THAT FUCKING MASCOT. A goat with horns. You&#39;ve got to be kidding. If this is the same mascot as the CT Sandy Hook then that&#39;s the final nail in the coffin as far as I&#39;m concerned. </p>

<p>i haven&#39;t done much research in Numerology but you can find it pretty much at every big &quot;illuminati&quot; event.</p>

<p>Like you said already,People must understand that the Elite believes stongly in Symbolism,Numerology and the Occult Knowledge.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if its true or not, but did you hear about that Aleister Crowley is related with the Bush Family?</p>

<p>One thing I forgot to mention is the following:</p>

<p>3/11/11 (Japanese tsunami/earthquake event, possibly deliberately caused)</p>

<p>12/22/12.</p>

<p>That puts us <em>right</em> in the ballpark for the fake &quot;Mayan end times&quot;/possible false flag.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you or I believe in numerology, astrology, magick, etc...<em>they</em> believe in it.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve heard the Crowley/Bush rumor...supposedly in some sex ritual he impregnated Bush&#39;s grandma (mm sexy). However, Bush&#39;s grandmother was fucking lots of dudes, including in that ritual, so who knows what happened.</p>

<p>9 / 11</p>

<p>PROOF!</p>

<p>This is basically what you&#39;ve done.  In fact, it&#39;s basically what you&#39;ve done IN THIS ENTIRE THREAD.  It&#39;s so ridiculously easy to manipulate numbers into a direction that proves a ridiculous numerological theory, that, surprise, douchebags have been making money off people who believe this stuff for as long as douchebags who believe this stuff have existed!</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but the self-congratulatory nature, the certainty, it&#39;s all too much.  You live in a world too complicated to understand, and you&#39;ve made yourself feel better by drawing ridiculous patterns in the sand.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d bet a hundred dollars that when this attack doesn&#39;t happen, you won&#39;t be even the slightest bit convinced that your numerology is any less true, because as has been said of every false flag predicted on r/conspiracy ever, &quot;ALL IT PROVES IS THAT WE PREVENTED THE EVENT BY TALKING ON THE INTERNET!!!11!&quot;</p>

<p>Events can either happen, or they can not happen; if both states result in the prediction being counted as &quot;not false&quot;, then why would you bother making the prediction in the first place?  When this one - like all the others - DOESN&#39;T happen, and you refuse to accept that it&#39;s because you&#39;re full of nonsense, I&#39;ll point to this post.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll check back with you in 10 days, so I can ask how you feel.  Because, heads up, this is nothing but confirmation bias.</p>

<p>I agree that the book was a little overbearing at times when it comes to the negative aspect of it all. An excellent 3-star review on Amazon sums up this point nicely, which the author himself was good enough to reply to. The discussion is worth reading, as the reviewer seems to agree with you, and the author&#39;s 2 cents are interesting as well.</p>

<p>Frankly, I was more taken with the revelations of the 9/11 ritual than the predictions about Phoenix, but the escalation of violent events lately <em>does</em> have me concerned that we are gearing up for <em>something</em>.</p>

Which now days is very difficult considering how unstable people are financially, morally, and ethically. I am not bashing the book and for all intents and purposes it works perfectly on the technical information side.

<p>And, <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98">this video</a></strong> sums up a lot of different independently verifiable facts about 9/11....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got downvoted but I believe you are spot on.</p>

<p>Let me quote from the book:</p>

<p>&quot;Given the scope and scale of the Global MegaRitual and the mind-numbing level of planning that obviously went into scripting the occult aspects of the event, it is of far more than passing interest to note that, in the thirty years prior to 9/11, 9-1-1 had become the universal code in the United States for &#39;emergency&#39;.</p>

<p>In light of all else that has been revealed, and the supreme importance of numbers in this megaritual, it strains credibility to suggest that this is mere coincidence. Other than being an &#39;engineered synchronicity&#39; designed to make people do a double-take and scratch their heads before falling back into media-induced trance, though, what would the purpose be? One might suppose that the intended meaning or message is that 9/11 was a gigantic 9-1-1, an emergency of global proportions, which it was intended to be perceived as.</p>

<p>However, this would be the conscious message--the intended subconscious message was one designed to inflict further psychic and emotional injury on the public, and was thus the true motivation behind this aspect of 9/11. The sudden reversal of meaning, which is a key tactic of occultists, was designed to induce psychic stress and mental anguish, to create additional inner conflict and fear.</p>

<p>9/11, then, was a weapon used to inflict further trauma on an unsuspecting public. By pre-programming the public consciousness for decades with the formulation that 911=help, a form of subconscious injury was inflicted through the abrupt reversal of 911=terror.&quot;</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m starting to think more and more that Sandy Hook <em>was</em> their Christmas spectacle that S.K. Bain was predicting. He had the event wrong but the right idea in investigating shootings.</p>

<p>After all, what with this supposed obsession with the number 11, Sandy Hook was <em>11</em> days before Christmas, the date the author felt something would occur.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s wrong about August 5th, then no one will die, but I think, sadly, that we&#39;re in store for some more bullshit false flags/psyops/whatever in 2013.</p>

The largest hole here is the alleged ability to crash an airplane into a specific floor of a ridiculously tall building.  Regardless of who or what was flying it.  I&#39;m not a pilot but I&#39;m not buying it.  The floors don&#39;t have numbers on the outside of the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Martha Rose published an article on the Occult Significance of 911. <a href="http://www.martharosecrow.com/The_Occult_Significance_of_September_11th.pdf">http://www.martharosecrow.com/The_Occult_Significance_of_September_11th.pdf</a>  -- Please see the list at the link. 911 being the Occult Egyptian New Year has been a day to plunder or start new ventures by occultists, masons, Kabbalist-zionists and sorcerers/witches for the last 2000 years. Here are a few:</p>

<p>911 1941 Groundbreaking of the Pentagon
911 1973 Salvador Allende murdered in a Chilean coup d&#39;etat by (Kissinger/CIA) US, installed Pinochet as ruler.
911 1997 Securacom, Marvin Bush-Wirt Walker III company goes public, become Stratesec (security of WTC).
911 1991 George H.W. Bush announces New World Order &amp; (Satanic ritual) 1000 points of light at an address to Congress. Time was 9:09pm.
911 2001 Son GW Bush &amp; Luciferian CABAL executed Twin Tower (under illusion of &quot;fake planes&quot;) demolition to expose Isis, to usher in the Antichrist &amp; spirit guides, along with massive insurance fraud. 4 years in the making. Princess Diana&#39;s ritualistic murder was the kickoff which lead up to the 911 demolitions for massive insurance fraud and to usher in the New World Order, along with the Antichrist..</p>

<p>I was happy to see the publication of SK Bain&#39;s book, 911 as a Mass Ritual. I haven&#39;t read it (only read the reviews), but I have been done much research on the occult rituals 911 &amp; occult references since 2007. I have been trying to expose the 911 Mega Ritual for the last 6 years.  </p>

<p>One more event of 911 of which you are probably not be aware: 2011, Sportvision debuted its latest endeavor, the virtual graphics system LifeLine. Sportvision &amp; ESPN bought PVI in December, 2010. PVI Virtual Media Services, Lawrenceville, NJ, is the virtual graphics system, LVIS, used on 911 to generate the virtual plane animation aired as the ALLEGED plane that was staged to hit the WTC tower. It was a graphic animation, not a plane. PVI LVIS computer was used by the 911 CABAL, to create the plane illusion mixed with program video at CBS control room. It was a PVI virtual graphic animation, generated from CBS &quot;Early Show&quot; control room. CBS bought the LVIS computer in 1999. It made NY Times news when CBS covered the NBC logo in Times Square for Dan Rather&#39;s CBS Millennium news broadcast. CBS broadcast from the GM building on 5th Ave &amp; 59th St., NYC during a few years before and after 911 2001. CBS This Morning moved back to 524 W. 57th St for its broadcast a few years ago.</p>

<p>CBS generated the 911 plane graphic animation. All the other networks &amp; stations took the feed from CBS&#39;s line. That is how they all network/companies got the same video pictures. The background video colors were different from feed to feed. I suspect each changed its  background color for identification of each companies&#39; signal. NYC news media are all involved in the 911 mega ritual and treason. I assume they are all part of the Luciferian Cabal. We know TV members of CFR are Illuminati. I won&#39;t name them. but I assume most people already know who the players are. These members of the CABAL staged the diabolical lies &amp; treason of 911. The illusion of planes was to mask the plan of massive insurance fraud: real estate fraud by Silverstein, so far Larry has collected $4.091 billion. Silverstein Group sought $12 billion but amount was capped by NYC judge. It was totally apparent to everyone that there is something very shady about Larry Silverstein. He is a Zionist, part of the Zionist CABAL. It never seized to amaze me that no one investigated the irony of the Towers being imploded 6 weeks after Larry but down $616 million for the WTC lease. I believe Larry got the money from the $2.3 trillion Donald Rumsfeld stole from the Pentagon Budget. Now, Silverstein is trying to sue UA &amp; AA for letting [non-existent] terrorists board non-existent planes. Death hoax fraud of $6 billion. (No one died, the towers were gutted &amp; prepped for planned demolition on 911.) $900 million stolen from the WTC basement vaults. $100 million in artwork (evacuated but) claimed as losses and an estimated $15 billion from put options (insider trading) on UA &amp; AA stock. </p>

<p>The plane flight numbers of the fake flights on 911 were chosen for the masonic/occultist reference. I learned from you 175 is &quot;On uniting oneself to a Deity.&quot; In my research I learned that 175 represents the Merovingian Dynasty, descendants of Bestia Neptunis. Reference to it is on Lawrence Gardner&#39;s page 175 in his publication of &quot;The Nephilim.&quot; </p>

Fake Flight 93 on 911 was the signal to all the witches involved that the morning of rituals was OVER. It was the signoff signal. Witches were assigned to gather in downtown Manhattan on 911 01 to chant for demonic power as the ritual commenced &amp; continued. George W. Bush initiated the day of rituals in the Florida classroom with the teacher &amp; children chanting before they read the book &quot;The Pet Goat.&quot; Reading the book summoned George Bush&#39;s grandfather, Aleister Crowley. Picking up &amp; putting down their books forced the children to bow. The teacher lead the ritual. She used her pen as a wand when she tapped it with their cadence.</p>

<p>I found your post while I was searching for a post that I made about 11, 77, 175 &amp; 93. I have much information which I am not sure you know. Did you know that Ann Cappelletti and Barbara Bush are illegitimate witch daughters of Aleister Crowley &amp; 1/2 sisters? Ann &amp; Barb were conceived with sex magick with their mothers and Crowley in his attempt to procreate the antichrist. Ann&#39;s mother was one of many 20 year old Sicilian girls lured to Abbey of Thelema, Cefalu, Sicilty to have sex magick w Crowley to sire the antichrist in 1923. </p>

<p>Crowley was deported from Italy by Mussolini at the end of 1923 because of his sordid/decadent activities at Thelema. Crowley went to Paris to stay with his benefactor, Frank Harris. Pauline Pierce, a 6th degree OTO, was staying with Frank &amp; his girlfriend,Nell. Pauline (and Nell) became Crowley&#39;s sex assistants in his sex stage act of Eroto Comatose Lucidity. Pregnant Pauline returned the U.S. at the end of October 1924. Barbara was born June 1925. Ann&#39;s mother sailed with her--after she was born--to the Strega witch community of So. Philadelphia, where Ann was raised learning witch rituals. Being Crowley&#39;s daughter was an asset there. </p>

<p>I learned all of this in 2007 when I had 4 hoodoo &amp; Voodoo curses taken from me over the course of a year. In 1987. a woman in NYC took away from me a buckeye/chestnut in a tomato. She told me that I was clear. But, I wasn&#39;t. It took me another 20 years to find another special woman who took away 4 more curses: hoodoo-john the conquerer root, John&#39;s personal curse on me that no one would ever love me; hoodoo-licorice root, that I would treat Witch Ann with respect, a decayed human molar from my niece. Ann paid my niece to put the tooth curse on me to ruin my teeth, and finally a thumb bone of a pirate bought in the Voodoo district of New Orleans in 1971, when we were all in New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl. </p>

<p>John Cappelletti was my college BF at Penn State from 1970 until 1977. (I have other stories about what Ann did to Joe Paterno &amp; Jerry Sandusky). In 1972 John demanded that I stay with his mother at their family home in Upper Darby, PA. I had no idea people were practicing witchcraft or sorcery. I certainly had no idea John was a witch. Had they only told me I would have made sure the world knew they were sorcerers long ago. It took me 15 years to learn Ann, John &amp; Joyce Cappelletti were witches and that they put 4 hexes on me in 1972. Ann put an effigy of me on her mojo car crash track and made 2 cars crash into each other on a toy Road Race track. (I have heard Witch Ann sold the same curse to QEII. Ann purchased one of Diana&#39;s dresses from her charity tour/auction.) I tell you this because I have learned the Cappellettis put curses on many, many people to steal their lives. Joey was a sacrifice. I will tell you what they did to me another time. This post is to wake up people as to what is going on in this country--especially in the White House. Barry is an occultist, as many are in the U.S. govt.</p>

<p>George Bush&#39;s cousins, John &amp; Mike Cappelletti&#39;s demolition company gutted, prepped &amp; planted the thermate for the 911 demoltions. Arnon Milchan, Hollywood producer, procured the design of the thermate from an Israeli lab, 11 master occultists, masons, Kabbalist-zionists &amp; witches were each in his/her assigned place s by Strategic Communication Laboratories, London, on 911 for the MEGA RITUAL: Bush, Cheney, Tenet, Bush&#39;s sorcerer aunt-Ann Cappelletti, Bill Gates, Giuliani, Condi Rice, Schwarzenegger, Silverstein, Soros &amp; Saddam Hussein, not dead, 33 degree mason, pal of GHWB, self-proclaimed Nebuchadnezzer II, who knows the ancient Sumerian recipes &amp; rituals to transmute gold into antigravity materials for space travel &amp; DNA replenishing elixir, Orme.</p>

<p>Yes, the towers were built to be blown up as a ritual. Ann &amp; Barb got together in 1970s to set the masonic plan to usher in the antichrist into action. Crowley followers are all involved in the 911 Mega Ritual. It is time to demand justice for what these slime bags have done to our country. And, if anyone feels any of the aforementioned slime has done something to you. GET HELP.</p>

<p>Did anything happen this past Christmas in Phoenix?

<p>I think Crowley would&#39;ve been <em>thrilled</em> with the event, and he would&#39;ve noticed every occult numerical reference, including those that were an homage to him. If it was possible to inflate his ego anymore, 9/11 would&#39;ve done so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! Excellent work.</p>

<p>I was finding significance in all the numbers you mentioned besides this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;George W. Bush was reading &quot;The Pet Goat&quot; in Sarasota, Florida, strangely enough just 10 miles away from Venice, the location of the flight school Mohamed Atta and another &quot;hijacker&quot; trained at.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I checked it out myself, and was very surprised to find further occult meaning behind this mega-ritual that is being executed.  Look here for the exact distance (I tried to be as exacting as possible, right on the elementary school where G.W.Bush was reading and the flight school building right by the runway: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BbJGs.png">http://i.imgur.com/BbJGs.png</a>)</p>

<p>We can see it is closer to <em>twice</em> the number of miles you estimated, but not only that, but it&#39;s 19.78 miles.  It was on September 25th <em>1978</em> that flight <em>182</em> crashed over Sand Diego, California making it the deadliest plane crash to date killing <em>144</em> people!  These occultists work outside of space and time, if you&#39;ve read further than the required Crowley and have peeked in &quot;Outside the Circles of Time&quot; by Kenneth Grant, you may begin to realize how deep the conspiracy really goes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you actually read any Crowley, but your writing is very reminiscent of one of my favorite chapters from Book 4 -- &quot;<a href="http://www.luckymojo.com/esoteric/occultism/magic/ceremonial/crowley/004bfint.txt">AN INTERLUDE</a>&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting work on the number 77. The numbers 7 and 11 (7 x 11 = 77) seem to be closely related to the pentagon, the phi ratio, and the Fibonacci sequence.</p>

<p>Reducing the Fibonacci sequence, modulo 9, yields a repeating sequence of 24 numbers:</p>

<p>1  1  2  (3)  5  8  4  (3)  7  1  8  (9)<br/>
8  8  7  (6)  4  1  5  (6)  2  8  1  (9)</p>

<p>Summing and reducing (mod 9) the first 3 numbers in each group of 4 numbers (for example, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4) yields a compressed sequence of 12 numbers:</p>

<p>4  (3)  8  (3)  7  (9)<br/>
5  (6)  1  (6)  2  (9)</p>

<p>Summing each pair of numbers yields an alternating pattern of 7 and 11:</p>

<p>4 + 3 = 7<br/>
8 + 3 = 11<br/>
7 + 9 = 18 mod 9 = 7<br/>
5 + 6 = 11<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t really matter to me. People who are interested in this topic and drawn to this sort of information will read it. </p>

<p>Besides, I&#39;m essentially summarizing an entire book here, I couldn&#39;t do it justice without a lengthy examination of the information provided (even then I only really just touched on it).</p>

<p>For anyone who&#39;s interested in studying <em>all</em> aspects of 9/11, I believe the points I&#39;ve outlined here are <em>crucial</em> to a more complete understanding of what occurred that day.</p>

<p>Even if only a few people read this I&#39;ll be grateful, I&#39;m honestly more glad to get it all off my chest, if you know what I mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, it was a good read, but you stretched really far with a lot if information I&#39;m not even willing to check up on, and this would take more people to keep a secret than could keep a secret, so many people would have to be involved someone would eventually leak info, remember the old adage &quot; three can keep a secret if two are dead&quot; yeah it&#39;s kind if like that. </p>
