    <div class="md"><p>The question is a logical fallacy, this is an appeal to intelligence &quot;blatantly obvious&quot;, and an appeal to truth. The way you phrased it makes it seem like if someone doesn&#39;t believe something that is posted here they are simply in denial of a blatantly obvious truth. You leave no option for individuals who are not convinced by the evidence presented but are willing to review further evidence. This is the very definition of dogmatic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, the fallacy is that you assume there are any truths that people aren&#39;t admitting. It is called a false dichotomy when you reduce a vast variety of choices to only two. In this case the people have the choice to admit the truth or deny it. You leave no option that perhaps the truth isn&#39;t true at all or perhaps that one is neither confirming nor denying a truth but instead delaying judgement.</p>

<p>So your question is what some would call loaded. Perhaps a better way to have phrased it may have been <em>In your opinion, what are some apparent truths that people fail to admit?</em> 
By declaring it an opinion instead of a blatant truth you leave the option open that it really isn&#39;t a truth at all. There is also freedom for the individual to remain unconvinced of an opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I didn&#39;t realize my word was all powerful. Because I used the word blatant other people can&#39;t have an opinion.

<li><p>education standards in America have been deliberately dumbed down</p></li>
<li><p>Jews are the ruling class of the Western world</p></li>
<li><p>blacks commit a far greater proportion of violent crime than whites, per capita</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: so why is this topic at zero? I can see why I was downvoted ... I&#39;m saying things many people don&#39;t want to hear. But this topic as a whole? Does it threaten some group in some way? I don&#39;t get the down vote for the entire topic.</p>

<p>I believe here you are overestimating the genetic differences between human beings. Race is but the mutation of a handful of genes which have nothing to do with intelligence. There is little variation between humans, the variation responsible for the different skin tone and physical features of an black person account for less than .01% of our DNA.</p>

<p>If you were to study biology you would realize that the common ancestors of all humans were black.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would appreciate the link to the studies in question, as I am a lab technologist in at a genomics laboratory and I have never seen any sort of literature that would suggest that any race is more or less intelligent than any other. I could be wrong, but a quick search of pubmed resulted in 0 articles pertaining to what you have said.</p>

<p>So the fewer guns, the more crime? This suggests that gun crime would reach its maximum level in a country with zero guns. Brilliant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>97% of scientists know global warming is mad made. There is clear evidence for it.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen fox news, not many jews anywhere in media actually.</p>

<p>Wow. Blacks less intelligent then whites? Considering that there is practically no genetic difference between blacks and whites. The only reason you think that is because of discrimination and poor education of where they live.</p>

<p>Jews are more intelligent then whites? Pretty sure you can be black and a jew. When you drop your Jewish faith, does your intelligence drop to? It&#39;s a religion.</p>

<p>The holocaust is a myth? So was 9/11, and Bill Clinton&#39;s presidency. I&#39;d like you to prove that one.</p>

<p>Why would widespread gun ownership result in less crime. Clearly no thought at all behind this one.</p>

<p>Jews aren&#39;t a class. I don&#39;t know what you mean by this.</p>

<p>Blacks commit more crimes because we aren&#39;t getting proper education to them. In some neighborhoods are so poor they can&#39;t afford school. You don&#39;t see millionaire blacks shooting people for no reason do you dumb ass. </p>
