<p>Stop looking at it from your shoes. There are people who can justify killing 500,000 Iraqi kids and go to sleep in peace at night. YOU are not them.  18+ kids cost NOTHING to these people when it comes to gun control.  These black-op-like events cost pennies for them in order to reap the huge leverage they will get when they disarm you.  US govt kills kids all the time. You have to go to liveleak or some place that doesnt have a grip around its neck to filter out what US wars look like.</p>

<p>The goal is not &quot;take away our guns&quot;, and it never was. We can keep our guns, they don&#39;t really care. Our guns make us feel powerful, but we can&#39;t actually defend ourselves against their tyranny...</p>

<p>The goal is <strong>greater militarization of the civilian police force.</strong> This has a two main purposes: 1. greater direct control in the form of the actual force, and 2: the psychological effects of such on the general public.</p>

<p>This is about control, but not about &quot;gun&quot; control. Like I said, your AR-15 and my shotgun and pistol are no match for the toys the US military has. </p>

<p>Why is it that in middle eastern countries, where everyone seems to have an AK, they still make IEDs? Yep. Because your gun is meaningless anymore, in regard to fascist occupation.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t, sorry.</p>

<p>My opinions are heavily influenced by the work of P. Bourdieu, a french sociologist and activist. His main set of arguments had to do with the <em>symbolic meaning of symbols</em>, and more importantly, <em>how the powerful get us to accept their symbolic meanings, and how that controls us</em>. </p>

<p>If you want to get facerolled, read Language and Symbolic Power. It is really heady and thick, but you can do it. The wiki page on Bourdieu is good, but it does not really get into the nitty-gritty. You could also try reading the shorter and easier to find/cheaper &quot;Acts of Resistance Against the Tyranny of the Market&quot;, also Bourdieu, wherein the &quot;market&quot; is question is the &quot;market of ideas, memes, symbolic meanings&quot;. Again, his argument is that the powerful control these symbolic markets, and achieve a domination over us that we are specifically programmed to not even comprehend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a canadian watching states it is like watching a third world country. It is crazy how warped and twisted the government is. Osama has been dead forever and they are still in iraq. Its so easy to send soldiers to war if they are constantly lining up to do so. They have millions of soldiers who don&#39;t even have a job when they get back because they have shipped all the jobs to china. I wouldn&#39;t put killing thier own children past them. They did it on September 11.</p>

<p>False Flag killing of children is the Leninist technique of creating scorn and revulsion for your enemies. The OKC bombing ended the militia movement that arose because of the S&amp;L and Farming Crisis in the 80&#39;s. Remember the most famous picture of the OKC bombing? <a href="http://www.worldsfamousphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/oklahoma-city-bombing.jpg">http://www.worldsfamousphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/oklahoma-city-bombing.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading you post made me ask myself if there is any truth to what you are saying, then we must ask who is being targeted for scorn and revulsion in this case and what I came up with is mentally ill, socially inept loaners are being targeted for revulsion.  Of course whether shooting incidence like this are engineered or not, the thing to look for is what the reaction is.  The mentally ill were some of the very first people to be targeted by the rise of European fascism in the 1930s.  I&#39;m not saying this is happening here.  It is just food for thought.</p>

The US was once one of the free-est countries, but it is gradually being turned into Euro-type shithole.

Then they will use the incidents to take guns from the population.

    <div class="md"><p>its not about taking guns it seems as I have evolved my thought, please check what redditisfacebook has said in this thread.  Everyone has guns in USA, but its no match to fight tyranny upon the US public! If you look at it objectively what USA is, its totally true.  Its a brilliant setup...I am going to be thinking about this all day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with redditisfacebook that the goal is control and that our glocks are nothing compared to their tech. However, disarming the populace is just a further step, an important step, on the road to total control. Now, if we could get organized, we could fight back perhaps. Without guns, we would stand even less of a chance than we have today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know the CIA illegally operates within the US, with fronts such as Evergreen Air which flies drugs into the US. They have no problem operating on behalf of the power structure, and have always performed for Standard Oil / the Rockefellers. Bush Senior has been involved in many shady operations during and since the time he headed the CIA.</p>

<p>It is quite reasonable to suspect that there are internal government operations intended to support deep policy, such as disarming the US in order to prevent revolution. The fact that the government allows banks such as HSBC to get away with laundering drug money shows that corruption and criminality goes deep.  CIA-brainwashed shooters is not at all far-fetched to envision, and Obama is trying to get the US entangled in UN disarming of citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the British are the original drug-pushers, and the Bushes et al have learned well their methods, or they are (junior) partners to the Brits. The Hong-kong Shanghai Bank of China is a British bank that has been around so long that it was involved in pushing opium in China. </p>

<p>We gotta wake up and fight back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The last major incidents <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444433504577651393759726660.html">saw firearms sales soar</a>, so in many respects it is counter productive to give these blanket coverage. If the government really wanted to take your guns they would make you feel safe so not have a reason to buy one in the first place.</p>

<p>The government would much rather you be armed with a gun than say, chemistry knowledge, a working wind turbine, a bicycle, or even close social ties where you have someone for mutual aid.</p>

<p>Alone, clutching your gun whilst hoarding cans of beans would make authorities perfectly happy.</p>

<p>What I can see is a further militarisation of the classroom. How about soldiers manning entrances? Barbed fences? Ubiquitous RFID tags? Facial recognition? Finger printed doorways?</p>

<p>From a PSYOPS point of view, whether deliberate or opportunistic, it perpetuates the idea of an enemy within that could be anybody. Hitler&#39;s famous quote (or that of his crony) claimed you first disarm a nation, I would suggest the first thing to do is take away the feeling of security. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is an emotional call using fudged figures.  Where did you get your source for 500K+ kids killed in Iraq by the US?  Someone told you?  You say it in a video?  You chose to just blindly believe someone on the internet you sheep.</p>

<p>the 500K number everyone is posting came from UNICEF and stops counting in 1998.  It is the estimated number of kids over the normal that have died in Iraq during UN sanctions.  (UN not US).  Now note that there was plenty of aid to Iraq during this time but it was kept for the elite around Saddam.  So you can&#39;t really blame those deaths on anyone but him.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ll notice none of the 6 downvoters have managed an actual reply to my comments instead choosing to just hide the evidence that counters their beliefs.</p>
