    <div class="md"><p>That is likely true for the criminal element. Gun control is not about guns. It is about control and money. The first thing Obama would do after a gun ban is create another multi-billion dollar government agency to regulate it. The laws that follow to ensure the ban would basically strip whatever privacy we have left. The irony is that progressives support it. Very sad.  </p>

<p>Not all alloys are the same and there are ways of changing their characteristics such as heat treating, annealing, case hardening, and design changes.</p>

<p>You might go take a look at some of the facilities that AK-47s were made at some points.  A garage machine shop would have been a major step up. Yet these firearms worked quite well considering how primitive the means of manufacturing was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s implying that you can&#39;t compare the &quot;drug war&quot; with gun trafficking, despite both being linked (gangs require guns which are then trafficked), these massacres are usually conducted with legally bought guns. </p>

<p>So strait out banning guns is nonsense but stricter gun control, like most developed countries in the world: gun license, psychiatric background tests, gun proficiency, is more than welcome. </p>

<p>As for illegal merchandise (drugs or guns), not that many people are willing to go over to their &quot;dealer&quot; for it, specially since those that are into gun trade are extremely dangerous (not your junky friend that usually sells you pot).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t make this argument something it isn&#39;t. No one is calling for a ban on guns, no one is going to take the hunting rifle you want to protect your property from bears with. Don&#39;t argue something you made up to make yourself feel big.</p>

<p>People are calling for a ban on assault rifle and large ammunition magazine sales. Do you need an Ak-47 with a 40 show magazine to protect yourself from a bear? No, you need that gun to maximize human deaths in a shooting. There are very easy ways to get most of these guns out of the market without spending much government money. Stop selling ammunition, stop new sales, encourage large scale buy back.</p>

<p>All criminally use assault rifles were originally purchased legally. Look at this shooting, the gun was his moms. Legitimate guns get stolen or sold to the black market. Stop the flow of legitimate guns and ammo and the illegitimate market will tighten. You still have a hunting rifle, shotgun or handgun to protect yourself and your property.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Australian here. I think what you said is a good idea, except with a long term plan of phasing out handguns as well. Australia has no handgun laws because they are counted as &quot;concealed weapons&quot; and that works quite well for us. You&#39;re allowed to own one but it must be registered under your name and kept in a local police station. Then you can temporarily take it out to go to the shooting club you&#39;re registered with. There is a HUGE screening process as well, and the result is that most Australians feel generally secure as long as they aren&#39;t being provocative to the wrong groups.</p>

<p>There is a complete ban on assault rifles, but you are allowed to own hunting rifles and shotguns and keep them in your house. But again, there&#39;s a lengthy screening process and they must be registered under your name and you have to have a lisence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very effective system and we generally don&#39;t have many problems with firearms.</p>

<p>The classification? Like are you just trolling or something?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An assault rifle is a select-fire (either fully automatic or burst capable) rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine. It is not to be confused with assault weapons.[1] Assault rifles are the standard service rifles in most modern armies. Assault rifles are categorized in between light machine guns, which are intended more for sustained automatic fire in a light support role, and submachine guns, which fire a pistol cartridge rather than a rifle cartridge.</p>

<p>How am I being the dick? Read your post, and read mine.</p>

<p>Honestly it seems like you just made a mistake in your rant not realizing that it&#39;s called an assault rifle for the classification of the rifle, not because you can commit assault with it.. That or you&#39;re trolling.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to bash you, or even discredit you as a whole. I took a problem with a single statement you made.</p>

<p>If people are calling for a ban on assault rifles, they want the classification of assault rifles to be banned, it really is that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that simple.  People seem to think that an AR-15  you can buy at Walmart an assault rifle.  By that definition, anything I assault someone with is an assault weapon, hence an assault rock.  I&#39;m going under the assumption that he is one of those.  Otherwise why would he talk about banning assault rifles, which are already banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See but that&#39;s just being sarcastic in a discussion that you&#39;re attempting to be serious with, which just defeats the purpose.</p>

<p><em>Clearly</em> you can assault someone with <strong>anything</strong> but that doesn&#39;t make that item an &quot;assault x item&quot; - it means you assaulted them with it.</p>

<p>When someone speaks about &quot;Assault Rifles&quot; they&#39;re either A) talking about assault rifles by classification, or B) speaking ignorantly and have no idea what an assault rifle is.</p>

<p>If they&#39;re doing A, then discuss it like that. If they&#39;re doing B, educate them instead of chiding them so everybody can win.</p>

<p>The parameters of what is an assault rifle is defined, if it fits into the category, it&#39;s an assault rifle. If it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s not. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that only drug users would buy guns.  I&#39;m saying that the entire industry built up to fight the war on drugs has failed so completely, that a person has easier access to drugs now more than ever.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a correlation / causation thing, But looking at the history of prohibition in this country, guns would become easier to get than they are now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some very real differences between gun manufacturing and illicit drug cultivation.  It isn&#39;t easy to build guns and ammo the way it is easy to grow weed, purify cocaine, or cook meth, etc. Also, nobody I&#39;ve ever heard of is addicted to guns. The demand isn&#39;t near as persistent as that for illicit drugs. I don&#39;t think a gun ban of any sort is on the horizon for a variety of reasons.

    <div class="md"><p>I see a continuing cycle of demand for guns if they were banned.  As guns are captured / confiscated, more guns would be needed.  An AK-47 was designed to be easy to make.  I keep a book as a novelty, that shows step by step how to make a silenced 9mm machine pistol with parts from Home Depot.  There are countries in South America that would have a very easy time modifying their payload on existing smuggling routes.  I don&#39;t believe a gun ban is on the horizon either, but it is the other side of the coin to all of the conversation going on.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch.  I think it would be a very bad idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt you or I could make a gun. It&#39;s not like building an iPhone. But, there are something like 300,000,000 guns in the states. That number is not possible to maintain with build at home kits. Either way, all of this is hypothetical. None of it will ever actually happen. Perhaps an easier solution than banning guns is simply banning the manufacture and sale of bullets to anyone other than cops and the military. There&#39;s no second amendment right to bullets. People will retain their right to bear arms. They can be strapped to the teeth, they just will be either not loaded or loaded with aging bullets from a previous era. But what we are talking about bears no resemblance to banning drugs. It more closely resembles banning other forms of military weaponry, which generally works pretty well. </p>

<p>They do.  They pay a shit load of money to law makers through lobbyists.  Law makers get super PAC&#39;s and tax revenue.  What real effort has been made on a federal level beyond taxing to discourage smoking?</p>

Taking your argument it would make more sense to tax gun owners than it would to tax smokers because gun owners are NOT addicted to their guns and have a choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was a smoker for 20 years, I always had a choice.  I&#39;ve had the same gun for years.  It stays safely put away in my closet with the hope that I will never need it.  My sons will have it after I&#39;m gone.  I don&#39;t see taxing guns as a large resource of revenue for the government.  And I believe we have established that they wouldn&#39;t do it for the sake of public safety.</p>

<p>IMO smoking rates are going down because smokers are dying off.  A lot of the old timers I knew started smoking in WWII.  The government allowed tobacco companies to put cigarettes in the soldier&#39;s C-rations as a means to hook them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, smokers are dying off but there are more people around to start smoking and they are not taking it up because there is a public campaign to inform children and teenagers that smoking is bad for them. This campaign is supported, in part, by taxes on cigarettes, in some states anyways.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a spring chicken myself and I remember growing up in the 60s when EVERYONE around me smoked. Somehow I never took it up but I also saw how a real effort by groups put out the word that smoking was bad and that is part of the reason people are not smoking as much. Also, one huge thing that governments DID do was to ban smoking in most public buildings which went a long way towards making smoking a pain in the butt and pushed more people to quit. I remember when I first started working in the corporate world back in the 80&#39;s and people smoked like fiends at their desks and forget about meetings! But when the bans went into effect it was great. People today don&#39;t know how good they&#39;ve got it with the bans on smoking in public buildings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you that the ban on smoking in federal and military buildings was a good move by the Feds.  Like you said though, most of the efforts have been on local and state levels.  Where I live, people can smoke in bars.  30 minutes down the road, no smoking within 25&#39; of buildings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a continuing cycle of demand for guns if they were banned.  As guns are captured / confiscated, more guns would be needed.  An AK-47 was designed to be easy to make.  I keep a book as a novelty, that shows step by step how to make a silenced 9mm machine pistol with parts from Home Depot.  There are countries in South America that would have a very easy time modifying their payload on existing smuggling routes.  I don&#39;t believe a gun ban is on the horizon either, but it is the other side of the coin to all of the conversation going on.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch.  I think it would be a very bad idea.</p>

<p>Edit:  Nobody is chemically addicted to weed either, but it&#39;s everywhere.</p>
