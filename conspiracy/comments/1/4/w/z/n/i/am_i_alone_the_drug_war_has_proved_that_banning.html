       That is likely true for the criminal element. Gun control is not about guns. It is about control and money. The first thing Obama would do after a gun ban is create another multi-billion dollar government agency to regulate it. The laws that follow to ensure the ban would basically strip whatever privacy we have left. The irony is that progressives support it. Very sad.

       The ATF is not nearly as big enough. This requires a huge new agency that will need hundreds of thousands, maybe more of government regulators. Obama can out it under the monstrosity that Bush created, Homeland Security. Obama did promise to "create" jobs after all.

       I had a discussion about this yesterday, basically if they banned guns more people would get shot trying to take the guns then are shot now. Also, the black market would simply set up shop and people would get guns which couldn't be traced. Simple.

       That doesn't answer my question though does it?  Is it possible to build guns?  Fuck ya.  Is it easy to do in a manner that isn't easily detected?  Fuck no.  Does it answer my question about where black market guns come from now?  Fuck no.

       Where do you get the materials from?  You can't just create barrels from anything.  They will explode in the shooters face that way.  Rifling also isn't exactly easy.  The supply chain is a flashing beacon.

       I would look up the specs for the metal on the designs. If you can't get the proper alloy, make the barrel thicker. IIRC, the barrel of one machine gun used by us in WWII was little more than a section of thick wall pipe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The supply chain is not going to be that much of a flashing beacon considering how many people use these materials.

       for a shotgun all you need is steel pipe or a drill press and piece of steel block. Rifling is a little harder but button rifling is not out of the question. Standardized cartridges would be the real limiter in the long run.

       How many people use these materials?  Are you comparing an unrifled gun to a professionally made semi auto or auto rifle?  You think they have anything in common or that the former would be any use to the people that currently steal guns and use them for crimes?

       Pipe that meets the specs for the rifle barrel is not actually listed as rifle barrel pipe, in fact you would probably just use round stock of a fairly common alloy.

       I doubt if ordering the bit would put me on a list in the US, and again it can be made locally.

       I said fairly common alloy and yes, it will work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all alloys are the same and there are ways of changing their characteristics such as heat treating, annealing, case hardening, and design changes.

       You might go take a look at some of the facilities that AK-47s were made at some points.  A garage machine shop would have been a major step up. Yet these firearms worked quite well considering how primitive the means of manufacturing was.

       No it isn't.  Most guns used in crime are stolen by private owners.  Most black market guns are bought from legal gun shops illegally(usually by someone buying a gun for someone else).  Go try to find a source for your claim and you won't find one but you'll find plenty of sources for mine.

       If you ban guns people will just make guns in their bath tub from ingredients at your local pharmacy. Also, there will be "gun mules" that will pack enough guns for 100 people into their ass for a plane flight smuggle.
      </p>

       Then there is the cutting of guns. They can take 10 guns, mix them with baking soda and cook them.  This will allow for 100 smaller and slightly weaker guns to be made and sold.

       He's implying that you can't compare the "drug war" with gun trafficking, despite both being linked (gangs require guns which are then trafficked), these massacres are usually conducted with legally bought guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       So strait out banning guns is nonsense but stricter gun control, like most developed countries in the world: gun license, psychiatric background tests, gun proficiency, is more than welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for illegal merchandise (drugs or guns), not that many people are willing to go over to their "dealer" for it, specially since those that are into gun trade are extremely dangerous (not your junky friend that usually sells you pot).

       So you honestly carry a sidearm with you to drop bears.  Dangerous bears.  Large blacks, or browns that require 2-3 shots to the chest with large calibre rifles to drop........ok.  Fair enough.

       .44 mag, .45 LC with a hot load, .50 Desert Eagle, etc etc will all drop a bear with decent shot placement.

       I grew up camping in Algonquin.  The rangers there needed 2-3 shots to drop most problem bears.  That is there job.  And you're going to drop one with a few rounds from your side arm?  Fuck off and stop lying to every one to try to prove some point about your need for a side arm.

       In some states, like California and New York, to buy pistols and semi-auto rifles you have to go through a long process, but you can still buy a shotgun without much problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some states you can buy a pistol at the same place you buy your beer, with no checks or waiting period.  (not even kidding)
      </p>
      <p>
       So it all depends on where you live.  Overall, the US is a really easy place to buy a gun.

       I don't need an excuse to own a firearm.  I would never trust my life to a can of bear spray.  Yes, you can and should try to scare off bears first.  You still won't find me wandering around in bear country unarmed.  That would be stupid.

       I do, I do need a gun to feel like a big man.  Until this moment, I never realized that.  Thank you so much for opening my eyes.  I thought I was being rational by taking steps to protect myself, but really I carry a gun to bolster my self esteem.  In looking back, I realize that it's because I was bullied by bears in high school.  I have to meditate on this.

       No one wants to ban all guns outright, but there is no reason for anyone to own 80% of the guns available in your country, no reason except to harm another human, allot.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Australia farmers, hunters and people who live in the bush can still get guns. Does it solve our violence issues? Hell no! Does it mean the difference between a disagreement at the pub and a full blown massacre? Yeah it does.

       Don't make this argument something it isn't. No one is calling for a ban on guns, no one is going to take the hunting rifle you want to protect your property from bears with. Don't argue something you made up to make yourself feel big.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are calling for a ban on assault rifle and large ammunition magazine sales. Do you need an Ak-47 with a 40 show magazine to protect yourself from a bear? No, you need that gun to maximize human deaths in a shooting. There are very easy ways to get most of these guns out of the market without spending much government money. Stop selling ammunition, stop new sales, encourage large scale buy back.
      </p>
      <p>
       All criminally use assault rifles were originally purchased legally. Look at this shooting, the gun was his moms. Legitimate guns get stolen or sold to the black market. Stop the flow of legitimate guns and ammo and the illegitimate market will tighten. You still have a hunting rifle, shotgun or handgun to protect yourself and your property.

       Australian here. I think what you said is a good idea, except with a long term plan of phasing out handguns as well. Australia has no handgun laws because they are counted as "concealed weapons" and that works quite well for us. You're allowed to own one but it must be registered under your name and kept in a local police station. Then you can temporarily take it out to go to the shooting club you're registered with. There is a HUGE screening process as well, and the result is that most Australians feel generally secure as long as they aren't being provocative to the wrong groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a complete ban on assault rifles, but you are allowed to own hunting rifles and shotguns and keep them in your house. But again, there's a lengthy screening process and they must be registered under your name and you have to have a lisence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a very effective system and we generally don't have many problems with firearms.

       A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  This has nothing to do with hunting, as such your hunting argument does not hold water.  You want change, amend the constitution.

       What's an assault rifle. I laid that out pretty well unless you're mildly retarded which is looking like a possibility.

       <p>
        An assault rifle is a select-fire (either fully automatic or burst capable) rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine. It is not to be confused with assault weapons.[1] Assault rifles are the standard service rifles in most modern armies. Assault rifles are categorized in between light machine guns, which are intended more for sustained automatic fire in a light support role, and submachine guns, which fire a pistol cartridge rather than a rifle cartridge.

       It's not that simple.  People seem to think that an AR-15  you can buy at Walmart an assault rifle.  By that definition, anything I assault someone with is an assault weapon, hence an assault rock.  I'm going under the assumption that he is one of those.  Otherwise why would he talk about banning assault rifles, which are already banned.

       you can assault someone with
       <strong>
        anything
       </strong>
       but that doesn't make that item an "assault x item" - it means you assaulted them with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone speaks about "Assault Rifles" they're either A) talking about assault rifles by classification, or B) speaking ignorantly and have no idea what an assault rifle is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're doing A, then discuss it like that. If they're doing B, educate them instead of chiding them so everybody can win.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parameters of what is an assault rifle is defined, if it fits into the category, it's an assault rifle. If it doesn't, it's not.

       I'm not saying that only drug users would buy guns.  I'm saying that the entire industry built up to fight the war on drugs has failed so completely, that a person has easier access to drugs now more than ever.  I don't know if it's a correlation / causation thing, But looking at the history of prohibition in this country, guns would become easier to get than they are now.

       There are some very real differences between gun manufacturing and illicit drug cultivation.  It isn't easy to build guns and ammo the way it is easy to grow weed, purify cocaine, or cook meth, etc. Also, nobody I've ever heard of is addicted to guns. The demand isn't near as persistent as that for illicit drugs. I don't think a gun ban of any sort is on the horizon for a variety of reasons. But, any comparison to drugs is a stretch at best.

       I see a continuing cycle of demand for guns if they were banned.  As guns are captured / confiscated, more guns would be needed.  An AK-47 was designed to be easy to make.  I keep a book as a novelty, that shows step by step how to make a silenced 9mm machine pistol with parts from Home Depot.  There are countries in South America that would have a very easy time modifying their payload on existing smuggling routes.  I don't believe a gun ban is on the horizon either, but it is the other side of the coin to all of the conversation going on.  I don't think it's a stretch.  I think it would be a very bad idea.

       I have no doubt you or I could make a gun. It's not like building an iPhone. But, there are something like 300,000,000 guns in the states. That number is not possible to maintain with build at home kits. Either way, all of this is hypothetical. None of it will ever actually happen. Perhaps an easier solution than banning guns is simply banning the manufacture and sale of bullets to anyone other than cops and the military. There's no second amendment right to bullets. People will retain their right to bear arms. They can be strapped to the teeth, they just will be either not loaded or loaded with aging bullets from a previous era. But what we are talking about bears no resemblance to banning drugs. It more closely resembles banning other forms of military weaponry, which generally works pretty well.

       The bullet loophole won't work any easier than a straight removal of the second amendment.

       It is not explicitly worded for guns (though this was the intention) it is specifically worded for not infringing the ability of the state or its people to defend itself from outside force.

       I've seen 3 or 4 articles about how bad lead bullets are for the environment.  I guess there is a new environmentally friendly bullet that some company is trying to push.  Making a new proprietary round would probably be the way they phased out ammo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posed it as a hypothetical.  It's true that a black market would provide less guns than there are now, but I would counter that a limited supply would ensure that guns ended up in the hands of people who needed them for their trade.  And only those who could afford them. For example, the Mexican drug cartel armies.

       There is already a black market for guns. They primarily come from unscrupulous American makers and distributors. The gun companies, not all but a few, look the other way as guns walk out the door for cash. That's why the retrictions should be put on the manufacturers and sellers. And if the company doesn't comply, it's put out of business. All these things are possible in the ideal country (not ours) and can be much more effective than the drug war.

       Because most smokers just shifted the money from somewhere else and kept smoking.  Plus, they didn't tax cigarettes out of concern for public safety.  They taxed them for money.  They want people to keep smoking.

       I didn't say taxing guns was for the public good. Though I think it would be great if taxing guns caused sales to go down. But if it didn't then it would generate a lot of money. Either way, it's win / win.

       And you really believe that people in government want people to keep smoking? Really? I'd say some cold hearted son of a bitch CEO's of a cigarette companies may want it but the rest of us want to help our fellow humans kick the habit.

       They do.  They pay a shit load of money to law makers through lobbyists.  Law makers get super PAC's and tax revenue.  What real effort has been made on a federal level beyond taxing to discourage smoking?

       As a side note:  It is legal to operate your own still for the purposes of fuel.  As long as you have a license from the ATF and add denaturents to the alcohol to prevent private consumption.  Read:  The government cares less about poisoning people than they do about collecting tax revenue.

       You have a point about politicians being bought but not everyone fighting smoking is in government and the rate smoking has gone down steadily over the years:

       Getting back to the original issue of taxing guns I'm tired of this strange concept of the poor abused gun owner, as if a tax were put on them that it would somehow hurt them to not be able to buy yet another gun. Taking your argument it would make more sense to tax gun owners than it would to tax smokers because gun owners are NOT addicted to their guns and have a choice.

       Was a smoker for 20 years, I always had a choice.  I've had the same gun for years.  It stays safely put away in my closet with the hope that I will never need it.  My sons will have it after I'm gone.  I don't see taxing guns as a large resource of revenue for the government.  And I believe we have established that they wouldn't do it for the sake of public safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO smoking rates are going down because smokers are dying off.  A lot of the old timers I knew started smoking in WWII.  The government allowed tobacco companies to put cigarettes in the soldier's C-rations as a means to hook them.

       True, smokers are dying off but there are more people around to start smoking and they are not taking it up because there is a public campaign to inform children and teenagers that smoking is bad for them. This campaign is supported, in part, by taxes on cigarettes, in some states anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a spring chicken myself and I remember growing up in the 60s when EVERYONE around me smoked. Somehow I never took it up but I also saw how a real effort by groups put out the word that smoking was bad and that is part of the reason people are not smoking as much. Also, one huge thing that governments DID do was to ban smoking in most public buildings which went a long way towards making smoking a pain in the butt and pushed more people to quit. I remember when I first started working in the corporate world back in the 80's and people smoked like fiends at their desks and forget about meetings! But when the bans went into effect it was great. People today don't know how good they've got it with the bans on smoking in public buildings.

       I'll give you that the ban on smoking in federal and military buildings was a good move by the Feds.  Like you said though, most of the efforts have been on local and state levels.  Where I live, people can smoke in bars.  30 minutes down the road, no smoking within 25' of buildings.

       Increasing taxes on guns is like teaching the black market how to swim.  Assuming TPTB are moderately intelligent, I would take an increase in taxes on guns as the surest sign that there will be no ban in the near future.

       The ATF is not nearly as big enough. This requires a huge new agency that will need hundreds of thousands, maybe more of government regulators. Obama can out it under the monstrosity that Bush created, Homeland Security. Obama did promise to "create" jobs after all.

       I see a continuing cycle of demand for guns if they were banned.  As guns are captured / confiscated, more guns would be needed.  An AK-47 was designed to be easy to make.  I keep a book as a novelty, that shows step by step how to make a silenced 9mm machine pistol with parts from Home Depot.  There are countries in South America that would have a very easy time modifying their payload on existing smuggling routes.  I don't believe a gun ban is on the horizon either, but it is the other side of the coin to all of the conversation going on.  I don't think it's a stretch.  I think it would be a very bad idea.

       There are quite a few sidearms capable of dropping bears. As with most guns, shot placement is everything.
