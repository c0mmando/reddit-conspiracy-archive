<p>And apparently the police are lying too. Or he could mistaken? Or the police could have been mistaken and let the guy go? Those are scenarios both more plausible than the few you say are the only options. So what is it? Are you actually unable to use your own judgement to assess the validity of a source?

<p>Are you saying that it&#39;s impossible for the police officer to have been mistaken? That as the events were literally unfolding it&#39;s impossible to have believed a 2nd shooter was there? Only to find out later that it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> the case?</p>

<p>What I said is that my assessment of several real and credible sources pointing to an accomplice have been airbrushed from the media narrative without any explanation. It may be these sources ultimately turn out to be red herrings, but no rebuttal has been provided for any of them.</p>

<p>Ok - pick your own word. Why are they less likely than the scenarios you&#39;ve concocted??? Quit being so lame and get to your point. But I&#39;m not being unfair - the fashion you are arguing in implies that the other scenarios are incorrect and don&#39;t apply. I don&#39;t think I misrepresented your point at all considering you are jumping to the least likely conclusions in the face of simpler explanations. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>What rebuttal would be necessary? Do they provide amounts of evidence that would somehow discount the scenario provided by the police or do they reflect two cases of people being mistaken during a violent tragedy?</p>

<p>Forgive me, but I am more worried about the media when they make up stories in the absence of known facts, report items of dubious and unreliable provenance as &quot;fact&quot;, and especially when they withhold and/or manipulate the known facts to promote a specific agenda.</p>

<p>Right - they don&#39;t have integrity. It&#39;s just that you switch them from being omnipotent to incompetent at the whim of your will. </p>
