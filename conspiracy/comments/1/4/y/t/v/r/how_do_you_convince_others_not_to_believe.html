       I try to do my part to (at least) plant a seed of doubt for our government/media to people that I have an opportunity to talk to. My question to you is this: where do you start? What is your best "proof" or connections you use to convince those that depend on mainstream media for information? I have found many of the people I talk to want to believe, but I consider my knowledge very limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time I will ask someone how many buildings fell in New York on 9/11. Everyone I have asked thus far has answered with "2" and I have went on to talk about WTC building 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side Note: I often get overwhelmed when browsing r/conspiracy. It seems that everything is so complex, and I'm convinced it's meant to be that way. I'm starting to see a big picture from all I've learned, but what is the root of all evil in your eyes?

       Actually it is a quasi-government/private institution. Essentially, a marriage of corporate banking interests and the US Treasury department.

       Who knows for sure - but fundamentally it doesn't matter. The key point is that the BBC clearly WAS told that Building 7 collapsed before the fact, which completely demolishes the official story.

       WHAT?  How is a mistaken report CLEAR PROOF that the BBC was told beforehand?  That is a giant leap of logic right there.  What makes more sense is that they got word that the building (which was on fire for hours and had no one trying to put the fire out) was going to collapse and in the process of transferring that information, it got mistakenly reported as collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just logically thinking, why would the government tell the BBC (of all places) that they should report the tower collapsed. . . . They would have reported it anyway without the government feeding them what to say.  This scenario makes no sense.

       Nobody tells the BBC what to report. The BBC was presumably given the information about the Building 7 collapse by a reliable (possibly official) source and the BBC broadcast it because it was an important story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither they nor their source realised the information was premature.

       Some things make me burn with rage, the feeling that this stuff happens and everybody in my life knows nothing or cares nothing about it. If I was to start explaining even a portion of these things to family members or friends, they couldn't process it and would shut me out or just refuse to believe.

       This type of truth seeking is a deeply personal endeavor and is very hard to convey. And, that really is the crux of it. You can't really make any one believe something, they have to make their own effort to learn it themselves. The reason the world works at all is because the vast majority of people are followers of prevailing beliefs
       <em>
        and not delvers for the truth.
       </em>
       The truth seekers slowly chip away at prevailing thoughts to uncover truth; it's a thankless job. Changing consciousness one thought, one person at a time the world over.

       The early abolitionists were such people, they stubbornly held to the conviction that owning another human being was immoral and evil and counter to basic principles. The fixed notion of a hereditary ruling class has also been whittled down from what was once the Divine Right of Kings to the present Disneyland nostalgia status it has now. And now corporate governments face the truth seekers efforts; the uncovering of bodies in the graves and the revealing of the unclothed emperor who lies even when he smiles.

       A shockingly large amount of people don't have time for hours of internet browsing, reading or discussion. They leave off for work at 7 in the morning and get back at 8 in the evening, eat supper and go to bed after a little TV. All to pay the bills, rent and hope things will get easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if a person doesn't start out with a little basis of history or a least the interest of such things; it's really unlikely they will turn over a new leaf later in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally have been reading since I was three which was long before the days of the net, but at the heart of it, interest in reading made it all possible.

       Oh absolutely.  It's pretty sad in various ways.  It's sad that there are people that far gone.  It's sad that we live on a (prison) planet that is that manipulated.

       It's sad that there is such a state of jadedness that a lot of those who are ignorant won't get helped by a lot of those who aren't.

       My parents are in their 50's and the other night my dad, (I'm 27) tells me I should try to take two weeks off from my conspiracies. Now, to give him credit he loves talking about it, and will always listen, so will my mom. It's the religion that is getting in the way. I can tell they can't take that extra step and abandon Christianity. Because we all know, you have to sort of open your mind to it at least, if not abandon it. Not to say abandon god, please dont get me wrong.

       I can't find anything to convince them, or persuade them to convince themselves. Even after turning all 6 of my brothers and sisters onto the "truth". They were all very hesitant but I proved I wasn't crazy just by continuing to post links and news stories, and talk to people. Dont be afraid to look crazy. If enough of us do it then I think people will wake up faster.
