I have found many of the people I talk to want to believe, but I consider my knowledge very limited. </p>

<p>Most of the time I will ask someone how many buildings fell in New York on 9/11. Everyone I have asked thus far has answered with &quot;2&quot; and I have went on to talk about WTC building 7. </p>

<p>Actually it is a quasi-government/private institution. Essentially, a marriage of corporate banking interests and the US Treasury department. </p>

<p>Its probably the &quot;Illuminati&quot; who is controlling Freemansonry,Secret Societys, Rothschild Zionism etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://consciouslifenews.com/library-congress-confirms-george-washington-aware-nefarious-illuminati/1122149/">George Washington himself did warn about the Illuminati</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati">The Bavarian Illuminati</a> is a fact.</p>

<p>Its more the Question if there still exist.</p>

<p>There are some Ex-Illuminati Member who are not a fake like Bill Schnoebelen, &quot;Svali&quot; (Whistleblower name)...</p>

<p>So the Illuminati exist and wants bring a New World Order.</p>

<p>Who knows for sure - but fundamentally it doesn&#39;t matter. The key point is that the BBC clearly WAS told that Building 7 collapsed before the fact, which completely demolishes the official story.</p>

<p>WHAT?  How is a mistaken report CLEAR PROOF that the BBC was told beforehand?  That is a giant leap of logic right there.  What makes more sense is that they got word that the building (which was on fire for hours and had no one trying to put the fire out) was going to collapse and in the process of transferring that information, it got mistakenly reported as collapsed.  </p>

<p>Just logically thinking, why would the government tell the BBC (of all places) that they should report the tower collapsed. . . . They would have reported it anyway without the government feeding them what to say.  This scenario makes no sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody tells the BBC what to report. The BBC was presumably given the information about the Building 7 collapse by a reliable (possibly official) source and the BBC broadcast it because it was an important story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some things make me burn with rage, the feeling that this stuff happens and everybody in my life knows nothing or cares nothing about it. If I was to start explaining even a portion of these things to family members or friends, they couldn&#39;t process it and would shut me out or just refuse to believe.</p>

<p>This type of truth seeking is a deeply personal endeavor and is very hard to convey. And, that really is the crux of it. You can&#39;t really make any one believe something, they have to make their own effort to learn it themselves. The reason the world works at all is because the vast majority of people are followers of prevailing beliefs <em>and not delvers for the truth.</em> The truth seekers slowly chip away at prevailing thoughts to uncover truth; it&#39;s a thankless job. Changing consciousness one thought, one person at a time the world over. </p>

<p>The early abolitionists were such people, they stubbornly held to the conviction that owning another human being was immoral and evil and counter to basic principles. The fixed notion of a hereditary ruling class has also been whittled down from what was once the Divine Right of Kings to the present Disneyland nostalgia status it has now. And now corporate governments face the truth seekers efforts; the uncovering of bodies in the graves and the revealing of the unclothed emperor who lies even when he smiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A shockingly large amount of people don&#39;t have time for hours of internet browsing, reading or discussion. They leave off for work at 7 in the morning and get back at 8 in the evening, eat supper and go to bed after a little TV. All to pay the bills, rent and hope things will get easier.</p>

<p>Also, if a person doesn&#39;t start out with a little basis of history or a least the interest of such things; it&#39;s really unlikely they will turn over a new leaf later in life.</p>
