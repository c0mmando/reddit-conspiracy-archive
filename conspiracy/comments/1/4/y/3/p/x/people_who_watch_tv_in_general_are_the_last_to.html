        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why do people embrace this shit? Objectively if you watch a basic popular show, why are the commercial line ups always following these themes throughout the show:</p>

<ul>
<li>snack for something unhealthy, give the message that its satisfies you as if you are eating a meal, replacing nutrition, ie snicks marketing</li>
<li>depressant drug ad - yes----------we believe you should take XYZ drug for your depression of staring at a tv screen for 4-6 hours a day, a company that understand this is maybe Eli Lily</li>
<li>car ad - the equivalent of peer pressure to update so other people dont talk shit and look down upon you in usual crab in the barrel behavior</li>
<li>video-games - zoned out people </li>
</ul>

<p>etc etc-----its usually a good mixed, but when I watch a TV show ie Simpsons I used to like when growing up, now I watch it sometimes just to see whats going on-----I see so many commercial breaks and these commercials are all for total shit. I dont want of that stuff and it seems like its for people with serious problems and mental issues to. Why would these companies be spending millions always advertising the mental issues and depressant drug ads? -----They run on all channels and for all sorts of shows! Its like a blanket. Fuck TV! The opposite of this post is someone who watches Big Bang Theory.  </p>

<p><strong>tldr; Do you think objectively its true that, if you look at the commercials for general tv shows, thats reflecting what who the viewers are? If so, many of them run commercials for you to take a pill to cure your mental illness or depression</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost 4 years ago, I called the cable company and pulled the plug.  After a month, I felt better than I had in years.  After three months, I started to really see the brainwashing...I thought I could see it before, but until I unplugged and got away from it, I didn&#39;t know just how bad it was. </p>

<p>The &quot;reflection of society&quot; that the owners of &quot;our&quot; media indoctrinate us with makes everyone miserable...so we&#39;re offered a solution: &quot;Ask your doctor if ___________ is right for you.&quot;</p>

<p>The doctor has just been visited by a beautiful rep from the pharmaceutical company, and now has cases of starter kits of the latest anti-depressant.  He&#39;ll gladly give you a few slips of the latest &quot;remedy&quot;.  </p>

<p>These won&#39;t get rid of the things that depress you.  They&#39;ll just cremate your cares, lower your IQ, and make you more subservient.  To borrow a phrase from Hicks, it&#39;s like taking a can of black spray paint to your third eye.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t addictive, mind you...but you better not stop takin&#39; em &quot;cold turkey&quot;.  The electric screw worms will eat right thru your brain.</p>

<p>So we take the pills, and we continue to suck up the lies from the owners of &quot;our&quot; media...but now we do so with shit-eatin&#39; grins on our faces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>its not entertainment!</strong> I keep trying to tell people that.  Advertisers are not paying millions to entertain these retards. The TV shows are really connected to the ads dont think they are totally separate. ITs gone as far now where the advertisement is the movie, ie Transformers. They are paying to brainwash you to go out and buy a soda or support this cause or that cause. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped watching TV almost completely, over a two years ago, and since then I have really realized how fucking awful it is. I literally cant stand to sit and watch it anymore. And its one thing if you&#39;re just by yourself and put it on for background noise or you put it on to see a show and do something during commercials, but I know people where their only pass time is watching tv. Its just depressing as shit when you go to hang out with friends and the only thing they want to do is sit and watch TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had no television now for 3 years at home. </p>

<p>I was at someones house the other day &amp; was shocked how often &#39;medical/pharmaceutical&#39; commercials were shown. In the span of an hour there were at least 7 pharma commercials. </p>

<p>Christ, I caught myself thinking &quot;do I have that?&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called &#39;television programming&#39; for a reason.</p>
