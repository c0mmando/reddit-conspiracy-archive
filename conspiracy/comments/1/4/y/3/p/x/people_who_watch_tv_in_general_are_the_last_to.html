       Why do people embrace this shit? Objectively if you watch a basic popular show, why are the commercial line ups always following these themes throughout the show:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        snack for something unhealthy, give the message that its satisfies you as if you are eating a meal, replacing nutrition, ie snicks marketing
       </li>
       <li>
        depressant drug ad - yes----------we believe you should take XYZ drug for your depression of staring at a tv screen for 4-6 hours a day, a company that understand this is maybe Eli Lily
       </li>
       <li>
        car ad - the equivalent of peer pressure to update so other people dont talk shit and look down upon you in usual crab in the barrel behavior
       </li>
       <li>
        video-games - zoned out people
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       etc etc-----its usually a good mixed, but when I watch a TV show ie Simpsons I used to like when growing up, now I watch it sometimes just to see whats going on-----I see so many commercial breaks and these commercials are all for total shit. I dont want of that stuff and it seems like its for people with serious problems and mental issues to. Why would these companies be spending millions always advertising the mental issues and depressant drug ads? -----They run on all channels and for all sorts of shows! Its like a blanket. Fuck TV! The opposite of this post is someone who watches Big Bang Theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tldr; Do you think objectively its true that, if you look at the commercials for general tv shows, thats reflecting what who the viewers are? If so, many of them run commercials for you to take a pill to cure your mental illness or depression

       Almost 4 years ago, I called the cable company and pulled the plug.  After a month, I felt better than I had in years.  After three months, I started to really see the brainwashing...I thought I could see it before, but until I unplugged and got away from it, I didn't know just how bad it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "reflection of society" that the owners of "our" media indoctrinate us with makes everyone miserable...so we're offered a solution: "Ask your doctor if ___________ is right for you."
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctor has just been visited by a beautiful rep from the pharmaceutical company, and now has cases of starter kits of the latest anti-depressant.  He'll gladly give you a few slips of the latest "remedy".
      </p>
      <p>
       These won't get rid of the things that depress you.  They'll just cremate your cares, lower your IQ, and make you more subservient.  To borrow a phrase from Hicks, it's like taking a can of black spray paint to your third eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't addictive, mind you...but you better not stop takin' em "cold turkey".  The electric screw worms will eat right thru your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we take the pills, and we continue to suck up the lies from the owners of "our" media...but now we do so with shit-eatin' grins on our faces.

        its not entertainment!
       </strong>
       I keep trying to tell people that.  Advertisers are not paying millions to entertain these retards. The TV shows are really connected to the ads dont think they are totally separate. ITs gone as far now where the advertisement is the movie, ie Transformers. They are paying to brainwash you to go out and buy a soda or support this cause or that cause.

       I don't think so, I haven't been to the doctor's in a couple years due to having to move and still not having insurance due to it's outrageous price and being someone who has to work odd jobs.

       What is "awake"? I regularly watch tv but like to think I'm more aware of the realities of what's going on than 99% of the population. No I'm not an idiot for watching what I like and tuning the rest out, but I also don't veg out and watch honey boo boo. You can watch the programs you like, it's just called self control.

       The commercials are there to put you into a passive, suggestive state; strip them out, and you can barely help but watch actively, which basically turns their weapon against them; that's why I get all my TV shows and movies from torrents. I never let them run in the background while I'm doing something else.

       This thread is stupid, of course commercials are used to sell you shit you don't need or want in an emotionally manipulative way. The guy who invented the first Public Relations Firm (and modern advertising as we know it)
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">
        Edward Bernays
       </a>
       was the guy who invented and literally wrote the book 'Propaganda'. This "revelation" is nothing new, and has been discussed in-depth for close to a century. I would suggest the documentary
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prTarrgvkjo">
        'The Century of the Self'
       </a>
       for information about how the concepts of advertisement and marketing evolved into the Leviathan they are today.

       What is "awake"? I regularly watch tv but like to think I'm more aware of the realities of what's going on than 99% of the population. No I'm not an idiot for watching what I like and tuning the rest out, but I also don't veg out and watch honey boo boo. You can watch the programs you like, it's just called self control.

       I believe that there are also a few very smart people within show business who are trying to reach those of the couch potatoes, the sheeple and the zombies who are capable of more by reverse engineering the hypnotism such that the lost causes don't "get it" and stay asleep while those who are capable of more get woken up. Sadly they are a dying breed. Check out

       I really don't understand anything about anti-TV movements.   Are you telling me that there's nothing in film or television that can exist on an artistic or intellectual level?  Are you saying that I can't enjoy and watch Game of Thrones, Homeland, Firefly, Cosmos, basketball games, documentaries, or any of the other wonderful things produced for TV and still not be able to think independently on a reasonable level?  Are you saying that I can't approach moving pictures in a critical way like I can with books, music, the Internet, or anything else?

       I stopped watching TV almost completely, over a two years ago, and since then I have really realized how fucking awful it is. I literally cant stand to sit and watch it anymore. And its one thing if you're just by yourself and put it on for background noise or you put it on to see a show and do something during commercials, but I know people where their only pass time is watching tv. Its just depressing as shit when you go to hang out with friends and the only thing they want to do is sit and watch TV.
