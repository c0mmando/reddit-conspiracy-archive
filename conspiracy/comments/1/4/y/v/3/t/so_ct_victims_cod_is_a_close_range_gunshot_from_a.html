        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>However the police found the gunman&#39;s body with two handguns.  They didn&#39;t find a rifle until much later, when they searched his car.  The news outlets have video of the police opening up the trunk and finding the rifle.</p>

<p>The dude never used it.  So how the hell does the coroner say that the victims where shot with a rifle when the gunman didn&#39;t use a rifle?</p>

<p>Conspiracy: the entire case is being mis-represented to make it look like rifles are bad, someone is trying to use this tragedy as a tool to increase anti-firearm legislation.  It doesn&#39;t help that technically there is no such thing as an &#39;assault weapon&#39;, painting a hunting rifle black doesn&#39;t make it special.  The term &#39;assault weapon&#39; is just a media buzzword, and it&#39;s ruining everything.  Technically, firearm ownership is on the rise and gun related violence is on the fall, but with the media agonizing over ever little thing it is pretty obvious that there is something going on, some political motivation in the media.</p>

<p>What sickens me is that I only noticed this glaring difference regarding the coroner&#39;s statement in a casual manner.  There are lots of people who are actively watching the news about this stuff, and I haven&#39;t seen it brought up anywhere else.</p>

<p>I posted about it in the dedicated <a href="/r/guns">/r/guns</a> thread for the CT shooting, thinking they would have some input.  No one is touching my comment with a ten foot pole STS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>21.00 (16.00) Lt Col Paul Vance, of State Police, is giving a brief update and says that a shotgun was found in Lanza&#39;s car parked outside the school. He says that the Bushmaster rifle was the primary weapon for the killing spree but that the gunman killed himself with one of his two pistols. All the weapons he took into the school had extra magazines and he was equipped with &quot;hundreds of bullets&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even the &quot;close-range&quot; stuff is inaccurate. Here is what the medical examiner said (this is from a transcript I made of his press conference: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I only did seven of the autopsies. The victims I had ranged from 3 to 11 wounds a piece, and I only saw two of them with close-range shooting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do the rest of the autopsies show close-range shooting? I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing though that the media narrative really highlights the &quot;close range&quot; part -- when, as far as we know, only 2 victims had &quot;close range&quot; wounds </p>

<p>The most recent reports state that he had all 3 weapons (2 handguns and the bushmaster) on his person, and a shotgun was found in the trunk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to bring up the amount of times these children were shot. They are saying each victim was shot between 3-11 times each.
