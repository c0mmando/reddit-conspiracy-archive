       However the police found the gunman's body with two handguns.  They didn't find a rifle until much later, when they searched his car.  The news outlets have video of the police opening up the trunk and finding the rifle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dude never used it.  So how the hell does the coroner say that the victims where shot with a rifle when the gunman didn't use a rifle?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy: the entire case is being mis-represented to make it look like rifles are bad, someone is trying to use this tragedy as a tool to increase anti-firearm legislation.  It doesn't help that technically there is no such thing as an 'assault weapon', painting a hunting rifle black doesn't make it special.  The term 'assault weapon' is just a media buzzword, and it's ruining everything.  Technically, firearm ownership is on the rise and gun related violence is on the fall, but with the media agonizing over ever little thing it is pretty obvious that there is something going on, some political motivation in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       What sickens me is that I only noticed this glaring difference regarding the coroner's statement in a casual manner.  There are lots of people who are actively watching the news about this stuff, and I haven't seen it brought up anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted about it in the dedicated
       <a href="/r/guns">
        /r/guns
       </a>
       thread for the CT shooting, thinking they would have some input.  No one is touching my comment with a ten foot pole STS.

       It didn't. Early reports erroneously stated that it was found in the trunk. Confusion and mistakes are to be expected when news outlets clamor to "get the scoop" first during a chaotic event such as this.

       So where did they find it?
Edit: found a video of them finding a long gun(possibly the shotgun) in Lanza's trunk.
Previously they stated finding the bushmaster in there.

        21.00 (16.00) Lt Col Paul Vance, of State Police, is giving a brief update and says that a shotgun was found in Lanza's car parked outside the school. He says that the Bushmaster rifle was the primary weapon for the killing spree but that the gunman killed himself with one of his two pistols. All the weapons he took into the school had extra magazines and he was equipped with "hundreds of bullets".

       Even the "close-range" stuff is inaccurate. Here is what the medical examiner said (this is from a transcript I made of his press conference:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I only did seven of the autopsies. The victims I had ranged from 3 to 11 wounds a piece, and I only saw two of them with close-range shooting
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do the rest of the autopsies show close-range shooting? I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amazing though that the media narrative really highlights the "close range" part -- when, as far as we know, only 2 victims had "close range" wounds

       What if you use compiled evidence to support the premise of a conspiracy, instead of positing a conspiracy and then speculating as to what evidence might support it?

       However speaking of evidence: .223 shells were found at the scene, yet the shooter only had 2 pistols on him at the time of his death. An AR15 was found in A.L.'s vehicle. This was what I was talking about.

       reports stated that the bushmaster was found in the car. This has since been corrected.

       The most recent reports state that he had all 3 weapons (2 handguns and the bushmaster) on his person, and a shotgun was found in the trunk.

       Since we're just going to wildly speculate for a moment, is it so great a stretch of imagination that, during the chaotic aftermath of the murder of dozens of people and the frantic rush to be "first on the scene" with fresh news scoops, people on the ground (on both sides of the microphone) could speak incorrectly or misreport information?

       No doubt. I just don't want to see this tragedy get swept under the rug, and not examining and discussing every incorrect fact or misreported bit of information, or proposing any theory, however implausible, makes it that much easier for this whole situation to fade away.

       I want to bring up the amount of times these children were shot. They are saying each victim was shot between 3-11 times each. I know this will be hard to imagine, but you need to try. Murder is brutal, suffering is worse. Who ever killed those children made sure they did not suffer. Why would someone off their nugget care? Someone who is a paid operator, someone who is flown around the world by governments to kill people, they might lessen the stress of murdering children by limiting their victims suffering.

       The rifle would be semi-auto only. full-auto or burst would be illegal and even a 100 round drum would be illegal as well. He'd have a normal 20-30 round magazine, I assume.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the multiple shots, ugh, and I really.. really.. hate to be talking about this. But how many shots with so few rounds? .. It's likely the rounds went through one or more kids to hit anyone behind them.

       I don't want to paint a scenario here but I can only imagine they were huddled up or close together for him to do that.

       Huh. never heard of that technique since I don't own guns. Also I looked it up. Connecticut never passed a ban on large capacity magazines for rifles.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess I was proven wrong twice. Either way, I still see no doubt that the bullets were able to travel through the bodies and hit others. -sigh-
