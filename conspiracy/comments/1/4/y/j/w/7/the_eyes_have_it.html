       They are not on drugs (at the time the picture was taken) you would see there pupils being bigger or smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this "crazy look" comes from Mind Control Techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       If look at different Pictures from James Holmes you can see clearly that this Guy has NO FUCKING IDEA what happend.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Aurora Shooting has evidence for a False Flag Operation what i think is what happend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some People saw multiple shooters in the cinema.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most likely he was under mind control forced to kill these people and got all the blame for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could easly set his trigger to a specific Movie Scene/Soundtrack.

       Another interesting trend that was observed in another CT shooting thread: these recent shooters, who off themselves or seemingly just give up and turn themselves in... why are they wearing body armor and masks? Most shooters that are intending to make a statement don't care about their own safety or WANT to be known and immediately recognizable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the guy that went to a
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRgE3TXZ4oA">
        town hall meeting and spraypainted a V on the wall before brandishing a gun
       </a>
       . This man wanted to get his point across, and he wanted people to know it was him doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You DON'T want a shooter immediately identifiable when you have multiple people involved and you have to set up a patsy later. Consider this seriously WHEN the next shooting happens.

      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor">
        Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

      </p>
      <p>
       I think we are seeing the results of quackery caused by the currently accepted practices of the psychiatric and pharmaceutical industry in our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say that there are never truly conspiracies, of course. But, sometimes you don't have to jump sharks to explain things if another, simpler explanation or rationale is available.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity" But, I say this more for the LIBOR connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       MK Ultra seems to be another matter that plays into this in a broader way: social engineering, psychological operations angle.

        Gun control? We need medication control! Newton elementary school shooter Adam Lanza likely on meds; labeled as having 'personality disorder'

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         In mass shootings involving guns and mind-altering medications, politicians immediately seek to blame guns but never the medication. Nearly every mass shooting that has taken place in America over the last two decades has a link to psychiatric medication, and it appears today's tragic event is headed in the same direction.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         According to ABC News, Adam Lanza, the alleged shooter, has been labeled as having "mental illness" and a "personality disorder." These are precisely the words typically heard in a person who is being "treated" with mind-altering psychiatric drugs.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         One of the most common side effects of psychiatric drugs is violent outbursts and thoughts of suicide.

       And people like you who brush off the mental illness aspect of these people are the very reason this country's mental healthcare is absolute shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       People do NOT shoot up a mall or a school because they are sane. Perhaps the drugs made them snap, we don't know that as 100% fact. We do know they have a mental illness, a chemical imbalance in their brain, that causes them to be off. Perhaps the medications caused an adverse reaction but to say they were sane is asinine and just plain idiotic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've never been around someone whose been off their meds who is legitimately ill, you'll understand it's a very REAL thing.

       There are plenty of mentally ill people that will never snap and shoot up a school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mental illness IS the excuse the DSM uses to dose the general public unconditionally. If you ever bother to pick one up, I think you'll be shocked to find how many 'mental illnesses' you and everyone you know can be dosed with.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the entire point of the DSM. To make the pharmaceutical industry profitable.

       Only thing I have is slight ADD. Adderall the one time I've taken it did help me focus. Then again, caffeine and ephedrine do the same thing.

       I work and volunteer in the medical field, I've seen mentally ill patients who absolutely need the medications. I've seen the effects of them being on the medication versus them being on it. Is it perfect? Far from it but it's a helluva lot better than just locking them up in a padded room.

       Every single industry is going to be a profit hog. You really believe that if/when the government takes over it won't be just as much, if not more so, about profits? That's just delusional to think otherwise.

       Putting a conspiracy hat on, I couldn't come up with a better way to agitate a population then by subjecting it to a series of seemingly random violence acts. It would serve as a means of control, a method of coaxing people along to a place where they'd be far more likely to submit to further controls and "security" oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
       If drugs are used to do this, it is very likely a matter of those drugs simply lifting the already shaky restraints that susceptible individuals may have.

       I think it's not overly surprising that children of affluent parents will be more likely to receive the psychiatric "care" that appears to be correlated to the killings.

       And how something like that could be folded into the background of these situations is unclear.

       If the goal is to leverage someone to do something to which they are resistant; following through with a threat and playing your hand would seemingly remove the weight of your threat.

       "Hostage taking" only grants power while the hostages live; I just can't see the LIBOR thing as being valid, more like a shark jump to discredit focus on the stupidity of over prescribing/incorrectly treating school age children with psychostimulants.

       That's exactly my point, stop trying to make my statements into a conspiracy. I focus my opinion on the heavy use of psychostimulants because there's actual evidence connecting it to mass murder sprees. The LIBOR connection to my mind is a tangent with very little to back it up. More importantly, I don't really have an opinion on the matter at this time other than it doesn't appear likely.

       Take, for example, Nicki Minaj.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear that the people most easily programmed are the people who have had their personalities fractured already by personal events. The handler class then drives a psychological wedge into these people's personalities to break them wide open. The human brain, as a response to trauma, compartmentalizes. It creates new areas of operation away from the trauma memory as a coping mechanism. Some therapists induce this by requesting a patient go to his/her 'happy place', effectively aiding in the re-wiring of the pathways to and through the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are highly susceptible to suggestion while building these new pathways. This is why you often see people going through a divorce radically changing their lives as a result. That is a much more tame version of what is induced in these controlled subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not new science. It's been worked on and perfected for decades. With mostly American taxpayer money. It's only now that you are seeing it glorified in the media when it celebrates broken pop stars and has you remembering the name of the last three mass shooter patsies, but not any of the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, to the media and those trying to program YOU, the victims aren't important. The name of the shooter is.

        Think about that.
