<p>The Aurora Shooting has evidence for a False Flag Operation what i think is what happend.</p>

<p>Some People saw multiple shooters in the cinema.</p>

<p>Most likely he was under mind control forced to kill these people and got all the blame for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another interesting trend that was observed in another CT shooting thread: these recent shooters, who off themselves or seemingly just give up and turn themselves in... why are they wearing body armor and masks? Most shooters that are intending to make a statement don&#39;t care about their own safety or WANT to be known and immediately recognizable. </p>

<p>Take the guy that went to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRgE3TXZ4oA">town hall meeting and spraypainted a V on the wall before brandishing a gun</a>. This man wanted to get his point across, and he wanted people to know it was him doing it. </p>

<p>You DON&#39;T want a shooter immediately identifiable when you have multiple people involved and you have to set up a patsy later. Consider this seriously WHEN the next shooting happens. </p>

<p>I think we are seeing the results of quackery caused by the currently accepted practices of the psychiatric and pharmaceutical industry in our society.</p>

<p>This is not to say that there are never truly conspiracies, of course. But, sometimes you don&#39;t have to jump sharks to explain things if another, simpler explanation or rationale is available.</p>

<p>&quot;You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity&quot; But, I say this more for the LIBOR connection.</p>

<p>MK Ultra seems to be another matter that plays into this in a broader way: social engineering, psychological operations angle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cchrflorida.org/blog/mass-murderers-and-psychiatry/">Mass Murderers and Psychiatry</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Dr. Dolan makes the point that random violence and mass killings are the acts of monsters. The fact that children have access to guns and violent movies do not create monsters. But drugs that alter brain chemistry can have this effect on susceptible individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://psychdata.blogspot.com/2007/07/mania-shocking-link-between-psychiatric.html">MANIA - The shocking link between psychiatric drugs, suicide, violence and mass murder</a> </p>

<ul>
<li>To begin with, many of the most notorious mass killers in recent memory have been on, or just coming off, prescription mood-altering drug.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/038353_gun_control_psychiatric_drugs_Adam_Lanza.html">Gun control? We need medication control! Newton elementary school shooter Adam Lanza likely on meds; labeled as having &#39;personality disorder&#39;</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In mass shootings involving guns and mind-altering medications, politicians immediately seek to blame guns but never the medication. Nearly every mass shooting that has taken place in America over the last two decades has a link to psychiatric medication, and it appears today&#39;s tragic event is headed in the same direction.</p></li>
<li><p>According to ABC News, Adam Lanza, the alleged shooter, has been labeled as having &quot;mental illness&quot; and a &quot;personality disorder.&quot; These are precisely the words typically heard in a person who is being &quot;treated&quot; with mind-altering psychiatric drugs.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the most common side effects of psychiatric drugs is violent outbursts and thoughts of suicide.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2012/colorado-mass-murder-linked-to-prescription-drug-use/">Colorado Mass-Murder Linked to Prescription Drug Use</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The Telegraph and other sources are reporting that James Holmes, the alleged “Joker” gunman, dosed up on prescription medication before going on a shooting rampage. </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.cchrint.org/school-shooters/">School Shooters Under the Influence of Psychiatric Drugs</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>At least fourteen recent school shootings were committed by those taking or withdrawing from psychiatric drugs.  There have been 109 wounded and 58 killed.</p></li>
<li><p>Of these 14, seven were seeing either a psychiatrist (5 of them) or psychologist (2 of them).  It is not known whether or not the other half were seeing a psychiatrist, as it has not been published.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>And people like you who brush off the mental illness aspect of these people are the very reason this country&#39;s mental healthcare is absolute shit.</p>

<p>People do NOT shoot up a mall or a school because they are sane. Perhaps the drugs made them snap, we don&#39;t know that as 100% fact. We do know they have a mental illness, a chemical imbalance in their brain, that causes them to be off. Perhaps the medications caused an adverse reaction but to say they were sane is asinine and just plain idiotic.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never been around someone whose been off their meds who is legitimately ill, you&#39;ll understand it&#39;s a very REAL thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly my point, stop trying to make my statements into a conspiracy. I focus my opinion on the heavy use of psychostimulants because there&#39;s actual evidence connecting it to mass murder sprees. The LIBOR connection to my mind is a tangent with very little to back it up. More importantly, I don&#39;t really have an opinion on the matter at this time other than it doesn&#39;t appear likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take, for example, Nicki Minaj.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that the people most easily programmed are the people who have had their personalities fractured already by personal events. The handler class then drives a psychological wedge into these people&#39;s personalities to break them wide open. The human brain, as a response to trauma, compartmentalizes. It creates new areas of operation away from the trauma memory as a coping mechanism. Some therapists induce this by requesting a patient go to his/her &#39;happy place&#39;, effectively aiding in the re-wiring of the pathways to and through the event. </p>

<p>People are highly susceptible to suggestion while building these new pathways. This is why you often see people going through a divorce radically changing their lives as a result. That is a much more tame version of what is induced in these controlled subjects. </p>

<p>This is not new science. It&#39;s been worked on and perfected for decades. With mostly American taxpayer money. It&#39;s only now that you are seeing it glorified in the media when it celebrates broken pop stars and has you remembering the name of the last three mass shooter patsies, but not any of the victims. </p>

<p>You see, to the media and those trying to program YOU, the victims aren&#39;t important. The name of the shooter is. <em>Think about that.</em></p>
