       I don't think this is that bizarre. Adam Lanza was clearly a very private individual who went out of his way not to leave an online trail. It makes sense that he wouldn't want the public to know about his online activities.

       I think this is a speculative stretch.  If he had autism it is likely that he wasn't interested in social networking or other activities that may leave a trail online.  So many are willing to participate in these things because it makes them feel a part of something.  My experience is that children with autism either can't feel a part of something or are whole enough in themselves to not care.

       This is assuming that Adam Lanza even had autism. That's just speculation at this point, and an unfair one to people who actually do have autism.

       Not necessarily.  It's most likely that he had aspergers which is still on the autistic spectrum, but regardless I hardly find it unfair to people with autism.

       I heard this too, They also stated that the FBI is trying to recover data from the computers...  I'm guessing we will never know what was on the disks or why they were smashed up.  This is unfortunate, because I feel like those computers could provide a bunch of information.

       No one doing that level of government work would advertise themselves primarily as a MCP.  Thats a desktop support company brag.

        Now, Peter Lanza, Adam's father, was a partner in Ernst and Young Accounting/Tax business. In fact, he was a VP in this company as well as GE Financial Services... still is, for that matter.

       Pretty much everyone that isn't a junior at a financial firm is a VP.  It really doesn't mean anything about his actual level in the company.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And, Mr. Novia is a big wheeler dealer in financial auditing and software tools now... and Peter Lanza is a big deal in GE Finance and Ernst and Young Tax Accounting (he's a partner there). So, the Tax Accountant's ex-wife is murdered and his disable son is dead... and the former head of security at the school system who is now a financial auditing software tools big shot... was a mentor-buddy to the Tax Accountant's disable son...

       For extremely light definitions of "big wheeler dealer"  We so evidence he was part of anything more than a mom and pop support shop.

       People are so desperate for this to be a conspiracy that they jump through all these stupid hoops and twist anything to fit their desired outcome.

       Don't mean to hijack the thread but I figure those of us who are following the case are lurking here...

       Has anyone heard anything new about the people who were taken into custody during the incident?
