    <div class="md"><p>By saying you don&#39;t believe in the illuminati are you saying you don&#39;t think they exist, or are you saying they no longer exist.  Because if its the former that is definitely not true:
<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28gw360395%29%29">http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28gw360395%29%29</a></p>

<p>So we&#39;ve established that the Illuminati at one time existed, which leads to the next point:  Where did illuminati symbols come from?  Well, obviously the Illuminati, which definitely did exist.</p>

<p>So today we see Illuminati symbols in film and TV - so we have to choices: 1)  The illuminati did exist and did use symbols, but doesn&#39;t anymore and for some reason people in film and tv started using their symbols - or 2) The illuminati still exists and they put their symbols in films and TV.</p>

<p>Option 1 doesn&#39;t really make much sense does it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that.</p>

<p>Option 1 really makes no sense when you look at the other secret Society&#39;s and how active they are still today.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure the Illuminati still exist today in a more secretive and more wicked way than in the old days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hugely oversimplified. First, the Illuminati did not create most of their symbols, they were either borrowed from broader culture, or from Freemasonry (a reference that I&#39;m sure will get your tin foil hat in a bunch, but really, they&#39;re just old guys doing charity these days). Second, lots of symbols get re-used -- see, e.g., the swastika being a Hindu symbol, then a <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SqhhJb_P3Kk/TNl1O4iIHfI/AAAAAAAANAo/Nz1KkwFLI9w/s640/Halloween+swastika+1918.jpg">symbol of magic</a> before it was used by the Nazis.</p>

<p>Your &quot;choices&quot; are absurdly reductionist. Yes, a huge number of symbols get re-used, all the goddamned time. #1 totally makes more sense, but even then, it&#39;s hardly an exhaustive list of why you&#39;re seeing these symbols. I&#39;d add a third option: you&#39;re seeing what you wanna see.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The point is that they did exist and they did have symbols.  We seem to agree on this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freemasonry (a reference that I&#39;m sure will get your tin foil hat in a bunch, but really, they&#39;re just old guys doing charity these days).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for the fact that their symbols are also showing up in TV and film.  That&#39;s a fact that shouldn&#39;t be glossed over.  It would also seem to contradict the claim that they are simply &quot;old guys doing charity.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, lots of symbols get re-used -- see, e.g., the swastika being a Hindu symbol, then a symbol of magic before it was used by the Nazis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The nazi use of the swastika is extremely interesting if one knows anything about the Ahnenerbe.  I won&#39;t go into it here but basically both Freemasons and Nazis get their symbols from a global culture that existed in prehistory.  Again, the fact that both these groups from their own admission get their symbols from this prehistorical global culture is a fact that should not be glossed over simply for the fact that we don&#39;t learn it during our 12 plus years of McEducation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your &quot;choices&quot; are absurdly reductionist. Yes, a huge number of symbols get re-used, all the goddamned time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You acknowledge the illuminati exists, you acknowledge they have symbols, these symbols are currently being used in TV and films...and yet, you <em>INSIST</em> that instead of this being evidence that the Illuminati still exists, TV and Film producers have decided to co-opt their symbols for some completely inexplicable reason.  It&#39;s absurd!</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t wearing a tinfoil hat - you have a steel fucking plate in your head - its the only explanation for how nothing can get through your thick skull.</p>

<p>Well, when I still see their symbols that would seem to suggest they still  exist wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>If you are going to claim that for some reason TV and Film producers have <em>conspired</em> together to coopt their symbols you will have to provide a plausible explanation for this.  Shits and giggles doesn&#39;t cut it.</p>

<p>The most reasonable explanation as to why we still see illuminati symbolism is because it is from the illuminati.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, I suggested that you&#39;re seeing them where you want to see them. It&#39;s suggestion bias, or just plain delusion.</p>

<p>Yes, someone seeing something that isnt there is delusion.  Someone not seeing something that is there is also delusion.  This type of bare assertion leads nowhere so don&#39;t bring it up again.  </p>

<p>Now, if you want to claim this is <em>exclusively</em> an Illuminati symbol, I&#39;d like to see you explain its <a href="http://blogs.law.yale.edu/blogs/rarebooks/JusticeRoots/Dumont.jpg">use</a> (1726) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:QuoModoDeum.gif">earlier</a> (17th Century) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Allsehendes_Auge_am_Tor_des_Aachener_Dom.JPG">other contemporary</a> (1766) varied contexts.

<p>You are an idiot.  You just got done saying how the show is making fun of and spoofing illuminati symbols - you already admitted that the eye of providence is one such symbol being mocked and admitted that it showed up in the show as the eye of providence.  Given that context wouldn&#39;t the eyeballs in the jar be <em>precisely</em> how the eye of providence symbol is being mocked???</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it is &quot;exclusively&quot; an Illuminati symbol.  What I said is that it <em>is</em> an illuminati symbol.  Dude, again, you just got done saying that Gravity Falls is explicitly mocking illuminati symbols - but at the same time seem to be saying that this isn&#39;t occuring - why the contradiction?  Its like you don&#39;t want to admit that for there to be a mocking of illuminati symbols the symbols have to be present.</p>

<p>I told you that. They&#39;re symbols of general relevance to European Christianity, used in various contexts to represented the sovereignty of God and the concept of the Trinity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just got done saying how the show is making fun of and spoofing illuminati symbols</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And these are commonly understood in modern-day culture as such. That does not mean that they are exclusively Illuminati symbols, even today. That was just the context in which they were placed by your example, which was <em>explicitly mocking</em> Illuminati and secret-society theories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its like you don&#39;t want to admit that for there to be a mocking of illuminati symbols the symbols have to be present.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m priming the conversation for when you bring up any and all representations of an eye as examples of the Eye of Providence, so that I can point out that it&#39;s on you to distinguish its use as an Illuminati symbol from its lasting relevance as a general Christian cultural symbol.</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples from other comments in the thread.  I am not going to spend an hour piecing together symbols just to have you say - &quot;That&#39;s not the all seeing eye, its just an eyeball.  Thats not an illuminati symbol its just a triangle.  Thats just a coincidence that there is the all seeing eye on top of a pyramid blah blah blahg.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Belief that music and music videos are holding secret messages has been a strong claim by nutters for over 60 years(probably more).  You&#39;re the same as the people that complained rockers were putting evil messages that could be heard when played backwards.  Whats more likely that a secret world running elite organisation is inserting their symbolism into music videos or that creative types that make music videos are likely to know a lot about symbolism and put in cool things they like?  JayZ plays up the financial elite thing all the time and hes definitely smart enough to look up symbolism and put it into his music because people associate it with power.</p>

<p>The flashing images of baphomet in videos, the eye looking through the triangle in multiple videos, but particularly the &quot;forever young&quot; remake.</p>

<p>I could literally give you hundreds of examples of him using ancient egyptian and freemason symbology. It&#39;s absolutely blatant. It&#39;s one thing to use cool symbols in a few videos, but for Jay-Z and others like him (Drake in particular) the ancient occultic symbology is simply through and through saturated into everything they make, from the lyrics to the images in the music videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still incorrect. </p>

<p>The core of all reality isn&#39;t survival, it&#39;s actually vibration. </p>

<p>The reason the &quot;illuminati&quot; take advantage of symbols is because of their inherent esoteric power/vibration and their ability to influence the subconscious mind of man.</p>

<p>If I put subliminal messages at 1/60th of a second in everything you watch on tv, those messages are going to affect your subconscious, even if you are unaware of them consciously. From the effect on your subconscious, it will have consequences on your life, whether you would like to believe it or not.</p>

<p>The reason freemasons and other secret societies that many refer to collectively as &quot;the illuminati&quot; are so intent on using symbols in their rituals is because they realize the very nature of reality is that of a mirror. The symbols you use to define and shape the mirror are like tools using to carve a piece of wood. You may act as if a butter knife is as useful as a chainsaw, but they are different symbols/tools and have different INHERENT usefulness and effects from them.</p>

<p>Why do you think the &quot;flower of life&quot; is burnt into so many ancient monuments and pyramids all over the world--this is the same symbol that when simplified is the star of david or metatrons cube--very central to freemasonry and of course--the primary symbol on the flag of israel.. </p>

<p>Ask yourself &quot;what makes a symbol? Why do we need symbols?&quot;. Then ask yourself what is the universal language all beings share. After knowing the answer to these three, then the symbols will not seem so mystical to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well have fun with your perspective that makes you sad I guess. Personally I try to overlook the superficial traits of a claim like, for example, whether it conflicts with my own worldview or not, because I know if I take that stuff too seriously I won&#39;t learn anything. Instead I try to gauge propositions by how well they function, in other words, how effectively they explain what they seek to explain while not being ruled out by the discrepancies I would expect to rule them out if they were bogus. And in that regard I consider the things in this text I posted very effective, they line up very well with everything happening in the world today, everything the secret societies&#39; literature and occult literature claims, ancient mythological understandings of spiritual phenomena, etc. etc. while also tying all of these things together by the same threads my observation sees is presently tying them together.

I do sometimes enjoy hearing what these sorts of people have to say, regardless of whether I trust its motives or not, so it&#39;s not like I simply dodge it out of obstinance, but I generally don&#39;t care to read books, so I probably just won&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are doing it -- putting symbolism into their videos -- to get noticed. The public is so jaded and so case-hardened against shock that the soulless creatures who crank out the noise that passes for popular music feel the need to do something that will move the public in a primal way. Hence the use of religious and pagan symbolism that affects the mind on the unconscious level. Since the music they are selling is essentially without any content at all, they need to pump their advertising (and that&#39;s what a music video is, an advertisement) full of seemingly meaningful symbolism, by way of compensation. The blander the product, the flashier the packaging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a double negative. If he denies that they never existed, then he acknowledges that they did at one time exist.</p>

<p>But joking aside, he&#39;s saying that there is no grand powerful illuminati like some people claim. And he&#39;d be right.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t deny that hundreds of years ago some drunken Bavarians made a secret club, but to believe it rules the world is just crazy.</p>

<p>It destroys any notion of democracy or self determination. It forces believers to see themselves as powerless and subservient. It stops them from focusing on or achieving real solutions to real problems. It shifts the blame for those problems from the real culprits to imaginary ones.</p>

<p>So IMO, the existence of the illuminati as an idea achieves more harm than it could do if it were a real organization. The existence of the idea itself is the conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to remember that some people who read this subreddit are genuine bonafide nutjobs. They don&#39;t have a baseline education in many of the topics and their head has been filled with half truth mumbo jumbo. So they have this horribly confused understanding. And of those people, some of them are dicks who just downvote what they disagree with.</p>

<p>But I think you hit the nail on the head regarding the publicity and marketing. Its the same as metal bands in the 80&#39;s. They all used satanic imagery and themes but it didn&#39;t make them satanists and it didn&#39;t mean that satan ran the music industry. For the listeners it was something to attach a sense of rebellion to, and for the press it was something to talk about, i.e free marketing.</p>

<p>And even that was just an evolution of the rock and roll imagery and themes. The whole &#39;going down to the crossroads&#39; thing, meeting the devil, selling your soul like you&#39;ve mentioned. That was all the same thing but milder, because it took less to shock people back then.</p>

<p>But today it takes a lot to shock someone, selling souls is cliché, goat headed album covers are passé, so they have to come up with something else. The modern bogeyman. And that&#39;s illuminatism.</p>

<p>If I were to release a music video I&#39;d stuff it full of all kinds of crap to get people talking about it. That&#39;s how marketing works now. You talk around the product, not about it. But you&#39;re still made aware of the product.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Why? Because you say so? You DO realize that the entire system of the original Bavarian Illuminati was subterfuge and infiltration? They practically designed the clandestine system for the CIA and other organizations, and you&#39;re claiming they don&#39;t exist because it seems like a radical idea to you? What you&#39;re saying is the equivalent to someone saying that they know everything that goes on in the CIA, when <strong>by design</strong>, noone, not even the people IN it, are going to know everything about what it does. So for someone to say an organization such as the Bavarian Illuminati (I keep saying that because that is what we know existed) disbanded, when that is the very image they <strong>WANTED</strong>, it is both laughable and face-palm inducing.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s put it this way - take Freemasons. No, not the foil-hat version, what they claim to be. Simply, a fraternity. It is widely known and documented that Freemasons inhabit positions in EVERY office or agency in our government, from engineering to law to food to policy making - as a fraternity, do you not think that members are going to pay deference to eachother to help get things they want done? Kind of sounds like a sweet deal even to me. Power in numbers, right? Now with that very simple and irrefutable logic, let&#39;s insert the whole adage that power corrupts.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you ever read the personal writings of Adam Weishaupt - but the guy was more of a sociopath than anyone I&#39;ve ever encountered via the printed, written, or typed letter - and to call them &quot;drunken Bavarians&quot; is kind of discrediting yourself in the discussion. Couple a personality like that, with a known organization and design of the Bavarian Illuminati (subterfuge/infiltration) with the brotherhood mentality of a fraternity - at the very least, and I&#39;m being more kind to you than ME on this conclusion - it&#39;s <em>completely</em> and <em>utterly</em> plausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are very common secret society symbols. I&#39;m not aware of specifically Illuminati connections, nor do I grant that all of those are symbols of any sort (eyes in a jar, really?). But let&#39;s do an easy one: the all-seeing eye, AKA the Eye of Providence.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to claim this is <em>exclusively</em> an Illuminati symbol, I&#39;d like to see you explain its <a href="http://blogs.law.yale.edu/blogs/rarebooks/JusticeRoots/Dumont.jpg">use</a> (1726) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:QuoModoDeum.gif">earlier</a> (17th Century) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Allsehendes_Auge_am_Tor_des_Aachener_Dom.JPG">other contemporary</a> (1766) varied contexts. The All-seeing Eye is a common Christian symbol of the sovereignty of God and the Trinity, not an exclusive Illuminati or secret society symbol.</p>
