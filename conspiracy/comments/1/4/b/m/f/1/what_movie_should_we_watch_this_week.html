    <div class="md"><p>Good Recommendation.</p>

<p>Aldous Huxley has admitted in the Berkley Speech that his book &quot;Brave New World&quot; and George Orwell&#39;s &quot;1984&quot; are the Plan for the New World Order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this: That we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy who have always existed and presumably will always exist to get people to love their servitude. This is the, it seems to me, the ultimate in malevolent revolutions shall we say, and this is a problem which has interested me many years and about which I wrote thirty years ago, a fable, Brave New World, which is an account of society making use of all the devices available and some of the devices which I imagined to be possible making use of them in order to, first of all, to standardize the population, to iron out inconvenient human differences, to create, to say, mass produced models of human beings arranged in some sort of scientific caste system. Since then, I have continued to be extremely interested in this problem and I have noticed with increasing dismay a number of the predictions which were purely fantastic when I made them thirty years ago have come true or seem in process of coming true.</p>

<p>A number of techniques about which I talked seem to be here already. And there seems to be a general movement in the direction of this kind of ultimate revolution, a method of control by which a people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs by which any decent standard they ought not to enjoy. This, the enjoyment of servitude, Well this process is, as I say, has gone on for over the years, and I have become more and more interested in what is happening.</p>

<p>And here I would like briefly to compare the parable of Brave New World with another parable which was put forth more recently in George Orwell’s book, Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell wrote his book between, I think between 45 and 48 at the time when the Stalinist terror regime was still in Full swing and just after the collapse of the Hitlerian terror regime. And his book which I admire greatly, it’s a book of very great talent and extraordinary ingenuity, shows, so to say, a projection into the future of the immediate past, of what for him was the immediate past, and the immediate present, it was a projection into the future of a society where control was exercised wholly by terrorism and violent attacks upon the mind-body of individuals.</p>

<p>Whereas my own book which was written in 1932 when there was only a mild dictatorship in the form of Mussolini in existence, was not overshadowed by the idea of terrorism, and I was therefore free in a way in which Orwell was not free, to think about these other methods of control, these non-violent methods and my, I’m inclined to think that the scientific dictatorships of the future, and I think there are going to be scientific dictatorships in many parts of the world, will be probably a good deal nearer to the brave new world pattern than to the 1984 pattern, they will a good deal nearer not because of any humanitarian qualms of the scientific dictators but simply because the BNW pattern is probably a good deal more efficient than the other.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Fall Of The Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the US economy by design. Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced by a new global currency.</p>

<p>President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1 Section 9 of the US Constitution by seating himself at the head of United Nations&#39; Security Council, thus becoming the first US president to chair the world body.</p>

<p>A scientific dictatorship is in its final stages of completion, and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide; an iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.</p>

<p>A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.</p>

<p>With the departure of the Bush Administration and the arrival of an “era of transparency,” opportunities are arising for the disclosure of new information that may shed more light on the events that took place before and after 9/11/2001. </p>

<p>I found this movie shed an interesting perspective on what occurred back in 2001. It is/was free on Netflix for awhile if that helps anyone</p>

<p>Bill Cooper is my favorite tin-foil-hat wearer.  If it weren&#39;t for &quot;Mystery Babylon&quot; I might accept the misinfo bullshit spewed by David Icke and Alex Jones as truth.  If you don&#39;t know anything about the message, life, or death of Bill Cooper, you owe it to yourself to investigate.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the US raising their debt ceiling, are we in a global bail-out bubble that will eventually burst? This doc offers a fresh insight into the greatest economic crisis of our age: the one still awaiting us.</p>

<p>The financial storm that has rocked the world began brewing in the US when congress pushed the idea of home ownership for all, propping up those who couldn&#39;t make the down payments. When it all went wrong the government promised the biggest financial stimulus packages in history and gargantuan bailouts. But what crazed logic is that: propping up debt with more debt? &quot;They&#39;re giving alcohol to a drunk: it just sets him up for a bigger hangover.&quot; </p>
