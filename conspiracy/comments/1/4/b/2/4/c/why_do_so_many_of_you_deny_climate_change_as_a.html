       Because they hate the idea that they might be accountable for their actions, especially if it means parting with some money?

       Actually, it's all about the money. No one likes paying taxes, although reasonable people will  concede that they're necessary in a civilised society. These are just people who take taxes personally for some reason.

       It does genuinely amaze me that with all of the underhanded tricks that "Big Oil / Coal" companies like BP and Chevron have pulled, there's a huge lacking of "Hey, perhaps they're pulling every string they can lay their hands on to make it look like their products don't adversely affect the environment".

       The ice caps are not melting, this has been debunked, the IPCC and related organizations have a monopoly on the mainstream science rags and they refuse to publish anything outside of their viewpoint.  You have been duped.  Antarctica is actually growing ice at a record rate, a big chunk of ice just fell off because it was so heavy.  Stop going to "green" sites and all of that bullshit.  The UN is using this "problem" to get a "reaction"(radical environmentalism) to bring about their predetermined solution (global governance).  It's blatantly obvious if you actually do real research and stop relying on those stupid "peer reviewed" papers, that are reviewed by "peers" who agree and are also funded by the IPCC and related foundations.

       The goal is to de-industrialize the western nations and bring about forced poverty and "socialist communitarianism", once again, it's blatant if you do

       Let's put it this way, it is a well known fact that the earth was in a "mini-ice age" until the end of the 1800s.  Any warming that is happening is happening because the earth's temperature is normalizing or just going through a different phase.  To think that humans can affect the climate of the planet based on the release of a trace gas into the atmosphere is ridiculous, we aren't even contributing a fraction of a percentage point into the air worth of CO2.  Think about back in the 30s through the 60s when everyone had fireplaces and
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       was burning huge fires everyday to keep warm, whole cities were engulfed in smoke constantly, now there is ONE fire in the middle of town that creates energy for everyone.  I would say the pollutants have gone
       <em>
        down
       </em>
       .  They are blaming the fossil fuel industry so that they can dramatically raise the price of fuel = massive profits for the conglomerates who also "coincidentally" own the huge "alternative fuel" industries as well, just do a little research, like I said.  It's about monopoly, now that they have eliminated the competing oil companies, the big conglomerates can work in tandem to control the resources.  They're all in cahoots, let's put it that way.

       You are ignoring the big-oil foundations broseph.  Rockefeller, Carnegie, Ford foundations ALL fund university "climatology" research and push "sustainability" measures using NGOs and non-profits.  You haven't actually looked into Agenda 21 at all have you?  You don't know how it's happening or the measures they are taking to implement it.  You actually
       <em>
        trust
       </em>
       IPCC funded "climatologists" who rely on computer modeling to make their "predictions".  You've never looked into the Club Of Rome who in the 70s made the declaration that they needed a global problem to bring about a "global solution" which was a world federal government, the "problem" they devised was man-made global climate change, the plan was to de-industrialize the western nations and force everyone into socialist communitarianism to live as serfs under an oligarchical rule.  But you won't look into this stuff because it contradicts your "beliefs", because that is what they are, you are being indoctrinated into the new religion of "earth worship".  Al Gore btw, is a member of the Club of Rome.  Actually if you want to see some good research on the subject of the big scam you have fallen for go here:

       Really?  It's colder now than it was 5 months ago.  Once again, increasing temperatures does NOT mean that it is caused by man, like I said, any change in climate is a phase.  You're so stuck on this because you've been conditioned to trust "experts" who they throw on TV and put in magazines that have ZERO accountability and who's cohorts back them up on all their claims.  These "climatologists" probably have never gotten so much funding in their entire lives, they will push this for all its worth.
