       Is the Syria rebellion even occurring? Or is it actually happening but it's a false flag operation of some sort? Or is it happening but the "rebels" are just CIA stooges? Help me see the wheels within wheels.

       Ok.... Another military operation because of another WMD threat. Why are we going down that road again? Why are they not call it what it is? Chemical weapons right? Well those are illegal all around and every country should be saying no, so it is trying to drop that good ol' bush idea of nukes in your head. Well who in the hell would nuke their own country? Even if you didnt care 1 bit about the people you were killing, you just lost a great deal of land indefinitely. So to take a jokeish  comment and give you a serious answer since thats what you're digging for, there you have it. The WMD trick to get us to think about what isnt there to convince the people of another military blunder.

       It wouldn't be because of any purported threat to us though. It would be because the Syrian government was actually using sarin gas in the ongoing conflict.

      <p>
       Everything is coming (to gaza) through tunnels. Everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, of course hamas is racketeering (taxing) everything that passes through tunnels. This is the way they are financing the operation to rule in gaza.
      </p>
      <p>
       If israel army has "iron dome" as an example of highly sophisticated system and it is unable to close tunnels going under their own boarder......  I would say it is highly unlikely.

       No, it's an uninteresting, idiotic theory. The west bank did not elect Hamas, and as a result Israel has allowed it to have one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The west bank now has a booming tech sector (with substantial investments from Cisco, Google, and HP) and Israeli firms are now outsourcing work there because they elected the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas. If Israel supported Hamas they would be sending Hamas into the west bank instead of sending money and jobs there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that if Israelis were running around pretending to be Palestinians fighting for Hamas, Palestinians themselves would have noticed by now and would be saying something about it. We'd have much better evidence than some random, blurry-as-shit photo.

       It was an idiotic theory that is totally illogical and unsupported by the evidence. Israel has absolutely no reason to support a sunni uprising against an alawite government in Syria.

       The Syrian uprising most certainly is occurring. It isn't a false flag operation (I can't even begin to work out how that would work in this context) and I don't see any reason to suppose that the CIA is orchestrating all this.
      </p>

       All the evidence points to it being an uprising by the people of Syria against a tyrannical regime.

       Well the situation is very complicated there. I wouldn't make any blanket statements about the entirety of it, or claim to know what exactly is going on; and I probably shouldn't have given that inclination about Libya, because I'm certain that there are legitimate protests, ect... Overall however, the instigation of violence (the snipers in the streets) by Assad seems to have been manufactured. I can say for certain that there is more going on than Assad attempting to stop protests and now the FSA. Syria very well may be on its way to "civil war", more like a coup. To speak specifically about what is going on however, is not something I can talk about conclusively...
      </p>
      <p>
       My apologies for the non-committal response. My "gut feeling" tells me that mercenaries were behind the initial violence, western-backed extremists are behind the FSA, and that this entire epic situation is going to be used for western forces to overtly intervene. As I mentioned, I don't want to say that I'm certain about the
       <em>
        entire thing
       </em>
       being a false flag; there's too much speculation there for me. Anyway; Yes, evidence is pointing to some shady operations.

       I don't see how any of those are "demonstrable." Please pick one and "demonstrate" why it justifies US intervention in 2012.

       I don't know why our military/espionage complex gives two shits about Syria. It seems like Israel had them safely contained - stirring things up there just seems foolish.

       no, thanks. i'm well aware of how you operate here. just wanted to point out that there can be agendas other than the bullcrap about chemical weapons you and western media are trying to suggest warrants military support. people who are curious can look up more about this. i have no need of convincing anyone of anything.

       Sure, there
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be. However hand waving about central banks doesn't really explain why after decades of stability the US suddenly overthrow a stable regional despot. Assad was one of the few arab leaders to actually make peace with Israel after all.

       That would justify U.S. intervention if overthrowing Assad somehow benefited either Turkey or the U.N. However it's not at all apparent how overthrowing Assad benefits either. Perhaps you could flesh out your theory?

       Well the situation is very complicated there. I wouldn't make any blanket statements about the entirety of it, or claim to know what exactly is going on; and I probably shouldn't have given that inclination about Libya, because I'm certain that there are legitimate protests, ect... Overall however, the instigation of violence (the snipers in the streets) by Assad seems to have been manufactured. I can say for certain that there is more going on than Assad attempting to stop protests and now the FSA. Syria very well may be on its way to "civil war", more like a coup. To speak specifically about what is going on however, is not something I can talk about conclusively...
      </p>
      <p>
       My apologies for the non-committal response. My "gut feeling" tells me that mercenaries were behind the initial violence, western-backed extremists are behind the FSA, and that this entire epic situation is going to be used for western forces to overtly intervene. As I mentioned, I don't want to say that I'm certain about the
       <em>
        entire thing
       </em>
       being a false flag; there's too much speculation there for me. Anyway; Yes, evidence is pointing to some shady operations.
