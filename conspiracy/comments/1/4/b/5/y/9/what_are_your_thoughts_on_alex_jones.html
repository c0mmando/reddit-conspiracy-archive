I will not be giving away my identity, but I was invited on his show recently (have not yet been on).  I&#39;ve been following Jones for close to 2 years now.  I&#39;ve recently read a lot of things about him being part of the NWO himself and providing disinformation.  I&#39;ve watched a few videos and read a few articles, but still can&#39;t find the &quot;truth.&quot;  What are your thoughts and opinions?  Links and sources would be appreciated.</p>

<p>EDIT:  And furthermore, should I decline going on his show?  Now that I&#39;ve read the few things that I have, I&#39;m wondering if he&#39;s actually part of the same agenda he claims to fight against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been listening to Alex Jones off and on since 1998.  At first I thought he concentrated too much on some crazy things, black helicopters, chemtrails and Y2K for instance.  But I have always thought his exposure of the growing US police state has been important.  The more I&#39;ve watched, the more I realize the amount of historical research he has legitimately done, and the vast array of knowledge he draws from in order to tie disparate pieces together.  He has become more of a mainstream right-winger in the past several years which I think is one reason you see a lot of people attacking him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is a tool of the ZioCIA, they have his body and mind, now they want his soul .. the blonde bombshell recently became Editor in Chief at Infowars, is there to vet his performance, whereas should he depart from the carefully contrived Zionist line, he would be eliminated in an instant!</p>

<p>Nor can he &quot;go to the police,&quot; since the unrequited death of Christian Palestinian activist Riad Hamad, whose bound tortured body was found in Lady Bird Lake in Austin, Texas April 18, 2008, since he is with alleged Mossad enforcer Victor Thorn, supposed to be culpable!</p>

<p>Jones is a CIA brat like Mr Barry Soetoro aka Barak Obama, the ZioCia handlers make sure each of their stooges, either in politics or the media is criminally culpable, thus Obama is similarly wanted for the murders of Nate Spencer and Donald Young in Chicago, deaths that had to occur before the Zionists would sponsor him to the next level!</p>

<p>Hamad had written to Austin newspapers, criticizing US thence Israeli policy in the Middle East .. the Ziojews intend to annex Texas as a homeland under the aegis of a false Messiah, after first seeing to the disintegration of the United States!</p>

<p>The FBI holds the key to the survival of America, only that body has the means to bring prosecutions for Hamad&#39;s death, no less than for the John Kennedy assassination and for 911, which will bring the Zionists before the courts! </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Ask Jones why he turns from 911 truth, after bullhorning 911 was an inside job on the steps of the US Congress, and in the British Houses of Parliament, and why he beats the drum of dual 911 treasoners Ron and Rand Paul, unless there is some reason other than capital treason.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Romney murdered Jon-Benet Ramsey according to the <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/romney-murdered-jonbenet-ramsey-new-obama-campaign,29114/">Onion,</a> while the concept of &quot;&quot;killed&quot; to advance,&quot; has its roots in the George HW Bush dictum of &quot;cleansing,&quot; insofar as an unblackmailed client was an unreliable client.</p>

<p>Ol&#39; GHWB was never gonna take the chance a &quot;cleanskin&quot; would enter the Company, who might as soon as he got wind of the inherent evil of the ZioCIA plan, turn against the body corporate!</p>

<p>So up and coming stooges, and ppl ambitious for rise who wish to get ahead, need to participate in Satanic ritual murder of some kind, where after they will be well and truly liable to suffer prosecution via the capital courts, despite they get a good job with high pay!</p>

<p>Riad Hamad was one such victim, he was a Christian Palestinian activist who decried US / Israeli policy in the Middle East, in letters to newspapers in Austin Texas .. his bound tortured body turned up in Lady Bird Lake in Austin April 18, 2008, the APD says he suicided then bound himself!</p>

<p>The evidence appears to inculpate Alex Jones and Victor Thorn, author of hit piece 911 Evil who is thought to be a Mossad killer, while Jones was roped into the plot to check his antecedents ..</p>

<p>Means if he fails to toe the ZioCIA line, he wears prosecution unto lethal injection for Hamad&#39;s death, no less than Barak Obama was promised greatness, all he had to do was get involved with the plot to kill Nate Spencer and Donald Young in Chicago!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure I agree with your terms of reference, however on this occasion instead of me speculating on what took place leading up to their deaths, which is a matter for the FBI in any case, why don&#39;t you say what you propose to do ..</p>

<p>I have been castigating the Texas political hierarchy and the APD since Hamad&#39;s death, for refusing to properly investigate, further assuring them the level of Zioinfiltration in Texas, more especially in Austin needs to be checked!</p>

<p>The FBI is the only body can do it .. ppl should be placarding and demonstrating adjacent to FBI stations, demanding arrests and trials .. no less than for 911 and President Kennedy&#39;s assassination, which were both Jew inspired black ops!</p>

<p>thats was giving me a good laugh lol.</p>

<p>He never turned away from 9/11 Truth.</p>

<p>You mean Ron Paul,Rand Paul have should speak out about 9/11 that Mainstream Media could him display as even more crazy?</p>

<p>Or are they in your head already CIA agent&#39;s because they offer some sort of solution?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Alex Jones is one of the good ones but he has alot of stuff that caters to the right wing for some reason. Like someone said before I think he lures you in with truth but has alot of bs in there. I find it interesting that he looks really really similar to Bill Hicks. You cant find any info on Alex prior to 94. Is it possible Hicks faked his death? 
They have the same views plus Jones producer was an associate of Hicks. </p>

<p>If this were 10 years ago I would say its impossible to fake your death cuz of how naive on how the world is run but now that i know of secret societies etc I dont think its far fetched anymore. Look at Hicks and Jones side by side they look exactly the same  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What i like about him:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He is completly independent funded and is still more succesfuel than most in the mainstream.</p></li>
<li><p>He exposed the Bohemian Grove and brought Bilderberg in the Light of the Public</p></li>
<li><p>His Movies are well produced and the information is always a bombshell.</p></li>
<li><p>He has the best spectrum of guest which are always intresting, also he is helping other Infowarrior&#39;s get a platform to speak out.</p></li>
<li><p>He is really living this everday and is probably one of the most awake people in the world.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On him being a disinformant Agent:</p>

<p>He is not a disinformant Agent:</p>

<p>Look  at the Information he is exposing the Elite would never attack themselve like that.</p>

<p>And yes i think the Elite is leaking sometimes a bit information on purpose (mostly mixed with disinformation).</p>

<p>If you really can go his show ask him straight forward about this in the break if you really think he is a disinformation agent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that he covers Agenda 21 very well, and has been for years, well before Glenn Beck even heard of it probably.  When he has Alan Watt on they are great together, they can really riff well with history.  I wish Jones went more into history than current events, he has a hard time fear mongering when nothing is going on, if he just covered the last 100 years in depth, using the conspirators own works and published writings, his credibility could skyrocket, but that won&#39;t happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure I agree with your terms of reference, however on this occasion instead of me speculating on what took place leading up to their deaths, which is a matter for the FBI in any case, why don&#39;t you say what you propose to do ..</p>

<p>I have been castigating the Texas political hierarchy and the APD since Hamad&#39;s death, for refusing to properly investigate, further assuring them the level of Zioinfiltration in Texas, more especially in Austin needs to be checked!</p>

<p>The FBI is the only body can do it .. ppl should be placarding and demonstrating adjacent to FBI stations, demanding arrests and trials .. no less than for 911 and President Kennedy&#39;s assassination, which were both Jew inspired black ops!</p>
