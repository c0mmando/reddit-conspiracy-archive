       Americans are easily impressed, easily lead, and easily manipulated. Pregnant royalty is in the news, because the owners of our media want it in the news. That some Americans actually give a shit is just a pathetic coincidence.

       Don't contradict yourself, they give a shit because they're easily manipulated.  They don't know any better, it is in the news to give those friggin' people something to watch and admire and chat about over coffee. And there is something in the news for almost every type of person out there!  It's something for these people to DO, in this fucked, boring consumerist life.

       Americans have one leg firmly planted in a childhood storybook fantasy world. The royals are the closest thing Americans have to a real-life Disney movie. Living in a fantasy world is much, much easier than living in the real world so Americans choose to do that. If they ever found out that the royals still have people wiping their bums after they shit, it would ruin the fantasy.

       Most people couldn't give two shits. However, there is a "lowest common denominator" in the US, just like there is in Britain, who are obsessed by royals and celebrities. People who watch a lot of TV and care about people interviewed on TMZ as they exit nightclubs.

       I've never met an American who could even name 2 "royals" - unless the mainstream fake media is "reporting" on whatever bullshit they're up to.

       The bigger question is, why do the British care so much about the British "royals".

       I'm actually around £2.30 better off a year thanks to the revenue from Royal lands that goes back into the UK's economy. Not a huge amount, but it all adds up. They more than pay their way.

       How about the possibility that I know more on this subject than you, and you're just making an assumption that the Royals are looting the poor populace to fund their castle-building exploits?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 1760 the hereditary revenues of the Crown have been turned over to the UK coffers in return for the Civil List. The Crown Estate is one of the largest property owners in the United Kingdom, with holdings of £7.3 billion in 2011. It is held
       <strong>
        in trust
       </strong>
       , and cannot be sold or owned by the Sovereign in a private capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In modern times, the profits surrendered from the Crown Estate have exceeded the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid. For example, the Crown Estate produced £200 million for the Treasury in the financial year 2007–8, whereas reported parliamentary funding for the monarch was £40 million during the same period.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suppose I must be brainwashed for thinking that £200 million  is a bigger number than £40 million.

       Save me your rationalizations based on the concepts and assumptions of hereditary title.

       Has the "queen" ever worked a day in her life? Ever run the register at a McDonalds? Or waited tables at a Pizza Hut? Ever washed her own "royal" panties? What about the "king" or "prince" or whatever?
      </p>
      <p>
       These people live entirely undeserved lives of privilege and wealth. They've never had to work for anything, and contribute nothing of worth to society. Their existence is an insult all the people who really do create worth in this world.

       You just sound like some bitter individual who's jealous that you're not wealthy. I'm not, but I wouldn't swap my life for that of a Royal. No privacy, your life's not your own, can't go anywhere or do anything without it being endlessly scrutinised. All those endless boring duties.

       You clearly don't actually know anything about how much the Queen does for our country, so stop making irrational assumptions that only display your own ignorance before you embarrass yourself any further.

       Do some research. Look into what the Queen and other royals actually do.

       Your point being? Besides, I bet a hell of a lot of Americans could name two royals.

       That's a 100% inaccurate description of the Royal family, good job.

       Murder is actually illegal in this country. Brits don't tend to be bloodthirsty psychopaths who kill anyone they don't like.

       Just floating some ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       However deplorable you feel it to be, humans are social creatures who are innately interested in alpha humans - always have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the mass media coverage of celebrity lifestyles, conditions the beta humans to care about alphas even more. When Princess Diana died, millions felt her death more deeply than the deaths of their own relatives. Sad but true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Americans feel a certain affinity with the UK - there are strong cultural and economic links as well as a common language. British Royalty is part of American history, and they are therefore more interesting than, say, Japanese Royals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The popularity of the US first family is mitigated by Obama's personal unpopularity (amongst half the nation) and his politics, so an alternative alpha family is sought out. The better looking British Royals (nobody cares about the ugly ones) provide a "real" soap opera that allows people to fantasise.

       Because the whole world loves the Duchess of Cambridge. Her child will become the future king or queen of Britain, after Charles and William.

       "the whole world loves the Duchess of Cambridge"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im guessing thats why he said you're "a poor deluded fuck". And really its not much of a guess because I suspect that in response to your absurd statement, 90% of the world would ask : Who the fuck is the "duchess of cambridge"? Because we really have no idea.
