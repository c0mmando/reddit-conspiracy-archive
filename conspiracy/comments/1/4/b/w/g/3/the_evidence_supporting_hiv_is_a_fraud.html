      <p>
       I've been posting this as comments on relevant threads, thought I would just submit it as a story in its own right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I apologize for the length of this. It is nuanced and, frankly, uninteresting... I've spent an inordinate amount of time researching this, so I present to you my findings in their lengthy and unedited form.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original papers establishing HIV as the cause of AIDS show evidence of fraud and scientific misconduct / falsification.  So there is the current head of the Institute of Human Virology - Robert Gallo... hes the guy who supposedly made this discovery. Well the first paper published in Nature magazine was written and researched by his research assistant Mikalus Popovich. The first draft of the paper stated that "despite intensive research efforts, the causative agent of AIDS has not been found". And then made very clear that it was an assumption with very limited proof that they were putting forth HTLV-III as the causative agent.  So Gallo makes edits to this paper, where he crosses out essentially this entire paragraph and rewrites it, utterly changing the meaning and hiding the doubt that the Popovich expressed.
       <a href="http://fearoftheinvisible.com/fraud-in-key-hiv-research-background">
        This can be found here. Read the book its pretty good stuff. Well reviewed on Amazon
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres a lot of other things he did in the paper that don't really stand up to scientific due diligence. In the published paper he adds the word "cytopathic" to the title of the paper (meaning that it was illustrated to kill/damage cells), but no where in the paper or in the papers cited does he show that. The only illustration of cytopathy is through indirect means about their other two virus (HTLV-I and HTLV-II). Cytopathy in HTLV-III is never established, yet there it is in the title. In fact, to this very day, how HIV supposedly kills cells is very much an area of conjecture.  (See aside at bottom for more information)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also he had some micrographs of what he claimed were HIV, but you can see from that link, his electron micrograph person wrote him a letter and told him they were cell detritus. He expresses the micrographs as HTLV-III (now known as HIV) in the published paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally theres sentences in the paper that simply are not very scientific... very uncharacteristic for something that was actually peer reviewed. For example, "Although patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS are often chronically infected with cytomegalovirus and hepatits B virus, for various reasons these appear to be opportunistic or coincidental infections." That's the whole statement... "for various reasons" is allowed to slide as evidence for that statement. theres no citation, nothing...  keep in mind, this is the FIRST paper about HTLV-III and its connection to AIDS... and the edits were made 2 weeks before it was published. Popvich didn't write anything about these being opportunistic or coincidental infections. Gallo did. 2 weeks before publishing. Without a single shred of evidence. That is fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://fearoftheinvisible.com/gallodefendsemai">
        Gallo responded to the woman who wrote the book that made these discoveries.  He only made one specific objection in regards to an investigation done by the Secret Service that found he did in fact fix these papers. He claimed she committed Libel and Slander. Interestingly enough, he nor any of those he claims she has slandered have ever filed suit against her.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.aliveandwellsf.org/articles/NEW%20ARTICLES/classics/popovic_gallo_isolation_1984.pdf">
        For your reference the published paper is here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So those things are pretty solid evidence of fraud / scientific misconduct / at the very best scientific incompleteness along with blaring conjecture. Which opens the door to a whole host of theories and investigations which I have linked to for you below. The first two are award winning, well reviewed documentaries available on youtube. The rabbit hole is deep on this one, I wished, looking back on it, I was actually a nut... but the evidence really suggests to me (a fairly even headed facts based person) that something very fishy is going on in this industry, at least at the foundational level.

      <p>
       (In regards to establishing HTLV-III as existing and the cause... their line of reasoning is this:
  * Cats get immune sickness
  * Immune sickness is caused by depleted CD4 cells.
  * Therefor, it must be a new type of a virus i already did research on
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously thats the deductive process put forth in Gallo's edits. The establishment of cytopathy is solely by means of illustrating syncytia formation (where cells bundle up). Well the problem there is that happens a lot in natural situations non specific to virus infection. In fact, there are all sorts of things you can do to the culture medium and prevent or encourage cell syncytia... so hardly conclusive evidence that you have a virus killing/hindering cells... Also remember, our cultures are chronically infected with other syncytia forming virus... including the cytomegalovirus, hepatitis b virus, AND HTLV-I and HTLV-II. So the question is... how did you eliminate the HTLV-I and the HTLV-II and the cytomegalovirus, and the hepatits b virus in your cultures and establish that your new HTLV-III was the sole cause of the cytopathy that was so important and conclusive that you edited the paper to put it in the title).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, because cats get immune sickness, and immune sickness is caused by depleted CD4 cells....  these people have a new strain of a virus they've spent their lives "researching"....  thats the foundational reasoning put forth in these initial papers. )
      </p>
      <p>
       (Second note, the people that do some digging into this industry often become very public targets... far incongruent with what you see in other industries...  Like if someone says ALS isn't real, or Polio is caused by chemicals.... they dont become the result of organized media smear campaigns, violent emails from pharmaceutical lobbyists, hacking attempts from Los Alamos National Laboratory, cutting of all grants for research (these all have happened to people, as you can see in the above links) Theres a clear, organized, and ruthless opposition force to this line of thinking... which when combined with the shakiness of their foundational papers... has me thinking if it looks like a house of cards, walks like a house of cards, talks like a house of cards.... then its probably a house of cards)
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Its been fun arguing with some of you. Even with all this arguing and banter.... none of you have directly addressed the issue of fraud here in this paper... you've all diverted the argument away from the blaring evidence of fraud that no one has answered to and the people involved continue to siphon billions of dollars away from the coffers of the american tax payer endlessly and hopelessly hunting and claiming to cure a phantom plauge.  And while we ended up with - votes... we did get quite a few upvotes... which means theres more people out there asking questions that nobody in this industry is capable of giving answers for.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2: Well i only lost 400 or so karma from arguing this... not bad... fuck me right?

       Ok. But what is your point? This paper was written almost 30 years ago. There are hundreds, if not thousands more recent papers that elucidate HIV and its role in CD4 cell infection (via gp120). Regardless of how it kills immune cells (it undoubtedly kills some via viral budding), the fact is that cd4 cell numbers drop. Once you get below 200 cd4/mm
       <sup>

       in your blood, you have aids. It's a somewhat abstract definition of the disease, but that's what it is. I actually have a virology exam tomorrow, so this is relevant to my interests. On my phone now and can't provide sources, but would love to continue this conversation later
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit- if your point is that HIV was created by the gov, maybe it was, I have no clue. But you seem to be arguing that HIV might not cause aids, which I do not believe to be the case. Btw, certainly not boring! Scientists make stuff up all the time. Check out
       <a href="http://www.science-fraud.org">
        www.science-fraud.org

       . Anyone who does research will appreciate and laugh at the blatant copying/pasting of bands on electrophoresis gels
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I'm pressed for time and can't read the whole paper, but the "various reasons" statement probably was inferred  by what they knew about the virus. Aids won't kill you, but the fact that it attacks your immune system means you are susceptible to other infections.

        HIV is thought to be derived from a simian immunodeficiency virus and is genetically most similar to a chimpanzee virus. In fact, HIV-2 is similar to simian immunodeficiency virus. The initial human infection occurred  in Africa in the 1930s but went unnoticed in rural areas. The migration of infected people to the cities after the 1960's brough the virus into population centers and cultural acceptance of prostitution promoted its transmission throughout the population

       The Fogh article, if you had read it, was discussing contamination in cell cultures in the 1970's, specifically fungal, viral, mycoplasm, etc. You said viral contamination was very widespread whereas in the review paper it is actually lower with no HTLV-1 or 2 reported.

       i quoted the original article.  "Although patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS are often chronically infected with cytomegalovirus and hepatits B virus, for various reasons these appear to be opportunistic or coincidental infections."  and   "Virus isolation and seroepidemiological data show that both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 can sometimes be found in patients with AIDS"  you know as well as I do, when you're hunting virus... sometimes is a lot.

       Lets make it clear that the assumption made at the time was that there was a new agent, based on the ones which all of them had spent their lives researching, in the mixture of viruses.... that was causing them to get sick..... not that these people lifestyles were causing them to be exposed to all these nasty virus's and causing them to get sick....  the former reasoning requires the assumption of existence of a new agent... for which they had absolutely NO EVIDENCE existed, much less was causing illness....  the latter requires no leap of faith. one is clearly a more sound scientific argument.

       Lets face it, whatever killed people in the 1980s IS NOT WHAT HIV/AIDS is today. There are, according to their statistics, millions of UNDIAGNOSED cases of HIV where no treatment is ever sought. Yet there are not droves and droves of people dying from strange fungal pneumonias and strange skin cancers.... That only happened in the 80s. It doesn't happen anymore. I think HIV probably was the industry created to hide what really killed those people in the early 80s. It would explain why Los Alamos National Laboratory.... the weapons research lab of the US government..... is so intimately connected with this disease.... it explains why your reference for what constitutes an HIV genome comes solely from this lab.... it explains why your only source of HIV for research purposes is the NIH HIV Reagents program. They give you the HIV reagents for use with their HIV test kits. DUH?! C'mon people, this is pretty obviously snake oil.

       Of course that doesn't happen anymore: HAART therapy was invented in the mid-90s... Most of people are diagnosed well before developing any symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, for those like me who are diagnosed only when they start to develop AIDS (the immunodeficiency syndrome), the weird infections do appear, and sometimes are mortal. In 2010 I had pneumocystosis - caused by a micobacterium wich is normally harmless - and I know of at leat one other person in my social circle who died of JC virus, also in a case of late diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you survive those problems, though, HAART therapy drops the virus count to nearly indetectable levels and the CD4 cells quick back to appreciable levels. No more weird infections then.

       No drug use, unless you consider alcohool (no abuse, occasional drinks) and cigarretes (no chain-smoking, actually I often take a week to end a pack). So you believe in the "drugs cause AIDS" theory? Man, I know people that don't even drink and had it...

       Oh, yes, by the way I just remembered a study from the mid 2000s showing that HIV got less virulent/damaging over time, so that could also help explaining why the infections got less common/severe over time. But you don't have to discard HIV as a cause because of that - in fact, most new diseases get less damaging over time because that actually increases the chances of the pathogen for surviving and thriving in new hosts. This has hapenned with syphilis, for instance, which was really horrible centuries ago and nowadays is even kind of assymptomatic in a sizeable portion of the hosts.

       No I don't think any single one of these things causes AIDS... i do think the collective of them has an effect of stressing ones immune system to the point where they will test positive to HIV tests or catch one of the

        cofactors known to cause false positives

       .  Look its your life, your body, your decision...  but the evidence for the counter is pretty compelling....
      </p>
      <p>
       promiscuity would actually lend you to the conclusion that you caught a lot of known pathogens through body fluids and got sick through the collective effect of that... not that theres an unproven, elusive microscopic agent causing your immune system to fail 10 years after introduction.

       But other DST pathogens that I caught - and IIRC there are not many of them - were actually diagnosed and treated over time, years before the 2010 event. Also, other DSTs were far more prevalent in the population before (for instance) antibiotics - why there wasn't AIDS then?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah, yes, there are other venues for being exposed to lots of pathogens and getting a depressed immune system. Wouldn't for instance doctors/nurses, workers at sewer plants, workers in the nuclear industry, etc, etc, be at higher risk of developing AIDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if you think that HIV doesn't cause it, how do you explain HAART therapy working so incredibly well? Before I was diagnosed, I suffered for months with strange intestinal problems (that the doctors were pretty lousy at diagnose correctly, nowadays apparently AIDS is the last thing that they think of) until having the pneumocistosis and other characteristic infections (for instance an aggressive herpes attack). Then, one month after starting the HAART therapy, all those problems disappeared magically and I started to regain weight. (I was a beefcake before and became a stick man after loosing 30 pounds. Now I am a slightly overweight beefcake - 6 feet x 180 pounds.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you think that HIV is not the cause, then you think that HAART is not what it is said to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that I am not being rude by asking all of that, I am just trying to understand your POV. To be sincere I don't think that I will get convinced of your theory :), but I try at least to be open to other explanations.

       i dunno. ima say your lifestyle is chronically infecting you with a lot of different diseases..... and HAART combats them all very generally (by interfering with their ability to reproduce). Im saying the evidence that supports there is a mystical agent responsible for this known as HIV is not solid scientifically and has significant signs of fraud everywhere you look around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its perfectly plausible that your lifestyle leads to being chronically infected with a host of other pathogens, and HAART is a very good general combatant of them. We don't need a mystical virus known as HIV for that to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I respect your ability to choose your health care and wish you best of luck. In any event, the days when their medications were responsible for killing you seem to have come to an end. Just be thankful you didn't catch the disease when they told you that a high dose of AZT would solve it.... you'd probably not be alive now.

       Well it sounds like hes been introduced to pneumocystis, agressive herpes, and some other "other DST pathogens that I caught". I mean it just seems to me the collective illness from these pathogens alone could have any number of effects on an individuals immune system. Also he states he has continued promiscuity. Which if your exchanging fluids with a guy thats also readily exchanging fluids...  thats a good buffer for continuous infections/reinfections of all sorts.

       Oh ok. So you really don't know.

      <p>
       You think theres no such thing as the HIV virus so therefore it doesn't exist.

      <p>
       Its just super herpes..right?

       AIDS isn't like the common cold. The guy has got it. We only call it aids because it represents a status of the immunological system but when you have HIV, your immune system is already compromised. AIDS just tells you how much and to what degree.

       I listened to Duesberg on JRE. Basically, it was bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Rogan admitted that he didn't know enough to really challenge Duesberg but he knew something was fishy. I at least admire his honesty in that regard.

       Duesberg didn't really have shit to say to even support his claims.

       Lol he refuted all of Bryans arguments. I'm definitley not agreeing with this guy but I can see that he was smart and knew waaay too much for me to conclusivey say he's wrong. Its like arguing with a butcher about meat. He had evidence a good backround and lost a lot because of it.

       Ok my initial comment was just to get you to see the other side. I hate people that see a side that sounds right because it common knowledge and act as if a dissenting voice is wrong even with evidence. That's what I thought you were doing but it seema like I was wrong.

       So this is where this starts getting bizarre.
       <a href="http://fauxcapitalist.com/2011/08/27/george-whitehurst-berry-of-crash-are-you-ready-interviews-on-the-aids-scam/">
        See this guys set of interviews
       </a>
       , where he puts Deusburg up against, not other scientists, but other more extreme HIV conspiracy theorists. The whole thing is fucking absurd. The podcast is also SUPER irritating to get through with its commercials and strange sound effects. i only made it through the one podcast with deusburg and the other dudes. One of the weirder things I've heard in my life.  This guy issues like a biblical damnation against Deusburg.  where he claims to have evidence that Deusburg and Gallo are playing for the same team, namely a company they both worked for, Litton Bionetics and manufactured a cancer virus that was released either purposfully or accidentally to the population via the "Special Virus Cancer Program".... shit gets real strange at this point.

       im not saying anything in regards to the existence of the aforementioned virus.... im saying the science put forth as proving its existence is RIFE with verifiable fraud and thats caused a lot of speculation as to why that might be.... ranging from the virus doesn't exist, to the virus being government engineered, to the virus as existing but not being harmful...
      </p>
      <p>
       me personally, after reviewing the evidence, it looks like a bunch of gay men were poisoned by a vaccination program in the late 1970s... and they built up this industry around this "virus" to hide what they did. the thing that killed people in the 1980s.... that isn't around anymore... no one dies like that anymore.  droves of people are not getting weird skin cancers. they're not getting strange fungal pneumonias... they are healthy and testing positive to their bullshit test, for which they begin to take medications which in turn make them sick. This industry is based over a very very clever and subtle slight of hand.  But the facts and history do not lie.

       We encountered AIDS before that because we can look back at what killed people and change or assessment of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, aids doesn't kill you. It makes you susceptible to further infection.

       Im arguing the industry responsible for generating these numbers is founded on a very clear case of fraud for which no one has been held accountable.  There is no verification of these numbers they generate, and the methods which they use to generate them are often terrible. One thing is for certain, people are not dying in DROVES from wasting, kaposi sarcoma, or PCP like they were in the early 1980s, here or in Africa.  There remains tons of untested cases according to their science, yet there is not a ton of people presenting with these symptoms....

       So you believe HIV exists, just that what was infecting people in the 80s wasn't HIV?  What do you actually believe because all you say is that the research is wrong but you don't deny that lots of people world wide are still dying from it.

       something certainly existed that killed a bunch of people rapidly in the early 1980s. Whether that was a new virus, or simply a bunch of old ones, or some kind of obscure reaction to a vaccination program, or the result of the high dose AZT treatment they were given.... I do not know.....I do know, however, there is nothing that is infecting people that is functioning like the virus they originally claimed to be fighting.  And it is this inconsistency, especially given the amount of money poured into this industry, and the amount of drugs they are responsible for pouring into third world countries in africa.... that we need to be looking into with a finer scope.

       AZT was a largely experimental drug, as are ALL drugs that treat viruses because of their inherent danger.

       Even further, AZT isn't the only aids drug out there.

       This is how I KNOW you're not trained in any formal methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
       People didn't know what they were dealing with until decades later. They have samples going back to the 30s I believe that they later analyzed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, as with mutated viruses, you don't always find patient zero but you can trace them as far back as possible.

       Alois Alzheimer didn't have immunology to determine that there was beta amyloid plaques in his patients brains but he did recognize that silver staining showed abnormalities. Even to this day his samples have been analyzed using modern technology and using immunology have been shown to contain beta amyloid plaques in patients suffering neurodegenerative complications
      </p>
      <p>
       He also might not have known what specifically he had found in those autopsy samples but he knew it was different from control brains. Too bad it would have to wait until the 1970's for the proper technology to surface and allow a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease being different from senility.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR not the first time in science or medicine that something had been found before proper technology

       You don't get to say HIV is really super herpes without understanding how herpes actually works or affects the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       HIV affects the body in a way that no other disease does. Herpes doesn't attack white blood cells.

       i didn't say HIV is really super herpes did I?  I said the person said he a super herpes outbreak. Signifying he had herpes. And that combined with all the other shit he apparently has had might have a negative cumulative effect on the effectiveness of his immune system.

       they are dying from a large swath of AIDS defining illnesses... apparently... these are all estimates, and you can do a lot of things with estimates...   id say the kids in africa are probably mostly dying from lack of access to clean water and proper nutrition, along with repeated exposure to unsanitary sewer/waste....   and we're just saying this is AIDS... when it really its just living in squalor thats killing them.

       well ill leave it as an exercise to the reader to validate if that estimate's methodology...... which i reproduced below.... is an accurate or inaccurate estimation:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Calculation of Person-Years Lost/AIDS Patients
       </p>
       <p>
        The authors first estimated the number of persons who were eligible to receive ARV treatment by obtaining the number of deaths from AIDS in South Africa for the period 2000-2005 from UNAIDS. Patients with AIDS who died without getting treatment lost the entire average benefit of ARV therapy. Data regarding individuals who received ARV therapy in South Africa between 2000 and 2005 were obtained from the UNAIDS and WHO ‘‘3 by 5' records (23% in 2005, less than 10% in 2004, 3% in 2003, and less than 3% for preceding years). The authors propose that South Africa could have started an ARV treatment program in 2000, covering not more than 5% of persons who needed therapy but ramping up the coverage as drugs became less expensive and more international resources became available to 50% coverage by 2005. This estimate is lower that the coverage achieved by both Botswana and Namibia. Then they estimated the average life-years that ARV therapy adds to patients with AIDS in Africa, based on primary studies, a meta-analysis, and a comparison with developed countries. The authors calculated that 2.2 million person-years were lost in South Africa from 2000 to 2005 by not implementing a feasible and timely ARV treatment program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Calculation of Person-Years Lost/Mother-to-Child Transmission Prevention Failure
       </p>
       <p>
        The authors estimated the number of children infected with HIV through vertical transmission, using data from the Actuarial Society of South Africa AIDS and Demographic Model and reducing that number to account for HIV prevalence in South Africa with population growth in mind. They estimated mother-to-child transmission prevention coverage using data from the PMTCT Task Team in South Africa and the Health Systems Trust. The research team assumed that it was feasible for South Africa to start a mother-to-child transmission prevention program in 2000, given that nevirapine was available for free, and estimated a ramping up to about 55% coverage by 2005. This estimate is less than the coverage achieved by both Namibia and Botswana. They used the HIV Network for Prevention Trials 012 trial, which showed that single-dose nevirapine decreased transmission by 47% compared with oral ZDV in a breastfeeding population. To estimate the person-years lost per case of HIV transmitted, the authors assumed a life expectancy of 48 years and then subtracted the average survival of an HIV-infected baby without ARV treatment. The authors estimated that 1.6 million person-years were lost in South Africa from 2000 to 2005 by not implementing a mother-to-child transmission prophylaxis program using nevirapine

       Having reviewed this methodology I consider it relatively sound. They probably under estimate the amount of improvement that could have been achieved in South Africa, but they admit this. The only way this estimate could be severely mistaken is if you assume that AIDS was not the causative factor in the deaths they are reporting on or that ARV is not actually effective; the latter is not supported by their analagous data from Namibia, Botswana, and developed nations that they reference; the former is unlikely to have resulted in a very dramatic overestimation.

       Id like to see this calculation. Help? I dont see where they are getting this value... where are the primary studies and meta analysis... where is the comparison to developed countries?  did they account for the fact that living in africa is inherently more dangerous than developed nations and control for it in their calculations?

       If you had formal science training, you would recognise that the above is an excerpt from a published paper, the full copy of which you would have to read in order to check their calculations.

       This is all part of the regular peer review process, and to fully critique the authors findings you would have to access or be familiar with the data sources they have used, which is why generally peer review is carried out by experts in the relevant field.
      </p>
      <p>
       When everyone here gets annoyed at you for not having any qualification, this is the reason; aspects of your argument rest on such a basic misunderstanding of the facts, findings and processes of the science you're referring to that it hampers any meaningful discussion.

       Well, no shit, because good luck getting anyone to be the "untreated" patient in that study.  Essentially 100% of everyone who is diagnosed treats.  Those who aren't diagnosed would not be a part of any such study because they don't know they have it.

         AIDS denialists will also demand even more specific evidence, only to change the demand once the evidence is produced. One example of this “pushing back the goalpost” technique was the former Sunday Times journalist and prominent AIDS denier Neville Hodgkinson’s claim that HIV tests are invalid because HIV has never been isolated. When scientists provided evidence that HIV has been isolated, the demand changed; Hodgkinson argued that the isolated virus was “impure”. Denialists now demand that the virus be isolated in “pure form”, that is uncontaminated by proteins. The demand for a pure virus devoid of cellular proteins is impossible to meet as it defies the biological nature of viruses. Such shifting of the grounds of debate allows denialists to claim that they are the ones following the evidence, and it is the AIDS establishment – an alliance of careerist researchers and greedy drugs companies – who are propagating pseudoscience.

        <em>
         In the 1980s legitimate scientists disagreed about AIDS. For AIDS deniers, everything old is new again. AIDS denialists rely on selected research findings from the days when not much was known about AIDS. The first tests for HIV antibodies were less reliable than current testing technologies. There were early debates about what caused AIDS and good ideas that turned out to be dead ends. The drug AZT was prescribed in massive and often toxic doses. But none of this is true any more. Though there remain many debates in medical science about how HIV causes AIDS, there is no longer a debate about whether HIV causes AIDS. Unfortunately, outdated scientific literature is not purged when new knowledge emerges. AIDS deniers use this information to create the illusion of a live debate. Denialists select old findings that support their flawed logic because they have no evidence of their own. Cherrypicking is another favourite rhetorical technique of denialists. This involves selecting a lone scientific finding, presenting the results out of context, and deploying it as evidence for their own conclusions.

       I've met a number of researchers in this area in my country, Australia; they were infants when HIV was first detected, and our country played no part in determining the foundational science, nor do they or our country stand to profit significantly from HIV treatment, and yet these people, intelligent people with years of specialized study, advise that HIV is a virus which causes AIDS. These people could not be so roundly duped, and so must be complicit in your conspiracy; what motivation could make them so committed?

       The Perth Group makes a wide range of poorly substantiated claims and I don't have time to refute them all, nor would it advance this discussion as there are an infinite number of erroneous contentions one could demand to require refutation before accepting an already well established scientific position.
      </p>
      <p>
       On their website the Perth Group claim three ways that this contention could be resolved; one is for their claims to be heard in court.
       <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perth_Group">
        This did in fact happen, and their evidence was thrown out of court after it was found to be ridiculous

       calling for the withdraw of these papers... I didn't invent this.... im just reiterating what these scientists have concluded.

      <p>
       Also, this area of interest, i clearly state, I find rather uninteresting.... Its fairly clear that the US Government through a lot of money at this problem for some reason, offered a treatment for it, which in turn was responsible for the quick deaths of millions of unsuspecting people. NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THESE PEOPLES MURDERS. If this did interest me, I would become a lawyer....  [see this is where i inspire the one guy reading this to become a lawyer and get filthy rich on taking these people down]

       A fallacy? So now your claim goes as far as to say that there is actually no benefit to education at all? A person can't gain greater insight into a field through education? Clearly this is a ridiculous position to hold.

       Looking at the letter you referenced, it only calls into question the initial article by Gallo, which was roundly criticized for stealing data from the French researchers who did successfully and unambiguously show the existence of a virus, which they called LAV, which we now identify as HIV. Sure, Gallo was not ideally professional, but that in no way takes away from the French research. How does this letter, produced largely by poorly regarded scientists, make any real difference to this discussion?

       Right. That's the fraud that he was officially on the hook for. But his edits show that he should have been on the hook for a lot more including outright making up key components of the paper up 2 weeks before it was published without evidence. He changed the conclusion without any evidence.

       Dude you have no evidence suggesting the more than 30 signatories are poorly regarded. The reader can judge for themselves how poorly regarded that many TENURED professors at major universities and medical schools around the country are..... How would one even determine that.

       I'm not defending Gallo, but his issues don't actually harm the body of evidence supporting HIV at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may have been overzealous with my criticism; the letter over steps it's bounds, which makes it's quality suspicious; the first signatory, usually the most esteemed, has no academic affiliation; I could not find any trace of the letter having been published or referenced in a peer reviewed or academic source. These failings, in particular the latter two, made me feel safe to assume that either the other signatories were not experts in this field or were duped into signing this letter without the knowledge that it would be used to attempt to deny the role of HIV in AIDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that the letter in question presents no relevant criticisms of our understanding of HIV, this is a moot point.

       The letter in question is indeed all over the internet, but is not addressed on any reliable academic source, which makes it highly suspect. As stated, if accurate, it does not call into question our understanding of HIV, which makes it somewhat irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having just done a quick search of the first 6 or so signatories, I found that only one of them has an ongoing academic affiliation, in an unrelated field, and the others were retired, in particular, one retired fellow with a background in chemistry, not biology, also dedicated himself to the hunt for the Lach Ness Monster. I feel this is sufficient to show the calibre of these signatories.

       Mullis invented PCR.... and since they use PCR in one of their tests... that gives him a little bit of expertise... I encourage the reader to watch the countless interviews with Mullis.... trying to represent him as a nut is so far off base its insulting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Geshekter is an an expert on the cultural problems in Africa. Hes on the ground there understanding what exactly goes on. And its in his professional opinion, that the people there are being sold a line of bullshit about HIV.  I mean hes seeing the effect of the industry over there... and its his opinion that they are not looking at a plague that is helped by their aids tests or drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also your arguments about these people not being connected to HIV research... they are all classically trained scientist... theres nothing in the HIV research these people don't grasp.  The people that are making objections are making objections about VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS OF HIV AIDS RESEARCH. I mean Mullis will talk to you about issues with the 1.16 density gradient....  its pretty clear he knows exactly whats going on from a scientific standpoint. They clearly grasp the material enough to point out accurate flaws in the industry's reasoning.

       Firstly, the people you have described have added significantly to the application of technologies, as well as economic growth, but have only indirectly influenced science through their investments. Furthermore, the little actual science they may have contributed was in early computing, before there was a large formally trained academic community, and these people are all independently extremely bright.
      </p>
      <p>
       It disappoints me that you're getting so worked up; I've put up with your aggravating claims all this time, trying to refute them with calm discussion; please pay me the same courtesy.

       Finally, I wouldn't want any identifying characteristics; simply broad strokes. It would be quite easy to find me in real life from my reddit history, but assuming that I was more concerned with privacy I would feel comfortable divulging that I am a mid 20's white male from an upper middle class background. I live in Victoria, Australia. I am heterosexual and have a long term partner. I work as a waiter part time. I graduated high school in the top 0.35% of my state. I received a bachelors degree in science majoring in Pharmacology, Human Pathology and Immunology. I am now in my final year of medical school. I have no history of mental illness.

       look who i am or where i am from is unimportant. we both know thats a very convincing argument for fraud that i reiterated in my post and it has been swept under the rug for a reason. US Tax payers continue to pay billions to this industry for which there is no REGULATORY body. These people are not answering to anyone, yet they are completely funded by the public's funds, and selling the public drugs and tests for which there are some very serious scientific questions brought up that they have deflected and never answered directly. There is no doubt the same guys who were in charge of it when they suggested high dose AZT responsible for killing millions are still in charge of it today. Specific questions about the process used in the isolation and purification of the virus around the 1.16 density gradient band have not been answered, and the answers to these questions are CRUCIAL in determining if what they are looking at is random cellular crap or actually an infectious agent.  Specific questions about the non specificity of p24 detection in samples as representing a positive test have NEVER BEEN ANSWERED by these people. They always respond with epidemiological studies of questionable integrity.... never anything that specifically addresses the science of the methods they are using. The public needs to know why.

       Who you are and where you are from is highly relevant; if you're a young kid with the internet, these ideas are forgiveable and likely changeable; if you have a previous diagnosis with schizophrenia these ideas are likely dismissable and unchangeable; if you have a university degree, particularly a science degree, you might be receptive to more in depth analysis of this field, without one the amount of information we would have to cover might be insurmountable. If you are an American your ideas are less likely to be changeable; if you have a long term partner it shows that you must have at least some social skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fraud you identified was irrelevant as it didn't call into question other independent verification of the existence of HIV.

      <p>
       There are of course many regulatory bodies for the pharmaceutical industry, here in Australia we have the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is slightly more thorough than the US FDA.
      </p>
      <p>
       "These people" are answerable to the scientific community, and there is lively informed discussion going on all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no "same guys" in charge of it at all; HIV treatment is a worldwide process decided and managed by a large number of independent bodies.

       Its been the same set of people since the beginning. It is not worldwide. You know where you get HIV to do research on? The NIH. There is only one source. You get it from the NIH HIV Reagents program. And you test samples for the presence of HIV, using ELISA and Western Blot tests provided to you by the NIH who more than likely gave you a grant to do the research so they know exactly what you will be doing with their virus.

       This claim is so bizarre and misguided that it is hard to think of how to discuss it.
       <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/infectious-diseases/poverty-diseases/projects/39_en.htm">
        Europe has it's own reagent group
       </a>
       , this was found with a cursory google, my impression is that there is a far wider variety of HIV reagent manufacturers all throughout the world, although I feel this is enough to categorically disprove your claim that the NIH is the only source of HIV samples.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a large number of independent manufacturers of HIV ELISA, western blot and PCR kits,
       <a href="http://www.zeptometrix.com/elisas.htm">
        here's a company that sells it's own ELISA kit
       </a>
       , one of many. If I wanted to, I could make my own HIV ELISA with the skills I learnt in my final year practical immunology labs. Throughout the world there are a large number of research funding bodies, so a lot of non-NIH research is being done. This idea of a centralized conspiracy is really way out of left field and I hope you'll desist with it.

       okay so maybe theres another one...  not that this has any bearing on the argument, but can you get hiv reagents from a non government source i wonder?  where can i get hiv infected lymphocytes... is that what reagents are? what exactly is in the reagent samples?

       if there are millions of undiagnosed cases of HIV... then there should be millions of people presenting with the illnesses we saw people presenting with in the early 80s. Namely PCP and kaposi sarcoma. People rarely get or present with either of these anymore. Yet if theres a bunch of undiagnosed people, there should be a bunch of people presenting with these illnesses....but there isn't.  The illness in the 1980s doesn't exist anymore.

       Thats not how this works.

      <p>
       HIV has a long latency period and even then, if these people still went untested, then you'd see more people presented with diseases that they'd normally be shielded from.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER, with a large campaign, even with people who don't protect themselves, to get regular check ups, we intervene with aids far sooner than we would have in the 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even further, advances in drugs and immunizations and treatments since then have allowed us to prevent susceptibility to HIV associated diseases since then...including respiratory diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       People still do present with these diseases...
       <strong>
        <em>
         BUT
        </em>
       </strong>
       since people know more about AIDS than ever before people are getting checkups more frequently than before and intervening long before you'd see major cases of people falling prey to these things as we saw in the past when NO ONE would go to the doctor for ANYTHING.

       Here is my reasoning:
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people die precipitously of previously harmless pathogens in what we call AIDS, they test positive for HIV. Other individuals exposed to these people by blood or sex also start to test positive for HIV; many of them also develop AIDS. People exposed to those HIV positive people who don't have AIDS also begin to test positive for HIV and many of these people develop AIDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who have developed AIDS have very low CD4 counts and also have high blood levels of HIV. We have drugs which reduce HIV levels in patients and this causes an increase in CD4 level in these patients, which coincides in a reduction of their symptoms, despite their symptoms being apparently due to pathogens not affected by these drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even if there were some inconsistencies in the original HIV science; I see no reason, given the observations above and the evidence you presented not to accept that there is a transmissible immunodeficiency causing organism which we call HIV which can be treated but not cured with the available anti-retrovirals.

       Here's my issue with your response: With my major in Pharmacology, Immunology and Human Pathology I have a good working understanding of these tests and how they work and yet you claim that all these tests are illegitimate; presumably any conspiracy which is able to fool the entire world into thinking that HIV testing is legitimate would also be able to falsify any other scientific data.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask for a study supporting my claim; I can't present you with any appropriate study; not because one doesn't exist; but because if your other claims are true, the conspiracy would have to be so powerful that any study I produce to counter your claims could be easily called into question.

       "The chronic nature of the disease allows the use of serologic tests to document HIV infection as supplemented by genomic detection and quantification using PCR-related techniques. Unfortunately, serologic test cannot identify recently infected people. HIV is very difficult to grow in tissue culture, and virus isolation is not performed. Recent infection or late-stage disease is indicated by the presence of large quantities of viral RNA in blood samples, the p24 viral antigen, or the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Viral RNA in blood can be detected by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, real-time PCR, and related methods. Blood levels of viral RNA are also useful as a monitor for the success of antiviral drug therapy. "

       The subreddit itself? Nah. Most conspiracies here are actually quite entertaining. Even the antisemites and holocaust deniers that regularly rear their ugly heads here are ultimately harmless (at least I'm pretty sure that they're either not deranged enough or too incompetent to start any pogroms).
      </p>
      <p>
       But AIDS/HIV denial (and related topics, e.g. "alternative" medicine for cancer) is a different beast altogether. Regardless of whether it's for profiteering off vulnerable people or out of a genuine but horrifically misguided sense of goodwill, this is absolutely harmful and dangerous. People are dying because they refuse lifesaving medicine, and people like you are to blame.

       You disgust me. You have no credentials whatsoever and all your "knowledge" comes from cherry-picking wrong or obsolete internet articles, yet you dare to purport yourself as more knowledgeable than the entire medical community and to give harmful medical advice. I sincerely hope you realize just how wrong you are before someone in need of help believes in your lies.

You know, informed consent type thing.... I hope people do take me seriously and they do bring up these objections with their medical professional... and he is able to give them a satisfactory explanation that addresses the issues these people bring up.

       I like how i respond to something then yall edit it and it makes me sound stupid.  ive given no one medical advice. i have not cherry picked obsolete internet articles. THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF FRAUD IN GALLO'S OWN HAND IN THE FOUNDATIONAL HIV RESEARCH. Theres no if and or but about it dude. THAT'S FACT.

       Well, this post in particular will probably not change anyone's mind for the worse, especially after all the dissent offered here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But imagine you just got a HIV positive diagnosis and, devastated as you'd be, turn to the internet to get your bearings. You'll find posts like his, which at a glance seem well though out, researched, sourced, and filled with appropriate terminology. And perhaps most importantly, he's telling you what you'd like to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not this guy alone, it's an entire industry of idiots who created this bizarre parallel world and give the appearance of legitimate controversy around HIV/AIDS when there is none. I think it's important to make it unequivocally clear that this guy is a loon who has no idea what he's talking about, and that even on a conspiracy forum everyone calls him out for his bullshit.

       Uh there is a very legitimate controversy surround HIV. There are scientists and journalists that have had their careers RUINED by this industry for simply asking questions. THAT IS A SURE SIGN THERE IS SOMETHING AFOOT IN THIS INDUSTRY.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY IS OUR GOVERNMENT SO HEAVILY INVESTED IN THIS INDUSTRY WHEN THERE IS NOT THE PLAUGE/OUTBREAK THEY CLAIMED THERE WOULD BE? ITS A SIMPLE FUCKING QUESTION.

       I'm done arguing this with you fucking idiots.... continue to believe in their bullshit and pay for your 60 dollar test that tells you absolutely nothing.... you know who holds the patent on that test... the US and French Governments.... honestly..... they came up with that test in a little over a year.... in the 1980s.... no email.... no internet.... just DOS/Unix and a rudimentary word processor.   give me a break... these people didn't develop shit in the 1980s... they fabricated it....  told people they were going to die... then gave them meds that killed them.

       Also like to point out, you didn't directly address the issues of BLARING FRAUD IN THEIR FOUNDATIONAL PAPERS, which is what my post is trying to illustrate.

       Mullis goes as far to say they are misusing the technology he invented and won a nobel prize for as evidence proving their virus exists....  You simply cannot use PCR to amplify an unknown agent.... they are clearly adding a piece of information to the puzzle for which there is no source.... that is the genome of HIV.
       <a href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index">
        Why does the weapons laboratory (Los Alamos National Laboratory) of our government maintain a database of HIV genomes?
       </a>
       How did they determine these genomes..... they don't tell you how anywhere on this site.  Just that these primers are HIV.... again we cant show you how we know that... just that they are what we will give you in the HIV you receive from our HIV Reagent Program - the only research source of HIV.

       Yea but the reason he was found guilty isn't the whole story of the fraud found in that original research. He got off the hook for a much greater fraud. Which is kinda what i write about in the original post. Giving specific examples of that fraud. No division fallacy required.  Im not cherry picking shit. I read the paper. I read the edits. The edits make it very clear he is fabricating the shit out of that paper. A lot more than misrepresenting he used Luc Montagnier's samples. Thats all you need people.

       look i don't know about you... but there should be ZERO cases of misconduct if you want me to bet the house on your hypothesis being accurate.

       The ONLY thing Gallo did wrong was take credit for the discovery of HIV...but HIV causing AIDS has been long supported.

       The question wasn't if HIV exists or if it causes AIDS. The only thing in question was who gets credit for it: The USA or the French.

       Or they did some more research and found he was right. BTW, HHS didn't file the charge. It was ORI and NIH.
In order to say politics were involved, you'd need to publish some transcripts of politicians being involved. Of which, you have presented none.

       I read it and you cherry picked that quote. You conviently left out how he put in sources for his claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the actual quote:
""Although patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS are often chronically infected with cytomegalovirus (7) and hepatits B virus (8), for various reasons these appear to be opportunistic or coincidental infections."
      </p>
      <p>
       You also fail to mention how later in the paper he shows the results of Essex and Lee,which show that patients diagnosed with AIDS had weakened immune systems and whose blood samples showed no signs of any other HTLV (the only type of virus found to weaken immune systems at the time) known at the time. Opportunistic infections happen when the immune system is weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if your quote does show some merit, thinking that one quote disproves the entirety of Gallo's paper would be a "fallacy" fallacy.

       It's called logic. Gallo's sources showed that the AIDs patients had weakened immune systems due to their infection and showed no signs of having a known HTLV. He showed that the virus he was researching weakened immune systems. Herpes and hepatitis B do not weaken immune systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, if hep and herp didn't cause the weakened immune systems, what did?
      </p>
      <p>
       As Gallo showed, it was HIV.

       There is evidence suggesting Ms Roberts called and talked with Larry Stewart. That is her own testimony. Unless Ms. Roberts credibility is in question, which no one has shown a case where it is. Ms Roberts is a wonderfully well documented journalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       also... if there was a part of her book that was libelous or slanderous or down right fabricated....  its been almost 5 years since Gallo responded to it himself, yet no suit of libel or slander has been brought against this woman.... theres a reason for that.

       Cool circumstantial evidence and shifting the burden of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still haven't given a transcript from Roberts or testimony from Stewart confirming this exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also haven't shown us the "report" the Secret Service made refuting Gallo.
      </p>

       You also have yet to refute Montagnier's results, Gallo's results and the other peer-reviewed studies on HIV.

       Thats not how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       HIV has a long latency period and even then, if these people still went untested, then you'd see more people presented with diseases that they'd normally be shielded from.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER, with a large campaign, even with people who don't protect themselves, to get regular check ups, we intervene with aids far sooner than we would have in the 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even further, advances in drugs and immunizations and treatments since then have allowed us to prevent susceptibility to HIV associated diseases since then...including respiratory diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       People still do present with these diseases...
       <strong>
        <em>
         BUT
        </em>
       </strong>
       since people know more about AIDS than ever before people are getting checkups more frequently than before and intervening long before you'd see major cases of people falling prey to these things as we saw in the past when NO ONE would go to the doctor for ANYTHING.

       look who i am or where i am from is unimportant. we both know thats a very convincing argument for fraud that i reiterated in my post and it has been swept under the rug for a reason. US Tax payers continue to pay billions to this industry for which there is no REGULATORY body. These people are not answering to anyone, yet they are completely funded by the public's funds, and selling the public drugs and tests for which there are some very serious scientific questions brought up that they have deflected and never answered directly. There is no doubt the same guys who were in charge of it when they suggested high dose AZT responsible for killing millions are still in charge of it today. Specific questions about the process used in the isolation and purification of the virus around the 1.16 density gradient band have not been answered, and the answers to these questions are CRUCIAL in determining if what they are looking at is random cellular crap or actually an infectious agent.  Specific questions about the non specificity of p24 detection in samples as representing a positive test have NEVER BEEN ANSWERED by these people. They always respond with epidemiological studies of questionable integrity.... never anything that specifically addresses the science of the methods they are using. The public needs to know why.
