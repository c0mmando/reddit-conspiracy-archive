       I refer to the concept that within the United States of America, the driver's license is not required by the average citizen to drive their cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a whole community of people who fight these legal battles with quite a few different tactics. Basically ordinary citizens who research the laws, and fight the court battles without lawyers (representing themselves)
      </p>
      <p>
       The general gist of the legal argument is that the ordinary driver's license is commercial in nature (meaning only really required for commercial drivers) and therefore the average "Joe" doesn't need one to get to and from work, the store, family, the bar, wherever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself have joined in and have learned how to win in court (beaten 9 out of 11 traffic citations - one is still in appeals court).  I haven't renewed my license since it expired in 2008.  I love court argument and motion writing and I've learned a LOT about law.  It's now one of my hobbies and I love spreading the word and seeing how people react when I tell them I "drive" without a license.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the SUPER short version of the argument:
The American Citizen has a right to travel.  The American Citizen has a right to own and use property in the way in which it was intended.  The American Citizen has a right to the use of the public roads.  Therefore the American Citizen has a right to use their property (cars) to travel (driving) on the public roads.  No law may infringe upon a right.  No law may turn a right into a privilege or charge a fee for the exercise of a right.  Therefore, no driver's license required.  Along with this comes all the traffic citation laws (they would only apply to commercial drivers as well)  And basically, if you don't cause damage or harm to someone else's property or person, you can drive however you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can back this up with actual law, and would be glad to point out the arguments, however I'm from Texas and as such all specifics are Texas based.  BUT each state has basically the same laws, just worded slightly different.  As such, you can fight these things pretty much anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider it a conspiracy because it affects the whole country and it unlawfully rakes in tons of money from people every year through the use of our legal system.  The insurance industry is heavily invested in keeping the traffic tickets flowing forth so that they can raise rates as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd really just like to know who all out there has heard of this and if so, what would it take to get you to fight your own court battles for the exercise of your rights (especially if it means once you win, you don't have to pay the tickets!)
      </p>
      <p>
       And btw, I still do my best to drive safely, 'cause cars can kill your ass!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL,DR
       </strong>
       Driver's licenses are not required and all traffic tickets are just revenue schemes.

       Your barely touching the root of a serious problem. This stems from the District of Colombia Organic act of 1871. Which declares AMERICA to be a corporation called The United States. The reason why we as UNITED STATES citizens are required to get a drivers license is because it is required under the regulations of THE UNITED STATES government. America and the US are 2 separate entities. This is also the reason the US Constitution is NOT a valid defense for a US citizen in the court of law (i can not think of the case to prove this as of right now) But you will not find an honest assertion of this here at r/conspiracy, you will be shunned and degraded because this is the true power behind our enslavement.

       What the hell are you talking about?  People use Constitutional concepts to defend themselves in court all the time.  It happens thousands of times a day, all across the United States.  It's so common it has become a part of popular culture - the Miranda rights, "Pleading the Fifth," etc.

       Much of this info was posted in r/commonlaw before it was taken over and much of the info deleted, I used to goto r/commonlaw to read and reference this info and then earlier this year the sub was changed, I think some of the info has been archived somewhere but I think much was deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit search for commonlaw to read the related posts about the takeover and drama that followed.

       What does this have to do with the federal government?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an act that creates the government of the Disctrict of Columbia as a municipal corporation.  This would be the government of Marion Barry, et. al, not the U.S. Federal Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Town and city governments in the United States are regularly created as "municpal corporations."  That's just what they're called, and it has nothing to do with an S-corp, C-corp, or LLC (corporations).

       It's not creating a new right to allow for state/local governments.  It's defining a new local government.  They created a new jurisdiction to house their government then they need a local government to run that.  That is all this does.

       Disinfo to me implies intent.  So to me he just accused me of trying to lie to further my argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty obvious he has misunderstood something(it happens, all my commonwealth lawyer friends constantly bitch about the wording in American laws being confusing) but to accuse other people of lying when trying to explain it to him is rude.

       Disinfo, whether borne out of a sincere belief to what one understands to be the truth, or out of a more nefarious nature.. is still disinfo. Plenty of people who are fed intentional disinfo sincerely believe it; does that make them deliberate liars? Or just misinformed, to be utilized as useful-idiots by the originator of said disinfo?

       Not too long ago I believed the Federal Reserve was, well, Federal. It is not. I believed the 16th Amendment was ratified and that legally I had to pay an income tax. It was not and I do not.

       It is not out of the realm of possibility that through legaleze and incrementalism our courts have been constitutionally circumvented. I see compelling research and citing of different case studies toward that end but by reading through your various comments, you seem less than open minded, so I'll save us both the time.

       You post that quote a lot in response to people who have not accepted a thought.  I entertained it, researched it and then rejected it.  As with everything I post on here.  Aristotle was not saying you had to accept everyones thoughts or that all thoughts are equal but that you should be open to them.  I am open to them until I find proof otherwise.

       Pretty sure I've never quoted that on Reddit. Maybe once, months ago. Definitely not "a lot in response to people who have not accepted a thought". That's a demonstrably clear lie that, quite frankly, is petty.

       It's rare to see the same long misused quote posted so frequently by multiple people.

       Trolling?  Just because I question sources and don't believe every youtube video on here doesn't mean I'm trolling.  It means I'm actually asking questions or asking for evidence.  Something that happens way too rarely here.  Probably because like you just did, everyone that actually thinks critically of stuff gets called a troll or a shill.

       If you go through my comments you'll see I do post elsewhere.  I just mostly lurk in other subreddits since I rarely have anything to say.

       I am regularly more impolite than I should be this is true but usually after providing the same evidence multiple times and having it be ignored.  The problem with this subreddit is that scepticism has become something to be attacked instead of embraced.  The hour long youtube rant is king even if it has no real content or facts.  It gets boring and I get crass.  Respect begets respect.

       Fair enough. The caveat to the skeptic thing, to me, is that the "theorists" are the skeptics, while you seem to be toeing the official narratives. In that context they heavily embrace skepticism and you are doing the attacking- and often times, probably rightly so, one cannot generalize the vast amount of topics or merit of in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may argue it's semantics, and this is not an attack on you, but I am subscribed to
       <a href="/r/skeptic">
        /r/skeptic

       and I am always hit by the irony that going with the official version of things is being skeptical.

       I understand the frustration of people posting hour long vids as a response but on the other hand a number have been well worth watching. Bill Foust's vids were among those well worth it, IMO. I like to know why people think the things they do, if nothing else, but found pretty compelling stuff in regards to our courts being run under admiralty law and that the US was restructured as a corporation. These claims are not baseless, these are people citing law, court cases, indeed the very changing of our Declaration to all capital letters, switching "for" for "of".

       I don't often promote one theory but I can often point out flaws in alternative versions and thats what I do.  I do it for the official version where I see problems too they just don't get posted here very often.

       I've read through a lot of the freeman documentation and watched a few videos.  Most of the famous ones seem more intent on selling their books these days though.  It's interesting to read and see them find what they think are loopholes but they just don't ever seem to work for them.  All the "victories" I've seen are empty at best.  So I'd say at best you could say they are morally right, but practically wrong.

       Central banking is another topic discussed here often.  If you look at the federal reserves purpose for what it is and not straight away as being evil it makes sense.  The government should not have to be focused on monetary policy.  They should be able to take any action they deem correct without worrying about what it will do to the dollar.  Thats why you need a separation there.

       I think most do not see it as being straight away evil, much to the contrary they believe it is a federal entity. This is by design and entirely false.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Fed truly was a federally owned and controlled entity I might be able to see an argument such as you're making. But it's not, it's a private corporation that creates money out of nothing and then loans it to the US at interest, enabling massive debt and a century of warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       The debt literally can never be repaid as the interest has not been created yet. If you have done the faintest amount of research on this and still don't see a problem, I must say you are rather naive or really are a shill. Either way, good day, sir.

       It didn't.  It created a city government to handle the day-to-day affairs of Washington, D.C., just like an act of the State of New York legislature created the City of Buffalo, or an act of the PA state legislature created the City of Allentown.
      </p>

       Administrative divisions of states are "municipal corporations" that exist as a result of action by the state legislature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the District of Columbia is not a state, but a federal area under the Congress, Congress created the city government of Washington, D.C., in this act, in the same way.

       er "CORPORATE FOR MUNICIPAL PURPOSES" just means creating a municipality, an area on the sub-state level that is given self-governance and legal rights in a certain area. Think city, town, township, village, etc.The idea is that it makes an area it's own legal corporation, being able to represent itself coopertatively in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever notice on road signs you see things like "now entering unincorporated springfield"? it means that while that land considers itself part of a township, they are not under the administrative authority of the local government, but rather the state government.

       There are plenty of governments operating inside the united states.  Your state governments, your city governments, etc.  Most of the city/region ones are incorporated.  But they aren't a business exactly.  A municipal corporation is different from a corporation you can go get today.

       Read that, not the "Under the laws of the state/country they are in" part.  They were creating a new city to house the federal government but the federal government shouldn't be concerned with a cities operation so they created a local government at the same time.

       I don't think you understand how municipalities work... or law for that matter. A municipality is a subdivision of a government, a district. Think about federalism and how it relates to state governments, it's similar on the local level, counties and towns have limited autonomity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to offend, but you're very, very confused with the definitions of these terms and how they work in practice and even how authority in the US is subdivided. I'd suggest this
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_States">
        wikipedia article
       </a>
       as a good jumping off point if you want to learn more about local government.

       that really doesn't explain anything more than you've said already. They're making the same errors you are, misunderstanding the role of corporations in legal terminology. The rest of the video they just play six degrees of kevin bacon with small snippets from various cases in order to make some greater claim that has no backing.

       Sub-governments under the states or federal governments don't just spontaniously sprout up, they must be incorporated as municipalities to be able to carry out legal functions, what's so hard to understand?

       Nah "freemen of the land" are quite predictable they cling to certain ideas like it's some secret irrefutable proof. All their arguments start and end the same, they're all based off the same faulty assumptions (in this case what it means to live in an incorporated municipality)
      </p>
      <p>
       At best they are naive, looking at legal text like how a child may look at the sky and think "what does the man in the moon do all day?"  at worst they are manipulators trying to con others into purchasing their legal advice or egotist that believe that they've found some secret loophole that the unwashed masses are too blind to see .

       It doesn't work like that. Once again you and sovereign citizens like this "bill" are making assumptions about the definition of terms that are simply not true. It's literary

       I've heard this line of reasoning before.  I see the argument and understand the concept, however I have never seen the black letter law that proves the underlying concept you refer to.  I HAVE seen the black letter law to beat tickets the way I do it so I stick to my method.
       <br/>
       I've heard of others who have used this way to win and I wish them all the best of luck!

       If you liked Bill (RIP) check out Charlie Sprinkle's story, think you'll like it:
Driving vs Traveling,

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Charlie tells of his stance and his lawsuit in the '70s against sixteen public officials, including Ronald Reagan- and all of their wives. He details his court wrangling in laymans terms, very entertaining. Suffice it to say, Charlie has not had a license in decades and
       <em>

       unmolested.

       I personally recommend not using this argument as it has no verifiable proof. Though it always sounds like it makes sense. Therein lies the appeal, but judges always want evidence, not appeals (lol my punny joke)

       I always challenge speeding tickets in court just because half the time the officer doesn't show up and you're let off and the rest of the time you can deal with the PD to get 0 points.  But your not getting off due to something like this.  I suspect in his case it's the exact same he is just getting confused about the reasons he is getting off.

       It's all about learning how to use the law against them. Traffic tickets are administrative and therefore you use that to your advantage.  Look up the administrative procedure act and learn how the state fails to exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding to a judicial forum.

       At that point however, doesn't the cost of defending yourself begin to exceed the cost of compliance with regular vehicle and traffic laws? Unless you're trying to instantiate a revolution over this, the police are never going to stop pulling you over for not having plates or tags, let alone a license.

       I just know I need ID to get a job. But mine expired and I never renewed it. To do so, I need my birth certificate. But being in another state, I need my ID to get it.  Alternatively, pay stubs and proof of address work too. But I've been homeless and out of work for some time now, only recently finding a place to get on my feet. But now it's hopeless.

       Hmm. I'm not too sure. When ordered my birth certificate all I needed was a license number (my license was expired but I kept the ID)  and proof of SSN. I don't have a SSC I just got a paper printed out from the social security office that confirmed I had a number. In order to get the actual card i needed 2 forms of ID which i didnt have.  I used the confirmation letter from the social security office and my expired license number to order my birth certificate. I was in Texas and requested the birth from Oregon. I am not sure how the  process varies by state but I am sure its possible if you're willing to deal with the massive amounts of bullshit red tape.

       9 out of 11 is correct.  The 10th is still in the appeals court.  11th should have been appealed but life had other plans for me.

        what do they usually say?
I'm not quite sure what you're asking.  What does the judge usually say?  If I'm feeling bold or obnoxious the judge will usually threaten me with contempt (The judge is the one person in the room everyone else is afraid of.  You have to realize that, and understand that the bailiff and prosecutor are deathly afraid of the judge). 
Of the 9 that I "beat", the prosecution dropped the charges.  You won't really "win" in court unless you get the jury to decide in your favor.  Judges (generally) won't rule in your favor.

       Since we are talking about legal definitions, no not quite.  If you are not being paid, you are legally traveling in your own private auto/car, you are not a passenger..  Since we are arguing legal meanings, and referencing Transportation codes and such we default to a legal dictionary for the definition of Passenger

       <strong>
        Blacks Law 6th ed.
       </strong>
       Passenger. In general, a person who gives compensation
to another for transportation. Shapiro v. Bookspan,
155 Cal.App.2d 353, 318 P.2d 123, 126.
       <em>
        The word
passenger has however various meanings, depending
upon the circumstances under which and the context in
which the word is used;
       </em>
       sometimes it is construed in a
restricted legal sense as referring to one who is being
carried by another for hire; on other occasions, the word
is interpreted as meaning any occupant of a vehicle
       <strong>
        other than the person operating it

PASSENGER
The essential elements of "passenger" as opposed to
"guest" under guest statute are that driver must receive
some benefit sufficiently real, tangible, and substantial
to serve as the inducing cause of the transportation so as
to completely overshadow mere hospitality or friendship;
it may be easier to find compensation where the
trip has commercial or business flavor. Friedhoff v.
Engberg, 82 S.D. 522, 149 N.W.2d 759, 761, 762, 763.
A person whom a common carrier has contracted to
carry from one place to another, and has, in the course
of the performance of that contract, received under his
care either upon the means of conveyance, or at the
point of departure of that means of conveyance.
Passenger mile. In statistics of transportation, a unit

       eh black's law isn't any more an authorative source in court than webster's english. The real authority comes from the language in the statutes in question. If you go into court and selectively quote from black's dictionary to make a semantical arguement, you're going to have a really, really bad time.

       I respect your opinion, but locally I have seen it play out quite differently.  Many people already argue this and get their cases dismissed very frequently.
      </p>

       Also the word transportation is defined NOWHERE in the TX transportation code (or in any other legislation for that matter).  Any legal dictionary of merit defines transportation the same way, as the act of moving people or goods for hire.

       ahh yes, no libs watch: the stalker hang out where my personal information was spread around so Cows could harass me outside of Reddit, where down vote brigades are organized and people like Cow, Green-light and Crack Duck recoup when they all have their accounts banned repeatedly for doxxing people, harassing redditors and in general being dicks. Also a fantastic breeding ground for racism, hatred and personal attacks!

       dude, have you sustained a head injury in the last few hours? I already posted the screen shot of you harassing me on youtube, the thread with you guys posting how to find my info is still on NLW. Your account and Green-light's account has been banned the days after you both posted in that (oh and Greenie kept on posting info about me in NLW).
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a know racist with the inability to differentiate between the people of The Middle East and North Africa and always refer to them as "brown". Greenie has been caught using images from Davidduke.com and Stormfont. Then there's CrackDuck (aka GhostofDusty) who is throwing around racial slurs will nilly. Oh yeah and all of you are holocaust deniers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every link on NLW leads to someone's post that you want down voted. Every comment on NLW is a crack or joke abou the poster. Nothign on the subreddit is of any value, least of all any comment from you.
      </p>

       So Cow, tell us how many pizzas you've scammed this week. Why do you support child soldiers son?

       it's not a matter of whether you drive or not. it's a matter that roads are public property and fall under the regulation of public municipalities. You need to qualify for the license (i.e. privelige) in order to be allowed to drive lawfully on them.

       You're right traveling in it's purest form is neither a right nor a privilege. I'm talking about traveling by motor vehicle on
       <em>
        public

       (government owned) roads. Since the state owns and regulates most roads (or jointly in the case of interstate highways, through federal taxation powers) they are allowed to license out use of the roads. It is very much a privilege.

       No it is not, those roads are owned by the PUBLIC for PUBLIC use.  We just allow the state to tax our gas and such to maintain them.  There are federally owned private roadways out there, but they are generally few and far between.  Constitutionally, the state cannot tell me I need some little piece of plastic to take my horseless, motorized carriage from point A to B as long as I am not endangering others or their property.

       For public use. They are regulated by a public authority, the state. You're failing to see the difference betwen a license("that little piece of plastic") and a license agreement (the contract that little piece of plastic represents). The point about tax doesn't even come into it, you're paying a licensing fee for the privilege to use your motor vehicle on them.

       . That is, that Maryland couldn't close it's border to Virginia. Highways, even though many receive federal funds through taxation powers are under the authority of each state to decide how to regulate. Just like you can't build a dam on a publicly owned river without coming to contract with the public authority. States have the responsibility and authority to regulate and maintain public property as they see fit.

        great essay
       </a>
       on the topic by a well known libertarian sociologist and US law expert. While he agrees with you that transportation rights have changed, he concedes that those changes are legal and upheld by the courts. Specifically on the issue of driver's licenses.

      <p>
       Also, I highly suggest taking a basic US law class in your spare time. Most community colleges offer them for under $300 a semester.

       meh, you cherry pick... from the abstract even:P The essay backs up the point at hand, that driver's licenses are allowed and the usage of public roads by motor vehicle are infact viewed as a privilege in American law. If you have read further you'd see that the author is dismayed by this, obviously(being a rather well respected libertarian thinker and all) but accepts it as truth.

       all he accepts is that the courts have over time changed the way they think about the right to travel.  Look at what they gain by doing so.  In Texas, the cops extorted over $140 million in traffic citations last year.  This is a huge racket and these assholes realize it.

       So basically your point is that it feels wrong to have a drivers license, therefore you should be able to drive without one. $140 million is a nickel compared to the rest of texas' budget.

      <p>
       First misunderstand. The ID is evidence of agree to a contract to travel by car on the roads, the license agreement. You may still be a passenger without one but with it, you pay a fee and pass a test that helps fund the road for the former and proves you are capable of handling a motor vehicle for the later.

      <p>
       Still the first misunderstanding. You're failing to uphold the terms of your contract. Active motorist use the roads most, so active motorist pay an additional license fee for the privilege to use them. you can drive on what ever private road you want without one, don't worry.

       Not true, deterrence and precautionary citations are totally constitutional. You break part of the contract designed for the safety of other contract holders, you are penalized in hopes that you learn your lesson. No man's a island, especially not on an open public road. Yet another misunderstanding.

       So percuationary measures are immoral? That punishment should only happen when the proverbial blood has been shed? Just because a drunk driver didn't kill someone tonight he should be allowed to keep drunk driving without punishment since no damage was done?

       I'm just going to focus on that last drunk driving comment.  Because all the rest of it falls under the same basic principles that we are obviously never going to agree on.  To sum it up on my end "No victim, No crime", on your end "big daddy government knows best, shut up and pay your fines".
      </p>
      <p>
       The limits imposed by the state for driving "drunk" by their definitions are usually way out of touch with reality.  in Texas the legal limit is .08.  It has been demonstrated that driving while drowsy is exponentially more dangerous than driving with a BAC of .08
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting arbitrary limits on the BAC when every person reacts different is retarded.  I know several people who have had their lives damn near ruined for drinking a couple of beers at dinner and then getting stopped for expired tags or some such garbage, and having the cop assert that they were wasted based on the light smell of beer on their breath.

       .  Blood doesn't need to be spilled, if you are drunk and dent a fender the punishment should be great.  If you are .08 "drunk" and get pulled over for something completely unrelated (i.e. expired tags), why would it factor in at all?

       You will get a citation and fine for negligence and idiocy too, reckless driving is an offense. Drunk drivers are at greater risk of crashing and alcohol, unlike stupidity is easy to test for.

       Depends, even in law jaywalking is given a lot of leeway. Cross a 15mph 1 way street infront of the cop, you'd be fine. Try to cross a highway, disrupting traffic and putting yourself and others at risk you sure as shit should be punished, just like reckless drivers.

       right, if you are doing 80 during rush hour and narrowly missing other cars as you weave through gaps and the shoulder, that is cause for a stop as you are presenting yourself as a danger (unless it is a genuine emergency).  If you are doing 120 on an empty/lightly trafficked freeway, why would that be an issue?  An attentive driver is just as much of a threat to others at 55mph as he is 100mph

       I guess I should have stipulated earlier, doing something like walking out onto a fast moving freeway, or pointing a gun at someone aren't exactly "victimless".  If you pointed a gun at me (even in jest), that constitutes a threat on my life and I could use lethal force against you and be legally (and morally) in the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you walked onto a freeway, causing others to violently swerve to avoid you, this is endangering others.  I'm not arguing this sort of thing shouldn't come with consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm arguing that situations where you can't even begin to make up an injured party (no license, speeding, no seat belts, tags etc), cannot be punishable offenses.  Because how in the hell is the officer nailing people doing 70 in a 65 on their way to work

       It keeps people safe by enforcing the law. A limit needs to be drawn or else it's totally up to discretion (for example one person may believe that going 45mph is too fast while another may be comfortable going 90 in the same area).
      </p>
      <p>
       A driver isn't omnipresent, they cannot see what may be on the road 2 miles away or what may happen, by not enforcing speed limits speeding is being encouraged. People don't usually think further than their nose, you cannot gaurentee that if left to their own descretions thousands of drivers would come to a rational conclusion. Because even an individual rational choice (driving faster when you know you can handle it) can produce irrational conclusions if multiplied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without broad enforcement with existent, but limited, wiggle room laws are useless. When they are enforced drivers take it into consideration when they speed up ("I should be careful or I will get a ticket"). Again the individual in society can only be fully responsible for their own actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone walking out onto a fast moving freeway or pointing a gun at you are not victimless even though no direct harm is done, why is reckless driving any different?

       I'm not defending reckless driving.  Doing 30 over the "limit" on an open road, and driving in such a way that you are endangering others are completely different situations.  "reckless" is a subjective term.  Pointing a deadly weapon at someone, or stepping in front of a moving vehicle cannot be considered anything BUT reckless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you don't need to convince me people can be shortsighted and bad drivers in general.  I understand that risk every time I get on the road.  But that doesn't change the fact that fining a citizen for traveling faster than the state thinks is ok, and other such "crimes" is a completely unconstitutional and morally detestable act.
      </p>
      <p>
       And please don't even pretend like police don't abuse their ability to stop people for traffic violations in an effort to meet unofficial quotas, or to screen for drugs on a whim.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone isn't capable of traveling in their car in a safe and reasonable manner, inevitably they will either shape up or ship out.  But such is life.  So why make traveling so shitty for everyone to fight a losing battle?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason major roadways have many lanes, it's so the person thinking 45 is acceptable can stay on one side to let the people that think 90 is acceptable to pass on the left :)

       How do we get out of speeding tickets then? I'm in Texas too, so laws are the same.

       First you have to realize that you will never get a cop to understand your position (unless you have great cleavage!).  Save your fight for the court room.  It's the only place you'll have a chance.
Second, read the Texas State Constitution.  Pay attention to Article V section 12 and 22.
       <br/>
       Also, realize that a citation is not a summons.  Texas likes to treat traffic tickets criminally.  As such, they are required to follow all of the rules of the Criminal Code of Procedure (CCP).  The CCP says that to get you into court, they have to first either have a warrant, or a summons.  And a summons is issued from a judge, not a cop or prosecutor.
But ULTIMATELY, you have to realize that all traffic laws are ADMINISTRATIVE in nature.  They fall under the Administrative Procedure Act, Texas Government Code 2001, and as such, the state fails to exhaust all remedies before proceeding to a judicial forum (the courtroom) and therefore violates your rights.
       <br/>
       Oh, and be TIMELY.  File your paperwork on time.
Best of luck - check out Eddie Craig from Rule of Law Radio to get an idea of some of the details.

       I've utilized this method before.  I filed a lot of paperwork that had been notarized in triplicate.  I filed on for me, filed one with the court, and served the other directly with a notice of service attached to all of them.  I receieved a letter from the DA saying quite literally... "We aren't saying that you aren't guilty of the crime committed, we just don't have any proof of it at this time and are dismissing the case."  I verified with the court that my case had been dismissed and it had.  But those words... "We aren't saying that you aren't guilty we just can't prove it."  That shit blew my mind.  I almost wrote a letter back asking the DA what non-american school of law did he attend, but I won and stopped there.

       Sounds like the cop didn't show up.  You could have saved all your hard work and just gone in and talked to the DA/PD.  If the cop isn't there(and they frequently aren't) they drop the ticket.  If they are you negotiate for a lower fine - points.

       I didn't negotiate for shit.  I didn't even have to go to court.  I settled it with paperwork.  They dropped the case before I set foot near the courtroom probably because they didn't want to deal with someone who "files" things for speeding tickets.

       Actually it's more likely that the ticketing officer couldn't make it into the court.  Given the wording "We aren't saying that you aren't guilty we just can't prove it" that sounds exactly like what they say when I've gotten off for the same thing.  They can't prove it because the accuser isn't in court.

       The "couldn't find the calibrations" for the machine was their excuse.  Prior to me filing the paper work and getting a ticket, "calibrations" were only ever mentioned briefly if ever and always that they were affirmatively configured.  I just so happen to file paperwork and they just so happen to not be there.  I'd say it was coincidence if this same thing hasn't happened to other people close to me.

       So they couldn't find the evidence?  You realize just turning up and saying not guilty to the DA would have gotten you the same result right?  Your paper work had nothing to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I challenge every speeding ticket I get just by showing up and talking to the DA/PD.  The majority of the time the officer won't show up and it will be dropped.  If they do show up then any points are dropped and the fine is lowered.

       pffft.  I don't go to negotiate and the ticket wasn't in my hometown.  It saved me a significant amount of time and annoyances.  And you're wrong.  There is NEVER evidence of a crime and people continue to pay for tickets.  I've got nothing to say to the DA and the officer cannot show where he has accrued any damages from my speeding.  That's my main argument right there.  It's a failure to state a cause of action for which relief may be granted.  Works for dismissal every time.

       It's an administrative law therefore the state must first exhaust all administrative remedies, such as holding an administrative hearing before an administrative judge before proceeding to a judicial forum. 
If you doubt that it's administrative, then look into what happens when you get a DUI.

       I don't doubt that its administrative.  I doubt you know what "exhaust all administrative remedies" means.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means that they must exhaust
       <strong>
        whatever remedies have been put in place by the administration
       </strong>
       .  Which, in the case of traffic citations for speeding or running a stop sign, is basically nothing.  They don't have an administrative hearing process for these violations, nor are they required to.  It doesn't necessarily mean they have to have hearings - there are thousands of administrative bodies in the states that do not hold hearings.

       Texas Administrative Code
TITLE 43 TRANSPORTATION
PART 1 TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
CHAPTER 1 MANAGEMENT
SUBCHAPTER E PROCEDURES IN CONTESTED CASES
RULE §1.21 Scope and Purpose
The sections in this subchapter describe the procedures to be followed in contested cases arising under Government Code, Chapter 2001, with the exception of contested cases arising under Occupations Code, Chapter 2301, Sale or Lease of Motor Vehicles, or under Transportation Code, Chapter 503, Dealer's and Manufacturer's Vehicle License Plates, which are governed by 16 TAC Chapter 111.
       <strong>
        Except as provided in this subchapter, all contested cases shall be governed by the procedural rules of the State Office of Administrative Hearings.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And...
TxDoT is considered a “state agency” pursuant TxGvC Chapter 2001, Administrative Procedure Act, Sec. 2001.003(7)
      </p>
      <p>
       (7)  "State agency" means a state officer, board, commission, or department with statewide jurisdiction that makes rules or determines contested cases.  The term includes the State Office of Administrative Hearings for the purpose of determining contested cases. ** The term does not include:**
(A) a state agency wholly financed by federal money;
(B) the legislature;
       <strong>
        (C) the courts;
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant TxGvC Sec. 2001.003(7)(C), traffic court is not a “state agency”, and is specifically excluded from having jurisdiction to hear any contested case regarding the Texas Transportation Code as any charge of allegedly violating said statutes is challenged and contested by me for the purpose of administrative review. (I write a letter contesting all tickets to the agency after getting them)
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, if someone contests the agency's claim, then they are required to hold an administrative hearing.  Thus exhausting their administrative remedies.
As I said, I know it's late, but just in case you still wondered.  And for those that would like to see more details.

       No.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule you cited (Rule 1.21) does not mean that at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the rule (taken right from the Texas Secretary of State homepage):
       <em>
        This subchapter describes the procedures to be followed in a contested case. The procedures in this subchapter may be used only if a statute provides that the matter may be the subject of a contested case hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act (Government Code, Chapter 2001) or a department rule expressly provides for a hearing under this subchapter.
       </em>
       <a href="http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&amp;amp;app=9&amp;amp;p_dir=&amp;amp;p_rloc=&amp;amp;p_tloc=&amp;amp;p_ploc=&amp;amp;pg=1&amp;amp;p_tac=&amp;amp;ti=43&amp;amp;pt=1&amp;amp;ch=1&amp;amp;rl=21">
        Source
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, unless a specific statute (or a DMV rule) allows for an administrative hearing, these procedures and hearings do not apply.  Traffic statutes do not provide for administrative hearings.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Texas Statutes, V.T.C.A. Transportation Code Chapter 543 describes the procedures to be used when someone is stopped or arrested for a traffic violation, and it specifically says that the person is either to be taken in front of a court magistrate, or given a notice to appear at a later date in front of a court magistrate.

       Yes.  Though I will concede that apparently there's been a change to their administrative code since the last time I copied and pasted into a motion.  I'll try to find a better cite to prove my point, though I'll leave this here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of going on the assumption of lawful authority, why don't you first prove the authority of the state exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Texas Transportation Code is written by the agency.  As such, it is subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.  As such, any and all disputes are handled under the Contested Case section of APA Texas Gov Code 2001.  The agency has no authority to say that their rule making supersedes their limitations placed upon them by TexGovCode.

       Doesn't matter.  Even under the old, there was no provision for administrative hearings for traffic tickets.  "Contested case" does not refer to a traffic violation.

       They don't have to.  The Texas statutes supersede any agency rules, and the statutes say when you are stopped for violating the traffic law, you get a citation to appear in court.

       Who said it's an administrative statute?  The laws that specify "rules of the road" are not administrative, they are duly passed by the legislature and are statutes.

       TxDot has statutory authority over the Texas roads, period, by act of the Texas legislature and governor signing the law giving them that authority.

       Where can we reference these laws that declare our right to travel, right to use public roads, and right to use property as it was intended? I don't doubt your knowledge, I just know that if someone were to actually fight this in court they would need to acknowledge which acts or laws provide these rights.

       Google right to travel. BUT be warned, you need to verify every court citation you read with your own eyes. People have started  misquoting cited and therefore a lot of what is online, though it may be close, is not actually correct.

       Word of caution, you're skirting the pseudolaw fringes of the stawman theory. When you get down through multiple teirs of semantics, you're probably grossly misinterpreting the law. It's a good thing you understand that safe driving is important, but if you were to try your theories in court, you will most definitely get burned.

       Agreed.  I have a feeling that the "9 out of 11" is a conflated or otherwise exaggerated claim.  Zero of these 9, assuredly, are on the merits of what OP is saying, because what he is saying is pure, unadulterated nonsense.

       The drivers license (at least in Texas, though I'm confident this applies to every state) is covered by the administrative procedure act (Texas Gov Code 2001) and as such the state must exhaust all administrative remedies before proceeding to a judicial forum without violating your right of due process. 
The Right to Travel and the Use of Property and the Use of the Public Roads have all been settled in Supreme Court cases long ago. 
You have to know the law and be very specific when fighting your court cases. I do this and win. And I enjoy it. 
As a side note, you can even get judges to violate the law and then file criminal charges against them. That's even more fun.

       Could you explain your arguments in detail? Because solely arguing that the use of public roads is a right wouldn't fly anywhere, it's long established that the legal use of public roads is a privelige, requiring registration.

       It's sounds to me that you went before the judge and plead out ("plea to 10 over") to avoid heavier fines, that's not really a conspiracy

       You aren't "driving" unless you have a passenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the police pull you over, the first thing they will typically ask is "what are you doing?"  Don't say "I'm driving to the store."  You're not driving.  You're traveling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately, the local police have gotten better about this.  They usually don't ask for a drivers license without cause.

       Oh, and it
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a conspiracy.  It is 100% graft and revenue generation.  My grandfather was a lawyer, worked for insurance companies, and then spent decades suing them into oblivion for denying claims.  Because of his experiences, and because of my understanding of free markets, libertarianism and the really shady connections between the insurance industry and government, I developed a moral opposition to insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The local police eventually got to the point that they would literally know
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       when my insurance expired, and send a car out to track me down, pull me over for some made-up reason, and ticket me.  Like, they would come from behind and tell me my windshield was cracked, or claim that they noticed I wasn't wearing a seatbelt, at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last guy who pulled me over showed me a list on his computer of all of my prior traffic stops.  He said he didn't even know what the codes on most of them meant.

       I spent a whole day reading a forum dedicated to this just so I could read about their "victories" it was the most bizarre thing I'd seen.  People would post about court cases where they had big fines but were after arguing for ages given slightly smaller fines and told to piss off as if it was a huge victory.  Ignoring the fact that if their beliefs were right they should have left with 0 fines.

       No. Cops show up. Well, except for one appeal, but I win based on the fact that they don't follow all of their own rules first. 
Basically the state fails to exhaust their administrative remedies and therefore violates your right to due process.

       It draws an exact parallel with the Tax Deniers - they would claim "victory" because they were acquitted on criminal charges of tax evation, even though (1) their acquittal was basically an acknowledgment by the court that they were too kooky to seriously think they were evading taxes, and (2)
       <em>
        they still had to pay the taxes, fines, and interest, in every single case.

       LOL no.  I'd love to see the "law" and how you think you're applying it.

       I'd also like you to prove that you've had "9 out of 11" citations thrown out.

       The law is not some magical talisman where, if you move your hands the right way and use the secret code words, it will not apply to you.

       The United States has the ability to regulate commerce.

       The states most certainly do have the authority to regulate travel on public conveyances.  That is how DMV's exist.  When you're in traffic court, you're dealing with state law.

       Driving on public roads has always been a privilage, you may argue that lawful freedom of movement is a right, but what is considered lawful falls into the regulatory hands of the state, like most public property.

       The "couldn't find the calibrations" for the machine was their excuse.  Prior to me filing the paper work and getting a ticket, "calibrations" were only ever mentioned briefly if ever and always that they were affirmatively configured.  I just so happen to file paperwork and they just so happen to not be there.  I'd say it was coincidence if this same thing hasn't happened to other people close to me.

       Fair enough. The caveat to the skeptic thing, to me, is that the "theorists" are the skeptics, while you seem to be toeing the official narratives. In that context they heavily embrace skepticism and you are doing the attacking- and often times, probably rightly so, one cannot generalize the vast amount of topics or merit of in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may argue it's semantics, and this is not an attack on you, but I am subscribed to
       <a href="/r/skeptic">
        /r/skeptic
       </a>
       and I am always hit by the irony that going with the official version of things is being skeptical.

       I understand the frustration of people posting hour long vids as a response but on the other hand a number have been well worth watching. Bill Foust's vids were among those well worth it, IMO. I like to know why people think the things they do, if nothing else, but found pretty compelling stuff in regards to our courts being run under admiralty law and that the US was restructured as a corporation. These claims are not baseless, these are people citing law, court cases, indeed the very changing of our Declaration to all capital letters, switching "for" for "of".

       If you understand how insidious Central Banking inherently is, you know we are all debt-slaves. This doesn't seem all that implausible once you study it's history.
