I&#39;ve been going out nightly to watch the jets with binoculars. Tonight I went outside about 25 minutes ago to watch and noticed that some of what I thought were stars began moving right over the house. I lined up the &quot;stars&quot; with the edge of the roof to insure that it wasn&#39;t just the clouds giving the illusion of movement, they were in fact moving. I&#39;m also seeing several of the military jets that I&#39;ve been watching flying around as well. Any of you have anything to help me to understand what I am seeing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is his sister-in-law and we have been trying and trying to get it on video but all the cameras we are trying just aren&#39;t capuring it, but we are witnessing it and have been for almost an hour now. We have watched this &quot;formation&quot; just move around and then other &quot;star&quot; looking things speed up and join in and then separate off and some of them, their lights just go completely out. We are in a very isolated part of Oklahoma and if we were to call the police they would just laugh at us. We are in a town of about 50 peopl and the town that is about 7 miles away with the police station is a town of about 300. So the police would just laugh at us and hang up. We are also seeing military planes rushing up and flying around the damn things!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh, you&#39;re not going to be able to record anything of value unless you have some night-vision. I&#39;d say screw it, just focus on the moment &amp; enjoy the spectacle. Don&#39;t even worry about &#39;trying to convince everyone&#39; . Just enjoy your sighting &amp; realize you are the member of a new club now. Btw, these moving star-like objects (where if they stayed still, they&#39;d look <em>exactly</em> like a star) have been happening a lot lately. I heard about these being seen every night in the early morning hours over the St Louis area all throughout the Summer, early-Fall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kept recording where we were seeing the lights, I tried with my phone and nothing, then tried with my point n shoot Sony camera. I just got home last night and reviewed my videos on my computer to see if anything showed up and just nothing. Pure black the whole time. We were looking at these lights and it was just a great thing to witness, I was getting rather scared though when the military planes were speeding in and then speeding out even faster. We don&#39;t expect anyone to believe us, but we needed to tell someone and it was too late to call anyone. We know what we saw so we don&#39;t feel we need to convince anyone, just thought we would share what we were seeing and were hoping there might have been someone else in the area experiencing this!</p>
