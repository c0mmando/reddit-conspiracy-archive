    <div class="md"><p>not to shit on you, but these snippets of mis-info are getting old. <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/rumsfeld__9_11_and__2_3_trilli.html">Here&#39;s</a> a long rundown of how this myth formed and how it got tied to 9/11 but I&#39;ll quote snippets for you from the sources, for convienence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Above all, the shift from bureaucracy to the battlefield is a matter of national security. In this period of limited funds, we need every nickel, every good idea, every innovation, every effort to help modernize and transform the U.S. military....</p>

<p>The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector, but not ours, not fully, not yet. We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain. Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it&#39;s stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible. </p>

<p>(from rumsfeld&#39;s speech)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t so much admiting money was missing just that the pentagon&#39;s financial procedures were outdated, he was lobbying for a revision to the systems.  </p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t even announcing anything new. <a href="http://hv.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=002hxm">there are articles</a> from 2000 talking about this issue. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting and 2+ trillon dollars is substantially larger than the pentagon&#39;s budget. It&#39;s not like someone walked out with bags of money all at once, this was a multiyear, possibly multi decade issue dealing with government waste. </p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041119191514/http://www.defense.gov/news/Feb2002/n02202002_200202201.html">here&#39;s</a> a memo from 2002 where the Pentagon once again mentions the wasteful accounting practices they had/have and what they&#39;re doing to fix the problem.</p>

<p>And if the pentagon was attempting a cover-up, why admit to it at all? Why bother to announce it publicly? And most importantly, why continue to bring it up after the alledged cover-up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree. One thing that puts me off though, do they plan ahead of these things? I mean, do they know they&#39;ll get found out the day before they plan it for example? Because if it took them by surprise, 9/11 is a big thing to pull off in &lt;24 hours</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard/read that these plans, whatever they may be, were laid a long time ago. Could it be that the exposure of the $2.3 trillion and the attacks the following day were both planned? That&#39;s a lot of money to vanish without something happening to disrupt it in transit. Why leave that up to chance? Drop hints that are discovered on your timetable. Keep whatever paladin that has stumbled upon the trail looking in one direction while you keep moving the pieces in the other direction. Then when it&#39;s time, admit to the theft, then create a distraction large enough to make people forget...then ???...then profit. </p>

<p>The conclusions I&#39;ve come to in my life lead me to believe that whatever may be going on is much larger in scope than I&#39;ve seen discussed most anywhere. I&#39;m still relatively young and I keep this in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m just playing around on google and wikipedia, I&#39;m no journalist, but here we go:</p>

<p>Jonbenet Ramsey:</p>

<p>In 1989, late in his military career, he formed the Advanced Product Group, one of three companies that merged to become Access Graphics. After mandatory military retirement, he became president and chief executive officer of Access Graphics, a computer services company and a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin.  In 1996, Access Graphics grossed over $1 billion, and he was named &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; by the Boulder Chamber of Commerce. Immediately following the murder he was &quot;temporarily replaced so the company did not have to bother him about business matters as he grieved&quot;, according to Lockheed spokesman Evan McCollum. Ramsey soon left his job to move his family to Michigan, where he joined another computer company. Access Graphics was later sold to General Electric in 1997.</p>

<p>Hmm weird, GE. Aren&#39;t they involved with the LIBOR scandal which the batman shooter&#39;s father was involved in? Just like the father of this current massacre was a tax director at GE was was also expected to testify at a trial?</p>

<p>What did the parents of the Coloumbine kids do?</p>

<p>Tom Klebold, 52, met Susan Yassenoff, 50, when both were art students at Ohio State University, where he was a year ahead of her. Susan came from a -ruh-roh- prominent -ruh-roh- Jewish -ruh-roh- family in Columbus, the granddaughter of the late philanthropist and construction magnate Leo Yassenoff, who built the local Jewish community center that bears his name.</p>

<p>They married in 1971. Tom found work in metro Denver as a geophysicist for -ruh-roh- Champlin Oil Co. -ruh-roh-</p>

<p>Maybe he was working on the case for fracking in Denver and it wasn&#39;t looking good. Hard to find any connections here. Most of the focus is on the shooters online.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s 9/11 we all know that one der.</p>

<p>What are some other massacres that weren&#39;t obviously people &quot;going postal&quot; at work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Collusion among banks to set interest rates and win contracts has been going on for some time, as the recent culmination of the case U.S. v. Carrollo, Goldberg, and Grimm points up. As reported in Rolling Stone, these three employees of General Electric subsidiary GE Capital were recently found guilty of conspiring with major Wall Street banks from around 1999 to 2006 of fixing public auctions of municipal bonds. The nipping and tucking of interest rates paid on these bonds floated to fix roads and build schools bilked cities and towns of incalculable amounts of money necessary to fund the day-to-day business of municipalities across the nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but look where he was prior to working at GE Energy Financial Services, he was the Tax Leader at GE.</p>

<p>Sure there&#39;s plenty of pipes in these byzantine companies. This guy was in enough places at GE at the right time to see or do the wrong things.</p>

<p>Maybe he was made Vice President after he pulled some tricks when he was Tax Leader at GE, maybe the same tricks that they want to question him about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Collusion among banks to set interest rates and win contracts has been going on for some time, as the recent culmination of the case U.S. v. Carrollo, Goldberg, and Grimm points up. As reported in Rolling Stone, these three employees of General Electric subsidiary GE Capital were recently found guilty of conspiring with major Wall Street banks from around 1999 to 2006 of fixing public auctions of municipal bonds. The nipping and tucking of interest rates paid on these bonds floated to fix roads and build schools bilked cities and towns of incalculable amounts of money necessary to fund the day-to-day business of municipalities across the nation.</p>
