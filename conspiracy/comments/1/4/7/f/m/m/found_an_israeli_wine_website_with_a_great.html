        Four Rothschilds, Wine &amp; The State of Israel
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some notable excerpts.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some towns such as Zichron Ya’acov and Binyamina
        <strong>
         were named after Rothschilds
        </strong>
        and others such as Rishon Le Zion and Caesarea, remain monuments to their support and generosity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Let's take a look at a few of these towns.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Zikhron Ya'akov
       </strong>
       "Jacob's Memorial"; often shortened to just Zikhron) is a town in Israel, 35 kilometres (22 mi) south of Haifa, and part of the Haifa District. It is located at the southern end of the Carmel mountain range overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, near the coastal highway (Highway 2). It was one of the first Jewish settlements of Halutzim in the country,
       <strong>
        founded in 1882 by Baron Edmond James de Rothschild and named in honor of his father
       </strong>
       . (James Mayer de Rothschild)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zikhron_Ya%27akov">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Binyamina
       </strong>
       was founded in 1922 and named after the
       <strong>
        Baron Edmond Benjamin James de Rothschild.
       </strong>
       According to the Jewish National Fund, Binyamina was founded on PICA land by members of the Third Aliyah. The original economy of the village was citrus-based. In 1947, Binyamina had a population of 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Givat Ada
       </strong>
       , named for
       <strong>
        Baron Edmond James de Rothschild's 's wife Adelaid
       </strong>
       (Ada), was established in 1903 by
       <strong>
        eight families from Zichron Ya'akov
       </strong>
       . Givat Ada was established as an agricultural settlement. The main farming branches were field crops and vegetables, and later, grapes
      </p>

       The two major malls in
       <strong>
        Rishon LeZion
       </strong>
       are
       <strong>
        Rothschild Center
       </strong>
       in the old downtown center and Gold Mall (Kenyon HaZahav) in the New West district.

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        State of Israel
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       After the establishment of the state,
       <strong>
        the Rothschild family agreed to transfer most of its land holdings to the new state
       </strong>
       . A different arrangement was reached for the 35,000 dunams of land the family owned in and around modern Caesarea: after turning over the land to the state, it was leased back (for a period of 200 years) to a new charitable foundation. In his will, Edmond James de Rothschild stipulated that this foundation would further education, arts and culture, and welfare in Israel. The Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Foundation was formed and run based on the funds generated by the sale of Caesarea land which the Foundation is responsible for maintaining.
       <strong>
        The Foundation is owned half by the Rothschild Family, and half by the State of Israel
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Foundation established the Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Development Corporation Ltd. (CDC) in 1952 to act as its operations arm. The company transfers all profits from the development of Caesarea to the Foundation, which in turn contributes to organizations that advance higher education and culture across Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Caesarea Foundation
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Development Corporation (Hebrew: החברה לפיתוח קיסריה אדמונד בנימין דה רוטשילד) is the operational arm of the Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Foundation, whose goal is to establish a unique community that combines quality of life and safeguarding the environment with advanced industry and tourism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the Chairman of the Caesarea Foundation and the CDC is Baron Benjamin de Rothschild, the great grandson of the Baron Edmond de Rothschild. Caesarea remains today the only locality in Israel managed by a private organization rather than a municipal government. As well as carrying out municipal services, the Caesarea Development Corporation markets plots for real-estate development, manages the nearby industrial park, and runs the Caesarea's golf course and country club, Israel's only 18-hole golf course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern Caesarea is one of Israel's most upscale residential communities. The
       <strong>
        Baron de Rothschild still maintains a home in Caesarea
       </strong>
       , as do many business tycoons from Israel and abroad.
      </p>

      <p>
       TL;DR - Yeah the Rothschilds pretty much run Israel.

      <pre><code>Foreign Office
November 2nd, 1917

Dear Lord Rothschild,

I have much pleasure in conveying to you, on behalf of His Majesty's 
Government, the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist 
aspirations which has been submitted to, and approved by, the 
Cabinet.

His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in  
Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their 
best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being 
clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the 
civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in 
Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any 
other country.

I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the 
knowledge of the Zionist Federation.


Yours sincerely,

Arthur James Balfour

       It was a conspiracy.  Conspiracies usually are normal.  They make sense because the actions people take usually are more in line with their actual motives than the bullshit stories they tell you in the winner written history books and on the corporate news networks.  Just because it makes sense that the Rothschilds would want a national Jewish state doesn't make their rape of and theft from the Palestinian people right.

       The Rothschilds paid for the Israeli Knesset and Supreme Court buildings. They also had a great deal of oversight on these projects and the amount spent is secret. The Israeli Supreme Court building has obvious references to Freemasonary.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the history of the Rothschilds it is not unrealistic to believe they control trillions of dollars in assets.

       The Rothschilds and the Zionists had their eyes on Palestine for a very long time. These are the white Ashkenazi and Khazarians of Eastern Europe and Russia. At least 40 to 50 years before the National Socialists came to power in Germany. I suspect there is something they are not telling US about the area. Once they purge the Palestinians and others in the area we will probably find out.

       I am interested in this topic.  I have read in passing that there may be advanced technology buried under Solomon's temple.  I have never gotten into the whole alien ufo type conspiracies just because I find them to be very speculative.

       Some think it may be the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is a FREAK of nature, unique. It is 25 miles east of Jerusalem; 53 miles long, 10 miles wide, and 13,000 feet deep (Wow!) at its greatest depth. Being 1310 feet below sea level, it's surrounded by hills and mountains, which make it an immense hole in the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jordan River pours 7 million tons of water into the Dead Sea every DAY, 24 hours a day. There is NO ESCAPE of that water except through evaporation and the MINERALS contained in the water are ALL left behind IN the Dead Sea.

       the Palestinian territories have one of the fastest population growth rates in the world. Not to mention the fact that there have only been 6000 Palestinian deaths since 2000.

       In the past people have speculated that it is the Dead Sea Mineral Deposits that Rothschild and the Zionist leaders were interested in. At one time it was estimated to be in the trillions of dollars.
