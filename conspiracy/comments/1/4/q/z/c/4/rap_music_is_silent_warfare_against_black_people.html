       Oh, do you mean

       So what does this have to do with rap music being an organized war against black people, despite the fact that rap music

       in black culture?

       its the same concept with the French and "cinema" and Jewish hollywood now....or maybe how lots of US legislation is written by dual citizenship israelis? Trying to see if I can punch you in the face with examples to help you understand

       Instead of bringing in these obtuse "examples" (of what you do not say), why don't you just explain your theory logically? As I understand it, you appear to believe a black cultural phenomenon is somehow being used
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       black Americans - despite the fact that it is a genre of music widely created, listened to, and performed by black people - but also people of all ethnicities. I'm yet to see you explain or justify this reasoning - and bringing up a single album name doesn't prove anything, as I'm sure you realise.

       Ah, yes, the conspiracy equivalent of "NO U R DUMB".  You can dismiss any criticism as long as it comes from a

       Seriously, I've been seeing your posts these last few days, and they're just ridiculous.  You post unsubstantiated garbage, and keep using the same quote about "silent weapons for quiet wars" as if that somehow ties everything together and makes you sound LESS insane.

       It wasn't that way until it started uniting and educating black people, AND white people started taking notice as well. It was at this point that white executives saw a profit to be made and began investing in acts that were pliable and represented the aspects most appealing to the disposable income (white) youth: gansta rap. Gangsta rap changed the game quite a bit, and was derided by the old school quite roundly. But money won out and here we are.

       Artists that don't play along are jailed, victimized, and killed. It's where the attention is, so that's where the corruption lies. It has nothing to do with race and everything to do with power and control.

       It's a metaphor.  The Jew "becomes" the black man and takes out his "fear" of them via the persona that they portray blacks on TV as.  this is way deep when you analyze it.

       <em>
        Quickly after the meeting began, one of my industry colleagues (who shall remain nameless like everyone else) thanked us for attending. He then gave the floor to a man who only introduced himself by first name and gave no further details about his personal background. I think he was the owner of the residence but it was never confirmed. He briefly praised all of us for the success we had achieved in our industry and congratulated us for being selected as part of this small group of “decision makers”. At this point I begin to feel slightly uncomfortable at the strangeness of this gathering. The subject quickly changed as the speaker went on to tell us that the respective companies we represented had invested in a very profitable industry which could become even more rewarding with our active involvement. He explained that the companies we work for had invested millions into the building of privately owned prisons and that our positions of influence in the music industry would actually impact the profitability of these investments. I remember many of us in the group immediately looking at each other in confusion. At the time, I didn’t know what a private prison was but I wasn't the only one. Sure enough, someone asked what these prisons were and what any of this had to do with us. We were told that these prisons were built by privately owned companies who received funding from the government based on the number of inmates. The more inmates, the more money the government would pay these prisons. It was also made clear to us that since these prisons are privately owned, as they become publicly traded, we’d be able to buy shares. Most of us were taken back by this. Again, a couple of people asked what this had to do with us. At this point, my industry colleague who had first opened the meeting took the floor again and answered our questions. He told us that since our employers had become silent investors in this prison business, it was now in their interest to make sure that these prisons remained filled. Our job would be to help make this happen by marketing music which promotes criminal behavior, rap being the music of choice. He assured us that this would be a great situation for us because rap music was becoming an increasingly profitable market for our companies, and as employee, we’d also be able to buy personal stocks in these prisons. Immediately, silence came over the room. You could have heard a pin drop. I remember looking around to make sure I wasn't dreaming and saw half of the people with dropped jaws. My daze was interrupted when someone shouted, “Is this a f
       </em>
       ***** joke?” At this point things became chaotic. Two of the men who were part of the “unfamiliar” group grabbed the man who shouted out and attempted to remove him from the house. A few of us, myself included, tried to intervene. One of them pulled out a gun and we all backed off. They separated us from the crowd and all four of us were escorted outside. My industry colleague who had opened the meeting earlier hurried out to meet us and reminded us that we had signed agreement and would suffer the consequences of speaking about this publicly or even with those who attended the meeting. I asked him why he was involved with something this corrupt and he replied that it was bigger than the music business and nothing we’d want to challenge without risking consequences. We all protested and as he walked back into the house I remember word for word the last thing he said, “It’s out of my hands now. Remember you signed an agreement.” He then closed the door behind him. The men rushed us to our cars and actually watched until we drove off.*

       How is it that on a sub like this, that spends so much time denouncing anything reported by 'mainstream media' as corrupt lies and propaganda, but an anonymous letter submitted anonymously to an unverified blog is somehow trustworthy?

       Isn't that just confirmation bias though? I could write a story essentially saying the complete opposite of that, and would that garner the same response from you?

       I am not familiar with rap music in such a detail. There is definitively some kind of agenda in texts and presentation of some of the more popular artist.

       In the end producers chose performers and than repackage them for maximum audience penetration (profit).

       It could be an accident...but it is highly unlikely. In any case it should be investigated more by someone who is more familiar with this type of music. If you are interested..

       No one is going to plan a conspiracy like that in a big mansion with a bunch of loosely connected players they are going to sort out the deals one on one in private then MAYBE have a meeting to go over it more with the people that seem really in.  The fact that people believe this story is a joke.  Also all the facts and dates in it have been shown to be wrong.
