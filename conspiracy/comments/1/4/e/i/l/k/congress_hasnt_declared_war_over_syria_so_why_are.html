       The president can send troops abroad and get permission from congress after.  I believe the time frame is 90 days after he needs congressional approval or the troops must exit.

       This has become normalized long before obama.  OP should know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why syria would use chem weapons knowing what would happen is the real mystery.  It like the police letting you kick the shit out of somebody right in front of them as long as you dont use your gun.  Then midway through the beating you use your gun.  Too dumb even for assad.  But hey, if we shoot them both then plant a gun on him...

       Unless Assad has become so far removed from reality that he fails to think through the consequences of his actions properly. Judging by his actions over the past months and years, he could well have become so detached from rationality that he just sees chemical weapon deployment as another way of desperately clinging onto power.

       I agree.  i'm not quite sure what to think about the situation.  It seems so foolish for Assad to use them.  But there aren't enough good reasons for the US or NATO to false flag the situation and invade, which makes one think that maybe Assad really is that crazy.  Or maybe just totally fucked to the point where crazy seems rational.  After all he's got to be running out of money right about now, and most of the loyalty that comes to him from the money class that keeps him in power must be drying up, as that the money class is hurting now too.  Maybe it was a message to them... to stay loyal.  I don't know!  arg!

       The non-conspiracy analysis says Assad is almost certainly not getting out of this alive. Either rebels or their supporters will kill him, or (if he tries to surrender or flee) his own people will kill him - there are other (primarily religious) power centers than just Assad. He wouldn't need to much intelligence to realize this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that? Use of chemical weapons could be revenge (the people have turned against me!? Well fuck them! I'm taking as many down with me as I can!). Or, it could be used to delay things. If suddenly NATO/UN forces need to spend considerable effort tending to those wounded by mustard gas/sarin/VX, it delays the rebellion (possibly also making it too dangerous to enter areas, forcing long delays just in the progress of the attacking forces, and forcing them through more heavily defended areas). If this gave Assad more time before dying, it increases the odds he could either find or engineer a way to escape with his life (or at worst, gives him awhile longer before being killed).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's reason to believe that use of chemical weapons wouldn't be completely stupid, tactically. However, I'll admit that "Assad has chemical weapons, we must stop him before he can use them" does sound awfully similar to "Saddam has WMDS, we must stop him before he can use them."

       I've read that Assad might just be that desperate.  Assad knows that if he loses the civil war that the rebels will kill him, so staying and losing is not an option for him.  The interesting part that I read was with regard to various asylum offers.  Many people say that he should just give up and go to one of the many countries that have offered him asylum.  However, Assad supposedly believes that his own people and body guards will kill him if he tries to take advantage of an offer for asylum.  The reason for this is that Assad and the entire ruling government is part of an ethnic minority in Syria.  Assad can't take everyone with him when he goes to his place of asylum, and the ethnic majority rebels would then kill those that he left behind.  Nobody wants Assad to abandon them and leave them to their deaths at the hands of the rebels, so they will kill him if he attempts to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all of that is true, then that makes the situation more complicated.  He could conceivably be so desperate as to actually use those chemical weapons.  I don't know, but I guess we'll see.

       "Immediately prior to Jefferson's inauguration in 1801, Congress passed naval legislation that, among other things, provided for six frigates that 'shall be officered and manned as the President of the United States may direct.' … In the event of a declaration of war on the United States by the Barbary powers, these ships were to 'protect our commerce &amp; chastise their insolence — by sinking, burning or destroying their ships &amp; Vessels wherever you shall find them.'"

       " On Jefferson's inauguration as president in 1801, Yusuf Karamanli, the Pasha (or Bashaw) of Tripoli, demanded $225,000 from the new administration. (In 1800, Federal revenues totaled a little over $10 million.) Putting his long-held beliefs into practice, Jefferson refused the demand. Consequently, on May 10, 1801, the Pasha declared war on the U.S., not through any formal written documents but in the customary Barbary manner of cutting down the flagstaff in front of the U.S. Consulate."

       I'll grant you that, but Jefferson did recognize that it was unconstitutional for him to go any further than defensive action without an actual declaration of war from congress. Yet, Obama and Panetta answer to the U.N.? Drastically different behavior...one president recognizing the law of this country, and another completely disregarding for the authority of a foreign entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read the history of the entire event almost the entire thing was from a defensive standpoint on the side of the Americans. Not envading a country on behalf of some foreign entity. Look at how many authorizations congress gave jefferson to act defensively in the interest of their commerce. What kind of authorization has congress given our current president to act in any manner in Syria? Why hasn't our president seeked the approval of congress as Jefferson did?

       It's not nearly the same at all.

       No, Congress simply authorizes them to assist the UN, the same way it authorized Jefferson's undeclared war. They're also authorized to assist NATO.

       Funny, that's not what Panetta said in a congressional hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In response, "Jefferson sent a small force to the area to protect American ships and citizens against potential aggression, but insisted that he was 'unauthorized by the Constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense.'" He told Congress: "I communicate [to you] all material information on this subject, that in the exercise of this important function confided by the Constitution to the Legislature exclusively their judgment may form itself on a knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of weight."

       I don't care what he said. I can read the actual text of the Constitution, and it never says Congress has to issue a declaration of war before the president can go to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can also read the actual laws passed by Congress, and those laws say the president is
authorized to use military force to assist the UN and NATO.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact Congress specifically addressed this issue when it took up a bill that would have stripped NATO O&amp;M funds for use against Gaddafi. In the end congress rejected that law and let Obama just keep using that NATO money to punk the Libyan army.

       Maybe you should read the Constitution again then.  Article I, Section 8 specifically. The Constitution expressively gives the power to declare war to the legislative branch, and not the executive branch. It did give the executive branch the power as commander and chief. This is how the Constitution attempted to balance the power of the branches. But I suppose the interpretation of the Constitution is entirely different debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on topic, I think you are making a false analogy still.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: And just so it's clear...Jefferson never installed a puppet government  after the Tripolitan War. I don't know you why you chose to pull that out of your ass; except that maybe it's an attempt to make your false analogy make sense.

       Yes, but it never says the legislative branch has to do that before the president can exercise his Article II CiC powers.
