       Iraqi's can't be terrorists?  Or rather, labeled as terrorists?  They haven't done it in the past, so therefor they couldn't do it in the future?  Sure they can be made into terrorists!  Home grown terrorists!  We went in there and made them, now they're out to get us.  It's the old story.  Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they will.....they'll be manipulated into it.  They'll be made the scapegoats and blame laid to them.  Etc. etc.  If that is the plan anyway.  how can what this guy believes be so far fetched given what we know already?  Just as you said, the "terrorists were from Saudi A, UAE and Egypt and yet hey TOLD us they were from Iraq regardless and we attacked them!  It doesn't matter to certain people, they'll use anyone and get away with it.

       Why does it matter?  Every single person that posts here has a file somewhere with all of your information organized in neat little bullets: birthday, hometown, school records, emails, website accounts with passwords, general interests, etc.  Don't think that if anyone is interested in knowing who we are that they don't already have that information.  Yeah, you may be one of the few people who always makes sure to use TOR, post through proxies, and only connect through public IPs, but that's unlikely and if somebody wants the info bad enough they can still obtain it.

       lol don't worry. If the thermite hypothesis is correct, of even the inside job hypothesis (Which I think anyone educated on the matter would say has overwhelming evidence for it), Iraqi, Iran nor Afghanistan were not involved in it. They are simply victims of it.

       Well, the 'middle East'-meaning Arabs, were not involved in it.

       There is
       <em>
        overwhelming
       </em>
       evidence, though, that the Israelis were exceptionally complicit in the events of that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the nanothermite used was traced back to Israel's Dimona weapons facility by numerous generals, ex-CIA guys, and Andreas von Buehler.

       credible source on that?  I'm only aware of patents for the type nanothermite used in the demolitions from Cheney's Halliburton.

       How about an I.D. tag from the lab and some papers related to your research?  How about some bona fides on your science education?  Also, some paper work on the Iraqis, or other proof that there are spooky Iraqi professors eager to learn all about nanothermite.

       If you have access to sciencedirect.com, I could share several interesting papers with you. I believe it is illegal to upload said papers to the web, though. It's a new field, so a lot of funding comes from the military so papers are not public. I would refer you to Sullivan and his work with copper oxide and aluminum, if you're interested.

       Now what constitutes "nanothermite dust".  Can anything else produce this same "dust"?

       Nanoscale is anything that has a smallest dimension of usually less than .0000001 meters (100nm). So I'm guessing when they did their testing, they found iron oxide particles with a radius that small or smaller. The scientist that made the claim is Dutch, and I'm not very fluent in Dutch.

       That's a great question. Typically, nanoparticles are synthesized in a manufacturing plant/lab. There are special cases of naturally occuring iron oxide nanoparticles, but they're pretty rare and certainly couldn't be collected in large quantities such as the several tons used in the alleged bombing.

       We're in the habit of working together and supporting those who are in need of the CORRECT information.  Especially those who come to us and post about it.

       People get pissed off about this stuff and can come on here and accidentally dissuade people from looking into the issue simply because they didn't get enough sleep.

       There has NEVER been a documented case of an Iraqi being a terrorist.

      <p>
       For example, the 9/11 terrorists were reported to be Egyptian, Saudi and UAE.
