<p>I&#39;m not saying they will.....they&#39;ll be manipulated into it.  They&#39;ll be made the scapegoats and blame laid to them.  Etc. etc.  If that is the plan anyway.  how can what this guy believes be so far fetched given what we know already?  Just as you said, the &quot;terrorists were from Saudi A, UAE and Egypt and yet hey TOLD us they were from Iraq regardless and we attacked them!

    <div class="md"><p>What are you on about, jackass?</p>

<p>I was at work - think I have time to sit here and listen to you bitch all day?</p>

<p>At least, you mention a school that&#39;s doing research into catalysts at the nanoscale.</p>

<p>Still, I don&#39;t see anything about Iraqis.  And I don&#39;t see anything about using nanothermite in demolition - mostly on micro-arrays.</p>

<p>Nice job, Encyclopedia Brown, you cracked the case!</p>

<p>Rabble-rouser?  That would be you.  I&#39;m here looking for good information and not finding any.  You&#39;re here selling some story about Iraqis and nanothermite as if I should give a fuck.  The epitome of what&#39;s wrong with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is numbnuts talking shit with no proof.  It&#39;s useless - like this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nanoscale is anything that has a smallest dimension of usually less than .0000001 meters (100nm). So I&#39;m guessing when they did their testing, they found iron oxide particles with a radius that small or smaller. The scientist that made the claim is Dutch, and I&#39;m not very fluent in Dutch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great question. Typically, nanoparticles are synthesized in a manufacturing plant/lab. There are special cases of naturally occuring iron oxide nanoparticles, but they&#39;re pretty rare and certainly couldn&#39;t be collected in large quantities such as the several tons used in the alleged bombing.</p>
