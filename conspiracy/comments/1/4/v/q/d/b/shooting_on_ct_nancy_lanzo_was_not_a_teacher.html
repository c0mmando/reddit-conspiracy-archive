<blockquote>
<p>A former school board official in Newtown called into question earlier reports that Nancy Lanza had been connected to Sandy Hook Elementary School, possibly as part of the teaching staff.</p>

<p>“No one has heard of her,” said Lillian Bittman, who served on the local school board until 2011. “Teachers don’t know her.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what to think about all this but 20 minutes of google told me the following...  </p>

<p>The attorney general of CT George Jepsen, was investigating the fact that CT had lost money in the LIBOR scandal.  <a href="http://newtown.patch.com/articles/connecticut-ag-looks-into-libor-manipulation-ac0130d1">Link</a>..  So I guess CT does indeed have ties to LIBOR.  </p>

<p>Wiki says he used to be a representative of the 27th district in CT, which google maps shows is very close to Newtown.  I can&#39;t tell if Newtown is actually in the 27th district.  </p>

<p>After talking about his time in the senate, wiki says &quot;Jepsen became a national leader against the National Rifle Association and for gun control.&quot;</p>

<p>None of this probably means anything, I just figured I&#39;d share what I read.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt any of this really relates to the school shooting, but honestly we&#39;ll probably never know.  Another interesting tid bit; the shooter&#39;s father, Peter Lanza, is the tax director at GE financial services.  GE has previously been named in the the LIBOR scandal.  Just some food for thought.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no proof anywhere that peter lanza was set to testify.  Both of those articles you linked to cite the same BS rumor.  I feel like I have to write this out multiple times per day for people here.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14yok9/can_we_gather_evidence_for_this_libor_scandal/">Please read through this thread</a>.  Also, some people like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/John_Omelette2000">/u/John_Omellette2000</a> just keep spreading this crap around...  the more people hear it the more they believe it.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14z2g3/the_prolibor_lobby_had_been_mobilized_on_this/">Yesterday he posted this.</a>...  Just read through that and draw your own conclusion about it.  </p>

<p>He also stated:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of curiously vocal people out there trying to spread doubt about the LIBOR connections (now 100% confirmed). Just downvote them and move on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t even know what to say about that it&#39;s just simply disgraceful.  We are all trying to contribute information, and asking for an honest source should be encouraged.  </p>

<p>A couple of us have a suspicion that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/John_Omelette2000">/u/John_Omellettee2000</a> is actually the guy in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gui-VRT_YZo&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">this video</a> and he&#39;s just trying to promote himself here.<br/>
There&#39;s no way to tell if that&#39;s true or not...  it&#39;s just kind of a hunch.  </p>

<p>ok, woah, sorry for the rant.  The point is we have no proof that peter lanza was connected to LIBOR.  I wish we did, but we don&#39;t.  If anyone has some real evidence then let us all see it please.  </p>

<p>EDIT:  I would like to clarify what I&#39;m trying to say in this comment as well as my comments above.  If you google GE, LIBOR, etc. you will find numerous articles stating that GE was involved in the scandal (I have not done my homework to research the validity of those articles).  If you google Peter Lanza, LIBOR, etc. it will only result in a few main articles (maybe more by now), and if you try to follow the citations, they won&#39;t lead you anywhere.  </p>

From here in australia, were getting reports that from mainstream news (channel ten) that she was a school teacher and that she was his first victim, which they found when they searched the apartment, and that she was a teacher at the school. They are also promoting that the shooter adam lanza was a autistic kid who was a loner, and just now there talking about (exact words) &quot;gun control, it&#39;s about time&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As cold as this sounds, it will be difficult until the identities of the victims are released.  Right now the whole thing is an inconsistency:</p>

<p>Some 24yr old (who may or may not have mental issues) with no prior record shot his mother and took the 3 handguns and 1 assault rifle (that she, for some odd reason, legally bought and registered and left laying around with hundreds of rounds of ammunition).  Then, stole her car, drove to a school that, as of right now, has no ties to him or his family, and killed almost 30 people, including himself and 20 children under the age of 10...</p>

<p>See my comment below, I want to see proof that she bought the guns herself and a toxicology report of the shooter.  Once the identities are released they should be thoroughly background checked and cross referenced with any other possible issues...</p>

<p>I know this all sounds cold, but see my comment below, I am feeling for these families and want to make sure that the truth is shown...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been driving me crazy and everyone I talk to looks at me like I&#39;m an a$$hole so I&#39;m going to just say it.  (I&#39;m a dad in CT by the way with two kids in this age range, so my heart is broken before anyone judges me).</p>

<p>Why/How does this lady, Nancy Lanza have 4 legally registered guns to her? 3 handguns and an assault rifle.  That seems really, really sketchy.  Then, not only that, but she is dead, so there is no real way for anyone to verify if she actually purchased the weapons OR if they were purchased and registered to her &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.</p>

<p>Additionally, I&#39;m hearing conflicting reports about whether or not Adam has mental disabilities or not.  What I&#39;d like to see is a toxicology report...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what to make of this, but it all doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense.  I don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s a hit, because that would be beyond words, but nothing is off the table here.  I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s another &quot;crazy kid with a gun&quot; incident...</p>

The story in the paper was a paid press release from a company that makes lots of noise about large lawsuits then charges people to sign on.
