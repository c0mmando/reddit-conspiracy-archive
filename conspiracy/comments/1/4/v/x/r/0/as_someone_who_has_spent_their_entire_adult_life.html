       There are some that fall under the umbrella at first but are later discovered to be either emotionally disturbed or suffer from a learning disability with mental illness. I just wanted to say that because the fact that they keep saying he was
       <em>
        autistic
       </em>
       is really starting to piss me off. Downvote me to oblivion just had to get that off my chest.

       Edit: The reason I put this under conspiracy is because this is such a blatant falsehood that I don't think anyone else would have an open enough mind to understand except you guys.

       I'm also a licensed mental health professional....  Yes, autistic men and women can also be co-morbid with Axis II Personality Disorders, especially the "Cluster A" personality disorders.  Autism can be mistaken for Cluster A Personality Disorders, such as "Schizoid Personality Disorder" and vice versa.

       Well the thing is that there really is no true definition of autism. It's really turning into a catch all. The 90's had depression, the00s had add/adhd and now we have autism. There is quite a bit of debate as to the alarming rise the in the diagnoses of autism. I think part of it is more awareness but that should account for like ten percent, the rest I do not have a fucking clue.

       "Personality disorder" and "autism" as categories are both part of a mass conspiracy to create a consensus reality.  As far as your incredulity goes, did it not occur to you to google "autism comorbidity" before posting this?  Also, why is this posted to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       ?  I'm not downvoting you, these are honest questions.

       Co morbidly when it comes to autism is a little misleading. Autism and all under the spectrum have a multitude of symptoms. Obsessive compulsive disorder would be considered co morbid in someone who suffers from depression but in a person with autism it is mostly considered a symptom of the autism not a separate diagnosis. I hope this sounds right. I am three sheets.

       Okay, so the way I'm reading what you're saying is that autism occupies a privileged category among "abnormal" brain types such that its various negative social effects are considered "symptoms" rather than "comorbidities."
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just find that kind of thinking really normative, automatic and limiting.  I can't imagine that "diagnoses" as we know them will even exist in 50 years if we're still around (remember those lobotomies?  Can you imagine how primitive today's crap-shoot "psychiatry" would look to people in this future?).  We still only have access to such a limited view of causality that it makes this sort of unquestioned acceptance of absolute categories feel absurd to me, I guess.

       I could not agree more to be honest. I think that autism is just an easy way out for pdocs to diagnose children with learning disabilities and who do not fit within the context of social
       <em>
        norms.
       </em>
       I really believe that saying the word autism is like saying the word song. It is just one word with infinite meaning. But I am in a system that I have to adhere to if I want to make the small difference that I can. If I went off the deep end as they would call it, I would lose my career and not be able to help anyone.

       Beautifully put.  And I agree with you that helping people in the best way you can is the most important thing.  I think maybe I'm a bit hypersensitive about this, to be honest, because I grew up with hyperlexia in a time before it was widely diagnosed, and as I grew into an adult I definitely developed what one might call "comorbidities"...

       it is not advisable to drink if you have any history of diagnosed mental illness. Alcohol is bad in any way but can trigger cause considerable damage to brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should avoid it as much as possible. Everybody should avoid it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not alcohol as a substance but drinking more than small amounts.
