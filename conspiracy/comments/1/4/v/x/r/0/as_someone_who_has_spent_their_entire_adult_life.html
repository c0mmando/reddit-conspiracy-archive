    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also a licensed mental health professional....  Yes, autistic men and women can also be co-morbid with Axis II Personality Disorders, especially the &quot;Cluster A&quot; personality disorders.  Autism can be mistaken for Cluster A Personality Disorders, such as &quot;Schizoid Personality Disorder&quot; and vice versa.</p>

<p>Diagnosis is far from an exact science, regardless of what the APA may publish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the thing is that there really is no true definition of autism. It&#39;s really turning into a catch all. The 90&#39;s had depression, the00s had add/adhd and now we have autism. There is quite a bit of debate as to the alarming rise the in the diagnoses of autism. I think part of it is more awareness but that should account for like ten percent, the rest I do not have a fucking clue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Personality disorder&quot; and &quot;autism&quot; as categories are both part of a mass conspiracy to create a consensus reality.  As far as your incredulity goes, did it not occur to you to google &quot;autism comorbidity&quot; before posting this?  Also, why is this posted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  I&#39;m not downvoting you, these are honest questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Co morbidly when it comes to autism is a little misleading. Autism and all under the spectrum have a multitude of symptoms. Obsessive compulsive disorder would be considered co morbid in someone who suffers from depression but in a person with autism it is mostly considered a symptom of the autism not a separate diagnosis. I hope this sounds right. I am three sheets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so the way I&#39;m reading what you&#39;re saying is that autism occupies a privileged category among &quot;abnormal&quot; brain types such that its various negative social effects are considered &quot;symptoms&quot; rather than &quot;comorbidities.&quot;  </p>

<p>I guess I just find that kind of thinking really normative, automatic and limiting.  I can&#39;t imagine that &quot;diagnoses&quot; as we know them will even exist in 50 years if we&#39;re still around (remember those lobotomies?  Can you imagine how primitive today&#39;s crap-shoot &quot;psychiatry&quot; would look to people in this future?).  We still only have access to such a limited view of causality that it makes this sort of unquestioned acceptance of absolute categories feel absurd to me, I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could not agree more to be honest. I think that autism is just an easy way out for pdocs to diagnose children with learning disabilities and who do not fit within the context of social <em>norms.</em> I really believe that saying the word autism is like saying the word song. It is just one word with infinite meaning. But I am in a system that I have to adhere to if I want to make the small difference that I can. If I went off the deep end as they would call it, I would lose my career and not be able to help anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautifully put.  And I agree with you that helping people in the best way you can is the most important thing.  I think maybe I&#39;m a bit hypersensitive about this, to be honest, because I grew up with hyperlexia in a time before it was widely diagnosed, and as I grew into an adult I definitely developed what one might call &quot;comorbidities&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is not advisable to drink if you have any history of diagnosed mental illness. Alcohol is bad in any way but can trigger cause considerable damage to brain. </p>

<p>You should avoid it as much as possible. Everybody should avoid it. </p>

<p>Not alcohol as a substance but drinking more than small amounts.</p>

<p>On a question of autism. You are both tight...it is &quot;diagnose&quot; for broad range of symptoms. Psychiatry really needs some overhaul.</p>
