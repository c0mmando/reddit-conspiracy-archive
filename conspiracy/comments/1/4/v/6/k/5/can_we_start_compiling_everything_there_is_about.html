    <div class="md"><p>Sheilaaliens has the first response radio traffic. Police reference visual contact of two shooters running past the library. It&#39;s within the first minute or two. I&#39;d recommend listening to the entire thing, multiple shooters are mentioned more than once. Also, an officer states he has located &quot;multiple weapons&quot;, including a shotgun, and handgun found in one location. Which does not jive with weapon reports in the news. </p>

The entire interview brought absolutely nothing to light about who he was as a person and they hadn&#39;t even had any sort of interaction since middle school. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I heard the possibility that the second gun man is the &quot;handler&quot; of the known gunman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlikely.</p>

<p>Second gunmen are handy when you have a patsy/subject who might back out due to a limited period of conditioning.  If primary shows up armed and ready to go but doesn&#39;t initially follow through, the second gunman primes the pump so that there&#39;s no turning back.  There&#39;s a reason that most of these events culminate in suicide. </p>

<p>A handler might be in contact just before the event or during the event via cell phone/radio (as was the case with the Mumbai shooters), but the handler is too high risk to place themselves in the field at the scene of the crime (the handler would have to commit to a possible suicide mission... and we all know most handlers aren&#39;t that committed)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iirc the two gunman theory in aurora came from a singular eyewitness account and from police radio where cops were discussing whether or not anyone else in the mall may have been involved. Eyewitness accounts are very unreliable especially under duress. ABC reporting a detail from an unconfirmed eyewitness source isn&#39;t evidence. The eyewitness account of a traumatized and confused child isn&#39;t solid evidence. I don&#39;t believe the state is to be generally trusted but christ some of you will accept any speculative bullshit as long as it&#39;s anti-government. </p>

<p>According to one television report, a <strong>second man was caught by police</strong> in an adjoining wood, handcuffed and escorted from the scene.
There were very few non-fatal injuries reported, indicating that once targeted, there was rarely any chance of escape, and that the gunman was <strong>unusually accurate</strong> in his fire.Vance said the majority of killings &#39;&#39;took place in one section of the school, in two rooms&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, for gun control.  In their minds, the more that these shootings occur and the more deplorable they become the more apt they are of gaining the public support for gun abolition.  The reason they want guns out of the hands of citizens?  The impending collapse of our monetary system.  When that happens, there are going to be many many many people wanting to rip the government to shreds.  Fortunately for them, we won&#39;t have an adequate arsenal to form any sort of effective force.</p>

The timing&#39;s preposterous, as well. Were a group trying to force POTUS&#39; hand, why stage the event when he is locked in negotiation with the GOP and currently unable to push through an agenda item which would entrench the right? Any shadow government operative worth their flouride would run an op like this after the fiscal cliff nonsense was settled.</p>

Fox News is also suggesting these massacres are the new norm; if anything the CIA is pushing for people to get more guns and make the killings more common place.

    <div class="md"><p>No. You&#39;re all fucked in the head. Is this thread a fucking joke? Are you serious?!</p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy. There are no all powerful societies and if you understood a smidgeon of human behaviour, you&#39;d understand that things like a new world order would never work.</p>

<p>If the government wanted to abolish gun use, they&#39;d make plans and do it! What? Do you think you&#39;re the ones holding back firearm prohibition? NO. The government doesn&#39;t want it because it&#39;s fucking profitable and an issue that could lose a shit load of votes for whoever proposes it.</p>

<p>I come from Australia where gun laws are strict and harshly enforced. Per capita, we have far less gun crime than America, and quite frankly, I enjoyed not dying at school. You might all bring up the fact that criminals will just buy guns illegally anyway, and yes that is true, but you forget two very important things about human nature:
-most people lack the ability to mortally wound other human beings, regardless of the circumstance.
-killers aren&#39;t just equipping themselves with guns; easily accessible weapons give the mentally unstable a means to manifest their illness into physical harm of others. For a group of people who claim to believe in the corrupting nature of power, you seem to have overlooked that. Give a man the ability to dominate others and he might just take it, regardless of whether he was corrupt to start with.</p>

<p>You&#39;re blinded by your pretense that most tragedies are orchestrated by authorities to chip away at your defenses. Be cynical in moderation, or you&#39;re just as bad as a fool who believes all he is told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, the way I see it,  nobody wastes a bunch of kids for no reason. So the perpetrators of this most heinous act had to have a reason, leaving us open to speculation as to whether they were well connected nutjobs or isolated nutjobs.</p>

<p>Secondly, as a human I resent and reject your statements;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As to the first wrong statement, I could kill you with my ass cheeks! Seriously? Humans are remarkable problem solvers and when the problem is life, cha don&#39;t have no problems. I hail to the quote &quot;God didn&#39;t make all men equal, Samuel Colt did.&quot; When you blame the killing on guns, you&#39;re ignoring the problem of the people killing people.</p>

<p>As to your second wrong statement, you&#39;ve gotta stop projecting your own dominant traits onto others. There is such a thing as a mutually beneficial relationship, and they are sacred rather than sinful. Stop fearing Hobbes&#39; werewolves and love your fuckin neighbor!</p>

<p>To go back to your first wrong statement, you WERE right when you said giving access to weapons to mentally unstable can lead to killing. I&#39;d like to throw it out there that mentally unstable people usually have a hard time acquiring a gun in America and that they have an equally difficult time learning the skills necessary to wield one. IMO that makes one very strong case that the shooters in this case were NOT mentally ill. So again I&#39;m left wondering, why would anyone in the right mind shoot up a school of kids? And/or how much would these mentally unstable people have had to be aided by other mentally ill people to commit this atrocity.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A reason? By many accounts the guy was said to have mental issues including what seemed like a personality disorder and/or some form of autism. If you&#39;re not in that state of mind, then you&#39;re not in a place to say there needs to be a reason that makes sense to you. Mental instability amplifies small problems and warps your perception of events. What might seem a nonsensical reason to you, might be very compelling to someone in that state.</p>

<p>As for obtaining guns, there is no argument. You say the mentally unstable have problems buying guns, but that just isn&#39;t true. An extremely large portion of people with mental illnesses remain undiagnosed, and even if they aren&#39;t, there are people in shops that sometimes offer to waive the waiting period and background checks so they get more business. It&#39;s happened to a friend of mine. Not all places abide by the rules. And even further, the high powered rifle wasn&#39;t his. I&#39;m not sure about the other guns, but there&#39;s a good chance he didn&#39;t have to personally obtain that either if his mother was keen on guns.</p>

<p>And what does problem solving have to do with anything? I&#39;m telling you that you&#39;re wrong. You don&#39;t understand human nature, obviously. Most people are morally incapable of killing another human being, and many that do so in self defense undergo months of therapy. It isn&#39;t a matter of solving a problem; that&#39;s a gross oversimplification with absolutely no thought put in. And I&#39;m not blaming killing on guns, I&#39;m saying it gives people who are prone to be violent a way to manifest that in a way that is more likely to be deadly. Saying that people are blaming killing on guns is just a huge cop out so that you don&#39;t have to face the reality of how dangerous the weapon can make a situation. An analogy: a bunch of kids on a trampoline and one of them is holding a hunting knife. He isn&#39;t a malicious person and the knife isn&#39;t going to personally kill anyone, but having that hunting knife in that situation just makes it far more dangerous to everyone.</p>

<p>Your definition of mentally I&#39;ll seems to be skewed in a strange direction as well. Mental illness contains an extremely diverse array of problems. People who have emotional and reasoning problems can very easily have normal technical skills and ability to learn; and often, they can display a heightened aptitude in many skills than the mentally healthy. So you couldn&#39;t be more wrong in saying that the mentally ill would need help. They&#39;re not all retarded; depression is a mental illness FFS. Open your mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know what point you&#39;re trying to make about projecting my own &quot;dominant traits&quot;. I say all this from observation, not from what I would do.</p>

<p>You obviously don&#39;t understand the general state of the human mind whether it be healthy or not, so don&#39;t embarrass yourself spouting nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re so sure of yourself. That&#39;s right, I was spouting nonsense. And you are now spouting nonsense too. I know what you&#39;re trying to say is that we live in a dangerous world with dangerous mentally ill people and dangerous guns and this is just another example of why these things are dangerous. Just as all the other well publicized, essentially celebrity mass murderer and assassinations that our black ops government has been orchestrating these past 100 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you ARE so sure of yourself aren&#39;t you? I believe the hard evidence however points towards gun free areas being more likely to be targeted for a mass shooting, and lower rates of gun violence with increased regulation NOT restriction. Most shooting happen in metropolises and registered gun owners are safer than doctors. You&#39;re obviously a person of belief, so I&#39;ll stop wasting my time here. I&#39;m never gonna convince you that guns aren&#39;t the problem, the runaway do whatever they want assassinate Kennedy military industrial complex is the problem.</p>

<p>I wish luck and clairvoyance upon you. Good day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re an ignorant prick. Your delusions blind you. I have no tolerance for people like you.</p>

<p>I live in a country with strict gun control and gun crime is remarkably lower than America. You can&#39;t even argue with that. It&#39;s fact.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying guns are the problem, I&#39;m saying guns make it a lot easier for problems to manifest themselves into reality.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t accept reality and logic, you can place your head firmly deeper into your own colon. Fuckwit.</p>

<p>That their is a fear of a revocation of &#39;2nd amendment rights&#39; devoid of reality. If anything there is only the legal precedent for the opposite of what people seem to fear. Nevertheless they say the same thing every time this happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Merely using the AR-15 as an example here of a relatively powerful gun available to the citizenry which gives very little marginal utility over non-firearms when trying to take down military weaponry. I&#39;m posing the question of why a shadowy agency would risk exposure--again and again, for years--to achieve such a minor advantage. Without evidence mor even internal consistency the theory reads like Red Dawn fan fiction.</p>
