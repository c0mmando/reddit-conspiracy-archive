       Soon, rebels to Assad WILL likely kill civilians, likely with gas, plus hinting at WMD's to come, then the Coalition, mainly U.S.A, Britian, and Israel will roll into town covered by International Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assad is found in a hole, then dead, because all Muslims run and hide when they hear we're coming, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       U.S-friendly CEO's take over as interim leadership until the new democratic leadership is elected, after whatever political and economic treaty's are signed.
      </p>
      <p>
       A major enemy of Israel vanishes, with a minimum of response from Iran against the U.N-sanctioned troops, and Russia just deals with it and scowls.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's enough for a b-movie, so it
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be intricate and diabolical enough for world politics lately..
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr
       </strong>
       -They're obviously full of shit about this one, too, but I think they've got it in their minds Syria would be an easier hit than Iran, as far as Russia and China are concerned. Iran has a lot of friends, but would anybody besides Muslims really stay pissed about Syria for long, if it could be done 'neatly' enough?

       we obviously learned from iraq ... now we create "revolutions" and "uprisings" so we can intervene when things get ugly and not be "invaders" but instead "liberators"  .. pretty brilliant actually

       You're probably better off just leaving the nuances at home and simply keeping it very basic, for
       <em>

       So, I wouldn't really bother watching something that gets 5/10 since they turn out crappy most of the time.

       I guess that scenario would just depend on how much russia and china like/need Syria there. Providing the U.S promises not to beat up Iran, that could be a fair trade, Syria now but Iran walks for a while, until
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       big of a bargaining chip with Russia is ever needed again anyway, though at a
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       later date ofc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia and China don't lose much, everybody still keeps making money after the initial power vacuums,  and stability in the region
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       likely improve. In favor of Israel, but still improves....

       Syria is a key strategic zone for moving oil and natural gas out of the middle east, as there are many pipelines running through the country.

       they learned something the last time around? A few mass graves could have lent the whole Saddam thing some more credibility than it had at the time. Not saying I
       <em>
        wanted
       </em>
       that to happen, simply that fresh victims of 'Saddamn and his WMD's' would have started that off from a better legal standpoint, with U.N-approval from day one.

       Libya is likely considered to be an 'operational success" for the U.S, or at least one of the 'desired possible outcomes' they envisoned.  Compared to how Iraq ended up, I'd guess that they all learned something-get in, get what they want done, and basically get the hell out ASAP.
      </p>
      <p>
       If gas is used against the citizens
       <em>
        by anybody, really
       </em>
       , could Syria be 'Libya'd' in that manner?
      </p>
      <p>
       Accomplish their personal objectives, assure Israel's peace of mind, and just GTFO, leaving it up to Israel and whoever has been given Syria to work out for themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the strike is sanctioned by the U.N, scam or not, would Russia, Iran, or China
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       want to make that crucial first step and open hostilities against the United Nations? Not likely...

       Not to mention, the entire 6 month Libya operation cost as much as a single day in Iraq circa 2006.

       Unlike Iraq there's actually verifiable evidence of the gas weapons in Syria because the US friggin' sold it to them... All the stupid and non-researched posts like this are why this sub is becoming such a crap fest...
