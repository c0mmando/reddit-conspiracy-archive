       FWIW, I deliberately left out the word "autism" in the title because I believe it's
       <em>
        such
       </em>
       a loaded term that refers to
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       many different conditions that bringing it up in a discussion about vaccinations completely distracts from the real issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not calling into question
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       vaccines, because that would fly in the face of decades of scientific research and analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER, babies in the US are being given
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       more vaccines at far younger ages than any other country on the planet. The CDC's reason for this is to "make sure everybody gets the vaccines" so they've increased the frequency and the amount for children, often combining more than 5 different vaccines to be administered at one time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this reasoning not seem like overkill?
      </p>
      <p>
       My concern is that the fragile and developing immune systems of these babies often can't handle this barrage of chemicals and viruses, and that the lack of studies on combining these vaccines at such a young age is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       troubling.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's striking how many more vaccines babies get today compared to even 10-15 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about autism and this isn't about herd immunity. This is about exposing our children with
       <em>
        too many
       </em>
       harmful chemicals at one time at young ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, we live in a climate were questioning the current vaccine schedule is akin to claiming we didn't go to the moon (or worse, those that question the schedule are causing the
       <em>
        deaths
       </em>
       of others!).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, on either side of the argument. Am I being irrational? Or is this a valid concern?

       This many doses aren't needed. That's the point. There is no reason why a child under 2 years old needs 3 hep B shots before the age of 2 unless his mother is Hep B positive.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no reason why a child under 2 needs polio vaccination. It can wait.

       There's no need for VZV vaccination at all.

       Okay I'll explain in a different way. Thimerosol and other preservatives that are in each vaccine have been proven to be dangerous to people's health. It's not the vaccine people care about, it's the other things in the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       So each time you get a dose (doesn't matter if it's a booster or a new virus type) you're getting pumped full of these unwanted chemicals. For a child to be needlessly exposed to these chemicals is literally child abuse.

       Would you care to provide some scientific documentation showing this assertion to be true?

      <p>
       Thimerosal is no longer used in childhood vaccines; hasn't been since between 1999 - 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thimerosal is metabolized into ethyl mercury and is passed through the body without any negative effect.  People hear the word "mercury" and immediately think that all forms of mercury can cause damage.  The form of mercury that is dangerous is methyl-mercury.

       Because you are double counting! You never count each does as a separate medication...unless you're trying to find something to fit your claim. If you were to take the following medications, how many medications would you say you're taking:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Advil (2 pills) -Dayquil (1 pill) -Benadryl (1 pill) -Amoxicillin (2 pills)
      </p>
      <p>
       You're only taking FOUR medications, not six. But using your "logic" you'd say you're taking six medications. You can say you're taking 6 pills, but that's different.

       Ampules of the same vaccines.  Ampules are doses.  I understand you have a deep seeded need to discredit vaccines, but you can attempt to make a smarter argument than that.  I've read a lot if stupid arguments about vaccines, this is the stupidest.   13 vaccines, not 40 or 26.

       Okay I think you are failing to understand some basic principles so I will make this clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, I am not discrediting vaccines, I am explaining to you why people are concerned. You cannot argue against something you do not understand. I am in favour of vaccination, so ad hominems against me only discredit you. This is merely for your understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, people are worried about the number of preservatives their children are receiving in their vaccines. Preservatives are in ampoules. Whether they receive 100 ampoules of the same virus vaccine or 1 apoule each from 100 virus vaccines, it would make no difference to their concern. Their concern is mostly the number of ampoules. Others may be concerned about the number of viruses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third of all, let's look at the CDC guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf">
        http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This clearly shows that children will receive 26 ampoules of injection by the age of 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 ampoules of Hep B (x1 at Birth, x1 at 1 month, x1 at 6 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       3 ampoules of Rotovirus (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 at 6 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       4 ampoules of Diptheria/Pertussis/Tetanus (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 at 6 months, x1 at 15 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       4 ampoules of Haemophilus Influenza B (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 and 6 months, and x1 at 12 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       4 ampoules of pneumococcus (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 and 6 months, and x1 at 12 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       3 ampoules of polio (x1 at 2 months, x1 at 4 months, x1 and 6 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       2 ampoules of influenza (x1 at 6 months, x1 at 16 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       1 ampoule of MMR (x1 at 12 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       1 ampoule of varicella (x1 at 12 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       1 ampoule of Hepatitis A (x1 at 12 months)
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, kids are being immunized against 14 viruses, but that's not the concern. The major concern is that they are receiving 26 ampoules with toxic preservatives before the age of 2. The other concern is that they are being injected by too many shots simultaneously (7 shots in a single visit at 6 months). And I'm sure there are other concerns, but I am not an anti-vaxxer so I don't know what they are.

       Which ones?  And do you have any proof that they are dangerous?  And which people?  Most thinking people understand how important vaccines are and that they're safe.  It's only the delusional paranoid members of society that don't.  They usually also believe in UFOs, hate Monsanto, hate GMOs, believe the big pharma conspiracy...the list goes on and on with their paranoid delusions.

       Everyone on your side (anti-vax no matter how much you try to prove otherwise) loves to use Thiameasol as their go-to toxin of choice; however, Thiamerasol was taken out of childhood vaccines between 1999 - 2001 when they moved from the multi-dose vials to the single-dose ampules.  It was used in order to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination of the multi-dose vials.  It's effects on the body and the effects of metabolism on Thiamerasol has been found to be safe and without any lasting ill effects.

       How do you know they're toxic?  Do you have any research that's been done to show this?  And by research I mean academic, peer reviewed research...not "research" you dig up on some anti-vax or alternative medicine website.

       This right here is called "vaccine or immune system overload."  It's a joke.  There's on such thing as immune system overload.  Do you realize how many infectious agents you come into contact daily when you are young..you're immune system is not overloaded.  It's designed in a way so that it can protect you from a large number of infectious agents at once.

       You really need to stop spreading this misinformation you're spreading.  People who are not able to think independently and are prone to paranoia delusions are going to believe what you say and put the public in danger of very harmful diseases.

       I know I'm not going to change your mind...that's not what I'm out to do.  Over and over, you've shown yourself to be a fool when it comes to this topic and I've systematically destroyed every single one of your arguments.  First you agreed with the absurd title of this posting.  Then when you were disproved on that aspect you went onto "Oh, children get 26 ampules of blah blah blah."  THEN you brought in the mythical idea of immune system overload.

      <p>
       Please respond, the more you respond, the more foolish you look and the more foolish the entire anti-vax movement looks.

      <p>
       You're obviously HIGHLY uneducated on this topic.  I'd suggest you go read an immunology text book, although I doubt you'd be able to grasp even the fundamentals since  you believe in the myth of vaccine overload...

       No, what you are doing is legitimizing their unfounded and unwarranted concerns.  Even though they may not be your beliefs (highly doubtful though) you are just as complicit in spreading around the undereducated and misguided misinformation floated around by anti-vaxers.  Good job.

       Conversely, I'm thankful I avoided a lot of the recalled vaccines, like HPV. I love SCIENCE, but I feel like a lot of products are rushed to market and have side effects that can't be taken back. I agree with OP that the rush for mandatory vaccinations that have not been around for a decade or so (without clear clinics and trials) are a bit unnerving.

       No conspiracy here though, just the sad outcome of greed fed by fear.

       When you say you love science, I think you are really saying that you love the ideal of science. The problem is that science has become a political tool. The tabacco lobby managed to use science for years to convince us that cigarettes were not harmful - until common sense won over in the end (to give an obvious example of how science can be manipulated). The same happens with GMOs. Science can be corrupted, and thus become anti-science. It seems to me that the science that defends vaccines is political... I could be wrong, but what is often missing from the debate is the acknowledgement that this is at least possible and should be part of the debate.

       The answer is they intentionally put live viruses in some vaccines, we have proof that polio was in the polio vaccines, this is all admitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know there were monkey viruses put into vaccines that caused cancer in the monkey this is all admitted.
      </p>

       So while many vaccines are beneficial, some are  useless and some are filled with cancer and other viruses.

       The majority of the vaccines issued contain the disease they are supposed to prevent.  What is done is that most of the pathogenic forms of antigen on the cell are removed, leaving a few so that the body will then be able to recognize them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dosage amount and the solution that vaccines offer more of a concern.  That and the occasional and possible slip up where there are contaminated vaccines- think of food an e. coli outbreaks.

       No, they intentionally put viruses and this is your problem. You just haven't heard and read what these people talk about all day and that is reducing the human population. I mean for fucks sake they write public articles about population control and reduction.

       I think the bigger issue is money.  Vaccines are the largest US export, if I'm not mistaken.  Maybe software too, but there's a lot of money involved in selling those shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actuality of it is likely that there are a few that are important, and there's a lot of bs and cost cutting that makes the rest of it unnecessary and dangerous.

       This is not a personal attack: Publicly questioning anything to do vaccinations will inevitably lead to an unfavorable comparison to Jenny McCarthy in the same way that questioning the use of fluoride in drinking water will lead to similar comparisons to other lunatics. There may be valid concerns regarding the number and frequency of vaccinations in American children, but, those concerns are immediately discredited by the majority of the public due to negative media coverage of vaccine deniers like McCarthy. 
A few things to consider regarding vaccines: The science behind vaccines is unassailable if fact based methods are employed. The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and DT ( diphtheria and tetanus) vaccines combine several diseases into one dose because it increases the effectiveness of the vaccines. Hepatitis B vaccinations must be given in series or little or no resistance is imparted. I would also add that the amount of harmful chemicals (formalin is an example) in vaccines and their effects on the human body is negligible, even in infants, even with multiple doses. Infants exposed to attenuated or dead microbes in minute amounts will be better able to resist those diseases in the future.
The driving argument against/for mass inoculation is philosophical in nature: Do the needs of the many (millions of children dying or being maimed by preventable infectious disease) outweigh the needs of the few (a minute percentage of those immunizations causing death or maiming)?

       Yeah but Belgium for example has 24 vaccines over I believe 16 years, most European countries have less than 20 vaccines over 16 years, having 40 vaccines and many of them administered by 5 or 10 is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the science done by almost all Europe countries shows than less than 20 vaccines over a period of more than 15 years is best.

       Cost control for socialized medicine verses privatized medicine. The schedule from the WHO is a good example of bare bones cost effectiveness. It is an example of how to prevent the most disease for the cheapest. You may recall the French health care service killing off their hemophiliacs accidentally on purpose with HIV tainted products and saving many francs in the process. American medical insurance companies would never pay for unnecessary vaccines if it did not save costs later on.

       guaranteed gates had someone write a program that finds negative commentary and auto posts pro vaccination bullshit in response. If you're trying to build an industry to sell to the Indians.... why not spend 20,000 to write a piece of software that argues with all dissent. incidentally, if you have not written this piece of software Bill, because lets face it, we know you're watching.....  i will do it for you.... for 20,000 euros.

       Question here... as a parent and an adult human being, do you think it is natural to be injecting a child (younger than 6 months old) with up to 40 vaccines (all of which have different products and by products in them) before your childs immune system even gets a chance to develop?  Second question, have you ever studied what by products are also included in your childs vaccines and can you name some of the most common by products used in vaccines?

       I believe that there are lots of people in pain, some acutely and some chronically who greatly benefit from pain medication. I think that this outweighs the overdoses, GI bleeds, and addictions that can come from that medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to antibiotics I believe that the harms of allergic reactions and diarrhea are minor in comparison to their benefits. The risk of antibiotic resistance is a null argument as you can only argue that the worst harm makes it so that antibiotics are useless, which isn't really a harm at all if they weren't beneficial in the first place.

       Not as many people used to die during childhood as perhaps you think. Anyways, at this point, enough generations have developed natural resistances to diseases that at this point other than the occasional chickenpox it is highly unlikely unvaccinated children are going to die or get a life threatening disease unless they are exposed to seriously unusual circumstances.

       Infant mortality was around 6% 75 years ago as opposed to 0.4% today (in the US).
      </p>
      <p>
       And not only that, but infectious disease was by far the largest killer of all people 75 years ago where it is eclipsed now by both heart disease and cancer (in the US).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think vaccinations have had no effect on either of these stats then you would be mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what are these "natural resistances" you speak of?  By what biochemical mechanism do they act? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

       Speaking of infant mortality, the USA ranks #50 in infant mortality rates according to the CIA World Factbook.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate">

      <p>
       The USA is also the most vaccinated country on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the reason infant mortality has decreased in the last century is because of running water, toilets that flush, soap, transportation, a stable food supply, a more diverse food supply, electricity for all, heating for all and clean water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets not forget that mainstream medical doctors 150 years ago laughed at the idea of washing their hands before delivering a baby.

      <p>
       Think of how your life would be without running water, a toilet and soap. Then combine that with doctors being offended at the thought of washing their hands before delivering a baby. Then you'll get an idea of why infant mortality was so high.

       Yeah, it's a ton of vaccines for children at a young age, but at the same time, it's those same children who are more at risk of dying.  Meningitis, for example, causes brain swelling and possible permanent neurological damage.

       That is absurd, and that is why the CDC takes such drastic measures to make sure as many people get vaccinated for as many things as possible. People who don't get vaccinated put everyone at risk by bringing down herd immunity. I would not go so far as to say that the CDC is immaculate by any means, but they have no scientific reason so far to advise against this method of vaccination. And no, anecdotal acounts by a few concerned parents is

      <p>
       This is about herd immunity. Anyone not being properly vaccinated is a detriment to herd immunity. Also, for every bit of time that you put off a vaccination, you are creating an opportunity for your child to become a vector. A measles outbreak in Arizona in 2008 (IIRC) was caused by a very young kid who had just come back from Switzerland. Now, I don't think his parents intended to vaccinate him at all, but even if they were just going to vaccinate him later, the outbreak was going to happen. If you wait and then your kid becomes infected and therefore a vector, every immune-compromised person, every infant that is too young for the given vaccination, and anyone else that does not have immunity, is at risk of infection because some kid's parents decided out of the blue and with no evidence that the given vaccine was dangerous or was too close in time to another. That's why we talk about herd immunity.

      <p>
       I'll agree that the conversation is being perhaps unjustly strangled, but many of the people who criticize the schedule also opted not to get many of the vaccines recommended, or did not get them when they were critically important.

      <p>
       You are being irrational. Excuse me if I have been harsh, but you have to understand what these vaccine "questioners" look like from outside of the movement: a bunch of paranoid, nutty concerned mothers shrieking about things that they do not understand (and are therefore unquestioningly afraid of).

       No, of course not. It's important to get as much scientific data as we can; for now, though, there's no support for vaccines being harmful, and there's no support for the assumption that grouping them makes them worse.

        Recently, I was told by a vaccinator that “herd immunity is just a definition and so it can’t actually be wrong. ” But the assumption of a 95% vaccination rate giving the herd a chance at eradication or higher levels of health – can be wrong.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yeah, exactly. Herd immunity is a definition. I'm not arguing that second point, that 95% vaccination can eliminate a disease, so I'm not going to try to debunk that article (whose sources consist primarily of "greenmedinfo.com"). I linked to herd immunity because I was talking about it's definition: the more people vaccinated, the less chance there is of getting infected.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think vaccines work (as I do), then herd immunity is obvious: more people vaccinated means fewer carriers means fewer infections. If you don't think vaccines work, then herd immunity is irrelevant. I was simply highlighting herd immunity as the reason why
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       wouldn't be content with each of us vaccinating our children only if we felt like it.

       An online poll on a site dedicated to showing vaccines are harmful (and run by a homeopath) is not a reliable source in the slightest. He analyzes only respondents with "entirely unvaccinated children" completely throwing basic statistical/scientific concepts such as "control groups" out the window. It also features basic math errors that I don't want to bother to list, and, if you actually read his results, you'll find that his numbers on autism in unvaccinated children match those reported in general populations, but Bachmair conveniently ignores this. This is not honest science.

       Generally speaking vaccines are effective in combating the target disease (the one you are getting vaccinated for) but the downside of this is that the chemicals they put in the vaccines in order to be effective also do serious damage to the immune system. A recent german study confirms this, kids are more likely to get other diseases if they are vaccinated than if they are not vaccinated at all:

       The very way vaccines are administered in bad for you, going straight into the bloodstream bypasses the body's natural defenses/skin/lungs etc. and throws tons of shit right into you. This causes the lymph nodes and white blood cell production to go crazy, and really does long term damage because the body's natural defenses are thrown into overdrive in a very short period of time, rather than naturally contracting a disease in which case the body has forewarning and has time to prepare. In addition, the chemicals in vaccines such as mercury will do long term damage to your immune system, which explains the german kiggs study's results.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's hilarious to see the mainstream opinion on reddit as pro-mandantory vaccination, as if humans didnt survive thousands of years without vaccines. I know the argument against that is that tons of people died, and with vaccines, NO ONE HAS TO DIE, but the interesting thing is, the majority of the reason polio and measles were virtually wiped out is not so much vaccination, as it is generational antibody production, much the same way diseases mutate to combat immune systems, immune systems adapt to combat disease. The body is capable of healing itself, and we didnt get here after thousands of years by 100% NEEDING VACCINES.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more vaccines we throw into people, the more they need to be vaccinated, as the immune system gets damaged more and more, thus vaccines become less effective (as the immune system cannot deal with diseases as effective, even if vaccinated, because of all the vaccines that have been thrown at it over the years, but we need to vaccinate even MORE as the immune system can do less and less by itself.

       Like so many other debates, the inherent problem here is that the subject has been polarized into the notorious dualistic "2 sides only"...similar to the state of the broken US political system.

       The media has convinced us it's an either-or situation. Either you think all vaccines are evil, or you accept and trust them am completely. As a result, rational and moderate debate on the subject is near impossible.

       It's pretty well accepted among independent researchers that the flu vaccine is statistically ineffective. Also there seems to be a causative relationship between getting the flu vaccine and getting the flu. I really wish I could go back in time to the days when I believed the FDA existed to keep me safe.

       I just thought most people knew of the studies and I really don't want to argue this issue. I was just stating the fact of the studies. I don't care what anyone here believes about flu shots. I feel very comfortable about my own conclusions. I will give you a link to a blog (mine) where you will find some reports about the various studies.

       Mercury is no longer used in childhood vaccines in the US, hasn't been since about 1999 - 2001.  There are a few flu vaccines that have thimerosol in them, but thimerosol is converted into ethyl mercury which is harmlessly excreted by the body.  Methyl mercury is the dangerous form of mercury.

       No, the body doesn't change the organisms. The analogy I will make is that if a disease goes through the usual layers of protection the body will start to mobilize its defenses the same way a country would call up troops if another country declared war. The difference is rather than being prepared for the enemy once it finally starts to attack, having a vaccine put even an "attenuated" version of the virus straight into the bloodstream is an equivalent of a surprise attack on washington D.C. as far as the "oh shit" response of your body. It's very taxing on the immune system.

       Mercury and thimerisol are just examples. There are tons of chemicals that can cause adverse reactions to children and even adults in vaccines, there are plenty of cases (although not the norm) that confirm this.

      <p>
       If you were really as unbiased as you think you are you would go do your own independent investigation of vaccines as countless doctors and individuals have, and come to the conclusion that the mainstream position is total garbage. The same way anti-depressants are only there to keep customers coming back for more by treating depression rather than curing it, vaccines require more vaccines because of the damage each one does to the immune system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main problem with vaccines is the fact that adjuvants are needed in order to stimulate the immune system to respond effectively to the disease. When going through normal avenues of approach such as skin/lungs the body sees whats coming and produces a response at a normal rate. With vaccines, chemicals are used in order to help the body to go into overdrive and effectively respond to the vaccine. The side effect of this is like overcharging any electrical system--it does permanent damage. This explains why numerous studies show that "non-target" diseases are more prevalent among vaccinated people than non-vaccinated individuals.

       Looked through your comment history, looks like you're in nursing school so you're obviously not going to go against what the very profession you've decided to be in has told you to believe. I'm not going to waste time convincing someone of something that at the core of them--they cannot bring themselves to believe--even if it is the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just in case you really are interested in the truth, let me drop some tidbits of verifiable information on you:
      </p>
      <p>
       FACT: Before the Polio Vaccine, there had never been a virus from another species deliberately injected into humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       FACT: 61% of all human tumors (at autopsy) now contain the SV40 monkey virus, traceable to the Polio vaccine of the 1950s and 60s
      </p>
      <p>
       FACT: CUTTER vaccine division and WYETH produced a deadly Polio vaccine with a live virus that actually gave the recipient POLIO
      </p>
      <p>
       FACT: All above information was withheld from the public for years to avoid a public panic and to prevent a loss of faith in vaccines. polio was a very rare infectious disease that presented little risk to the public, but the risk was greatly exaggerated by the Polio Foundation before the introduction of the  polio vaccine, the miracle vaccine - contaminated with a monkey virus which has been the cause of soft tissue cancers for decades since.

       This can be confirmed in this well researched and documented book:

       Your argument is based upon the idea that the immune system works in one layer at a time.  This is completely false.  Once through the skin, the immune system works in concert.  As I said vaccines are killed, weakened or particles of an infectious organism.  Actually, a living infectious organism would send the immune system into haywire more, based on your shoddy theory.  When a host cell is killed be an infectious organism it sends out cytokines in order to have an immune response.  This mobilizes the white blood cells more than a vaccine.  Since a vaccine is a killed, weakened or particle of an infectious organism, it doesn't produce such a response and if it does it is much weaker than the infectious organism.

       Look at the vaccine schedule for DTaP and compare it to the average age of SIDS deaths. I think there is a pretty obvious connection. Wish that was talked about more.

       No, but it does need to be explored. And just so you are aware. I am not anti vax. My children have all of their Vacs that are required but notbthe optional ones. I did however delay/ spread out vaccines as recommended by a pro delayed vax pediatrician. I was able to do this because i stayed home and could exclusively breast feed. Not everything is black and white. We do have so many more vaccines than Europeans but our mortality rate is higher.  It is not extreme to question why.

       WRONG!!!  It varies widely from country-to-country but most have around the same vaccine requirements as we do in the US.  You'd also be interested to know that a few required the BCG vaccine which is the vaccine against TB.  You'd also be interested to know that once a person has a BCG vaccine they must have a chest x-ray as well as a PPD reading to ensure they don't have TB.

       Pretty vague term here.  Mortality in terms of what?  What age group are you referring to?  Are you implying that we have a higher mortality rate due to infectious diseases?  If so, what infectious diseases?  That's a very broad, generalized, and cliche statement.

       Not everyone has to be monitored for TB after having the vaccine; however, if someone wants to work in healthcare or with children, they must get a TB test.  If they've had the BCG vaccine, this means they also have to have a chest x-ray because the PPD will sometimes show positive for the TB toxins and antibodies.  The point was to tell you that in Europe they actually MORE vaccines than we do in the US.

       As you can see in the first link, in 2005, the SIDS rates in the US and most European countries was statistically the same.  I provided the second one so that you can brush up on the subject since you clearly don't know what you're talking about... Seriously, are you just pulling stuff out of your ass here?!?

      <p>
       Are you implying that SIDS is caused by vaccines?  If so, you are again misguided.  Like autism, there's no proof between childhood vaccinations and SIDS:

       Jesus. I am saying there needs to be more studies about this. I am not quoting any websites or saying that dtap absolutely causes sids. Like I said even my own kids have had dtap ..just delayed. There is some correlation and I wish it was looked into/ talked about. That's it.

       It looks like you're deflecting.  I've systematically disproved every single point you've made so now you have no where else to turn but accuse me of being angry.  There's no angry tone whatsoever in any of my posts, but then again like I said, you have no where else to turn.

       I've seen this same exact response by anti-vaxxers all the time...strange that you claim to not be anti-vaccine, yet use their same tactics...such a weird reaction from someone who claims not to be anti-vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for vaccine safety, there are plenty of studies available about the safety of vaccines, 20,000+ at least at last count.  None of them have any earth shattering implication about dangers of vaccines.  The one study that ALMOST did was the Wakefield study, but then look what happened?  Falsified data, lies, retractions from a very prestigious medical journal, removal of his medical license and ability to practice medicine...
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing the anti-vaxxers always say (yes, I'm lumping you in with them, don't care if you say you aren't anti-vax, its very clear that you are) is that "more research needs to be done."  Hogwash on their part, they are just waiting to find research to bolster their claims.  Vaccines have been around for 50+ years, and if anything they are getting safer, not less safe.  Good luck on your crusade of anti-vaccination.  Thankfully most people aren't as under educated about the topic as you clearly shown...over...and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know full well I won't change your anti-vax mind, but at least I've made you look like a fool sufficiently enough so someone reading your responses will realize how uneducated your stance is.

I could really care less. Where I am coming from is that I am a responsible. Parent doing what the government.

       Is this supposed to be two sentences?   It has nothing to do with the government asking or not asking people to vaccinate.  There is no federal requirement to vaccinate, it is done state-by-state.  You'd know this if you'd have done your own research.  The problem is that people like you spread lies and misguided information that influences people to make terrible decisions of not vaccinating their children.

       As I said, it influences people not to vaccinate.  People who are undereducated on topics (clearly this is you in this case) always point to correlation.  There has never been any proof that DTaP causes SIDS, only a correlation.  In fact, the SIDS rates are decreasing world-wide.  If you'd have looked at any of those links I provided you, you'd have realized how shaky your argument is.

       Since it's obvious you're going to come back to the SIDS argument, I'm just going to quit.  I've succeeded enough in making you look foolish and tearing apart your arguments.  Hopefully enough people will read our little exchange and realize that you anti-vaxxers base your arguments on conjecture and opinions rather than scientific research and publications.

       I am really sure my comment that sids is higher in the us and that I think therebis a correlation between dtap and sids that should be looked into and talked about isd really going to cause a rash of people to suddenly stop vaccinating their kids. I am not that important.

       That is a grand total of 13 vaccines that are given...for pretty horrific diseases.  I know...I know...people like you think the vaccine is worse than the disease, but it's not.  These are debilitating diseases that can be eradicated but unfortunately people like you who pedal in junk science are often given a broad microphone in the media without any counter balance to your erroneous claim.

      <p>
       Vaccines are safe, there are small risks of side effects but that goes along with anything.  There's absolutely nothing ominous about them, but I guess when you believe the big pharma conspiracy story it's different.

       People who do not vaccinate their children should be held financially liable for any illness suffered after exposure to those children by unvaccinated infants for by individuals for whom the vaccine is not effective.

       Babies are exposed to thousands of new germs in their first two years making 40 more exposures a very small percentage...if their immune system is handling 10,000 exposures is 10,040 significantly different? Logically speaking of course.

       Because they already have antibodies in their system inherited from their mother, it's not like all these germs are totally foreign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines annihilate the immune system, numerous studies have shown this to be the case, but since they effectively combat the target disease, no one questions them...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2011/new-study-vaccinated-children-have-2-to-5-times-more-diseases-and-disorders-than-unvaccinated-children/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is, the chemicals need to be put in the vaccines so they can bypass the bodies natural defenses in order to implant antibodies. The downside of this is that they do permanent and ongoing damage to the body's immune system, thus more vaccines are needed in the future, and so on and so forth. A money maker if I've ever seen one, similar to anti-depressants, fixing the problem by forever prescribing drugs...go off the drugs and you're worse off than you were before you were on them.

       I didn't say
       <em>

       that children shouldn't be vaccinated at all, so bringing up the red herring that is Jenny McCarthy's bullshit crusade completely distracts from my point.

       I'm suggesting that perhaps we need to space out the current vaccine schedule, especially for infants.

       Infant mortality was around 6% 75 years ago as opposed to 0.4% today (in the US).

      <p>
       And not only that, but infectious disease was by far the largest killer of all people 75 years ago where it is eclipsed now by both heart disease and cancer (in the US).

       If you think vaccinations have had no effect on either of these stats then you would be mistaken.

       adaptive response occurs over a person's lifetime, not over generations.

      <p>
       I believe that there are lots of people in pain, some acutely and some chronically who greatly benefit from pain medication. I think that this outweighs the overdoses, GI bleeds, and addictions that can come from that medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to antibiotics I believe that the harms of allergic reactions and diarrhea are minor in comparison to their benefits. The risk of antibiotic resistance is a null argument as you can only argue that the worst harm makes it so that antibiotics are useless, which isn't really a harm at all if they weren't beneficial in the first place.
