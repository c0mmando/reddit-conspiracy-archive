       The Mayans stopped counting galactic time then; it still isn't clear why, but they must have had a good reason. Something is going to happen at a cosmic level, which materialist science may not even be able to discern, that makes it either impossible or pointless to calculate future celestial movements with the accuracy they required from their point in time. I don't claim to know what it is; but I'm keeping an open mind, and making it a point to enjoy life while I do. No point in getting riled up; you can't prepare for what you don't understand; but you can prepare for death, which we all ought to be doing anyway, by living right. I'm actually more concerned with what NWO might do to exploit the occasion than the preColumbian gods.

       thank you for bringing this up, more people need to connect the dots on your idea and the tilt of the earth. if the earth is tilted an unknowable amount of degrees how could you possible keep count with the stars.

       There are 13 bak'tuns in the grand cycle (might not be the right term for it) each bak'tun is like 2150 years or something like that, but it's not based on time and date as we know it. Once the 13th bak'tun is completed, the planets align with the center of the galaxy and allegedly a huge pulse of energy is going to come through each planet and raise our mental frequencies so that we can achieve an elevated consciousness as a species. The pulses energy is only supposed to last a shrt amount of time but allegedly the pyramids are supposed to capture the energy in our atmosphere and sustain it much longer. Its kind of like an lsd trip on steroids. In that time dec 21-23 were supposed to focus our thoughts as a species on positivity and freedom and (again) allegedly this will shape out future. After this consciousness shift, the grand cycle restarts and we begin the 1st bak'tun again. Just like how we have 12 months in the Gregorian calendar, the Mayans had 13 bak'tuns however try are much longer cycles and they don't use Gregorian dating like our calendar. This is why people who use the leap year argument are wrong. Bak'tuns follow the stars, not a Monday-Sunday schedule

       A major event WILL occur as of 12/21. From an astrological standpoint the earth will align with the sun and the center of our universe for a period of time as of that date (est at 11:11 gmt for approx 11 seconds) What specifically does this mean for Earth?  It is said that it will prompt the polar shift in the earth causing it to tilt.  I'm pretty confident if this does happen to be the case, you can imagine the dire consequences this will have  on everyone and everything.

       To my understanding a pole shift has been in effect for hundreds of years.

       What you're thinking of is precession where the magnetic pole migrates...for instance in the last hundred years it has moved hundreds of miles which is at an alarming rate in itself. The best evidence that I can see of a polar shift is by looking at the aligned megalithic structures such as Giza, Easter island etc that align above and below the equator as we know it today, but imagine if their alignment was the equator at one point in time. It is an obvious shift if you compare their alignment with true north. In addition, isn't curious that mammoths have been found frozen in Siberia in pristine condition even with plant food in their stomachs? What can cause such a rapid change to where it just wipes out creatures  where they are standing? To me it is evidence of things to come. When? Thats the beauty of it all. I just find it curious when you have cosmic  events happening on 12/21 that can cause such an event..
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, I don't think it is solely a fear mongering gesture to think something will happen as of that date but I can see why people will think it is... I mean, how else can you prepare 7 billion people for a cataclysmic event? You don't. You just tell them it's crazy talk so everyone can go about their lives for what time they have left. It keeps the moral afloat.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some advocates for the 2012 catastrophe say that what will actually cause the devastation is an alignment of planets. There is no planet alignment on the winter solstice in 2012. Nonetheless, advocates of doom connect the fictional alignment to astrological predictions or groundless claims about a reversal of Earth's magnetic field and unprecedented solar storms. Many internet postings and guests on all-night apocalyptic radio have elaborated on these themes.

       See your bullshit is in your own words, but no one ever seems to pick up the slight subtleties. "there is no planet alignment" as nasa says, which is correct, but that is not what was being talked about. A planetary alignment has to do with any number of planets lining up, where as the sun and the earth and the middle of the galaxy does not.

       There are so many predictions it is hard to say...

      <p>
       You've got the planetary alignment that you are referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the possibility that Nibiru does exist and it will fly between mars and Jupiter and the gravitational pull will have a profound affect on Earth.

       Terrence McKenna and his work with the I Ching and his timewave zero theory. In which he describes events in time that had significant impact such as the fall of the Roman Empire to 9/11 as "novelty" . The timewave reaches 0 on December 21 2012. Now, he did not say that that will be the end of time but instead it may be an infinite amount of novelty. An awakening of the gathered consciousness so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bashar says that it is a threshold and that the world will be slightly more positive than negative and it will be the beginning of what he describes as a snowball going down a mountain and the positivity will increase at a faster and faster rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion? 
Don't think about a future in which you are a victim. You might attract being a victim into your reality. Your thoughts evoke reality. Stay positive.

       True. It could be nothing. Honestly, like you, I don't know. But it has been fun studying the different aspects of people's imagination who were convinced that this date is of importance. The part that you quoted was very interesting. Especially how terrence mckeena stumbled upon his timewave zero theory. Do some research on it I can sen you sources if you'd like. Peace.

       We will end the era of materialism to enter the era of magic. Some people will gain magical abilities and  new species  will spawn out from the underground like orcs and goblins. Elves would come back through magic portals. The world will still be as deadly and chaotic as today but Dungeon and Dragon like; progressively going to a full magic trans dimensional world until  the end of the next cycle  and come back to lame ass normal world

       If there really was a conspiracy in the works, then I believe 12-21-12 is  the wrong date. If something happens I bet it will be after the 21st... not long and we'll all know.

       The Mayan end date of 12/21/2012 is important, and I will get to what I think will happen soon, but first - the sun and galactic center line up visually every single year.  This is not the first time in 26,000 years.  It is not even a perfect alignment - just as close as it gets - and nothing is going to last or align for 11 seconds.
       <em>
        IF
       </em>
       an event happens, an alignment is not the cause.  The Maya just used this alignment as the best way to describe things in the sky at this point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Mayan myth it was very important that
       <em>
        THE WINTER SOLSTICE SUN
       </em>
       lines up with the galactic center, which means it only matters when the alignment is on December 21.  Even that happens every year from roughly 1980 to 2018.  If that alignment caused a problem on Earth, it would have happened many years ago.  There is no gravitational boost or other astronomical problem coming 12/21/2012 from what appears - only from Earth's perspective - to be an alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the world is not going to end in 2012.  BUT I do expect horrible events causing huge and terrible changes this month, bringing on TEOTWAWKI.  Watch the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       The night sky is like a giant clock and many cultures give astronomical details in their prophecies.  The Maya point us to 2012 and 2019 (mostly 2012.)  The Bible points to 1967, 2012, and 2019 - but mostly 2019, and specifically to December 21, 2019.  Since the astronomical clues in the Bible repeatedly point to December 2019, EXACTLY seven years after the Mayan end date, I must conclude that the most likely time for the seven year tribulation is 12/21/2012 to 12/21/2019.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have hundreds of pages of details for anyone interested in this astronomical analysis of Bible prophecy, the Maya, and other world mythology.

       If you're reading the Book of Revelations as anything other than political commentary on Nero's Rome, you're doing it wrong.
