It just took some rational thought and research til I realized that the people in control were only interested in their own gain. I began looking into what others thought about it and I started conversing with other people who believed the same thing and that&#39;s what sparked my interest in conspiracy theories. Many of them I don&#39;t believe but I will still look into them because I think everyone should be heard regardless of how crazy it sounds.

    <div class="md"><p>I started reading about Scientology, thinking it was a weird cult that I wanted to know more about.  That led to discovering that despite bugging the IRS, the Church of Scientology was afforded tax-exempt status as a religion.  That led to me wondering why.  That led to me discovering that L. Ron Hubbard was a member of the Ordo Templi Orientis in the 40s.  That led to realizing that Dianetics is just Aleister Crowley&#39;s Thelema repackaged with scientific names.  That led to learning that the chapter of the OTO L. Ron belonged to was headed by Jack Parsons, one of the men responsible for the formation of Jet Propulsion Labs and the creation of the rocket fuel formula used in the Apollo Space Program.  That led to Operation: Paperclip and how the US brought over tons of Nazi scientists to work on the space program under new identities.  That led to learning that the SS inner circle was referred to as the Knights of the Black Sun and were based on the same set of teachings as Aleister Crowley&#39;s Thelema (and consequently Scientology).  That led to the murals in Bank of America&#39;s headquarters proclaiming the same imagery as the Knights of the Black Sun.  That led to the murals in the Denver Airport.  That led to Deep Underground Bases.  That led to the mysteries of what is or is not under the ground in Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico.</p>

<p>And, just when I thought I&#39;d reached the end, I looked up in the sky and saw 6 chemtrail lets in the sky leaving perfect geometric shapes in the sky.  As Stanley Kubrick once tried to tell me, I feel like I spent 35 years walking around with my eyes wide shut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occupy Oakland. I experienced way too much first hand to not start questioning the dynamics between the city and federal government. There were many events that made no fucking sense. The militaristic aspects of the raids, and the strange psychology warfare that seemed too complex for oakland to have come up with (oakland does not have their shit together). Turning off the city hall clock, turning off specific lights before raids, targeted arrests (sometimes snatch and grabs) etc. Even the justification for the raids were very strange. One was a shooting at the encampment, which was in an area with a relatively low murder rate. Another was partly because of a failed health inspection where they found a gas grill under a cloth near the kitchen. I&#39;m the one who put that cloth over that grill, because <em>someone</em> locked a goddamn gas grill to the railing near the kitchen with a fucking chain and padlock. 
Even at the most recent protest the city was tracking the march and <a href="https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/261659862201683968">turning off street lights along with the marchers</a>, which was creepy as hell.
Overall most conspiracy theories seem a bit far reaching, especially in terms of NWO or Reptilians. But it is no longer a fringe conspiracy that agencies such as NSA, FBI, DHS etc use and abuse powers and technologies way beyond anything that Orwell could ever have imagined. Who the fuck needs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescreen">Telescreen</a> when everyone has a smartphone! This has been a fun tangent, thank you.</p>

<p>This information was given to me just months before Waco. I didn&#39;t believe a word of it and regarded it as the ramblings of a nutter, although a very well connected and overly armed nutter. </p>

<p>Then Waco unfolded.</p>

<p>Waco was gotten away with because of the use of the news media  to propagandize against the victims which caused a public outcry for action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Around 4:30 PM I was driving to my friend&#39;s house and when i got close to my final turn onto his street time seemed to slow down and everything got quieter(the radio mostly). Suddenly i noticed a flash out of the corner of my right eye, that&#39;s when it came into my view. For the longest 5-7 seconds of my life I stared at this vehicle in utter amazement. Picture two contact lenses stacked on top of each other with a slight bulge for a cockpit. The rear also stuck out a little bit with what looked like a circular exhaust port which emitted a warm blue color. The rest of the UFO was a mirror-like silver color. Then this thing accelerated so fast it was a black dot(continually smaller until I only saw sky) faster than I could blink. Having been skeptical of UFOs before that event, I was stunned out of my mind for at least two days. I figured this thing came within 30 feet of me so how would the government not know right? So that&#39;s how I started looking into conspiracies, but I still take everything I read with a grain of salt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it was the US Presidential election of 2000. </p>

<p>I am a Brit, but I have an MA in International Relations so I&#39;ve been closely following US politics for a long time, and I became convinced that the election was blatantly stolen by a combination of dishonest pro-Republican election officials, corrupt politicians, judges and ultimately, by partisan Supreme Court Republican nominees. And yet nobody in the US seemed to realise or care! It totally blew my mind.</p>

<p>The result of this major &quot;negative epiphany&quot; was that if the greatest fraud in global history could pass without comment, then there were no limits to what these people would try to get away with, or what they WOULD get away with, because of how gullible and acquiescent the public were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a comprehensive response, but I am afraid I absolutely disagree and I am frankly astonished you could attempt to trivialise such blatant, premeditated election fraud - overseen by the brother of the winning candidate, no less. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court should have recused itself both as individuals (for conflict) and en masse, for the OBVIOUS reason that the judiciary is not competent, according to the Constitution, to determine the will of the people in an election. </p>

<p>Either a total recount, or a new election should have been ordered, rather than SCOTUS produce the weasel judgment it did. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the even wider fraud perpertrated by Republicans in the 2004 election demonstrates the vapidity and dishonesty of your argument that 2000 was some sort of &quot;minor glitch&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>911, sort of. </p>

<p>I was on an irc channel in those days, with a guy who was into conspiracies who was always talking about 911 but I never bought it, cause I couldn&#39;t see the government doing such a thing. </p>

<p>Then a couple of years later the FBI took down a site called voxnyc but the owner had offsite servers and started posting mirrors of the site and going around to other websites and posting where it was (<a href="http://www.voxfux.com/archives/00000076.htm">voxfux</a>). It turned out that he had figured out it was a deliberate false flag attack and was posting about it and (never read this part) and encouraging someone to kill Bush because he had killed so many Americans. </p>

<p>I figured if the government didn&#39;t want me to read it, then I wanted to read it so I started reading it. </p>

<p>I came across this </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Brzezinski, the USA is such a &quot;increasingly multi-cultural society&quot; and the average people are not inclined to support any more Vietnams, the only thing that will motivate massive emotional support for foreign wars is something like &quot;the shock effect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.&quot; America will likely &quot;find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues, except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I remembered reading this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Proactive, Preemptive Operations Group, (P2OG), brings together CIA and military covert action, information warfare, intelligence, and cover and deception. Among other things, this body launches secret operations aimed at &quot;stimulating reactions&quot; among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destruction -- that is, for instance, prodding terrorist cells into action and exposing themselves to &quot;quick-response&quot; attacks by U.S. forces. 
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/1028-11.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/views02/1028-11.htm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Declassified CIA Assassination Manual: In lost assassination, the assassin must be a fanatic of some sort. Politics, religion, and revenge are about the only feasible motives. Since a fanatic is unstable psychologically, he must be handled with extreme care. He must not know the identities of the other members of the organization, for although it is intended that he die in the act, something may go wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The blocks all fell into place. I could almost hear the &quot;click, click, click&quot;. If they had been manipulating fanatics and crazies into committing assassinations since the early 50s (at least) they could manipulate them into committing hijackings. And they had an entire group to get terrorists to commit terrorist actions. And Brzezinski explained the why. (Hate him to this day.) We&#39;re used to reading the same thing in the PNAC but the plutocracy has been talking about how to start a world war for years. The wars of US and NATO have enriched a few rich people and hurt everyone else. But we don&#39;t matter. Only the wealthy matter in their world. You know what they call us, &quot;fodder units&quot;. Cause they feed off of us and they don&#39;t even consider us sentient. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cannonfire.blogspot.com/2009/05/fodder-units-jeb-bush-and-economic.html">Fodder unit</a> -- derogatory term for a serving member of the armed forces, used in the Bush family between Jeb &amp; Dubya after the term was originally coined by their father George H W Bush. </p>

<p>The Bush idea was (I remember Jeb used to say this) that, &quot;Look, you hit them in every single hat they wear.&quot; That was the idea. He used to call them fodder. You hit the fodder in their hats as Taxpayers. You hit them in their hats as Investors and Savers. You hit them in their hats as Insurance Policy Owners through all these insurance scams his brother was involved in. Then there was, of course, Jeb&#39;s International Medical Corporation. Jeb also liked health care scams. But that was the idea the Bushes had, that you take the American taxpayer (which they called &quot;One Fodder Unit,&quot; or OFU) and you hit them in every single hat they wear.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where the term came from, but &quot;One Fodder Unit&quot; became a popular term on the Republican cocktail party circuit in 1985. According to them, each individual American citizen equals One Fodder Unit. <a href="http://richmond.indymedia.org/newswire/display/1293/index.php">http://richmond.indymedia.org/newswire/display/1293/index.php</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But once you accept one conspiracy, you find it easier to accept the next one. I&#39;d always accepted the Oswald One-shooter myth of JFK&#39;s assassination. I no longer do. Once you start reading about things, well not everything is a conspiracy, but you realize some things are, and that the plutocracy is our enemy and works and plots against us and we need to wake up. </p>

<p>I watch alot of star trek and the motto of going where no one has gone before backs up my statement in a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first these nice men in suits had me take some kind of drug that gave me superpowers. I am able to walk invisibly among men and learn the secrets these nice men want to know. So far, I have established that the moon landing, JFK, 9-11 and the theft of the 2000 election are all interconnected by one thing. I am not allowed to reveal much, but lets just say Obama is an alien and leave it at that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always liked to indulge in the sensational aspects of conspiracies, but, Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast really changed my opinion of the world. Mostly because of NDAA &amp; Op. Northwoods and the absolute facts behind them.  </p>

<p>Then one day, I got on reddit and saw the James Holmes Shooting post from the person in the theater that day, and decided to tune into the police scanner, witch inevitably led me to this sub reddit. I am 100% sure that I heard/watched a conspiracy take place that day and the following months. It changed me I think.</p>

<p>In general though, I watched 9/11 unfold on the tv in my 9th grade classroom. It was suspicious to me then, and it has been a natural progression to where I am now. I feel fortunate to be &#39;awake&#39;.</p>
