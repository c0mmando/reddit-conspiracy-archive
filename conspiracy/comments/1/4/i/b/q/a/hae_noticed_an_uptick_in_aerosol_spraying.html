    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just so sickening to see the thick trails coming, then hour by hour they turn the whole fucking sky into a gray mush, I can&#39;t remember the last time I saw huge fluffy white clouds on a blue skye. </p>

<p>When I was a kid I recall looking at skies like that, contrails were so fascinating to watch as they formed. Weak, gray and dissapeared in a short time, they dissapeared fast. Because I have actually seen clear blue skies and have a memory I am able to see a clear difference. Anyone saying geoengineering is not happening are probably just in denial mode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been watching jets since the early 1950&#39;s.  The contrails look the same as then but those are not what we are complaining about. I still see contrails (on clear days) and they look like the ones seen from 1950 to 2000.  The chemical trails that linger for hours and spread across the sky are the  geoengineering of the atmosphere that are the problem.  They didn&#39;t start until around 2000.  </p>

<p>Plenty of evidence has been collected that says chemicals are falling from the sky. They didn&#39;t up there by themselves, they were put up there with airplanes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the purpose of the bill was to limit, partially or completely, the use of these types of weapons.</p>

<p>So what does that tell us? Whether or not they had actually existed at that point, Congress, in 2001, acknowledged that chemtrails were a real possibility and could be used as a weapon. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the context of the bill, being to limit/prevent the use, seems to entail that it was likely that they WERE being used, or were GOING to be used in the future.</p>

<p>All this, from over a decade ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so, what you&#39;re saying is, a congressman introduced a bill to congress detailing potential government weaponry so that he could throw &#39;conspiratards&#39; on a loop?

So what would be the logical purpose of this again? </p>
