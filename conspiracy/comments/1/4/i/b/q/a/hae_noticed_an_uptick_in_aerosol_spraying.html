       It's just so sickening to see the thick trails coming, then hour by hour they turn the whole fucking sky into a gray mush, I can't remember the last time I saw huge fluffy white clouds on a blue skye.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was a kid I recall looking at skies like that, contrails were so fascinating to watch as they formed. Weak, gray and dissapeared in a short time, they dissapeared fast. Because I have actually seen clear blue skies and have a memory I am able to see a clear difference. Anyone saying geoengineering is not happening are probably just in denial mode.

       Most people I've ever heard talking about chemtrails seem to say they first appeared from 1990-ish onwards. Given that's the case was there any change to the type of fuel used in aeroplanes around this time?

       You appear to be under 20 years old,these things first appeared in Sydney in 2003 and now we get them nearly every day,so far this spring (10 weeks of it) we have had around 5 blue skies in total,as someone who starts work at 5am I see a clear blue sky and then around 7.30am the plane sprays us and by 10am we have a greyed out sky,this never used to happen and my photo library supports this,we don't have blue skies anymore.

       I've been looking at the skies since the 1960s. Contrails look just the same as they ever did. In fact, they are smaller and disperse more quickly now because planes are less smoky and more fuel efficient. This contrail nonsense is silly. Think about what would be involved. Ridiculous.

       I've been watching jets since the early 1950's.  The contrails look the same as then but those are not what we are complaining about. I still see contrails (on clear days) and they look like the ones seen from 1950 to 2000.  The chemical trails that linger for hours and spread across the sky are the  geoengineering of the atmosphere that are the problem.  They didn't start until around 2000.

       100$ you've never done shit beyond forming your own guess to what you think you're seeing. Ever get an air sample from the "gray" mist, ever take a dirt sample from the ground and have it tested? Ever filmed a plane doing this every single day? Ever done anything? No? I thought so.  Get outta here with this BS. Everybody quit with this BS until you got at least a damn thread of evidence. A sliver of evidence for Christs sake.  If its happening every day get some god damn proof.

       Pay attention to the sky.  When half the days you see grids being put down, then you can bet it is happening in other places as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of evidence has been collected that says chemicals are falling from the sky. They didn't up there by themselves, they were put up there with airplanes.

       What in the world are they spraying?

       it's mentioned once in a catchall descriptor of what space weapons could be.  Hardly any kind of proof

       Actually the purpose of the bill was to limit, partially or completely, the use of these types of weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does that tell us? Whether or not they had actually existed at that point, Congress, in 2001, acknowledged that chemtrails were a real possibility and could be used as a weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the context of the bill, being to limit/prevent the use, seems to entail that it was likely that they WERE being used, or were GOING to be used in the future.

       All this, from over a decade ago.

       It doesn't imply that at all.  It very well could be in there to placate conspiritards, which personally why I believe it's in there.  This is far from proof and is as much proof as pointing to contrails and saying that one looks different.

       Ok so, what you're saying is, a congressman introduced a bill to congress detailing potential government weaponry so that he could throw 'conspiratards' on a loop? On a subject that really didn't become popular discussion until very recently (it's not even in discussion at all past conspiracy-centered forums), let alone a decade ago. So what would be the logical purpose of this again?

       I've been looking at the skies since the 1960s. Contrails look just the same as they ever did. In fact, they are smaller and disperse more quickly now because planes are less smoky and more fuel efficient. This contrail nonsense is silly. Think about what would be involved. Ridiculous.
