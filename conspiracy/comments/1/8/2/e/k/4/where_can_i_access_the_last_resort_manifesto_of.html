<p>The link for the alleged 11,000 word manifesto is bunk and I&#39;ve heard reports it was &quot;taken down&quot; from the Internet - as if that were actually possible.</p>

<p>So, anyone have a link?  I&#39;m very curious as to this person&#39;s allegations against the LAPD.</p>

<p>You disrespect the office of the POTUS/Presidency and Commander in Chief. You call him Kenyan, mongroid, halfrican, muslim, and FBHO when in essence you are to address him as simply, President. The same as you did to President George W. Bush and all those in the highest ranking position of our land before him. Just as I always have. You question his birth certificate, his educational and professional accomplishments, and his judeo-christian beliefs. You make disparaging remarks about his dead parents. You never questioned the fact that his former opponent, the honorable Senator John McCain, was not born in the CONUS or that Bush had a C average in his undergrad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So throwing in Anderson Cooper proves it&#39;s real somehow, because CNN would NEVER just lie to the public for ratings or to promote an agenda (one that Anderson Cooper ostensibly supports at that) would they? I&#39;m not even going to say any of these various versions are all true or not, because I have no way of knowing for certain. I do, however, have this thing called common sense that I can use to ascertain the invalidity of the idea that a vigilante using guns to exact revenge, who would be in essence a &#39;domestic terrorist&#39;, would promote banning the very instrument he&#39;s using to exact said justice.</p>

<p>I assure you that the casualty rate will be high. Because of that, no one will remember your name. You will merely be a DR# and &quot;that guy&quot; who was KIA/EOW or long term IOD/light duty in the kit room. This is exactly why &quot;station 500&quot; was created. Unfortunately, orphanages will be making a comeback in the 21st century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s talking about making orphans out of the children who&#39;s parents he will kill. According to that logic, he wouldn&#39;t have to kill them if there&#39;s an assault weapon ban. Come on, man. He&#39;s going after them because they&#39;re corrupt and have ruined his good name, which has nothing whatsoever to do with assault weapons.</p>

<p>The guy is going on a rant. Explain the message to his former highschool principal, what did that have to do with LAPD?</p>

<p>It looks to me like this wasn&#39;t just an LAPD hate on, this is a culmination of perceived slights adding up over time, a good old fashioned slow boil.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if any of his manifesto is real or not to be sure, but it sure looks like you&#39;re the one with the gun agenda.</p>
