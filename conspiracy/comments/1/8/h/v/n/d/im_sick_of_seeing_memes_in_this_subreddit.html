       What's with recent trend of memes being posted here lately?  I thought we all wanted this sub to be credible, deep, and free of shills and crap.  There's a whole other sub for conspiracy memes, so post them there, no matter how 'funny' you think it is.  I'm subbed here because I want to discover meaningful news, and I don't want this subreddit to slowly turn from something cool to something lame like all the shallow crap you see on the reddit front page.  Posting all these stupid memes just devalues the quality of conspiracy.

       Maybe we should make a tab for memes instead of banning them. also, maybe we could program a button for people to turn off posts that are memes, We should be working to find ways to incorporate them but not dominate the subreddit.

       Ill remove them if you guys are really feeling this strong about them. I really was not bothered by them, so long as the content of the meme was germane to the /r/...

       It could be a good thing though, to have "conspiracy" content in easily palatable macro image format that gains a lot of upvotes quickly, unlike the same content in the form of an article that gets 30 upvotes and no exposure. I think the subbers should be consistent in all posts to try and be relevant and on point.

       First of all, no 2 part sentence laid over a pic will have the same content as even a short article.  Second, for many people it will just make the content and those who promulgate it seem immature and without real information.  Lastly, if you want that rule gone, lobby the mods for it, but Reddit is only as usable as it is because people largely follow the rules.  I like that rule.

       By this logic American idol is the highest form of entertainment because well the majority likes it. It's called appealing to the lowest common denominator, it's why tv news is written and presented at a level a sixth grader can grasp.

       So we need mods to tell us what entertainment is? Some of the memes are really good well others are not. Not all the memes make it to the top. I use a lot of them on facebook and get responses back that I can lead people to more truth. Sometimes all you need is a little saying or picture to provoke some people to think. It doesn't hurt. I don't like anybody censoring anything. I'll be the judge. I thought that's what reddit was about anyhow.

       Personally, i think memes are an easy way to connect with the younger generation who have problems understanding complex issues in regards to topics such as international financial scandals, world governments, MSM, laws etc etc.  Example; just today, this one must have hit home with someone and brought to light some things the MSM might have not ran with
       <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3szc6b/">
        http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3szc6b/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because everyone on this board isnt 16-35, doesnt mean memes are not valuable to this community.  My 2 cents, r/Conspiracy is doing good with its subscribers, things have picked up around here in regards to content (and spam content), but it still needs way more members.  What are 1-2 memes going to hurt every once in a while, its not like they are constantly voted to top every day on r/conspiracy.

       Look at the atheism sub and think to yourself if anyone would want to be an atheist just from looking at the posts.  Then look at the science sub and see how much you can learn from just the first few posts.  Maybe the 'younger generation' is having problems with learning because we keep coddling them?  I'm part of the younger generation and I don't 'connect' with memes, I just find them annoying and insipid.  Memes aren't some new fangled way to try and 'communicate' with young people, they appeal to the lowest common denominator.  Information is information.

       Well, to be fair, most of the submissions on r/atheism in the past 6-9 months have turned into picture posts with 1-2 line references from popular atheists ;) and science is hard to explain under 20 words and 1 picture. Also with this graphic just released yesterday, it suggests 23%!!!!! of Americans are illiterate!
       <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/infographics/Illiterate-America-800.png">
        Here is that in a nice chart
       </a>
       So as we can deduct, yes it is hard for people to understand complex issues, so using small, short and precise images/memes might help with a quicker understanding and shed light on certain subjects
       <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3szc6b/">
        Once again this dorner meme from r/AdviceAnimals yesterday had over 2900 upvotes
       </a>
       .  Now, should the question become, is it logical that person will spend the time to dig deeper into a problem after seeing a meme?  Also, is this sub here to make people learn, is it here to inform, is it here to entertain?  As far as we should be concerned, it should be here to open doors and open minds, give people a chance to ask questions, give people a chance to see a different perspective, and should be up to the members of this sub to help push forward the proper links and articles and images that will show why a certain idea or thought has been proposed and debate a reasonable conclusion to a theory. These are theories, and they have to be treated as such.

       That would be true if posts always rose on merit. But if you spend any time in this sub, you notice that there exists a group of people that game the system to push their counter agenda. They already spam the sub with garbage, memes would just increase the signal to noise ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally I'm against fracturing a sub, but
       <a href="/r/conspiracymemes">
        /r/conspiracymemes
       </a>
       exists specifically because
       <em>
        conspiracy memes don't belong here
       </em>
       . That's why they're against the rules.

       You are on the wrong side of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit is more about evaluating the current trends in conspiracy thinking and sorting relevant news.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you expect meaningful information learn how to gather and build your own world view. Any conspiracy site should be considered compromised by default.
      </p>
      <p>
       The secret is to go through all the lies until you find the small truths hidden in the lies and carefully piece them together.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you expect to find theories with lots of proofs,evidence that will absolutely convince you. You will be disappointed...

       I'm not just going to evaluate, gather, and piece together.  I want to take what I know and become an active partcipant and try to do something to make the community better.  What's the point of having all this information if I'm just going to be quiet and docile and have nothing change.  If anything, I will find nothing in memes.

       Without knowledge your opinion is meaningless,just like the opinion of the majority of this reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lets not mix words here,that's why you are here and that's what you want,your opinion. You aren't organizing any protest,you aren't preparing you supplies for the worst and by your admission you are not here to gather,not here to evaluate and not here to piece together.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is your opinion different from a meme? at least with a meme you can sometimes have a perspective,a symbol, something you can relate too and inspire.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in general its not that different.

       Yes, I'm stating my opinion.  How obvious.  Is there a problem?  I didn't suggest I'm going to start some mass revolt.  Others agree with my opinion, and now a mod--and maybe other users on this sub--will give a little more effort in reducing the amount of memes.  I'd say that's a meaningful amount of change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I said "I'm not just going to evaluate..."  The key word is JUST, meaning I'm going to do more than that, not that I'm going to do none of it.

       Ok, we all hate memes. But what's annoyed me the last week are multiple posts with the same information from different news outlets in regards to Dorner. It seems like everyone was trying to get on the karma bandwagon and see who could post the most interesting article about Dorner first.

       First of all, not everyone that comes in and posts a conspiracy related meme is a regular contributor to this subreddit. So, to say "I thought WE all wanted this sub to be credible" is to imply that the regulars are the ones solely responsible for whatever it is that is offending you. People wander into different subreddits all the time and post irrelevant material. This is the internet. These things happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, your post actually does nothing to help the situation and has as much to do with the conspiracy sub as the memes themselves. By attempting to fix the problem, you have contributed to it.

       I don't have a problem with cool images, but obvious two sentence and a picture memes just trivalizes its topic.  It has no content or meaning and probably doesn't even make sense to anyone who doesn't already know about it.

       This is bullshit, memes are often the most effective way to reach the mainstream public and we should embrace them and let them flourish here. The subreddit is a joke and I believe that efforts to speak out against them are deliberate and come from the sock puppets.

       Not all meme are equal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally see meme as an Orwellian erosion of herd attention span and independence.  The current trend of meme is dominated by puns and poor grammar. I don't think incomplete sentences are the optimal strategy to spread awareness of anything except the awareness that we are being lead by a bunch of know-it-all kids who have strong beliefs on the subject and access to photoshop.
