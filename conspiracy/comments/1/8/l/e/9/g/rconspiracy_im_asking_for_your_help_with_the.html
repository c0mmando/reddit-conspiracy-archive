        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys. So I have been really dissatisfied with the media coverage of the follow-up investigation to the whole Chris Dorner event, and I really think that if the mainstream media refuses to provide us with the information we need to determine just <em>what</em> happened up at Big Bear, we need to discover it for ourselves. I have been wracking my brain, trying to think of ways that we can actually <em>do</em> something about this, rather than sit here passively and wait to be spoon fed information. Alas, I couldn&#39;t come up with much. However, I do have one lead that I am asking everyone on this subreddit, and anyone who is willing to help us, to chase down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.co.san-bernardino.ca.us/sheriff/coroner/PressRelease.asp">http://www.co.san-bernardino.ca.us/sheriff/coroner/PressRelease.asp</a>
This is a link to the website of the San Bernardino County Coroner and Sheriff, who has made a few different mainstream media appearances throughout the length of this case. Now, this link will take you directly to the &quot;press releases&quot; section of the website, where you will notice that at the top of the page it says &quot;Updated February 15th&quot;. Note that this is, in fact, today. Despite the fact that the San Bernadino County Sheriff&#39;s department has had ample time to release a press release for the autopsy of Christopher Dorner&#39;s body, the information has NOT been made publicly available. I think we can change that.</p>

<p>I urge everyone to create fake e-mail addresses (or use your personal if you are a brave soul) and e-mail the San Bernadino County Coroner and Sheriff, asking why they have not released a statement about Christopher Dorner&#39;s autopsy. Call the station if you are even braver.</p>

<p>Or, don&#39;t do any of these things. But let&#39;s do <em>something</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my hollywood fanfic version in an alternate universe.</p>

<p>Dorner tries to blow the whistle (to the media and the police) - it looks really bad, he has hard evidence that would shatter the image of the police in LA.   They&#39;ve been singing Nazi songs and the force is rife with evil.</p>

<p>The threat is too big, so TPTB order that Dorner is removed.   A cover story is arranged.  A facebook page is created.  Photos are uploaded.   A portion of the original whistleblower letter has been leaked, so this is turned into a dramatic manfiesto - to supplant and minimize the original whistle blowing.   A package is made for display on the news to confirm it.   </p>

<p>Several versions of the manifesto make their rounds, which starts argument over which is real, and helps the idea that one of them is real, rather than both being faked up.</p>

<p>Only a few people know that Dorner is dead, and the police are led to believe there&#39;s a killer on the loose after them and their families.</p>

<p>In order to convince people that this guy is on the loose and dangerous, those in on the plan kill two would-be revenge victims and some random officers.  This is a vital part of the plan to convince the public, as is the shooting up of the truck.  This makes the police look like madmen, and it would be crazy to mess with a volatile force as that.</p>

<p>Meanwhile cover stories are planted and actors brought in.  A boat owner claims to have been almost robbed, but the man has trouble stealing the boat.   He&#39;s bought SCUBA gear, and thrown away some ammo and lost some ID here and there, all on low res video.</p>

<p>Dorner and his truck are driven up to Big Bear and burned out.  Dorner&#39;s body is stashed in a Cabin, to be covered up later. </p>

<p>The now cool, burned out truck is not found until long enough after to make it appear like Dorner is on the loose.  A full scale &#39;real world&#39; exercise begins, use of Drones and other tactics are practiced.</p>

<p>For the finale, a car is crashed, 911 calls made, and there come reports (first that two housekeepers) of hostages and that Dorner is pinned in the Cabin where his dead body actually lays.  </p>

<p>The plan is to burn the place to the ground and hide the evidence, while scapegoating Dorner and the problem is solved.   The hostages (actors that were used in the Sandy Hoax production) are presented to the TV viewers, and give a shaky recollection of what they are told to say happened.   </p>

<p>Most everyone believes it, and instead of questioning what Dorner did, the police only now have to defend burning someone alive.  Much easier than the alternative!  Plus, a good crisis is a terrible thing to waste.</p>

<p>Thankfully, none of this could be possibly true, and there&#39;s no point telling anyone even if it is.  I thought it would entertain you.</p>

<p>Really? Think about it. Reusing actors? Even LAPD isn&#39;t that dumb.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lie big.  Nobody would expect it.  Besides, how many of these actors do you think they have?  They would have used her and him in more than one scenario .. do they just dispose of actors when they are done?   Actors play more than one role as a rule.</p>

<p>Karen Reynolds and Vernoique Pozner have the exact same mole on the front of their neck in the same place.   they sound the same age, and the woman playing Karen sounds not so old as she looks.  Watch carefully.</p>

<p>I live in a small town and sit on a city council.  We had an arson which resulted in a criminal death (arsonist) and the autopsy and investigation took a long time.</p>

<p>You have the regular investigation pieces and then you need the fire investigator and also an autopsy which takes some time as well.</p>

<p>No coroner will release their report until they are 100% certain they have it done correctly, especially if it&#39;s high profile because that record will most certainly be reviewed by a huge group of people.</p>
