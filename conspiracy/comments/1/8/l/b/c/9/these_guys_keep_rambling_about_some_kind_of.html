       Well if you are not getting paid to attack people you don't even know then that just makes you psychotic, I'm calling my friends at the company and telling them to keep an eye on you, because you sir, are a potential terrorist.

       because many conspiracy theories confirm their mistrust in the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, it's kinda sad really, because it's not like that's based off of a reasonable analysis of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's pretty clear that there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       elements in the gov't that would do such bad things, but it's not a monolithic entity. In fact it's fairly vast and diverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, it's our lack of effective participation in gov't that would allow something like a 9/11 inside job to happen. It's certainly what allowed the financial crisis to happen. If people are too stupid to understand what a derivative is they sure as hell aren't going to demand that their representatives effectively regulate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The complete acceptance of the military industrial complex, and the covert actions it has taken since the end of WW2, by the citizenry is what created the environment where there is absolutely no accountability for what the CIA does.

       Seriously,  it is hard to Remember the lie when you are actually looking at a missile in a footage. It is a natural slip. In the cases where the administration has slipped up on their story, I realize that debunkers are not in search of truth but just debunking. There is a lot of speculation out about certain aspects of 911, and some of them are undeniable as the Administration themselves have been helpful in telling us  the truth. Was flight 93 shot down ? Yes, Cheney himself said so ! Next..

      </p>
      <p>
       How did demolition teams wire both towers without  anyone noticing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, wouldn't that take huge amounts of man power? Are you saying that not a single one of those guys has come forward?

       Great question and I don't have a solid answer. It could be that they were silenced? I've seen interviews of people claiming they heard and felt explosions coming from the basement of the towers yet they received very minimal news coverage. The "Pancake Theory" has been argued about and scientists claim that the support beams in the middle of the tower would've prevented the towers from collapsing completely and were designed to withstand pancaking unless they were cut like in a controlled demolition. Multiple people inside the lower floors of the towers and people outside the tower claimed they saw explosions inside of the building prior to collapse. This video can probably explain some of the theories better than I can

       I know there were a bunch of Israel students that lived in the twin towers for a period of time prior to 9/11, and they were undetected.  I would link to the NTY's article, but I suck at linking on my phone. As for anyone coming forward, if you planted explosive in a building and knew what you were in for, why would you come forward?

       You can google "WTC power down" and Susan Lindauer recounts being informed of white vans entering for about 3 weeks before September. Also, Marsch and McClennen, the offices that were directly hit in WTC 1 had been totally rewired for security upgrades shortly before along with the company in WTC 2 (can't remember right now). People tend to think between the power downs and "security upgrades," teams were able to wire the cutters and install a "beacon" of sorts as the shitty Cessna pilots would not have been able to hit their targets with such success. Richard Andrew Grove has a lot of great info on the financial gains and motives and worked in the WTC. He's great for this sort of detail.

       Memory is kinda vague now, but the weekend before the attacks, both towers were shut down for maintenance, and crews were going through both towers like all day long. I'm sorry I can't give you solid details, but I'm sure if you look this up you'll find what I'm referring to.

       . There's also a video I watched a few years back which is really difficult to find, and is always being taken down... but it's with a Russian guy who saw and has the original documents from when the towers went up. He shows that they were originally wired with mini-nukes in the case they ever needed to be demolished. He also says this is standard for any high rise. In case they ever need to be taken down... they're wired from day one.

       Very good question. This is also mentioned in the interviews (I'll try to find the videos), and, this was news to me, they didn't leave behind radiation. Nuclear bombs have come a long way over the years, and don't necessarily have to be as dirty as they used to be. I know that sounds retarded... so give me some time and I'll try to find the source for you, and anyone else interested. I'm not comfortable making such claims without being able to show you where I got my information.

       I am well aware that bombs are MUCH cleaner than they were during the Cold War and previously, but still, NO BOMB ON THE PLANET will use 100% of it's nuclear fuel, that is basically impossible.

       If there was no radiation detected, there was no nuclear explosion. Simple as that.

       I can't really offer any further explanation. I watched that video several years ago, and don't have the time right now to watch it again to further explain my previous response. The best I can say is to watch it yourself. This is brought up, and he explains it all quite a bit.

       I kind of agree. I don't doubt there was a plane, because TONS of people saw it. But the plane isn't what hit the Pentagon. There's a documentary out there,
       <a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/national-security-alert/">
        National Security Alert
       </a>
       that interviews several reputable people who also saw the plane. But they all agree, independently, that is was not on the flight path stated by the official story. Most intriguing is the cab driver at the end. The one who had the light pole go through his windshield. But his story directly contradicts photographic proof... and when he thinks he's off camera says some very interesting things. He is definitely one who was paid to shut up, and he tells the documentary makers that they're going up against something much bigger than themselves, and they should back off. Pretty interesting watch. Some of the witnesses even say they saw a plane flying past the Pentagon after the explosion. So... in my opinion, the plane everyone saw is what delivered the missle, and after the explosion, everyone's attention was there, not on the plane escaping. Though... I'm honestly not that sure of all the details. I'm simply convinced, at the least, that a plane did not hit the Pentagon.

       Don't know why i've not seen more people mention the shooting down of flight 93 before. Maybe i've not been looking hard enough. It would most certainly explain why the debris was apparently spread out over such a large area.

       That's likely what the 9/11 Commissioner was meaning. The term 'missile' doesn't just apply to the weapons. Technically if you throw a rock, it's a missile.

       The others certainly make a good point. The Rumsfeld interview where he says "American Airlines flight" and then "missile" like they're two different things, now that's worth mentioning.

       He got down voted because he's a troll (or just an asshole...really hard to tell who's legitamitely trying to stifle discussuion and who's just an obnoxious dickhead enabled by the former) and his post isn't needed here. Anyone that starts their post off insulting the entire subreddit as if we all think the same shit deserves to be down voted. Look at his username. Hes obviously mocking the subreddit. This is the only sub that people come to to personally attack the sub and its users on a regular basis. And there are a lot more dangerous and crazy people to be made fun of on reddit

       Again, this is why people laugh at you for finding a single quote ANYWHERE you can and using it like it's evidence for your bullshit.

       In 2001 David Cameron was a brand new MP in the conservative party, being passed over for promotion to the front bench. A nobody, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you suggesting he was in on it? Are you suggesting when he was elected prime minister 9 years later he was told 9/11 was an inside job? Are you suggesting David Cameron is a conspiracy theorist who believes the towers were blown up?

       Under the lawn of the Pentagon is plenty of forensic evidence.

      <p>
       Also here is proof of something much hotter than kerosene, paper wood and upholstery heating the debris of the towers.  Take a look at the completely melted car for instance. No matter how much trash and kerosene you burn in a car you cannot melt it to this degree.

       Your first reply on that thread you linked, mainly consists of quotes from "Peter Tully, president of Tully Construction of Flushing" and "Loizeaux" and after reading everything they have to say, they don't even agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peter Tully says the molten steel came from the jet fuel, and Loizeaux says it came from combustibles packed down the elevator shafts by the tower floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second post doesn't even provide any evidence to dispute this, lots 'experts dispute this' but apparantly don't want to leave their name, then it's just quotes from  single investigators whose findings don't have the backing of any of their respective unions and nobody else in their field agrees with them.

       Neither of which is possible. the molten metal is the subject and whether it existed these witnesses say it did and they are, as you point out at odds with the premise because they are paid to be.

       Hahaha your solid evidence is coming from a post on a website called 'uscrusade.com' it's writer hasn't bothered to leave their name, and 30% of the article is in bright pink and has no sources...
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in their own summary they say "Now this temperature is nowhere near high enough to even begin explaining the World Trade Center Tower collapse."
      </p>
      <p>
       The NIST never said burning jet fuel was the cause of the collapse. Only that it was a factor. Your solid evidence, is arguing against a point that isn't even being made.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is photographic evidence of floor sagging, if the fire has had no effect on the building at all, why do we have evidence of floor sagging?

       Cite please I haven't seen that, only fallacious drawings by NIST.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site with the science of the temperature inside the building  is a mirror the original has expired after many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT One does not need to provide sources for doing calculations in math.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit 2 the fact of the lack of sufficient heat to affect the steel in the towers is attested to by the presence Fire Chief Orio Palmer who along with another fireman talked on the radio for several minutes from the78th floor for several minutes without cooking, and by the fact that Edna Centron also was seen holding directly onto the steel for several minutes without apparently being burned by the metal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those three humans not being cooked by temperatures exceeding even 200 degrees plus the mathematical calculations of the highest heat possible  would convince even the hardest HONEST critic that something is amiss about the claim that NIST certainly did make that the steel was weakened by excessive heat from the jet fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have tried to have it both ways just by assertion. That the CEO'S of Controlled Demolition Inc. and Tully were not on my side so somehow that made them less credible in saying that the molten metal existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have judged  at this point that you are without a doubt not an honest skeptic but come on back at me if you must. Ignore all facts and postulate ad hominem and 'laughter'  as your own facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe instead of me endlessly defending my position as you want to try to do,  how about you miraculously come up with a reasonable defense of the official conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       This conspiracy right here.

       Photographic evidence of floor sagging, the way in which the towers then collapse is in conjuction with that theory.

       Why aren't you people big supporters of campaign finance reform then? Everybody with a tiny bit of understanding about politics knows it's run by big money interests. The only way to sort US politics is to reform the financing of politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of lots of threads about how politicians are working on behalf of big business, you get endless threads about government shooting children to take away guns, black guys who may or may not exist being set up by government to use drones on citizens, vaccines being designed to kill us all etc

       All of this good energy which could  be focused at the REAL issues, are instead focused into bat shit crazy stuff

        Are you suggesting when he was elected prime minister 9 years later he was told 9/11 was an inside job?

       Sure. Why wouldn't a world leader be informed? Obama certainly knows of secret things that went on before he was President.
