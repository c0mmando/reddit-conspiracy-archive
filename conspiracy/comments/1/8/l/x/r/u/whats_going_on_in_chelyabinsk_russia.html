       So someone tried to post a video earlier explaining a little about the town of Chelyabinsk and its history of pollution. Within moments the videos were deleted from You Tube.
      </p>
      <p>
       This prompted me to do a little investigating, what I found was weird to say the least. Chelyabinsk has a long history of government nuclear testing, environmental disasters and even its fair share of UFO sightings. The nuclear disaster are considered by some to be worse than Chernobyl.
      </p>
      <p>
       I put together a small article highlighting some of the information but I'm sure there is a lot more to this place.

       While I try not to use Wikipedia all the time I'm not sure why people hate on it so much. I know people can edit it so you can't take everything there as 100% fact but like any source you have to take it with a grain of salt and determine for yourself if what your reading is true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm new to the whole news/blog thing so I'm still learning. I do agree less wiki is always better but it does contain a wealth of information that most people know nothing about.

       I agree - usually the thing to do when linking to Wiki is to check the sources at the end of that Wiki's article.

       Then again, by that point you might as well link and quote the sources...

       thanks, some good info there.  I would remove the link to the sound heard around the world though, it has been proven to be a hoax.  Same audio used in every one of those vids.

       That place is definitely a military hotspot for Russia I would agree.

       It was mentioned in the article that I didn't necessarily agree with the UFO and sound stuff but only put it in as a footnote in the long list of weird stuff going on there. I did a quick search for "proof" of it being a hoax but didn't come up with any thing. Got a link?

       Thanks for posting, lots circling around that town.  Personally, I find it interesting that this meteorite, said to be the size of a bus, was not monitored like the meteor that recently passed (size of a football field). Also very interesting that this meteorite had an impact similar to a nuclear explosion. It was also said to be shot by Russian patriot defense system, and this is all 1.5 days after Putin urges N. Korea to give up nuclear program.  I know it's a reach that N. Korea could have set off a nuke but, it all sort of fits together nicely, like all conspiracy theories do.

       So you think we can monitor all meteor activity? This was said to be a "table" sized rock hurtling faster than a rocket can intercept it. I think that Russian missile thing was bs, all videos of it shows only its tail and nothing intercepting. See an explosion, besides itself?
      </p>
      <p>
       The impact was also not a nuclear explosion. Did you even look at the pics? The damage it caused was from its sound wave, shit 33000 mph or km will do that.

       Sometimes it may be a good thing to do if it was still high up, as it would be burning up as you see this one did all the way down. The smaller it is the more of it that won't cause damage, so if you could split a really big rock up into much smaller rocks then the less potential damage it will create, though that could also lead to more damage since it may create a larger field of destruction.

       The damage from any explosion, nuclear or not, is from the "sound wave," which is usually called the shock wave.  There is also heat, and the residue (whether chemical or nuclear) -- but there is no difference between the shock wave of a nuclear bomb and the shock wave of some other explosion releasing the same power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The meteor did not "impact" and instead it exploded in mid air, with a power that is comparable to small nuclear weapons, but is not itself a nuclear weapon.

       Dude...  If a meteor had struck that building, and it also had enough force to damage such a wide area of geography, we would not be looking at the damaged walls of the building.  We would be looking at a crater, and no building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the building looks like a big round thing hit it.  Don't be silly and think that the meteor hit it.  The shock wave hit it and made a funny-looking damage pattern that coincidentally looks like a round thing took a chunk out of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had looked at the pictures before you asked, btw.  My thought is I don't understand how you could look at this picture and think what you thought.  It's just not possible for an impact to damage such a wide area, strike something in the middle of it, and not vaporize (literally: turn in to vapor) the thing that it hits.

       Yeah I don't think anything out of the ordinary really happened with this meteor itself (NK nuclear strike, russia shooting it out of the sky etc.) but the town of Chelyabinsk, Russia might need a little looking into. I might be too young but I never even heard of this place or the stuff that went down there. How many other places like this are there?

       Zinc is commonly found with other base metal like copper and lead, i'm not sure if it's normally found with uranium but it could be. I looked into it and Zn64 is the most abundant isotope of zinc which is then transmuted into Zn65 a highly radioactive isotope. Zn65 is used as a salting agent in nuclear weapons to increase the fallout capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it makes sense to have a "Zinc" factory in a town like this.
