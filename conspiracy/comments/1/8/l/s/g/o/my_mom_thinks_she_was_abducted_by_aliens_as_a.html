        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, I&#39;m posting with a throwaway because I know people who use Reddit and occasionally check my post history and there are certain things that I do not want other people to know that are a part of this story (such as my mother being raped when she was young). I hope you understand. </p>

<p>My mom just shared this story with me, and I thought you guys would find it interesting. </p>

<p>When she was about 11 or 12 years old, she was laying on her friend&#39;s roof with her friend, whom we will call Lisa for the sake of this story. They were staring up at the stars, when all of a sudden, the sky lights up white. Then it returned to darkness, and they saw many &quot;streaks&quot; in the sky, like a meteor shower, but the streaks didn&#39;t hit the ground. Instead, they stopped at a certain point, and then flew straight up. </p>

<p>They both were like &quot;Did you see that!? It must have been aliens!&quot; and Lisa says to my mom &quot;Do you think maybe they took us?&quot;, but my mom figures that they couldn&#39;t have since they&#39;ve been laying there the whole time. </p>

<p>Well, not long after that, Lisa begins acting &quot;strange&quot;. My mom couldn&#39;t really elaborate on it, but the best way she could describe it was &quot;strange&quot;. One day, she comes up to my mom and says &quot;They told me that my mom is gonna die in (year).&quot; My mom asks &quot;Who told you that?&quot; and she replies &quot;Those people who took us.&quot; </p>

<p>My mom says to her &quot;But I thought you said you didn&#39;t remember ever going to any space ship or anything like that.&quot; and Lisa replies &quot;I don&#39;t. They came and took me again. I kinda remember the second time.&quot; </p>

<p>My mom thinks Lisa is kind of crazy at this point. Not long after that, Lisa comes to her again and tells her &quot;They told me that I&#39;ll never have a child, and that you&#39;ll have one but you&#39;ll have to fight a battle with your body in order to have it.&quot; </p>

<p>Of course, my mom still thinks Lisa is crazy. Soon after that, my mom, grandma and uncle all move away from where Lisa lives. Fast forward to when my mom is 14. She goes to a party and ends up getting raped. She doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for her to have gotten pregnant for whatever reason (poor sex-ed of the time, I suppose), so she completely hides the fact that it ever happened.  </p>

<p>Fast forward a few months, and my mom ends up having a miscarriage. Luckily (I guess?) her friend had an adult sister who helped her hide the entire incident because she knew that her family would kill her if they ever found out she was pregnant. </p>

<p>Time goes by, to when my mom was 16. She went back to where she used to live to visit family (my grandpa who had divorced my grandma) and ran into Lisa again. She described Lisa as being much less strange than before, but she still insisted that they had been abducted by aliens. Oh, and guess what? Lisa&#39;s mom died, in the exact year the aliens apparently predicted. </p>

<p>Mom returns home, and time goes by, to when she is 21 years old. Mom gets pregnant by her boyfriend, but it turns out that she has Endometriosis and it could kill her to have the child. She wants to have the child, but her health becomes severe and she is forced to abort it. It looks as though the alien&#39;s supposed prediction about her is beginning to come true. Somewhat unrelated, her boyfriend got suicided (aka managed to commit suicide by shooting himself in the back of the head while handcuffed and in police custody) by the police. </p>

<p>Then, when she was 25 years old, she became pregnant again. She desperately wanted to have a child this time and swore that she would go through the painful and potentially deadly pregnancy even if it killed her in the end. 9 months later, I was born, and she was forced to have a Hysterectomy. So it truly did come true, she would have ONE child after an intense battle with her own body. She would never be able to have another. </p>

<p>So what happened to Lisa? Well, a few years after I was born, she made contact with Lisa again. You know what she found out? Lisa was infertile, she would never be able to have children. That prediction also came true. Lisa claims she hasn&#39;t been visited by the aliens since she was a child, but also admits that she may simply not remember it, as she barely remembers the times she believes she was abducted. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s one more oddity to this story. My mother claims that she has a recurring nightmare, that she&#39;s had since around the time when she may have been abducted. She is laying on a flat bed or table in a completely white room. On the walls are doors that reminded her of bathroom stall doors. They&#39;re semi-transparent, so she can see 3 figures inside each door. They &quot;look kinda human, but not human&quot; (aka humanoid, a typical alien description) but she can&#39;t see their faces, only a vague outline of their bodies. She never hears any voices or sounds or is probed or anything like that, she is just stared at by these figures while unable to move on this bed/table. </p>

<p>And... that&#39;s pretty much it. </p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: My mother and her friend are potentially abducted by aliens as children. The aliens tell her friend the future and it comes true.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I will start off by saying I will pretend to believe this story is 100% Legit,</p>

<p>now my question is why,</p>

<p>why bother telling her the future, just as a joke or maybe to recur that memory that the aliens you met were not just dreams?</p>

<p>Why they take her, why would they even bother doing anything if they are just going to let them go, I just don&#39;t get it. Just doesn&#39;t make sense to me from their perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You pose some good questions sir, but what the f*** do we know? It&#39;s very likely that our human minds wouldn&#39;t be able to comprehend the reasoning behind extra-terrestrial actions. Who knows, they may not be coded to express violence, or emotions, religion, greed, etc. The essential ingredients of war and destruction. Our thoughts, feelings, visions or perceptions of reality and the universe we live in are most likely on a completely different plane of existence than beings from another realm of this cosmic clusterf**** we reside in. i guess that&#39;s why they call this the unexplained :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unrelated but I had a strange dream last night.  One in which I kept waking in the dream and going through locations in my life ended up fighting nazis but body always being dissected upright and walking to pieces.  I remember in the dream the lucidity enough to think i was being possessed by a ghost from 2nd world war which is why i kept slowly dying - about 6 separate times or more.</p>

<p>Lucidity is / dreams are...weird</p>

<p>If we were visited by the no shows (aliens) it would only be because in about 20 years or so we will have the technology to create machine intelligence a billion times + the combined intelligence of all humans alive now.   Not an insignificant matter on a galactic scale surely?
One soon to be followed by a trillion times itself and so on and so on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s strange aliens haven&#39;t turned up as they must exist somewhere but....?</p>
