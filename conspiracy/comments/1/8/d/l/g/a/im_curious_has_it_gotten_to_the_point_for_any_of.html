       I just want to get an idea where everyone is at with this? It seems if one did pull out altogether then they would suffer a huge credit score dive and prevent them from making large purchases such as car or home or major appliance unless paying cash upfront?!?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just looking for a friendly discussion, no need to upvote or downvote, I just want to hear what others are considering or have already done.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPDATE: thank you all so much for the all respectful and helpful suggestions and experiences! For once an actual discussion on reddit that didnt result in everyone hating on the other. Keep it coming! I love the insight

       It would appear I live check to check. It's best not to have anything the government can garnish. Of course, if you decide to keep your assets outside of a bank, you absolutely need to invest in a safe. Quality safe's are not cheap, $3K &amp; up,  so for most people a Federal Credit Union is a wiser choice.

       Jesus, 3k for a safe!!! That seems massive! After that you don't have anything left to put in it! Lol I kid but I understand what you mean. My concern is, you have someone professionally drop a safe in your closet and then they are the ones who break in later and take the safe lol. Paranoia, it's a bitch

       You should try shopping for one, it's pretty interesting. Once you get out of the more "mainstream" mass produced models you'll find an industry that is much like watch makers and the like. They are very inclusive, very private, and few in number, which makes the likely hood of collusion with a bad element rare. Their business isn't a volume based model, so even the suspicion of criminal activity on their part would ruin them. There is also the aspect of warehousing these things for sale. These people can't just pack up and move in the middle of the night to new pastures and start all over again. Paranoia is a bitch, though. I'd suggest reading

       I did for a while when I was paying off my debt. I did the debt snowball thing and did my groceries and walking around money in cash. There was something about looking in my wallet and maybe seeing a hundred dollars in cash and knowing it had to last a week that helped me control my spending. I really should go back to that. Though it wouldn't do a lot of good since the only groceries near me are krogers and they charge you about ten to thirty percent more if you won't let them track you. I wonder if the government pays them?

       It is shit but they make you use a card you have registered for so everything you buy is tracked. Even if you use cash. If you refuse to let them track you they charge you extra for everything you buy. Avoided krogers as a result till the last nonkroger grocery sold out to them. How much extra they charge you varies. I was looking at some olive oil that they wanted an extra $3 for if you didn't use a tracking card.  Kroger is evil.

       I've been using an old ID number my parent's registered for themselves probably 10-15 years ago. The only information even on the card that is still accurate would be their names not that you can't instantly track everything else down by that. Moral of the story, my parents act as my Kroger's tracking shills and have for around a decade.

       The way this works is they give you a discount if you do let them swipe your store issued identifying card. Perhaps it seems a little more friendly that way, but in effect it's the same.

       Off the top of my head all the grocery stores I know of in my area do this.

       Yeah I really did seem forced. I mean I was already doing direct deposit for years but to think paper checks were a thing of the past.'its just crazy. Yet they still send us a statement that looks just like the check except silt says [this is not a check] across.

       I left Bank of America for a local bank.  The local one is a pain in-terms of going out of town, but ATMs work just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I did close my account, they asked me why.  I replied "Because you are on loan to the Federal Reserve for 75 trillion dollars over the next 10 years?... my lowly amount of cash can't possibly help your slow implosion".  They had 2 guards immediately at the doors  making sure others weren't coming in to do the same.  Let's just say they tried contacting me 3 months later about some purchases on my non-existent account.  I literally told them on the phone "I'm holding my account closing documents right here with your manager's signature on it."  Then I told them the manager's name.  They immediately hung up and I never heard from Bank of Asshole again.

       Bringing about change will not be comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with a job can buy a new car if they want. Car loans are handed out like candy. Houses are trickier, but with 20% down and verifiable income your credit score isn't that important. Credit scores are shit and to get rid of them will require discomfort; people should save up for the things they want, not pay for them later.
      </p>
      <p>
       A local credit union will circulate your deposits to the local community. It will loan your money to your neighbors. They usually cost less, have better service, almost all of them can do online bill-pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd suggest keeping enough in a credit union to pay your monthly bills, but keep everything else in cash. Groceries, gas, etc should all be cash transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand the money you deposit into a bank is expanded via fractional reserve. For example every $1 you take out of your savings at a bank will "destroy" 5-10 times that amount of the bank's ability to lend money. IE, for every 1 dollar you put in, the bank lends out 10. This means that even people pulling a couple hundred bucks out each month will have a great impact. The sum is greater than the whole of the parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have money in the market... really this is how you can do some real damage to the system. Take it all out. Penalties be damned. This will be VERY uncomfortable. This will be VERY disruptive. What to do with it? I suggest precious metals, land, and productive assets. If nothing else, never use leverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, the solution is to deploy your capital today on solutions that tomorrow will require no dollar inputs. IE a fruit tree costs a few bucks today, but provides fruit for years without the need for any more dollars. Every purchase you make, ask yourself if this gets you closer to your goals. If not, don't spend your limited capital on it.

       Sure. Let's start with the big one: credit unions are  non-profit institutions. That means they don't use your money to invest/invent speculative instruments (derivatives) for profit.
Here's an infographic that explains more:

       Yes, i've removed it completely, and re-integrated it into tangible assets. Guns, depending on type, will retain value, or even go up (the AWB scare doubled some of them)

       Silver is always going to have value. Asswipe toiletpaper "dollars" only have "beleived value".

       I've never understood why people believe that in the event of a catastrophe, gold or silver will hold value. I can't do anything with that. To me, it's the exact same thing as paper money, it's just something that's supposed to represent value instead of having an inherent value itself.

       feel that the collapse of the US would fall into a Mad Max fantasy scenario?

       The collapse is going to be slow, then abrupt, there will be a sorting period, and then things will return to a jaded form of normalcy.

       Look at how fucked Zimbabwe is. They had all sorts of crazy shit happen, and even still, gold and silver retain value.

       Its not an initial "i have silver and you dont lolz" its to preserve purchasing power. If i can trade silver for fuel and groceries later on, then im fine. I want the collapse to not impede on my day to day operations.

       Silver is useful when you need to barter with someone and have nothing else which they are interested in trading for. Silver will always require a certain amount of physical labor to mine and purify, so it always has value. Even if not used for trading you could hold onto that silver while the dollar tanks and then purchase the replacement dollar or foreign currency with your silver. If you did not have silver, and were holding dollars, and the dollar collapses, you have nothing but worthless paper dollars.

       If I'm having to ration/hunt my own food, I personally would not trade it for gold. I'd trade it for something like water or gas or services. Something that's useful to me. I mean I get that in a semi-established community, gold would have value since people attach value to it, but if I was trying to survive on my own? Gold would be worthless.

       Personally, I switched to ING Direct and every time my bank has been swallowed by a Chase, or BofA, or now, in ING's case, I've moved to Navy Federal Credit Union. It feels like I'm running out of places to go.

       I can get a way more ounces of silver for the price of one ounce of gold. To me if I had to use silver as currency right now, at $30 an oz. silver seems more useful for everyday spending than a $1650 oz of gold.

       This will get buried, but, the problem is the Federal Reserve, not banks. You must avoid banks which secretly own the Fed, such as BOA, CITI, Wells Fargo, etc. I am in Canada and I am with CIBC. Still a big bank, but not as much part of the overall corruption problem.

       I say marijuana if you're in a state that allows it. Easy to trade, mostly non-perishable, it already has generally agreed upon units (grams, eighths, quarters ...)  and many people like the stuff. I don't know what all the gold bugs think they're going to be able to do with gold in the event of collapse.

       By that time prices will be skyrocketing for basic necessities and your paper money will not buy much. Think of a loaf of bread costing $20 due to short supply or a surge in fuel prices for example. This is why it is advisable to have a reasonable stockpile of food and such close at hand or at your rural retreat.

       I don't think you get it. If the dollar collapses, it's not worth anything from that very moment on. There is no grace period where people will take it as currency. You literally have NO CLUE what you're talking about.

       No no, I just meant if you have all your money in a bank controlled by the federal reserve and that bank were to freeze funds which would mean you wouldn't be able to have access to your money, cash would be the only way to buy things such as groceries.

       I believe that Canadian banks are government owned, so their will be very little difference between banks themselves.  I have heard of accounts being frozen for various reasons, I am really not as informed as I should be

       Ok, so I am in a shitty situation, my company (which I thoroughly enjoy working for) does not offer paper paychecks. I am forced to have a bank account with direct deposit. However I bank locally with the same company that holds my mortgage and it's a personable group of people working there, so that gives me some false security. I also have a 401k which is gaining exponentially the past year, which I am terrified to cash out in fear of a collapse. So, I leave it there gaining money in hopes I will get a sign when to take it out (being facetious). All in all, I can count on complete restriction to any and all of my finances in the event of a collapse. I personally am relying on my skills as a form  of currency if ever needed. What god is gold or cash after the first week of a collapse? people will need food and shelter before money, in my opinion.

       Well the idea of giving my wealth to a complete stranger and asking them to hold onto it for me never really sat well for me. I have an account (small local bank) to pay bills with, I keep just enough in it so it stays open, deposit only what is needed right before I write the check. As far as credit, I never have had a use for it, so I've never been in debt to my eyeballs. Life has not been as stressful for me as it has for some of my friends that had a new house and 2 new cars, not to mention 2 jobs to pay for it all.

       I live paycheck to paycheck, but where I can barter, I will. Several times my car has broken down, to keep it in repairs, I have arranged with a friend who owns a shop, to work hours in the shop, with upkeep, oil changes, small things, and he'll cover the parts and I'll do the labor. Food is a little trickier, what I can grow I do, and what I can't I buy, using cash as often as possible. Barter is the number one thing to do, start talking to people you know, building a network, and have something to barter with, skills or goods.

       Own my car and every one I've ever had. Never pay a car note, the insurance is paid through the business but my personal insurance is paid in money orders.  I use a pre paid cell (cash at ATT), no cable, no net -except on phone and at the business.  I live in a mobile home which I own out right and the lot I'm on is owned by an old lady who loves cash with no questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vehicle is from 2001, just paid $1700 for it and another. $1000 to fix it up. Runs like new.  My boyfriend hunts,  we grow some food and buy from local farmers.
      </p>

       I live a very simple, humble life.  Work hard,  travel, read and enjoy being a free human being.

       Rent:  A landlord can kick me out when the SHTF.

       Reason I always hated the idea of renting was the collapse was out of my control. The landlord goes belly up and I'm out on my ass at a moments notice. If I own it and I fuck it up then at last I have no one to blame but myself.

       My Wife and I do not have a bank account. We only cash them at the bank they are drawn off of. We do not have a ton of cash on hand. We're working on that. She just started working a couple months ago after 5 years of school.

       I want to start gaining tangible and other goods we can barter with. Food, precious metals, etc.

       EDIT: We are "renting to own" through our landlord who thinks just like we do. This was done by a handshake. And we do have a pre-paid debit card that we never have more than necessary on.

       I have my monies in multiple banks - am thinking of shifting some to different countries; Switzerland, Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing illegal - taxes paid on each interest...
      </p>
      <p>
       Just want to be somewhat safe if there is a bank run and have trouble taking my money out in this country.

       Judging from a large number of comments I've read here, people are removing their cash from the banks and their Ponzi scheme transaction systems.  What you may not know, is just how much this is directly affecting their criminal empire.

       YES - I've wirhdrawn from all mainstream, commercial banks and have opted for a credit union that has no more of a relationship with the central banks than through FDIC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, stopped filing tax returns 2 years ago - sure, they mostly get to keep my money, but I am NOT complying anymore with the process beyond what my employer/slave driver has forced me to do.
      </p>

       Also, took out my 401K - didn't pay any taxes and everything is biz as usual so far.

       In the event the banks freeze funds and not allow people to withdrawal your funds. The local grocery store will still accept your cash. It's about bank controlling access I guess

       Banks dictate how much your legal tender is worth though. If a bank says your money isn't worth anything a grocery store is not going to take it. Or in the more likely event like 1950's Germany the bank will say your money is worth very little and the grocery store will still accept your money but will also assume it is worth very little. Imagine $100 loaf of bread and you get the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want to protect yourself from a banking failure you should be investing in commodities that will be useful in the event of a fiat currency collapse. I myself have about a 10 year supply of canned goods.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The money that your grocery store is going to accept is deemed legal tender at the FEDERAL level. The banks are in the business of storing and profiting from numbers games with that money, and only because it's value is backed by a guarantee from the FEDERAL government.
      </p>
      <p>
       True enough, the government expands it's money supply through an entity referred to as "The Federal Bank", but I think it's been more than proven that entity is federal in name ONLY.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few presidents have tried to issue money that is purely federally ISSUED and without interest, and the same thing happened to every one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that would be because they were putting themselves at direct odds with the entity that claims to be both Federal and a bank. But that's another conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point stands: Banks do not determine what is and is not legal tender in this country. Period.

       You mention the presidents that tried to issue federal money, I assume you mean the ones that were assassinated, they were unsuccessful in issuing that currency. The money we have now is a fiat currency that's value is determined in a non-sustaining market of futures and interest, the majority of which is the trade of bonds between the federal reserve and the united states government. In turn this federal reserve also determines how much money is printed and therefore has a very large interest in how much the US dollar is worth. If this company, the federal reserve, were to print enough money that the fiat bubble burst we would end up an economy governed by worthless pieces of paper. I guarantee if the shit hits the fan to the point where the Federal Reserve is printing so much money that it is worthless that the grocery store will simply lock its doors and wont give a ninny that those pieces of paper say legal for all debts public and private.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point: The Federal Reserve is a very large bank and The United States Government has a Mortgage out from that bank that the US citizens pay interest only on.

       Our economy is circling the drain. Black tuesday is going to happen, again, and soon at that. I refuse to be the one who loses everything.

       I can get a way more ounces of silver for the price of one ounce of gold. To me if I had to use silver as currency right now, at $30 an oz. silver seems more useful for everyday spending than a $1650 oz of gold.
