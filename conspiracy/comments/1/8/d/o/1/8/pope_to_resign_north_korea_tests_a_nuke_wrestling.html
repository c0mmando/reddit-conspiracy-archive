       The Pope is setting up to be the next dictator in North Korea, he's recruiting the best wrestlers in the world for his personal guard and during the next Papal conclave, a nuke will erase any material and/or living loose end that may endanger the plan.

       Censoring a post based on the opinion of one person, or even a group of people, is anathema to the very idea of this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people are not free to speak their mind, even if you see it as ridiculous, what is the point of this place?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps I believe that HAARP discussion is stupid.  Perhaps I believe that it's dumb and not relevant.  Should we censor that too, just because a few people disagree with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you see how slippery that slope is?  Once you start deleting posts based on subjective opinions it all flies out the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a subreddit that rightly rails against censorship, you seem all to eager to delete what you dislike.

       Yeah but your opinion doesn't take precedence over his.  He has his opinion, you have yours, but his isn't stupid because you don't agree with it.  It's not a productive discussion at all, you didn't give any good feedback, just basically told him to shove it.  Classy.

       That goes against the entire idea of this subreddit, your inability to understand the subjectivity of opinions is exactly the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is dumb for posting their ideas, even if you see said idea as being stupid.  Because one man's dumb delusions are another man's truth, it's totally relative.  That's the entire point of this place in my opinion, anything and everything goes.  It's also what makes this place different, circlejerking about the same stuff over and over again is what the other subreddits do, not us.

       I think his post and inistance of non-coincidence are dumb.

       And this subreddit isn't a place for ideas to be criticized?
       <em>
        Really?

       Have you
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       seen a post supporting the official 9/11 story that isn't slathered in responses calling the person a shill, sheep, or moron?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any group looking for truth must accept that the truth might disagree with their preconceived notions. If all we do is agree quietly and ignore everything we don't agree with, what are we really gaining?

       That wasn't criticism, you were being an ass.  Criticism implies some amount of constructive discussion, you were basically saying "well fuck you buddy I don't agree with that you're a moron" without giving any reasons for it.

       So?  That's such a relative statement, who is to say what is or is not retarded?  You?

       Half of the posts in here are about seemingly similarly ridiculous stuff to some people, who is to say that he doesn't get his chance to say what he wants to say?

       If you start limiting expression based on what people say is or is not "retarded" you'd have to start censoring a whole plethora of posts based on completely subjective opinions.  You want free expression, yet people that bug you should be silenced?

       In a subreddit where UFOs, Reptoids and other items are regularly discussed, where do you draw the line?  And whose judgement do you use?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen people go on huge rants about how HAARP is controlling your mind and everyone smiles and nods.  Yet you claim to have standards to uphold?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know for a subreddit that labels itself as freethinking you really are quite dogmatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It says right on your subreddit description...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Respect other views and opinions, keep an open mind.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So how about you do that?  One man's delusion might be another man's truth.  Who are you to tell others what to believe?  This entire subreddit is based on the idea that everyone can freely speak their mind without people crying "bullshit" and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you start censoring people based on what you see as "retarded" then why not censor anything and everything that anyone thinks is stupid?  It's a slippery slope.
      </p>

       Although it's amusing to see people that hate fascism and censorship become what they rail against.

       Perhaps I think it's common sense that any discussion on Dorner material should be nixed.  Do we censor every article based on the opinion of one person, or even the majority?

      <p>
       It's no different than any of the other discussions here.  Just because you disagree with it doesn't mean it's bullshit.

       It's confusing how a group of people could be so opposed to censorship, then demand they censor others because of disagreements.

       Hello!

      <p>
       Welcome to r/conspiracy, where free thinking and discussion is encouraged!
      </p>
      <p>
       When you spot bullshit, call it bullshit, when you spot an interesting fact or a story you weren't aware of, investigate it and make an informed comment in a given thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, a troll or a shill is usually called on his/her bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I am calling you out, dingbat.
