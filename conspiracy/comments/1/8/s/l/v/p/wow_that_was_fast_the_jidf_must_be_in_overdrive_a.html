    <div class="md"><p>Ive participated in both threads. Question for OP- did you look at the Auchwitz poster&#39;s history to see if he/she spends a lot of time counterbalancing bad Israeli press? Is it possible this was posted by someone really moved by a trip to the musem and thought they&#39;d share? Its not like one cancels out the other. Be it some asshole instagramming a pic of him holding zero on some Palestinian kid&#39;s medulla or scratches in bare cement made by terrified human fingernails- they both have a similar message. We&#39;re our own worst enemies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem.</p>

<p><strong>1.) Did you look at posters previous submission history  if he/she spends a lot of time counterbalancing bad Israeli press?</strong>
No, why should anyone? And, that shouldnt matter in this case. Its not the poster you should be looking at, it just the content in question. Additionally the internet is anonymous, so it doesnt matter who submits anything, especially on this website!  There is no verification proceedure and people create fake accounts all the time, some people have hundreds of then, there are no limits to how many accounts a person can have, thats the beauty of the internet.  So someone can, theoretically, create 100s of reddit accounts and wait for an opportune time to use one with whatever content they need to suit their needs. The whole point of the &quot;Auschwitz&quot; image album, which skyrocketed to the front page, was for damage control, get peoples emotions back on your side. PR Damage control.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/12/06/21/224222/reddit-cofounder-says-site-was-built-by-a-horde-of-fake-accounts">Even the Reddit Founder Used Fake Accounts to get the website started and seed the direction of conversation</a></p>

<p>Side Note: <a href="http://socialtimes.com/redditors-continue-to-fight-9gag-citing-fake-followers-and-stolen-content_b103756">Also 9Gag was caught inflating posts with bots and fake accounts</a> Seriously the list goes on and on with fake accounts and bots etc etc.</p>

<p><strong>2.) Is it possible this was posted by someone really moved by a trip to the museum and thought they&#39;d share?</strong> 
Of course.  So ill just direction your attention to the Reddit Search function, do a quick search for &quot;Auschwitz&quot; and you will literally see 1000s!!! of posts that have either 0-10s of upvotes with eerily similar experiences/pictures in just the last 3 months alone (if you search an entire years worth of posts with just the word &quot;Auschwitz&quot; there are too many to go through!). So why this submitters album of pics was chosen, couldnt tell you.  Does it fit the model of PR Damage control, yes it most certainly does. Also, none of the other &quot;Auschwitz&quot; photos/experiences reach the front page on a daily basis with such velocity! </p>

<p><strong>3.) the timing of the pictures.</strong>
The isreali sniper pic has been out for a week or so, yes, but just started to get negative press as seen here by <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xE5kW42.gif">yahoo front page news article</a> (Yahoo is generally the world&#39;s most visited home page) and on twitter comments and as well as on reddit. Twitter is extremely popular, and the popularity of the image on Reddit has skyrocketed in the last 2 days evidenced by the high number upvotes. Also, Reddit is almost of direct source of the human experience now, its a community of millions upvoting and downvoting what should and what shouldnt be cool. So, one can see the extreme importance of damage control on reddit once again.</p>

<p><strong>4.) The &quot;Auschwitz&quot; pic has a total of over 3000 upvotes in as little as 2 hours!</strong>
That is really fast! And very unusual for that type of post. Cross reference that with the litterally 10s of 1000s of other very similar Auschwitz pic albums/experiences that get uploaded DAILY through reddit and you start to form a pitcure of &quot;Damage Control&quot; with the front page &quot;Aushwitz&quot; album upload. </p>

<p><strong>5.) Diversion from discussion comments</strong>
Divide and conquer, or diversion from bad press seems to be applied when it comes to negative press about this sniper pic, and it applies to just about anything with negative press.  And that press is starting to change form - not only is it used on MSM but, it is moving to MSSM ie Reddit (Main Stream Social Media) This tactic can easily be seen applied to reddit, and its being applied to this post and the other post on r/conspiracy right now which has over 1000 upvotes, the one of the sniper pic (although 80% of the good/upstanding comments are being upvoted which is good to see) - key phrases similar to &quot;this is anti-semetic&quot; &quot;paranoid conspiratards&quot; &quot;retarded&quot; &quot;how do you know its real&quot;  have been seen and that calls into question the use of PR Damage control tactics.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/israeli-sniper-posts-photo-child-crosshairs-163924256--abc-news-topstories.html">And finally, again, here is the yahoo article about how real the image was.</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Added some words to make as proper a sentences could make :)</p>

<p>The best evidence you can extract from the last 2 days is basically timing and PR Damage Control.  The scenario goes like this.  Negative/Bad Press needs to be counteracted with Positive Press.</p>

<p>The Negative Press: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/israeli-sniper-posts-photo-child-crosshairs-163924256--abc-news-topstories.html">Israeli Sniper Posts Pic of Child in Crosshairs</a> - Mulitple Posts on Reddit and other Social Media/News agencies websites with has story gaining negative emotions and responses.</p>

<p>The Positive Spin: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/18tcsh/photos_taken_at_dachau_during_wwii_that_i_found/">Photos taken at Dachau during WWII that I found when cleaning my grandfather&#39;s house. NSFW.</a> Also just hit front page today.</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>Positive Spin #2: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/18s90e/so_i_was_in_auschwitz_last_weekend/">So I was in Auschwitz last weekend...</a> - this post, which yesterday, out of nowhere had over 3000 upvotes in under 2 hours, was another post counteracting the negative news story of the Israeli Sniper with child in crosshairs article. </p>

<p>Take it for what you will, but there is a better explanation and more in depth breakdown in the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/18slvp/wow_that_was_fast_the_jidf_must_be_in_overdrive_a/c8hvzs6">1st linked comment</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about that, I didn&#39;t see your previous post. Thank you for responding to my request. I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to submit a counterargument, point-by-point.</p>

<p><strong>1) Did you look at posters previous submission history if he/she spends a lot of time counterbalancing bad Israeli press?</strong></p>

<p>If you have not done thorough research into who the OP was, then you can not reasonably conclude that he/she is an agent of the JIDF without evidence to support the claim. Additionally, I do not accept the burden of proof for unfalsifiable claims. Please reference &quot;Russell&#39;s Teapot&quot; for further reading.</p>

<p><strong>2.) Is it possible this was posted by someone really moved by a trip to the museum and thought they&#39;d share?</strong></p>

<p>Even you accept that this is a possibility. Your &quot;evidence&quot; to support JIDF involvement is the existence of other posts of a similar nature which were not as successful. This is not even a proper argument, and if you are familiar with Reddit (as I&#39;m sure you are, as your account has existed for 4 years) you will know that this is nothing out of the ordinary. You may also know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">the simplest explanation is the one that is most likely to be true</a>, and your claim here most certainly does not fit the criteria of simplicity.</p>

<p><strong>3.) The timing of the pictures</strong></p>

<p>Again, the burden of proof falls upon you to suggest that there is a correlation between the timing of both images that cannot be chalked up to coincidence. Although this is the core of your argument, you have provided no evidence so far. Unless any is forthcoming, the claim is void.</p>

<p><strong>4.) The &quot;Auschwitz&quot; pic has a total of over 3000 upvotes in as little as 2 hours!</strong></p>

<p>Allow me to direct your attention to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/18tyaz/bus_driver_jailed_17_months_for_this_gif/">this</a> post which has received almost 9,000 upvotes at the time of this writing, in little over 3 hours. In fact, a quick glance at the front page at any given time will likely yield these same results. There is nothing special about the amount of upvotes acquired by the &quot;Auschwitz&quot; post.</p>

<p><strong>5.) Diversion from discussion comments</strong></p>

<p>I have not seen these and you do not discuss them. Please direct me to exactly where these diversion tactics are taking place.</p>

<p>In short, the evidence you have provided is circumstantial at best. There is hardly a viable argument here to rebut. Before you dig through my comment history, I&#39;ll admit that I am an anti-Zionist Jew. I find the actions of Israel reprehensible, but I think there is a very important distinction between &quot;Jew&quot; and &quot;Zionist&quot; that many people on this subreddit forget. If someone wants to claim that &quot;those sneaky Jews are behind it&quot;, they had better have some damn evidence.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am <strong>NOT</strong> saying that the JIDF had nothing to do with this. I have no reason to suspect anything for which evidence is not provided. I am simply saying that if your argument is that they <strong>ARE</strong> behind it, you need to provide verifiable evidence to support the claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank goodness someone on here has responded with some thought out rebuttals instead of, (these go along with your #5) <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/18slvp/wow_that_was_fast_the_jidf_must_be_in_overdrive_a/c8hun8n">you are paranoid</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/18slvp/wow_that_was_fast_the_jidf_must_be_in_overdrive_a/c8hr7ie">conspiratards</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/18slvp/wow_that_was_fast_the_jidf_must_be_in_overdrive_a/c8hxcjf">douchebag</a>.  So first, let thank you for adding to the conversation.  Secondly here is my rebut to your rebut ;)</p>

<p><strong>1.) If you have not done thorough research into who the OP was, then you can not reasonably conclude that he/she is an agent of the JIDF.</strong> </p>

<p>At no point and time in any of my explanation did i say the poster was working for the JIDF!  Not once. - Here is the sentence you should have focused on - <strong>Its not the poster you should be looking at, it just the content in question</strong>.  I was merely pointing to the possibility of the JIDF taking someones &quot;reddit submission&quot; that is sympathetic to their side.  IE: a post about the holocaust.  (now 2 of them to be exact, one more recently again today - could just be spillage or excitement from the first one though) - and propping it up to the front page of Reddit fast.</p>

<p><strong>2.) This one is easy i already conceded that someone was possibly moved by said trip, this is true. But as to the overall importance of the subject, its very little importance and doesnt matter, i will explain below, again.</strong></p>

<p>Do a search for &quot;Auschwitz&quot;, without the quotation marks, on the reddit search.  Right now you can see in the last 18 hours!!! there have been other users uploading their moving experiences with similar photo albums, some are even better quality and higher resolution.  Once again, you can see these posts happen almost everyday (concentration camp photos and trips) and yet most only garner about 10-15 upvotes.  I will use this explanation again later...</p>

<p><strong>3.) timing of the pics</strong></p>

<p>Here we can see the core of the argument.  Like is said before, the negative news, comments and perspective of the whole sniper thing was starting to reach a critical mass.  </p>

<p>The whole argument was based on PR, Spin and Damage Control.  Is it possible it was a coincidence that on the same day a post about some concentration camp photos gets voted to the top, yes i can concede that, anyone could! Its not rocket science here.  </p>

<p>But take a step back and look a little wider.  As was shown above in rebuttal #2, there are probably 100s of other posts in the last 3-4 months alone, of very similar uploaded posts, whether it be some image scenarios of someones trip or someones grandparents old family albums that probably tell an equal if not better story, yet are never voted to the front page!  Now, couple that, with the negative response from the sniper shooter was starter to garner, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/israeli-sniper-posts-photo-child-crosshairs-163924256--abc-news-topstories.html">evidenced by the news article that was linked to, that hit the front page of yahoo ysterday</a> and also getting over 1100 upvotes on r/conspiracy and also similar in WTF and other subreddits, you can see the importance of spinning or doing some damage control and upvoting someone elses concentration camp photos to the top of Reddit.</p>

<p><strong>4.) Which leads me to this - 3000 upvotes in 2hr</strong></p>

<p>Yes, once again anything can happen! Yes, posts can get upvoted like mad and most do in short time if they are good.  But once again, there is Nothing New about the concentration camps, they&#39;ve been upvoted so many times on reddit its amazing. Its the whole timing of the concentration camp photos that coincided with the negative press about the Israeli Sniper.  </p>

<p>But, still you fail to see the core of the argument, the whole theory was based on the JIDF pushing the Auschwitz post higher to divert the attention away from the Isreali Sniper, and bring peoples rage and anger back to the &quot;real problem&quot; Remembering the concentration camps!</p>

<p>Example: Person #1: Wow did you see that post about the Isreali Sniper aimed at a little kid with his sniper rifle?</p>

<p>Person #2. Yeah that was crazy, but wait, check out all these new images of the of the concentration camps. It really shows how bad they had in WW2.</p>

<p>Person #1: Wow, didnt see those images, wow, those are amazing, look how bad they had it in the concentration camps.</p>

<p>And you can see the whole circle of life of PR/Spin/Damage Control.  It is getting more sophisticated and MSSM (Main Stream Social Media) is the new battle ground.  </p>

<p>So, if you think it is not possible to put together a spin campaign or do Damage Control online in a matter of minutes or hours, well then im gonna have to tell you to do some more research, hmmm, but maybe i can show you real quick to get you started,  i wonder if there could be any companies out there that would try to capitalize of this new type of online threat, lets see shall we.  (FYI these links are more for companies, but if you really think about, if its good enough for a multi-Billion Dollar company, then a Multi-Trillion Dollar country would employ the same tactics, right?)</p>

<p>There are a ton others, but the whole core of the argument was based on using someone elses post, pushing it to the top of reddit (with upvote campaigns) and leaving a better perception of Israel at the top of Reddit. Did it happen, we will never know, could it happen, yes it very well could.  Are there methods and systems in place to combat against negative press, you bet there are, and people get paid 100s of 1000s of dollars every year to help protect people images and reputations.</p>

<p>Thats the best i can do for ya.</p>

<p>Because, at the end of the day, I care about what other people think. Not in a &quot;thought police&quot; kind of way, but because objectivity and good arguments matter. If I feel that someone is mistaken or simply unjustified in making a claim, I&#39;m going to say something about it, not only for the good of that person, but for the good of other people who are exposed to the claims of that person. I &quot;give a shit&quot; as a matter of principle.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. The nature of this post was much more confident, much more bold, much more paranoid, and much, much more assumptive than a mere &quot;observation.&quot; And you know that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s always something up with overly defensive people.</p>

<p>You caught me. Paid shill, right here. Because after all, caring about what other people have to say obviously means we&#39;re out to shut them up so devious plans can be carried out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am Jewish and you will not find a bigger criticizer of the racist apartheid state of Israel than me. When my grandpop was alive we visited Auschwitz where he was interred for almost two years...primarily, it turned out, so he could show me all of the revisions made to the camp to make it fit the narrative of history better. Its insane that nearly everything about the place (including the death count) has been revised since the war.</p>

<p>I sure wish that I would have listened more to what the man was telling me when he was alive. Even with the testimony of a full-on &#39;survivor&#39; right in my face it took me years and years to realize what a scam the entire &quot;Shoah business&quot; was. It fattened the pockets of a select few who made out like bandits thanks to the lies and reparations while leaving true &quot;survivors&quot; like my grandpop to die nearly penniless, living off of his meager pension and social security/government cheese at the end.</p>

<p>These people should be ashamed and rot in hell...yet their names (I&#39;m looking at YOU Weisel and Weisenthal) and their time-and-again proven lies make the history books and my grandpop (who only sought the truth about the holocaust) died in obscurity...him and fellow survivors shunned by the people that became rich on the backs of his tragedies.</p>

I am not jewish and nor do I despise them but I am starting to feel pretty damn angry at the Zionist movement. Especially looking at the deaths in the past 150 years of war and how it was financed. There are a lot of events that have been created out of false flag events and I am getting sick of it. Seems to me now the agenda is to get my gun. And they won&#39;t , atleast not easy, that will be one of the lessons I have learned from those who pershed during WWII because they did listen to their gov&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so, the &quot;calling people holocaust deniers&quot; thing comes in where, exactly?</p>

<p>again, you mean &quot;people denying that the holocaust and sympathy due to it absolve Israel of responsibility for similar atrocities&quot; and &quot;holocaust deniers&quot; are the same thing?</p>

<p>this is in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, where when something, be it an image, a reporter&#39;s piece of journalism, a leaked cable, or anything that damages a state&#39;s ideological propaganda - will inevitably be responded to BY that state with something, images, another journalistic piece, a story, something that garners sympathy for them to keep the tides going in their favor as much as they can. this is all happening on a social media giant, reddit, and it&#39;s all happened on reddit&#39;s frontpage recently.</p>

<p>this is, indeed, where all of this would be happening. we know that we&#39;re dealing with people who don&#39;t mind, as a collective, enforcing apartheid and brutalizing an entire people, and using the most dirty, underhanded tactics imaginable on their critics. so, basically religious fanatical terrorists brutalizing people with the support of the US government and England. Imagine what the Israelis would be doing if &quot;a people&quot; or religious group/state came in and did to them what they are doing to the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Just imagine what they would do in retaliation to that.</p>

<p>Are we deciding that they&#39;d never do such a thing as post images of the holocaust&#39;s various camps or gas chambers to [one of] the world&#39;s biggest social media aggregation site days/a week after the image their soldier posted with a child&#39;s head in his crosshairs surfaces and circulated?</p>

<p>so we&#39;re agreeing to that now and everyone who disagrees is actually denying the holocaust?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on your definition of holocaust denier. One form of Holocaust denial is saying that it &quot;wasn&#39;t as bad as people claim it was,&quot; and that it is exaggerated to gain sympathy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is a single person that believes 100% the entire Holocaust was a lie. Holocaust denier just means someone that downplays it, justifies it, or argues against specific things that happened.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that&#39;s denying the holocaust now? Would it be &quot;hiroshima and nagasaki denial&quot; if Japan came and invaded your country, subjugated your people, killed anyone in their way, knocked your house down, cordoned off your street, sent soldiers with guns into your neighborhood who killed anyone who made them uncomfortable(an occupying force of people who feel guilty for participating in crimes against humanity tend to be made uncomfortable by simple things, <em>like children playing in public parks</em>), CERTAINLY killed anyone who resisted them to the point of bombing cities with pockets of resistance full of women and kids, and called anyone else who would resist them terrorists --- and then when someone started speaking negatively of Japan, a tour of the wreckage remaining from Nagasaki and Hiroshima came to the top of the frontpage of the most popular social media site in existence and stayed there for a while at a very convenient time -- and some guy made a post about how convenient it is that whenever people begin feeling overwhelmingly negative about something horrible a soldier from the Japanese occupying force does - those kinds of pictures are brought up?</p>

<p>Would that be &quot;Hiroshima/Nagasaki denial&quot;? That is the point/question.</p>

<p>Because I haven&#39;t seen anyone say &quot;people made a bigger deal of hiroshima/nagasaki/the holocaust than it actually was&quot; here. So where does the &quot;holocaust denial&quot; part come in again?</p>

<p>Just curious, and if that hasn&#39;t happened, why are you here in this thread asking about &quot;why are you denying the holocaust&quot;?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not my argument or stance at all. If anything, my stance here is that we don&#39;t have <strong>any</strong> sort of good evidence or reason at all to positively suggest the things you&#39;re suggesting. Is it possible? Sure! But that&#39;s where it stops bro. If you want to go on trying to &quot;connect all the dots&quot; and running on wild speculation and superficial conclusions, be my guest, but don&#39;t for a second act surprised when folks find your conclusions unjustified and don&#39;t give you the benefit of the doubt. Even if I <em>were</em> taking the position that &quot;everything is a coincidence,&quot; <strong>you</strong> are still the one positing that <em>nothing</em> is a coincidence -- because after all, &quot;they&quot; control everything. </p>

<p>I never said or even suggested that your &quot;Auschwitz pics conspiracy&quot; was fundamentally ridiculous. I simply posit that it&#39;s entirely unfounded, unjustified, and predicated on simple possibility and superficial speculation. Your conclusions are <strong>especially</strong> unjustified when an occurrence like this one is in fact very easily explainable via coincidence. I&#39;m not asserting that it <em>was</em> a matter of coincidence, just that it&#39;s very easily <em>explainable</em> via coincidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not mine, and that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about. You&#39;re being an idiot. They aren&#39;t my conclusions, and that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about. Coincidence or not, that has nothing to do with the points I am making.</p>

<p>There are many things in this thread, one of them is not like the others. That&#39;s me. You don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about, because what you&#39;re talking about has next to nothing to do with what I am talking about; you think it does because you keep on missing the point, which is the only one worth making or taking away from a post like this. Do you think I&#39;m actually arguing that Mossad agents came on the internet and posted internment camp photos? That&#39;s entirely possible and even plausible(as it fits a policy that suits the Israeli government, fits every piece of human psychology known to man used in that regard), but it has nothing to do with what I&#39;m talking about in this thread. Whether or not the poster is an agent, you are a shill, or whether &quot;this conspiracy&quot;(god I&#39;m talking to an idiot) &quot;is true&quot; or &quot;isn&#39;t&quot; - it&#39;s can be completely disregarded because it&#39;s not at all worth talking about, or what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it possible? Sure! But that&#39;s where it stops bro&quot; Aw, how quaint you are. You don&#39;t even know what we&#39;re talking about here in this thread(yours and mine).</p>

<p>My bad. I was mistaken in thinking that it was specifically and originally <em>your</em> idea. But aren&#39;t we in fact talking about the idea that the Auschwitz pics posted earlier was some sort of Israeli plot to distract from the sniper pic? Is that not what we&#39;ve been talking about?</p>

<p>Because our whole post-war society is built on the promise that we will never let anything like the Holocaust and the Third Reich happen again, ever. We simply came to the conclusion that trading a minimal bit of free speech for the protection of millions of people is a fair deal. It&#39;s not that hard to understand.</p>

That Winston Churchill himself said over and over that he wanted war with them because of the financial juggernaut that germany had become by working their asses off?

<blockquote>
<p>if you take a look at David Coles example he goes to the curator of Auschwitz and he denies what I always heard growing up. He penned the number at 1.1 million not the 6 I was told.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The curator says 1.1 million have died in Auschwitz. THIS <em>IS</em> THE COMMONLY ACCEPTED NUMBER. Judging by your comment, you either thought 6 million died in Auschwitz alone (6 million is the <em>total</em> death toll of Jews in the Holocaust) or that the curator said 1.1 million died in the Holocaust in total (it&#39;s not really clear what you meant) - and concluded that the curator provided &quot;proof&quot; that the Holocaust death toll is inflated. Is it really that hard?</p>

<p>If you still don&#39;t believe me, why don&#39;t we take a look at the official website of the Auschwitz-Birkenau?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a result of the inclusion of Auschwitz in the process of the mass extermination of the Jews, the number of deportees began to soar. About 197 thousand Jews were deported there in 1942, about 270 thousand the following year, and over 600 thousand in 1944, for a total of almost 1.1 million. Among them, about 200 thousand people were selected as capable of labor and registered as prisoners in the camp. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not my video , I just quietly let them speak and tell their story. Have you been there? I find it damn curious why some people cannot question things, and it is punishible by prison. Voltaire has said, Know who you cannot be critical of and you will know who rules you. But you go ahead and do what you want in light of events like the USS Liberty. I don&#39;t care what you think but you cannot deny what is going on now and in the past.  Go ahead and watch this short one if you have a pea brain and a short attention span   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t_LxpCY2G8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t_LxpCY2G8</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I don&#39;t even know anyone jewish that I have a personal relationship with. Anti semite is not a word I grew up even knowing but I do know this. There are people who were there and they know more about it than you and I do. I take what those who were not there with a grain of salt and don&#39;t accept everything as gospel. What I do look it are facts. I can create a whole list of things that add up and point in the same direction. The USS Liberty , the Balfour Declaration , The history of the Rothschilds financing with regard to countries/central banks/wars. History of Mossad false flag events in Egypt. Israel Spying on the US, Israeli&#39;s celebrating when the twin towers fell(Caught by Sgt Decarlo). I mean seriously how many fucking things have to be shoved in your face until you accept that something is wrong here. Ya know if everytime something bad happened and it were Canadians or people from Mars after awhile you would figure it out. But no, the misledia has fed everyone a steady diet of propaganda and you believed it.  Ten percent of the people in Israel are genetically Jews, the rest are Khazars.  I simply became aware from the financial view point not something of racial hatred. </p>

<p>It is highly unlikely that the IDF would respond to a post on a couple of small subreddits, the most viewed of which receiving fewer than 1000 points, by posting on reddit.

I was more going with what a buddy of mine said to me he was a sniper and he looked at the picture and just said &quot;why can people just go to work and work anymore...&quot; and just shook his head. That&#39;s how he always looked at it it was his job to go out there and take out the target. its sad that this is what is happening but i don&#39;t see this as a conspiracy because they take any opportunity to push look what went went through agenda doesn&#39;t matter if the picture was there or not its how it works. honestly its just good business play the victim and make sure the money and military aid keeps flowing because when that ends shit hits the fan. I have no problem with Israel what i have a problem with is giving aid to a country that sees us as enemy (they see every one as an enemy).</p>

<p>The Jews did not have an army. Because their countries of origin decided to no longer protect the jewish segment of their population, quite the opposite.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the US government deciding to kill all left-handed people. It&#39;s not like the US government deciding to attack Mexico. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference.</p>

<p>Three. To adress Prometheriondumbdumbdumb: The only other ethnic group who were targeted for genocide were the Gypsies. Who do have groups supporting their cause. In Europe. Where they fucking ARE.</p>

<p>While there are lots of jewish people in the US. That&#39;s why you hear lots about the Jews. Because that&#39;s where they ARE.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you don&#39;t hear about the Gypsies as much as we in Europe. Because that&#39;s where they fucking ARE. You dumb pieces of shits.</p>

The germans were persecuted after WWI that they in fact did not start but Britain could not stand to lose!!!!! So they employed the Americans and got a bunch of us killed to do his bidding. Germany was paying reparations to that central bank through Union banking and it was crushing the country, they were fucked from debt. Hitler made all those people pay for it , crazy fuck that he was. Thank Loyd George for his role in dealing with Woodrow Wilson ALL WARS ARE BANKERS WARS.

<p>You know quite well what the argument is, but I&#39;ll humor you:</p>

<p>Prometherion666 said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The holocaust wasn&#39;t just Jewish people is the part that I always wonder about. Sure, yes, Jewish people were killed en mass but so were a ton of other people and we don&#39;t have groups mass supporting their lost cause.</p>

<p>To which I added in agreement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More Russians died in WW2 than Jews. 20 million dead?? But somehow it&#39;s all about the Jews. </p>

<p>And then you went all diarrhea of the mouth on us, being the troll that you are. And then I remembered trolls should not be fed. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the user has posted several different topics that are broad across all categories. The user is also 7 months old. When I&#39;ve seen &quot;obvious&quot;( as you guys put it) accounts they have all been a week old with no other content. How does posting the pic make people forgot about something that happened a week ago? The topic is one week old but it took them a week to try to steer the topic in another direction? The picture was posted on instagram and has gained a lot more visibility on that site and through in a week compared to when it was posted on reddit. </p>

<p>Also if they have the power to up vote these topics to the top why aren&#39;t there any down votes to get popular ones buried? And don&#39;t say since it reddit&#39;s algorithm because ive seen a top of 2000+ thread with a thousand comments become 0 in less than an hour if drama happens.</p>

<p>I took the courtesy to respond and upvote. I hope to get the same respect for having a different view and not be just down voted and scroll passed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about I meet you halfway and admit that yes, race does in fact exist, but it&#39;s a cultural construct, not a biological one. There is surprisingly extremely limited genetic diversity in humans as a species. There is greater genetic difference between monkeys in a family than there are between any human beings. Sure people look different, you could have blue eyes while your sister could have green, but that doesn&#39;t mean anything about who&#39;s better.</p>

<p>Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_genetics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_genetics</a></p>

<p>Differences in behavior are due to culture, but that could be influenced by anything. You could just say that you were <em>meant to be</em> born in a superior position, but that doesn&#39;t make you much better than the jewish lawyers who look down on people or the Indian caste system which banish their own kind.</p>

<p>Hell, culturally, one group may very well be on a higher-tier, but you can&#39;t explain that with genetics alone.</p>

<p>You know quite well what the argument is, but I&#39;ll humor you:</p>

<p>Prometherion666 said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The holocaust wasn&#39;t just Jewish people is the part that I always wonder about. Sure, yes, Jewish people were killed en mass but so were a ton of other people and we don&#39;t have groups mass supporting their lost cause.</p>

<p>To which I added in agreement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More Russians died in WW2 than Jews. 20 million dead?? But somehow it&#39;s all about the Jews. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then you went all diarrhea of the mouth on us, being the troll that you are. And then I remembered trolls should not be fed. ;)</p>
