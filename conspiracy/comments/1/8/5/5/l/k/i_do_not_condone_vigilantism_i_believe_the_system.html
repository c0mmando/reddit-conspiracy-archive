There isn&#39;t any hard evidence like DNA, video footage, etc, but it would be silly to doubt he did it when he had the means, the motive, had explicitly said that she was the target, and then took responsibility for the murders after the fact.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Think of the common tropes that this man embodies as a black american, and how malleable his image is for the media to spin. Is he a ruthless, violent cop killer, suffering from mental unstability, punished by the anglo-american system? Or is he an educated vigilante, trying to remove the corruption from his city the only way he knows?</p>

<p>As much as I  want to cheer for him, he could be either of the images he is being portrayed as. The only thing that I am certain of, is that violence is not the answer to defeating a corrupt system. The violence the system can endure, and dish out, will always be greater than that of one man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dude doesn&#39;t even <em>identify</em> with &quot;black America&quot;.  He was raised by a white father and went to all white schools from kinder till high school.  He has a great, great sense of racial justice, to be sure, and got into various fights in school when people used the word &quot;nigger&quot; - which is the very same reason he got into a physical confrontation with another police officer he was riding in a vehicle with.  However, the idea of making him a &quot;black crusader&quot; I think is really stupid and unfounded - especially, again, since the man himself was more <em>culturally</em> white than anything.</p>

<p>Ultimately it&#39;s neither here nor there as it regards his race.  Unfortunately, the media (and a lot of people, for that matter) <em>will</em> indeed make it into a race issue, but that&#39;s entirely missing the point.</p>

<p>If this cop was white, he would be backing him up. Sometimes the pro white agenda people here say good things but their racist bullshit holds them back from the truth. All over YouTube and other main sites, people are calling him a hero for standing up to corruption. Why are they so brave and we must be so cowardly?</p>

<p>Edit: Here is probably the best paragraph to explain his motives in the entire thing..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luckily I don’t have to live everyday like most of you. Concerned if the misconduct you were apart of is going to be discovered. Looking over your shoulder, scurrying at every phone call from internal affairs or from the Captains office wondering if that is the day PSB comes after you for the suspects you struck when they were cuffed months/years ago or that $500 you pocketed from the narcotics dealer, or when the other guys on your watch beat a transient nearly to death and you never reported the UOF to the supervisor. No, I don’t have that concern, I stood up for what was right but unfortunately have dealt with the reprocussions of doing the right thing and now losing my name and everything I ever stood for. You fuckers knew Evans was guilty of kicking (excessive force) Gettler and you did nothing but get rid of what you saw as the problem, the whistleblower. Gettler himself stated on video tape ( provided for the BOR and in transcripts) he was kicked and even his father stated that his son said he was kicked by Evans when he was released from custody. The video was played for the entire BOR to hear. Tingirides, Eisenberg, and Martella all heard it. You’re going to see what a whistleblower can do when you take everything from him especially his NAME!!!</p>

<p>He discovered that law enforcement is basically a criminal gang with shiny medal pins, tried to report on it in order to try to <em>stop</em> it, and then GOT FIRED.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is mad because he isn&#39;t one of them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s mad because they&#39;re not <em>honorable</em>.  If he killed the commissioner&#39;s daughter and her husband, then that is NOT good - he should have just killed the commissioner himself - but this revolves around his honor and, in his own words, his <em>name</em> being tarnished by corruption.  It&#39;s not about something as stupid as him no longer being a cop <em>only</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>had he found his place he would be out on the streets generating revenue and harassing people just like all the others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Right.  And that&#39;s exactly why he actually fucking REPORTED one cop that was <em>not</em> acting honorably in the line of duty right?  That&#39;s why he got fired for not going along with a cop kicking a downed civilian.  Right?</p>

<p>Get your shitty shit straight, son.</p>
