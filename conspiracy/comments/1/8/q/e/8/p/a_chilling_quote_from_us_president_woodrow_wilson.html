       “Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it. They know that America is not a place of which it can be said, as it used to be, that a man may choose his own calling and pursue it just as far as his abilities enable him to pursue it; because to-day, if he enters certain fields, there are organizations which will use means against him that will prevent his building up a business which they do not want to have built up; organizations that will see to it that the ground is cut from under him and the markets shut against him. For if he begins to sell to certain retail dealers, to any retail dealers, the monopoly will refuse to sell to those dealers, and those dealers, afraid, will not buy the new man's wares.”

       Wilson was a manipulated man.
      </p>
      <p>
       The British government and the Zionist leaders struck a dirty deal. The Zionists were led by Chaim Weizmann, the man who one day become the first President of the State of Israel. The idea was for the Zionists to use their influence to drag the mighty USA into the war on Britain's side, so that Germany and it's Ottoman allies could be crushed. In exchange for helping to bring the USA into the war, the British would reward the Zionists by taking over Palestine from the conquered Ottomans after the war was over. The British had originally wanted to give the Zionists a jewish homeland in an African territory. But the Zionists were fixated on claiming Palestine as their land. Once under British control, the jews of Europe would be allowed to immigrate to Palestine in great numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Zionists powerbrokers such as Bernard Baruch (father of the MIC), Louis Brandeis, Paul Warburg (father of the US Federal Reserve), Jacob Schiff (financier of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia), and others immediately went to work to put the screws to President Woodrow Wilson.
       </strong>
       Overnight the Zionist influenced press transformed the German Kaiser and his people into bloodthirsty “Huns”, determined to destroy western civilization. In 1916, the US, with the help of the previous year’s Lusitania “incident”, entered the war on Britain's side under the ridiculous pretext of “making the world safe for democracy”.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Beat Back the Hun!” declared Fred Strothman’s famous propaganda poster, - a slogan which became a rallying cry of “patriotic” Americans. Woodrow Wilson was caught up in a sinister force beyond his control...

       This is the thing. The British and The Jews have used the US as a military force to gain their own ends. It is great for them because the US is viewed as an oppressor while the British and Israel get off relatively scot-free. We need to wake up and try to regain control of our own society. You can see clearly how it is being run into the ground before your eyes.

       I'm not a hipster, it's just that your restatement was very weak sauce compared to Woodrow Wilson's remarks.  Which is really what we should expect when trying to improve on the words of Woodrow Wilson.  I mean, c'mon, try to be serious about your abilities compared to his.

       I may be a robot, a homeless man at the library, or a saint, how could you know? Let us be serious and honest that we know nothing of one another or our abilities. My words have boundless ability to anyone who wishes them to have boundless ability. As do yours. As much as I despise the 1913 Federal Reserve Acts, I was quite enamored by these quotes from WW. It was flattery that provoked my own interpretation. Though it is hard not to judge him for his lack of oversight with certain social and financial projects, but I do my best to not judge anyone. Though most times I do, then I have to think seriously about my abilities, and realize I'm a flawed person who judges before knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR- Put away the scale model of Woodrow Wilson's Dick, I will not measure myself to it.

       I think it is safe to assume you aren't as good a communicator as Woodrow Wilson, even without the evidence you provided.  Your restatement was snarkier, but not better.

       Snarkier. I disagree. There was no irreverence in my context. I also think it's better, but opinions are personal.

       Safe assumptions are why we have lost so much freedom in this world.

       BTW: Well done on the subtle derogatory "evidence"  interjection, I was quite amused!

       Snark with regard to those on the take, not Wilson.

       We have lost freedoms because of safe assumptions made about your abilities?  I seriously doubt that.  You're just a megalomaniac, it seems.

       If I am being subtle,  I apologize.

        I think it was ridiculous of you to attempt to improve the Wilson quote, and the product of your attempt was bad, and you are bad.  So therefore I am ridiculing you and in no way do I mean to be subtle about my feelings in this regard.

       Aha! I certainly am a Megalomaniac, well aware of this indeed. Matter of fact, I get on reddit, not for your benefit, but mine. The only reason I'm chatting with you is that I enjoy it! The only thing that makes me different is I admit these things. I am aware and try to do what is right in spite of my ego, rather than ridicule as often as it suggests.

       Like attracts like. You see in others what is most in yourself.

       I am, at this moment, at peace with who we all are. If you even exist.
