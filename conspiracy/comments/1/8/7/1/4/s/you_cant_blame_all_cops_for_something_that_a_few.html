       I come to this subreddit looking for decent discussions. I do not completely trust the government and hope to make intellectual investigations on what's really going on, but what do I find when I look at some comments? Wild, completely biased and uneducated responses of "THE POLICE PROTECT OUR DARK SHADOWY OVERLORDS AND WANT TO KEEP US IN CHAINS!" Be serious people. I have several family members that are a part of the police force. They would never even consider harming an innocent person. Hell if I know my uncle, he'd pull a gun on his partner if he pulled his on someone without a reason. Please, keep the tinfoil hat on a coat hook and think about what you are saying. Not all cops are dirty cops, and not all cops are allies of the government. Each state is like a different country, and each cop acts differently in each state and city. To generalize that all cops are terrible people; dogs of the government is simply not true.

       right, that proves that there are cops out there that are bad people that don't deserve their jobs. But I'm not saying that there arent people out there like that. I'm simply stating that it's impossible to generalize, because you have people like those assholes, and people like my uncles, mixed up within the force doing what they can to help others or themselves.

       because not every cop can be bought. You could easily say that superiors among some of the leadership is corrupt, but to simply state that "cops are bad" is incredibly general and is not true. The more specific you get, the closer you get to a more intellectual discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       "cops are bad" -too general.
      </p>
      <p>
       "some cops are bad" -a little better
      </p>
      <p>
       "these specific cops do these specific things" -that's what I'm going for

       then say a shit ton of cops instead of all cops!!! That's what I've been saying this entire fucking time! I know there's a massive problem and I know we have to address it! but that doesnt mean we should condemn every cop because they are a cop!

       I'm not referring to you specifically, I'm referring to what I see on this subreddit a lot. It makes literally no sense that me saying to not be biased is biased. Now I could see how you could see me saying that not all cops are bad could be slightly biased, but it's far from what intended. If you see a cop, again not referring to you specifically, you shouldn't instantly think them an upstanding law keeper, but you shouldn't instantly condemn them as a corrupt jackass. I say take everything on a case by case basis, show zero tolerance to the corrupt cops, and support those who do truly try to clean up the streets. I posted this because I was tired of people condemning raging at cops in general. I;m not supporting cops in general, because that would indeed be biased, I'm just trying to polarize peoples hate to those who do deserve it, and keep it away from those who dont.

       No you were referring to me "then say a shit ton of cops instead of all cops!!!" You said don't be bias and then go onto say not all cops are bad because of your family members. That's your bias perception. Do you know everything your family members have done?

       ok, you're right. I'm not one of those people that defends an argument even if they are proven wrong. I'm confident my uncle has a good strong character, but you're right, I don't know everything he's done. But statistically, there HAS to be at least a handful of good cops out there, and I just want to defend their names and put blame towards those who deserve it. Again you're right that I was referring to you specifically, and you didn't actually say "all" which was my mistake. So what is your view towards cops then? I'm not trying to go on an internet rant. I'm a reasonable person open to all ideas and thoughts.

       I know not all cops are bad, but I think the bad cops are running the show. So when cops like Chris Dorner try to speak up, they get shot down from the top. It's a very complicated subject because how are you able to change the top when they are the ones with power? I don't know, but talking about the massive corruption is better then sweeping it under the rug which CNN has been doing since this started.

       ahhh now there's a point I can agree with. That's basically the point I was trying to make when I first created this post. We need to shift blame away from cops in general, and towards the ones who are in charge.

       Okay. But you can call for the jobs of corrupt police officers who abuse their power and authority and hurt civilians and demand they be prosecuted like any normal man would be. Apparently there is a lack of that going on.

       see that's EXACTLY what I'm talking about. you say "cops" like it's every cop. You cannot generalize people like that. Every person is different. Different morals, beliefs, lifestyles. Certain cops protect people, others dont, but you simply can't say "cops."

       I agree, but that is why cops themselves need to speak out against the bad ones. Instead of "ugh some people only talk about the bad cops" like my family says. ADDRESS the bad ones those guys are making all of you look bad. Instead my family makes excuses for the bad ones, so in a way a lot of these cops are bringing it on themselves. Speak out, say you are against it, punish the cops doing bad. Until then, we will still have this problem.

       I agree with your message, I just think it needs to be aimed at cops themselves, if you know what I mean. It is a terrible cycle: Cops do bad, society hates them, cops hate society because they are hated by society and the cycle gets worse. But cops have the power. If they didn't cover things up so much, or try and dismiss thing, or make excuses, society wouldn't hate them as much. Be more transparent and things might change. You hear about it here and there, but it needs to be every time...zero tolerance. Like that officer who hung is dog and then was allowed back on the force...wtf is that all about. These extreme cases make it so much worse for cops nationwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we could stop generalizing, but in reality that isn't going to happen. The cops are the ones who have actual power, IMO it starts with them.

       you make an incredibly valid point. I'm just trying to defend the cops that do put an honest effort in keeping their community safe. I saw a comment from a guy talking about revenge and crap like that, and I don't think blind rage belongs on this subreddit, which a lot of comments I see harbor. In these conspiracy theories, we need to ensure that the right people get blamed. When you look at everything you just said, one could easily make an allusion towards racism.

       I get you. Its terrible, because I do know good cops, who wouldn't hurt a fly, and they don't deserve the stigma at all. And it is so frustrating. I mean, my dad has saved lives before, and yet he has also told stories of things not so kosher that he has done and he has watched other do. It is hard for me to balance it all, so I can imagine how easy it is for others to lump them all together. And the good cops really don't have a lot of people defending them. Yeah, the brotherhood protects its own, but usually it does so when needed (meaning that person has already done bad), but the good ones who don't need it get ignored. To sum up, it is
       <strong>
        frustrating

       for sure lol.

       The problem in our society, especially when it comes to law enforcement (not to mention federal agencies) is that the system of checks and balances has been corrupted.  You don't need every cop "in on it."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a cultural thing, and in most instances a generational thing.  Good cops are lumped into the mix because most only honor their oath on the clock.  They won't challenge the system too much for fear of losing their lively hood, and tainting their reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most good cops know the system is corrupt and have seen or heard stories of retaliation.  Fear, apathy, and general laziness are the real enemies of good cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing nothing is part of the problem.  These good men took oaths to protect and defend the Constitution (rights of the people) from all enemies, including their own.  They pledged their lives, fortune, and sacred honor.  These people stand on the front lines in guard against tyranny.

       I would probably give some of that credit to groups like Oath Keepers and the like.  Real patriots are starting to make a stand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still contend that they have failed, due to the recent headlines like kill lists, drone assassination of American citizens, and talk of gun bans.  We might yet snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, but nothing less than radical/revolutionary change will accomplish this.  Violence is not the answer.  Simply standing up and speaking out should do it, but uniting enough good cops to stand against their brothers sounds like herding cats.
      </p>

       Lets use this time to promote Oathkeepers.org to as many officers as possible.

       See, this is what I'm talking about. Good rational discussion with a good compromise. If only the senate could wrapped their damn heads around that idea. I can guarantee you I'd help in that revolution. This summer I'm going to Norwich military academy for college on an cyber security and information assurance degree. I'm not saying I'm going to hack the government or anything, but if things go south in the next couple years, I'll at least have the physical skills from marine training, and technical skills from my degree.

       You can blame the minority for something the majority does on a regular basis.

       I know not all cops are bad, but I think the bad cops are running the show. So when cops like Chris Dorner try to speak up, they get shot down from the top. It's a very complicated subject because how are you able to change the top when they are the ones with power? I don't know, but talking about the massive corruption is better then sweeping it under the rug which CNN has been doing since this started.
