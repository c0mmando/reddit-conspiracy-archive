       I've read a lot of people who, understandably, are considering that Dorner has been framed for killing innocent people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just read the Manifesto's; he makes it very clear that he was going to kill Quan's family, and why. Page 10, in the middle, if you're reading the police.pdf
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, there are two Manifestos out there, and the mass media keeps acting like the insane one is real.  I doubt it!
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, then the shorter one is the conspiracy, to make him look more sane. But that version still contains his desire to kill innocents, and the part about how he should have killed other officers in a police van early on. If that was the conspiracy, those parts would have been edited out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does seem logical that they'd have to immediately paint him as crazy as possible, and the police sent out the crazy version to the media, who are following along like lap dogs. I wonder if they'll ever wonder why they were fed misinformation?

       I would like to point out that the whole Boat Theft incident seems fishy:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The 81-year-old boat owner reported being accosted and tied up by a burly man dressed in black who threatened him with a gun and said he wanted the boat to flee to Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       But while the assailant was trying to start the boat, a rope became fouled in the propeller and the boat was inoperable, authorities said.
      </p>
      <p>
       The suspect took the boat owner's cell phone and fled the scene and the boat owner was unharmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       About 2 a.m., a citizen reported finding property belonging to Dorner on a street near Lindbergh Field, not far from the scene of the attempted boat theft. The property included a briefcase and Dorner's LAPD badge."

       sigh, I've been over this one a hundred times. The passport of one of the terrorists was found in the debris of the plane crash before the towers collapsed. If you look at pictures there was lots of flammable debris from the plane crash, including paper, pieces of people, seat cushions, etc. A passport laying in the street with an arabic name would stand out.

       Makes sense if you think about it. Where were the terrorists located? In the front of the plane. The fuel is stored in the wings. The plane was moving at 500+ mph and the cockpit never passed through the fireball because it was always ahead of it. So the force of the explosion pushed the contents through the building and onto the streets.

        For example, this man found Flight 11 itinerary: "On the street, standing in a shower of office paper and the siding from the building, he found a piece of paper. It was an airliner's itinerary, listing information about a flight from Boston to Los Angeles."

       A plane just flew into the building next to him and this guy happens to find the time to scrummage through documents for some reason and hits the jackpot.
Anyway find me some surveillance footage of the terrorists in the airport on the day of the attacks and i"ll cut you some slack.

       This isn't a plane crash in the middle of a field. This is a plane crash around 200,000 people in downtown manhattan. Thousands of people walked through/by the debris. A passport looks very distinctive.

       There were no cameras at Logan airport. (origin of Flight 11 and 175) Flight 93 came from Newark airport which also had no cameras. This is largely irrelevant because there is a very clear paper trail and at no time did the hijackers attempt to conceal their identity.

       Yes everyone knew it was going to collapse because they rigged the fucking thing. All these firefighters are saying is that they were told to get out of there from higher command. But provided you can debunk all physical aspects of 9/11. There are far to many coincidences surrounding the event. You and me both know what those are. War game exercises, Cheney running the country, Rumsfeld announcing 2.3 trillion missing a day before 9/11, dancing Israeli's, terrible pilots hitting 75% of there targets, a terrible pilot pulling off an extremely difficult maneuver in order to hit the pentagon, while his instructor said he was a terrible pilot and could hardly fly a small plane, MARVIN BUSH and his security on both WTC and airports, project for a new American century, the patriot act etc. This and realizing that the people in power will do whatever it takes throughout history to consolidate that power makes me very suspicious. But I guess we will never agree on what really happened, glad to have this debate, cheers.

       Rumsfeld talked about the 2.3 trillion over the course of several years before and after 9/11. It it three times the entire defense budget. It is nothing but government waste accumulated across several presidencies. It isn't like the cash disappeared overnight.

       You don't have to be a great pilot to steer an airliner. Amateurs fly planes in simulators all the time with no effort. Airplanes are designed to be easily flown.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't a difficult maneuver, planes have high tolerance for maneuvers like that. Pilots don't typically bank that hard to avoid disturbing passengers, but it is completely within the planes capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       An amateur with the same experience as hani hanjour replicated the maneuver and the crash 3/3 times in a simulator.

       So anytime you'd like to go in depth in any one of these topics I'm game.

       From Wikipedia:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The exercise involves all NORAD command levels.[5] Out of a range of scenarios being run on September 11, 2001, one was a "traditional" simulated hijacking.[6] According to General Eberhart, after the first attack,
        <strong>
         "it took about 30 seconds" to make the adjustment to the real-world situation.
        </strong>

       Are you arguing that it delayed response by 30 seconds? If so, I'm willing to concede that point. But you also need to consider this next sentence:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Because of an increased number of staff, the exercise would prove to be an enabler of rapid military response for NORAD and its NEADS component, as senior officials who were manning NORAD command centers throughout the U.S. were available to make rapid decisions.[8]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also if you check the source of the "traditional simulated hijacking" it says no such thing was to occur that day in the source. A traditional hijacking was a part of the range of exercises, it was not scheduled until later in the year. Not to mention the commander, Major Kevin Nasypany, who designed the exercise was present and knew which were exercises.

       Not true at all. Please provide a source for this claim so I know specifically which engine you are talking about. I could happily provide proof for every plane, but I'd rather just concentrate on the one you think has a different engine.

       I wonder about the possibility he had some relation to the captain's daughter, and had her help with arranging a safe house. It would explain how he got into the parking garage, and keep him concealed during preparation and execution of the plan. I definitely think he's in LA now.

       I think you're 100% right.  This was my very first reaction when I heard they found his truck.  My second thought was these fucking idiots aren't going to find him any where near his truck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly some times I feel like we are watching a God damn movie here.  I mean did anyone really expect that they'd find him hiding in some one's vacation home?
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I read about this guy, the more respect I have for him.  I have to say I don't condone any of his past and future violent acts.  Reading his "manifesto" really made me believe that we weren't dealing with some psycho that had a break with reality, which was my knee jerk reaction to the whole thing at first.  How could you not feel that way with all that's gone down in the past year?

       One thing is for sure, the U.S. AG needs to investigate the LAPD.  Not just Dorner's claims, he wasn't the only black man on the force.  I'm sure there are plenty of other minorities on the LAPD that have similar grievances.  For my money Dorner was the only one crazy enough to challenge the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm living in Denver at the moment, a city which I find to be quite pleasant.  Sure there are some rough spots, but nothing like L.A., Chicago, or Detroit.  The Denver PD just settled a suit against them for beating a handcuffed 16 year old kid. They kicked his ass so bad they caused damage to his kidneys. At least they fired the fucker, there have been cases where they haven't though...

       It's a shame that Dorner has gone down the road that he has.  He struck me as a man that had honor, integrity, and a sense of justice.  It's too bad he chose to throw it all away.

       Are you his psychologist?  Dorner doesn't strike me as a sociopath in the least, but that doesn't mean a thing because one can not simply discern psychopaths from an 11 page manifesto and a shooting spree.

       More than a psychopath he sounds like a guy who has completely lost his shit.  A few better examples that come to mind are Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Henry Kissenger, LBJ.  These to me are the typical cold, calculating individuals who have a total disregard for anyone other than themselves.

       It's a shame he chose this route. He didn't exhaust all available options to clear his name. His path now isn't something any one should ever think is okay.

       I live in San Diego and I've also been to that yacht club on numerous occasions. First off, Lindbergh Field isn't that close to the club. Probably ten minutes driving, at least an hour on foot. Secondly, the South Western Yacht Club is in an extremely odd place. It is only accessible by driving through residential neighborhoods. You'd never find it if you weren't actually looking for it. Also, it is probably one of only two yacht clubs in all of San Diego that doesn't have a gate blocking access to the docks. I'm not sure what that really adds to the discussion, just some interesting points.

       Word on the street is that he posted this shit on Facebook 2 days before the shooting.  I'm fairly certain I read this in one of the articles a few days after the Quan killings.  I just can't remember where.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always heard that the FBI monitors Facebook for terrorism related messages and school bombing/shooting type shit.  I wish I could recall what I'd read about a foiled school terrorism plot, supposedly one was stopped by the FBI after they learned of a Facebook threat.  Then again this could have been a tip from a citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew a Muslim guy that claimed he was raided by the FBI for starting a vague count down on Facebook.  He claims a girl that he'd hooked up with and stopped calling, had called the FBI on him.  I've got no proof on this whole deal, but it seemed legit.  If you think of the way terrorists are portrayed by Hollywood this guy would be a dead ringer.  He had the crazy ass beard, dark complexion, and a some what unfriendly demeanor.

       They do monitor social media. The problem for them is that no matter how many people they have, even the Indian firms Facebook uses for monitoring- it's just a drop in the bucket. Using word filters to pick up on terms isn't that effective because EVERYONE uses them in one way or another. The FBI, or any other alphabet soup firm has to single someone out to watch and build a case on. And if they are under budget or political pressure- they will fabricate a problem to fix to show to their bosses that they deserve a bigger budget, or their appointed boss deserves a promotion. Federal agencies are extremely competitive and cutthroat regarding each other.

       I've read the supposed manifesto, I take issue with this term.  This is classic media manipulation at it's finest.  Let's play a quick game of word association, I say manifesto and what is the first thing to pop into your mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is the unabomber or any variation of crazy/psycho.  They want you to associate this man with a mad man.  My take on what I read wasn't that I was reading the ramblings of a mad man at least in the sense of one loosing touch with reality.  I can't say I condone this man's actions at all.  Personally I wish he chose to bring his grievances to the public's attention in another manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously this is where the conspiracies come into play.  I call bull shit on the framing of him for the Quan killings, I'm sure he did it.  If they wanted to frame him they wouldn't have shot up some ladies delivering news papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The craziest thing about the media and the whole shooting is that I don't see anyone in the media trying to take the LAPD to task for the shooting.  The way I see it the LAPD issued a standing order of shoot to kill for Dorner.  This is probably the most troubling aspect of this whole cluster fuck.  Since when has it been okay for a police department to go out and execute suspects on site?  This isn't the 1800s, I hope this incident alone brings down the house over at the LAPD.

       They want him dead, in my opinion, because of all the interesting things he would say if he were tried in court. Things LAPD don't want the public to hear. That tells me that Dorner has serious dirt on them. If he did the murders he should go down for it.

       The media's run by Jews; Jews want a police state, they want to take our guns away so we can't defend ourselves. The Jew World Order is at hand. All easily verifiable if you spend an hour looking. Jews are the real culprits.

       You ever think that both manifestos were fake maybe. The system is aware that people online will be questioning things so they put one out as the "real" one and have one in the media floating around. Not saying its true but you have to wonder because they are fully aware of these social media sites will be expressing their opinions and dissecting what we are being fed through the media

       I'm just going with Occam's Razor, and assuming that one is real. It makes sense that he'd leave one.

       If they were both fake, and the couple killed as a cover story; it just feels too far fetched. The most likely truth feels right, and there's good evidence for it.

       I don't like your reasoning.  It's not conspiracy theorist type thinking, it's shill type acceptance.  Religion.  Faith.  Bullshit even.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not none?  There could have been a whistleblower letter that was turned into what we see.  It would make for an easy set up and solve a big problem - maybe cover up some other crimes with it and take the new police state for a test-drive.

       No; it's that one is a real stretch of the imagination, while the other makes a lot of sense to me. I'm still staying open minded to all possibilities in this discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I believe really isn't a shill theory; I'm claiming that the LAPD might be actively conspiring to make their enemy look worse than he already does. And if they get caught in it, they'll look even worse!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, there might just be an original manifesto, and some stuff he really wanted to add in later, in a mad rush. Or it could all be faked to frame him. I think the first two theories are more likely than the third, but I'd love to see evidence!

       I'm willing to put an hour worth of work here. How does one normally get these questions raised to a high enough scale to make some noise.. i.e. The LAPD press conference with Chief Beck, the reporters got to ask questions - mine would have been "Chief Beck, it seems obvious this is a shoot first, ask questions later operation. Don't you think that gives your suspect's so-called internet ramblings some merit?" Also, here's my obligatory I don't agree with Dorner's methods (murder) but like his message. (Can we stop saying this now?) So what can I do? Write a letter? Make a YouTube video? Create a ironic graphic design in Photoshop that will get attention?

       I'm saying that a lot of people are considering that he might not have killed Quan's kid. He very likely did.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I don't think he released the crazy rambly version of his manifesto. Perhaps it was edited to make him looked totally nuts, to discredit him and avert any chance he'd start a movement. There's the conspiracy.

       He wasn't his lawyer, I want to say it was his advocate whom was also a police officer.  He is a retired LT or CPT I think. Part of his whole deal is that the brass in the LAPD lets all this shit go down.

       Word on the street is that he posted this shit on Facebook 2 days before the shooting.  I'm fairly certain I read this in one of the articles a few days after the Quan killings.  I just can't remember where.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always heard that the FBI monitors Facebook for terrorism related messages and school bombing/shooting type shit.  I wish I could recall what I'd read about a foiled school terrorism plot, supposedly one was stopped by the FBI after they learned of a Facebook threat.  Then again this could have been a tip from a citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew a Muslim guy that claimed he was raided by the FBI for starting a vague count down on Facebook.  He claims a girl that he'd hooked up with and stopped calling, had called the FBI on him.  I've got no proof on this whole deal, but it seemed legit.  If you think of the way terrorists are portrayed by Hollywood this guy would be a dead ringer.  He had the crazy ass beard, dark complexion, and a some what unfriendly demeanor.

       No; it's that one is a real stretch of the imagination, while the other makes a lot of sense to me. I'm still staying open minded to all possibilities in this discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I believe really isn't a shill theory; I'm claiming that the LAPD might be actively conspiring to make their enemy look worse than he already does. And if they get caught in it, they'll look even worse!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, there might just be an original manifesto, and some stuff he really wanted to add in later, in a mad rush. Or it could all be faked to frame him. I think the first two theories are more likely than the third, but I'd love to see evidence!
