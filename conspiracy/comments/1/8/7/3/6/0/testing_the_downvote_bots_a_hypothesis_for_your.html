       There has been a lot of reports on reddit of the mass manipulation of posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's test this theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       We meet and decide a time frame and a set of 'pre-approved' links and topics to conduct this experiment. Mods then, for given time duration, can remove the downvote option via CSS and the majority of 'human' users will not be able to to see and use the downvote button.  BUT the command to downvote as performed by a bot would still be capable. For that test period we post the pre approved topics on numerous subjects and see what gets hammered with downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this a potential way to prove manipulation of content in this subreddit?

       It became a cesspool of power users who gamed the front page by voting on each other's stories. Nothing inherently wrong with this, if the power users were decent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the content eventually dropped significantly and it was quite obvious that the system was gamed for money. Power users could earn a nice profit if they could get a story onto the front page and go popular. Then retard Kevin Rose decided to re-do the whole system and make it so that any news outlet (HuffPo, CNN, FOX, etc) can have their own profile. This meant the only popular stories were official "credible" news sources, and regular bloggers had almost 0 chance of getting any visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's been sold to some shit-for-brains company and it is probably never coming back anywhere near its former glory. Please take note that Reddit isn't "going the way of Digg" - it is already there in my opinion. It's just more difficult to tell because Reddit has a significantly larger userbase with more categories(subreddits) than Digg ever had.

       This, a thousand times. The "Bury Brigade" that constituted a majority of Digg's power users were known employees of extreme political groups, or members of these groups themselves. They gamed Digg so hard that a regular user submission had 0 hope of ever reaching the front page. Many bloggers discuss the migration and dissemination of the Bury Brigade as Reddit rose to power. They are here, in our ranks, without a doubt.

       Even without those, you can always press "A" or "Z" to downvote anyway.

       That is probably the best way to script the BOT. I remember writing "apps" to manipulate AOL using SendKeys BS back in the 90's. R.E.S. and Alien Blue users would most likely be real people. A bot would probably only use the A or Z key. Not that real people wouldn't wise up and start pressing those if the Downvote disappeared. I guess there is still a flaw in that experiment because we can't say who is pressing those keys. However we can do a comparison, and use some advanced statistics to determine the difference between real people with no desire to downvote using extraordinary means, vs a potential bot or corporate vote injection...

       I've long advocated for more transparency in the Reddit voting system.  If there were a way to audit who was doing the voting, maybe even down to the IP, it would be easier to spot patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember what happened when the wikipedia contributors' IP's were leaked, gaming became clear (although wikipedia IMHO still is a shameless propaganda mouthpiece for anything of concern to the intelligence agencies and powers that be).
      </p>
      <p>
       It probably is also the case that Reddit is gamed from the inside too.  Who could resist responding to the bribery or extortion potential that serving up or suppressing news to millions of eyeballs entails?  And if they don't sell out, you just suicide them.

       Im curious as how all this works. I guess I could just start examining, but things like RES and mobile apps are just getting the http and applying their own styles on it? The problem is the reddit site sends the "downvote" tag in the HTML and it's only the mods style override that calls it hidden. Therefore anyone using a custom theme, wont follow that CSS attribute.

       I'm glad I have Uneditreddit installed to see through such blatant dishonesty as this.

       's original comment before he completely changed it, here it is in its entirety:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prove it? It's very apparent to all. Why prove it when you can counter it?
       </p>
       <p>
        When a post of mine gets downvote brigaded, I can simply edit the response to give the opposite impression. e.g.
       </p>
       <p>
        'Dorner manifesto is fake' = -20 karma
       </p>
       <p>
        change to
       </p>
       <p>
        'Dorner manifesto is real. CNN is telling the truth.' = -20karma
       </p>
       <p>
        Another way to counter them is to edit your replies to change the meaning of exchanges where you are getting badgered.
       </p>
       <p>
        You'll get drawn into a stupid exchange and every reply you defend yourself with gets downvoted until you have negative karma. I've read threads talking about the strategy on r/conspiratard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fortunately for some reason shills don't want to (or are not allowed to without some pain) edit their replies, which allows some real creativity in reshaping the conversation and making them look like even bigger idiots.

       this is what r/conspiratard trolls do as a rule.   either way the conversation is being manipulated and downvoting affects my credibility and ability to post responses.

       It became a cesspool of power users who gamed the front page by voting on each other's stories. Nothing inherently wrong with this, if the power users were decent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the content eventually dropped significantly and it was quite obvious that the system was gamed for money. Power users could earn a nice profit if they could get a story onto the front page and go popular. Then retard Kevin Rose decided to re-do the whole system and make it so that any news outlet (HuffPo, CNN, FOX, etc) can have their own profile. This meant the only popular stories were official "credible" news sources, and regular bloggers had almost 0 chance of getting any visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's been sold to some shit-for-brains company and it is probably never coming back anywhere near its former glory. Please take note that Reddit isn't "going the way of Digg" - it is already there in my opinion. It's just more difficult to tell because Reddit has a significantly larger userbase with more categories(subreddits) than Digg ever had.
