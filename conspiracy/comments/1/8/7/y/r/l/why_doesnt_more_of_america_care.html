        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Phillip Marshall, a conspiracy theorist who wrote a book attempting to implicate the Bush administration in the 911 attacks, was found shot to death in his home, and the police are calling it a murder suicide. </p>

<p>Aaron Shwartz, cofounder of Reddit and an Internet activist highly critical of the US government, was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment. Shortly before his death, a massive amount of capital and support was being collected to aid him in a grass-roots anti-establishment political campaign.  <del>Despite the police ruling his death as a suicide, no suicide note was found and he displayed no signs of depression.</del> Edit: Shwartz was depressed according to his blog.</p>

<p>Bradley Manning, a US Army soldier, released classified material concerning Guantanamo Bay and unconventional Iraq/Afghan airstrikes to wikileaks, a disclosure portal created in 2006 for anonymous whistleblowers to get information to the public. He has been detained for 3 years now. </p>

<p>Chris Kyle, a US Navy SEAL credited with the most combat Sniper kills in american history and author of the book American Sniper, was killed by a man he was attempting to help cope with PTSD. He had also been training Teachers and businessmen in safe firearm use, something he was asked continuously by his former military connections to stop doing.</p>

<p>Keith Ratliff, a member of the YouTube team FPSRussia which educated viewers on the characteristics and use of different military weapons, was killed early December. He was found shot in his apartment surrounded by every weapon he owned, none of which had been recently fired or were missing. There was no sign of a struggle. </p>

<p>John Noveske, one of the most celebrated battle rifle manufacturers in America, died in a mysterious car accident. He had recently begun a Facebook campaign questioning the Sandy Hook shootings illegitimate tie to psychiatric drugs, asking &quot;What drug was Adam Peter Lanza on?&quot;, as well as questioning its timing in the center of a gun control debate. </p>

<p>The DHS has in the last year purchased and stockpiled <del>1.6 billion bullets.</del> At the rate of 5.5 million rounds being used per month in our current military conflicts, this is enough ammunition to fuel a 24 year Iraq war. Edit: It seems that the 1.6 billion number is off (i would appreciate anybody finding an exact number), however a focus still remains on the millions of recently purchased hollow point rounds which are not used in training (SOCOM at least) and are prohibited in international warfare. </p>

<p>Obama has now charged seven people with violating the Espionage act, a WW1 era act meant to deter German saboteurs only used 3 timed before by all previous presidents. The seven charged are American&#39;s accused of whistleblowing or criticizing the government. </p>

<p>The department of justice claimed a memorandum earlier this week outlining their constitutional right to use Drone attacks on US citizens in the name of the war on terror. Furthermore, they announced that under this statue they do not need any sort of actionable intelligence confirming that they pose a threat. </p>

<p>John Brennan, a counterterrorism expert often hailed as the architect of the US drone program, has been nominated as the next director of the CIA. His drone program has claimed the lives of 535 civilians living in middle eastern conflict zones, including over 60 children. A direct violation of international law that has continuously been dismissed and ignored by the United Nations Human Rights Council. </p>

<p>Representative Alcee Hastings, a democrat from Florida, has reintroduced his FEMA camp bill. The federal emergency management agency (FEMA) was created to help domestically handle natural disasters. The newly proposed bill would authorize no fewer than 6 military installations across the country to be run by FEMA under the direction of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The current bill is using vague language to give the Secretary of Homeland Security carte blanche power to use these facilities in any way necessary to ensure the security of our country. Similar facilities were setup by Franklin D Roosevelt under a similarly worded executive order during WW2 to detain large numbers of Japanese civilians. </p>

<p>Okay so I&#39;m writing all of this to show a very subtle shift occurring in our country. Our economy still sucks, over 50% of our citizens for the first time in recent history believe the government is more of a threat than a shield, Obama has drastically increased defense spending, and in the last 5 days there have been 3 <del>murders</del> civilians innocently shot by California police looking for Christopher Dorner that have all gone unpunished. I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re diving head first into a dictatorship, but a police state is not far away at the rate were going. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This revelation is also brought on thanks to mobile cameras, uploading, the internet in general. This is why they keep trying to push legislation to control the internet. It starts with file sharing, then onto social media monitoring, traffic monitoring, and it keeps getting more intensive. They can access your webcam, they can access your mic, they can track you. </p>

<p>If they are successful in clamping down on the internet, then we will be truly lost, and our only saving grace would be a revolution. Or aliens. hopefully peaceful aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to disagree with you, but let&#39;s examine the sense of this idea that people owning a few assault weapons could topple a first world country. Unlike the Arab Spring, a revolution in America would be disastrous for <em>us</em> for a couple reasons. 1: Media spin would most likely demonize the militia groups as gangs or terrorists (of course), and could potentially turn the public against you (I mean, we all know they would rather believe the news, than their guts right?) 2: And this is the most obvious one, any well equipped militia/group would be massively out gunned by the Military, Air force, National Guard, and possibly the SWAT teams too since they keep getting better equipment every year not to mention the drones they would probably have watching you before you even call a first meeting. </p>

<p>So no, owning a gun is not the going to be our saving grace if/when we get in that scenario. If anything, it&#39;s reaching into peoples minds to change the way they think and what they value. If you don&#39;t care about how much money you make, then you could say whatever you want about your job, the low pay, the hours, the lies, the lies in news stories, etc. THEN do what you have to to make it <em>better</em>. Convincing people that what we have now is <strong>not</strong> okay, and fight the argument that I hear all too often that goes something like &quot;YOU SHOULD BE LUCKY YOU LIVE HERE! YOU JUST HAVE TO WORK HARD! THIS IS LAND OF OPPORTUNITY!&quot; Convincing people like that is the hard part...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ONE MAN(Dorner) has all of SoCal LE quaking with terror. All their swat teams, tanks, helicopters and guns, and one dude has them collectively shitting themselves. You say American revolutionaries would be massively outgunned. So were the Vietnam cong. So were the Iraqis. So are the Taliban. So were we, during the revolutionary war. A big war machine just means easier targets. Things are a lot more even than you think. The govt. knows that, which is why the USG. Is just as terrified of us as LAPD is of Dorner. More so, most likely.</p>

<p>Also, some in this thread point out that we talk a lot but no one knows what to do. I agree. My solution is personal responsibility. What I mean is, don&#39;t look to someone else to lead. BE THE LEADER. We look at Anonymous and think how cool it would be to hack..well, learn, dammit. We the people need to be physical warriors(hand to hand), cyber warriors, and, yes, gunslingers. Learn to hack. Learn to fight. Learn to shoot. This is what I&#39;m committing myself to.</p>

<p>We may yet avoid the need for physical conflict with our government. The course can be averted. But we need to be ready. No more being sheep. Head in the game. DHS bought millions of rounds of ammo for a reason. That reason is we the people. Will you go meekly into the night when the knock at the door comes?..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even? Noooooo, no no noo sir. A militia does not have a navy, a militia does not have an airforce, a militia does not have M1Abrahms tanks, or apcs, or helis, or anti-air or much anti-vehicle equipment. You mention the Viet Cong and Iraqis, and the Taliban. Viet Cong got weapons from the North Vietnamese army, Taliban got their weapons from...well, US, and the Iraqis got their weapons from <em>supposedly</em> Iran or another neighboring country. I don&#39;t know why people bring up the American Revolution as if things work EXACTLY the same as they did back then, which I don&#39;t need to tell you they don&#39;t. The musket was THE top fighting weapon back then, only difference was the way the colonists used it compared to the Brits. They did not track every weapon 24/7, and they did not have surveillance or drones like we do today. Even if you changed your tactics to guerrilla style, you would still be fighting veterans who have already fought in Iraq/Afghanistan, especially if they call in the private militarys that <em>consist of mostly veterans</em>. </p>

<p>I know everyone, I know it&#39;s uplifting to think of an armed revolution with your brothers and sisters, but we cannot go looking for a fight for some time before we <em>know</em> more people are on our side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Convincing people like that is the hard part...&quot;</p>

<p>Its okay.  Its easy to swallow BS when life is okay.  But as people realize the American Dream is a lie and their lives are falling apart, as they see people close to them get rounded up or screwed over, they will stop swallowing the BS the TV shovels up.  It will be replaced by a new paradigm, &quot;Keep your head down, or BS will hit your fan.&quot;</p>

<p>There are roughly 3 million active &amp; reserve US troops.  There are roughly 120 million US citizens who own guns and are capable of using them.  You&#39;re too much of a hippie to have bothered to learn basic military operations and merely allowed the TV to tell you that tanks beat rifles.  (The truth is that one tank, without supporting infantry, can be quite vulnerable to a squad of competent and properly armed soldiers.)  The USM can occupy Iraq and Afghanistan (barely), but it will never be able to occupy America (unless we accommodate them.) </p>

<p>The Powers That Be may see a reason to be wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on FEMA camps.  But I suspect its only for extenuating circumstances they&#39;re only privy to.  Our reality is that the corporations were thwarted from passing their SOPA legislation, because uncontrolled media (the Internet) was able to alarm enough consumers to intimidate legislators with their concerns.   One day this may not be enough.  Then you will want hundreds of millions of phenomenally stupid Americans to be armed with semi-automatic rifles and ammo.  TPTB would never risk major property loss fighting a civil insurgency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for criticizing my knowledge of military ops, but there are many factors you left out. </p>

<p>First one is: Most of these gun owners you mentioned, have never been in combat. <strong>EVER</strong>. (paintball doesn&#39;t count either) Second is: These people would be facing an army of soldiers AND private corp. mercenaries who have been through the grinder <em>probably</em> more than once and KNOW how to deal with insurgents. </p>

<p>That&#39;s great you took the time to learn basic military operations, maybe you can take on the military single handed. I have my doubts, but if you want to believe simply having more people with rifles will win a war, you sir are the one letting the TV get to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said gun owners would topple a first world country. Armed revolt is the next step after policing would shut down the internet. A cynical and dark outlook yes, but most likely possible.  I never said it would be a saving grace.

    <div class="md"><p>No offense but I feel like this is an ignorant statement. Just because you can hack doesnt make you intelligent, just because you can shoot doesnt make you strong. As a matter of fact brute strength has nothing to do with shooting, if only you knew what actually goes into shooting. A shooter can go off grid, and if there the outdoorsy type they can survive out in the wild. A hacker is typically stuck in his moms basement learning code or some bullshit. Plus if hackers are so smart why havent any of them actually done something like take over cnn or fox for 30 seconds. You wanna wake people up, send a message through their own media outlet!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your computer can protect you in more ways than you think, and you don&#39;t need to be a basement dweller to understand and take precautionary steps. Learning about TOR, or other anonymyzers, Ghostery, Disconnect, and other add ons to your browser can make anything you view discreet and confidential. I believe that what you view on the internet, what you say on the internet, can easily land your name, your address, your family on some government watch list. Odds are, they know you have the guns. So when they come in the night to drag you away, you won&#39;t see it coming, and they&#39;ll probably fire before you even have the chance to put your hands up. </p>

<p>The oppening scene of Robocop 3 comes to mind. In detroit, mega corporations have bought up entire ghettos and neighborhoods, &quot;relocating&quot; citizens with busses. Later on in the movie, you learn that those that went on the busses, those that were arrested, were killed. But just a few people need to stand up and start fighting, the few that have it in them, the few that are not afraid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly how do you think it will go down? </p>

<p>To me, we&#39;ve seen the mass arrests @ Occupy events nationwide. We are on the first few steps of a drone escalation, that given the worst progression (Dorner being executed, increased warrant-less surveillance, the data center being constructed in Utah) they will blanket our skies with remote controlled eyes and hair trigger missiles. While the drones are overhead, the network of cameras that any government agency can view is constantly increasing, facial recognition software is improving, behavior analysis software is beginning to make claims that it can determine if someone is a terrorist based off of body language (Bullshit if I ever heard it). Police nationwide will continue to brutalize, oppress and harass the general population, but we will see outbursts of violence and resistance. The media WILL brand those involved as terrorists, criminals, lunatics, whatever fringe and libel it can spill to discourage anyone from sympathizing. National Guard will be used to quell the more active protests that will crop up. Late night roundups of people involved and photographed at protests will occur, neighbors who are too curious will also be removed for &quot;their security&quot;. But eventually, the police, the military will have to pull back, isolate and blockade an entire town if they need to. They can siege with tanks, toxins, assassins, drones, anything at their disposal if it gets to that point. </p>

<p>Now that synopsis leaves out false flag events, or other attrocities that could occur and be blamed on protesters or people resentful of the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, several people asked me offline &quot;What ended up happening to Christopher Dorner?&quot; They assumed it was over because they could no longer find it anywhere as a top news story. And despite their curiosity, if it&#39;s not in the top news it must not be worth searching directly for.</p>

<p>I found it interesting because some of them get their news from completely different sources than the rest, so collectively they cover the MSM pretty well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Post-9/11 brought a dramatic ramping up of the evolution of a police state, almost as if in anticipation of some large federal power consolidation. Examples: The legalization of domestic mass surveillance, the normalization of torture, the right for the president to kill US citiziens, Homeland Security, the militarization of police, the coordination of the military and police, etc. etc. etc. In addition to increasing their power in concrete ways, the PSYOPS have increased as well. Hence the apathy and inability to consider what isn&#39;t confirmed by the mainstream.</p>

<p>Because we&#39;ve been conditioned <em>not</em> to.  We&#39;ve been spoiled and rendered stupid and impotent.  We&#39;ve been made deep, deep into sheep.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we don&#39;t care.  Even if we say we do, we really don&#39;t.</p>

<p>It&#39;s here.  Right here on the internet.  Right here on Reddit.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>We talk our shit - and sometimes it&#39;s really good and compelling &quot;shit&quot; - and then we turn off our computers and go back to sleep in our comfortable beds and wake up to go to work the next day.</p>

<p>The vast majority of us are nothing more than internet warriors.  We ain&#39;t doing shit.  We&#39;re just talking...Yappin&#39;.</p>

<p>We need to get our asses up, start banding together, and start forming citizen militias or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t miss his point, I started off saying I hated how right he was. I completely agree that awareness doesn&#39;t always equal action, however I think raising awareness is a necessary stepping stone on the way towards real action.</p>

<p>And while I do GET what you&#39;re saying about cancer, there&#39;s more to it than lending support to an idea. It&#39;s the active SPREAD of ideas, new ideas. The cancer ribbon is a perpetuation of an already existing idea, that there is no cure for cancer and one needs to be found. Raising mass awareness to the corruption, lies, greed, poisoning, and destruction of human mental capabilities/spirituality is WAY different. Knowledge is power, and buying the pink ribbon isn&#39;t a gain of knowledge or power in any way, it&#39;s symbolically or financially supporting those who claim to be searching for a cure for cancer... When in reality the money used to purchase that ribbon either goes directly to the person selling it, or it finds its way to those that make sure a cure is never found. In the long run purchasing the ribbon does absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>What&#39;s happening now, what we&#39;re taking about, is nothing like that.</p>

<p>In order to get people to take action we have to reverse the damage that&#39;s been done to the human mind. Without knowledge of what&#39;s going on people have no reason to stand up and act. Complacency and ignorance go hand in hand, and in a world where slaves are kept in cells that extend no further than thought, spreading knowledge that has the potential to break down that prison cell and free that person mentally IS a form of action.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s a necessary form of action. Acting doesn&#39;t always mean stomping the streets, firing a weapon or forcing legislation, sometimes it&#39;s as simple as telling someone something that gets them curious to learn more about what&#39;s really going on. And you&#39;ve got to figure, the speed at which people are waking themselves up is relatively young, sure people have been doing it for decades but... Not like this. Shit, the internet is still fairly young and it&#39;s one of, if not THE, main contributor to this movement, if you want to call it that. So we&#39;re in an early albeit important stage right now in eventually moving on to action. Why do you think such heavy emphasis is being placed on regulating/censoring the internet?</p>

<p>We&#39;re in a decades long info war, and the internet IS the frontline battle ground of information. </p>

<p>Look I&#39;m not saying that this particular post is going to be the spark that gets the revolution burning, but this isn&#39;t the only place I speak of what&#39;s going on. I tell family, friends, strangers, who ever will listen and then I encourage them to do the same... THAT&#39;S the form of action I&#39;m taking right now. And it&#39;s the same form of action thousands of people are also taking, and it&#39;s scaring the living shit out of those in power.</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t perform a surgery on someone without knowing how to do it first, right? Learning the proper procedure IS part of the surgery because without that knowledge you&#39;d probably end up killing the person on the operating table.</p>

<p>This is correct.  In other words.  There <em>is</em> indeed a validity in just SPREADING THE WORD, right?  There <em>is</em> indeed a validity in IDEAS - in the spreading of IDEAS.  That&#39;s very powerful too right?</p>

<p>What&#39;s stronger and more effective, after all?  The person that walks down the street shouting &quot;Wake up!  Wake up!&quot;, or the person who, in the comfort of their own room, doesn&#39;t march or demonstrate anywhere, but instead makes a video that causes people to go <strong>O_o</strong> and actually begin waking up?  Videos like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">this</a> one.  I&#39;ve come across many like it before, but last night when I saw/heard it, it definitely got the &quot;O_o&quot; reaction out of me in a manner that wasn&#39;t as much the case before.  That&#39;s powerful too.  Knowledge is power right? and those that spread knowledge itself - even if they don&#39;t arm themselves and form citizen militias or anything - ARE doing their part...Right?</p>

<p>It would seem so.</p>

<p>However, the problem is that there seems to be a VERY fine line between making videos like I linked and <em>justifiably</em> thinking that you&#39;re actually doing something to fight the system on one hand...and jumping on here on Reddit, saying &quot;Fuck the country!  The country sucks!  This society sucks!  It&#39;s all bullshit!&quot;, and then patting yourself on the back thinking that you&#39;ve &quot;made a difference&quot; and &quot;did your part&quot; because you griped on the internet before going back to playing your X-Box.</p>

<p>I think a lot of us are really doing the latter thinking that we&#39;re doing the former.</p>

<p>Somebody behind their computer saying &quot;Fuck America.&quot; (something which I myself say often) should <em>never</em> ever be confused with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-nXT8lSnPQ">THIS</a> dude right here.</p>

<p>Think about it.  I think going online and spreading the word is very important - yes - but if we were ALL willing to do things like that dude did (and more)...<em>THEN</em> we could say we&#39;re really doing something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that I&#39;m sitting here, not really doing anything but typing away on my computer, is also fucked up. But man it&#39;s a start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, sir.  It&#39;s a start indeed.  But you see...that&#39;s the thing.  We have to really watch ourselves and not be <em>too</em> proud that we&#39;ve at least accomplished making a &quot;start&quot; because if that&#39;s all we do, then we as a people will continue to loose as badly as we definitely are up to this point.  TPTB are <em>way</em> ahead of the game at this point because they&#39;re not just proud that they&#39;re at least &quot;starting&quot;.  They&#39;re doing and doing <em>big</em>.</p>

<p>It is indeed scary as fuck to say this, but perhaps we should be ready to up and form militias and arm ourselves and REALLY be ready to back up the nobel ideas we put forth about liberty and justice and what&#39;s right, and do it with physical demonstration and, if necessary (i.e. to show that we really ARE committed to the liberty we&#39;re demanding) actually physically FIGHT to maintain our rights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conversations like this weren&#39;t happening on the scale that they&#39;re happening on now, and they ARE growing, both on the internet and outside of it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, I just...really don&#39;t feel we&#39;re moving fast enough though.  I feel we are sheep that are getting our jimmies a little rustled and are starting to look up and baaah and bleat a little louder than usual is all...when in fact we should be fucking UP IN ARMS by now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the more our mouths are flapping the faster we can get people on board to actually DO something about the shit happening in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I certainly hope so...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pen is mightier than the sword and loose lips sink ships so</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An ounce of action is often worth a pound of theory, however.</p>

<p>Ultimately, thank you for your thoughts.  I think they&#39;re very valid, and I actually think you&#39;re RIGHT about a lot of what you&#39;re saying...</p>

<p>I just feel I want us to really start doing <em>more</em>.  I think the time is really nigh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much agree with every letter you typed up there. Not enough is being done, and too many people (myself shamefully included) like to bark a lot without <em>really</em> showing teeth, and I think that problem stems from the fact that... well... not a damn one of us knows exactly how many people out there are willing to stand and fight/protest/whatever, and the general assumption, at least from what I&#39;ve seen, is that there truly isn&#39;t enough of us yet to make any real physical progress.</p>

<p>Mentally I think we&#39;re progressing at an alarming rate. I feel as if I am anyway, I know friends and family who are doing the same, and have talked with countless individuals of all ages across the internet who also feel as if they&#39;re shifting.</p>

<p>But where does that get us if we&#39;re all stuck doing the same shit the sleeping masses are? =\</p>

<p>My honest belief is that most people (myself, again, shamefully included) are waiting for something big to happen, something to really rock the boat and shake people out of their slumber, before any serious action can be taken by the average citizen. There are still far too many people out there zombified by drugs of all kinds, television, and years of conditioning and semi-false education that I just find it hard to imagine that anything productive could be done outside of the simple spread of information while there are so many still plugged into, believing in, and dependent on our current system.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all good though. I&#39;m not afraid of what&#39;s coming, if anything truly is coming, and whatever happens, happens. From the looks of things, good or bad, the world is going to see some serious and amazing shit happen over the next couple of years and personally I&#39;m excited either way.</p>

<p>I just hope we don&#39;t go the way of whatever the eff lived on Mars before it turned to dust.</p>

<p>Yes.  This is 100% correct.  And <em>that</em>, I think, comes from lack of organization and lack of communication.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I agree.  Heck I&#39;ve often said and felt that I&#39;d be the first one out on the battle field if I felt I at least had a CHANCE to fight with others of the same/like mind.  I&#39;m not afraid to die.  I&#39;m not.  I just wouldn&#39;t want to do it FOR NOTHING.  I wouldn&#39;t want to step out there and fight, get shot down, and then shit stays <em>exactly</em> the same as it was before I stepped out there because...well, because no one really stepped out there with me and I was the only one out there.</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>But where does that get us if we&#39;re all stuck doing the same shit the sleeping masses are? =\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  I&#39;m stuck, I feel, in the stage of awareness <em>just</em> before &quot;actually <em>acting</em>&quot;.  I <em>have</em> acted, but I know I have not <em>really</em> done as much as I know I could, and feel I really haven&#39;t done enough or all that much in the way of <em>really</em> moving forward to help humanity out of the manipulative doldrums we&#39;ve been in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My honest belief is that most people (myself, again, shamefully included) are waiting for something big to happen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  You literally keep voicing the very thing I was just thinking about and was just about to type.  Yes.  I&#39;m at the point right now where I&#39;m literally waiting for that &quot;spark&quot;, you know?  When that &quot;spark&quot; hits, <em>then</em> I feel I&#39;ll move forward.</p>

<p>Part of me feels like a failure p.o.s. for thinking this, however, because part of me feels like I <em>know</em> that REAL spark may not actually happen...since I wouldn&#39;t doubt if a LOT of us are also sitting around just &quot;waiting&quot; for that supposed &quot;spark&quot; to happen.  Maybe it&#39;s just an excuse that keeps us from having too much cognitive dissonance as the entire fucking world blows up around us and we still sit here and do nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I know shit&#39;s fucked up, but I&#39;m not a sheep.  I&#39;m a <em>wolf</em>, baby!  The only reason I&#39;m sitting down right now is because I&#39;m waiting for that spark to happen!&quot;</p>

<p>No, motherfucker.  The only reason you&#39;re sitting down is because you&#39;re a <em>sheep</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how I feel about it oftentime anyway...how I feel about myself and others.</p>

He certainly may not be acting on it in the absolute best, most intelligent way possible, but I almost feel that if we <em>all</em> have at least a sufficient level of honor, sense of morality, ethics, etc, then we simply would NOT <em>at all</em> stand for the corruption we absolutely see in front of our faces every day.  He seems to be one that <em>did</em> see that corruption in front of his face, and instead of going <a href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/082/456/Okay.png">m&#39;kay</a> and not doing anything, he said <a href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/987/fyeah.jpg">bring it, bitches</a>.</p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t go on killing sprees - especially against <em>one another</em> - but I feel more of us should grow some &quot;Dorner balls&quot;, if you will.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>something to really rock the boat and shake people out of their slumber, before any serious action can be taken by the average citizen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that by the time that something THAT serious happens, then it will <em>absolutely</em> be too late and we&#39;ll be even <em>more</em> fucking enslaved than we are already.  Also...and hell, if we were waiting for the &quot;one big event&quot;....then what the FUCK was 911? or, more specifically, what the fuck is the understanding so many of us have already come to that 911 was 100 fucking percent a FALSE FLAG ATTACK?</p>

<p>911, Sandy Hook, Colorado, Sikh Temple...We say we keep waiting for the &quot;one&quot; event that will set things off...yet in reality, I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re not just using that as an excuse to cover our fucking cowardice; as an excuse to cover our own lack of willingness to get up and DO something...Cuz we definitely HAVE been shown quite a few examples of corruption sufficient to make us realize that we SHOULD get up and fight this shitty system.  That&#39;s for sure.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>God dammit you are so 100% right about that.  There&#39;s really not much I can say about that, because it&#39;s simply right and correct.  :/</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This really hits hard. You&#39;re right though... What kind of event ARE we waiting for? What kind of event am <em>I</em> waiting for? The NDAA should&#39;ve been enough, or the wild executive orders that Obama has been passing, or the troops sent illegally to Libya and possible Syria, or the 9/11/2012 attacks at the Libyan Embassy and the truth about what happened there, or the recent attack on the second amendment, or the drones, or the 17 TRILLION dollar national debt that we&#39;re all forced to pay back despite the fact that we had nothing to do with it. </p>

<p>The list could go on forever.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a lot of ideas on how to change the minds of many people but it would take a hell of a lot more time, effort and man power than I alone could ever hope to muster, and it&#39;s scary to think that in this day and age a little civil disobedience can get you locked up... uh... forever...</p>

<p>Thanks NDAA.</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly frustrating having a harvest of knowledge that could effectively change the world and being paralyzed into not using it. I&#39;m not <em>afraid</em> of using the knowledge I&#39;ve gained, but I am kept in my place by the overwhelming question of... HOW do I use it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s upsetting, and paralyzing, and frustrating, and itchy, and smelly, and whenever I try to think of a way to do... something... I just find myself turning up the music and napping my worries away because of the sheer amount of effort it would take to dethrone those responsible for the way the earth is now. The thing is though, the effort WOULD be worth it, and I&#39;d gladly sacrifice my blood, sweat and tears to get this species back on its feet, mentally spiritually and physically, if only I had people to do it with that didn&#39;t exist merely as letters on my monitor.</p>

<p>I do have some good ideas, like ways to radically change the education system, and I believe I&#39;m smart enough to change the world for the better, but it takes more than just intelligence to truly shake things up and while I&#39;m here bitching about how bad things are I&#39;m still searching for what that &quot;more than&quot; is. So in the end I do nothing but sit back and watch it all happen because I simply don&#39;t know what to do, and those all too infrequent and brief moments of clarity where I do know WHAT to do, I fail to find way to do it... And so I remain stuck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No mother fucker. The only reason you&#39;re sitting down is because you&#39;re a *sheep *.</p>

<p>There may be more truth to that than I&#39;m willing to admit.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;m just going to sell off all my worldly goods and run away hoping that this will all sort itself out. Much less stressful and I&#39;d get to see the world.</p>

<p>Or I could just kill myself... (Kidding, kidding)</p>

<p>But seriously, if there&#39;s anyone out there willing to really stand up and do something about the world let&#39;s get our fucking move on, because I&#39;m tired of sitting in front of my computer watching youtube vids thinking it&#39;s doing the world any good.</p>

<p>What kind of event ARE we waiting for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think most of us are waiting for something REALLY overt like the kind of government-bombing-the-citizens stuff going on in some of the middle east countries, etc that we watch in the news and on the net.  &quot;War-torn mayhem&quot; kind of shit.  Anything short of that, and we Americans can still say &quot;Oh but we&#39;re not like <em>that!</em>  We&#39;re not like <em>them!</em>  Things are bad here, of course, but we don&#39;t need to get up in arms because at least we still have our FWEEDUMS!&quot;</p>

<p>It seems our technology and civilization here has given us a VERY false sense of comfort and importance - a sense that has all but castrated our vigilance and willingness to <em>fight</em> for our rights, even against our own government if need be.  We are a bull in an open field who <em>used</em> to be lean and mean and muscled and ready to gouge anything and anyone if threatened.  But then big brother came in playing a nice, sweet lullaby and filled us with all the food and sweets and candies and yams we could eat - all the while setting up a television in front of our face that rendered our brain incapable of forming really any complex thoughts.  Then BB built a fence around us that we were too busy eating and watching the television to notice about and care.</p>

<p>Now that we realize there IS a fence around us and that the fence is getting fortified and closing in on us even more...we&#39;re actually too fucking fat and stupid to actually DO anything about it.  We rise up with the anger and vehemence that we once had as the lean, mean, matador-gouging machine we used to be, and quickly fall to the ground, winded and realizing that we are now a fat, lazy pig; no longer a strong free bull in a green field, but now a lazy cow in a dirty slaughter house...waiting to get cut up.</p>

<p>...damn...I think I just depressed myself right there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What kind of event am I waiting for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re looking - <em>we&#39;re</em> looking - for the event that will give you at least a DECENT opportunity to either succeed at your endeavor, or make a <em>big</em> statement against TPTB that leads to change.  Right now, we know that if we act by ourselves and on our own, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a great chance that we by ourselves/alone will make much of anything happen.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not afraid of dying or martyrdom.  However, I don&#39;t necessarily want to get shot or imprisoned for life FOR NOTHING and have no one know about what I did, or care about it, and have my action effect <em>no one</em> and effect <em>no</em> change.</p>

<p>Fuck that.  THAT&#39;S not worth getting up in arms for.  I think most people feel this way.  While I don&#39;t think that just <em>anyone</em> is willing to lay their life on the line for the sake of fighting TPTB and I <em>am</em>, I know that I&#39;m definitely no different than my brothers and sisters in the sense that I don&#39;t want to go out and act/fight FOR NOTHING, you know?  I don&#39;t want what I do to be nothing but futile action.</p>

<p>Martyrs, after all, are at least KNOWN and influence people to ACT for a cause.  That I wouldn&#39;t mind being.  Not too many people are willing to be an obscure casualty for nothing but a doomed cause that doesn&#39;t help the bigger aim, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NDAA should&#39;ve been enough, or the wild executive orders that Obama has been passing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that it&#39;s just flying over most American&#39;s heads because these things are presently not really effecting us DIRECTLY like RIGHT NOW and in front of our face.  The NDAA is 100% real, but there&#39;s no gestapo American force knocking down our doors at the moment, so I think most people are going &quot;Meh.  It won&#39;t happen to me.  It&#39;s okay.&quot; kind of thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think shit hasn&#39;t really gotten REAL enough for a lot of us, like you intimated in your last post.  I think a lot of us &quot;know&quot; that &quot;such and such&quot; bill got passed, and that such a bill really does have some dire consequences, but - since we&#39;re not really seeing an obvious and direct, deleterious effect on our everyday lives - we&#39;ve become kind of hypnotized and tricked/fooled into thinking that everything&#39;s exactly as it&#39;s always been and there&#39;s nothing to worry about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or the 17 TRILLION dollar national debt that we&#39;re all forced to pay back despite the fact that we had nothing to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Most of our minds have been so darned conditioned to simply PAY TAXES - that taxes are just a &quot;normal part of life&quot;....to &quot;make the economy and the country better!&quot; - that most of us just blindly pay them...just fill in the blanks where we&#39;re supposed to fill them in, turn in the paperwork, and hope that we get some small return from the money that was stolen from us in the first place.</p>

<p>And the tune goes on and on...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The list could go on forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re definitely playing the same tune here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s scary to think that in this day and age a little civil disobedience can get you locked up... uh... forever...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I&#39;ll be honest and say that part of me actually <em>fantasizes</em> about finding myself in a cause that I feel strongly enough about to cause me to do something that is <em>right</em>, but STILL gets me &quot;locked up forever&quot; kind of thing.  I guess that goes along with my willingness to effect SOME sort of change even at the cost of my own life, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m obviously not SO crazy about the idea that I&#39;m willing to just do anything to get myself locked up though.  lol.  Of course not.  But, again, I wouldn&#39;t be afraid to act for the right thing/cause.</p>

<p>I think Bradley Manning is a true, TRUE hero.  Julian Assange isn&#39;t worthy of even carrying Bradley Manning&#39;s jockstrap in my estimation.</p>

<p>God dammit this is <em>exactly</em> how I feel.  I wish you lived in Los Angeles.  Talking in person through things with like-minded people often begins the ruminating of ideas sufficient to start up action that might have promise.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought about that very thing (minus the &quot;selling off the worldly goods part&quot;, as I don&#39;t have much)...possibly move to India and just walk around as an obscure nomad...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah used to think the public was ignorant, but in part thanks to sites like this many are well informed. The problem is we don&#39;t know what to do with that information. We get all ramped up and angry, argue about it and call it unjust, but then eventually forget and continue on with our day. The government knows this, they know many of their secrets are being revealed, but they also know that everyone will get riled up, and then not doing anything about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of us are, at best, revolutionaries of opportunity. That is, some of us <em>may</em> act if presented with low hanging fruit, some relatively accessible chance to do something. Not nearly enough of us are nearly angry enough, and if one stands in opposition, a thousand more sit on their hands. That&#39;s disheartening. Honestly, we&#39;re trapped. We buy into the whole stupid system, it gets its hooks into us and when we finally realize how evil and mindless the whole thing is, too often we&#39;re in too deep. We <em>like</em> our flatscreen TVs. We <em>like</em> staying out of jail. <em>We like to be comfortable</em>, and it sucks--comfort will be our undoing. Something needs to happen to make a lot of people <em>extremely</em> uncomfortable. It&#39;s good that the evil cunts who run our world are becoming more blatant about it--perhaps it will result in a tipping point where enough people decide the TV, the celebrity culture, the freedom to drive a big car and eat lots of fast food <em>don&#39;t matter anymore</em> because there are bigger things at stake. Hopefully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until someone bright points a way to stick it to The Man.  And then they&#39;re screwed.  The real lesson of winning wars is always avoid active warfare when you can.</p>

<p>Take for example, the Rodney King riots.  What The Man didn&#39;t properly figure out was that the populace had been boiling mad over the crap the LAPD had been pulling for a decade before Rodney King.  They never anticipated the hoi polloi would go batshit over a black man getting an extrajudicial beatdown for instigating a car chase.  The MSM likes to point out a lot of ugly shit the raging mobs perpetrated.  But it cost The Man a lot of money.  And cost Gates his job, eventually.</p>

<p>Either we have competent municipal and federal gov&#39;t, and they try to defuse unrest, or they keep papering it over, and <em>boom</em>, blowback.</p>

Your country is dead, your government are criminals. If you organize peaceful opposition they plot to murder you with snipers.

<p>I stood at the foot of his hospital bed, tubes coming in and out of him, and felt helpless. Not only was i no medical expert, but he wasn&#39;t even my family member. I wanted to pretend it wasn&#39;t happening because it wasn&#39;t my responsibility. But i didn&#39;t. I did the most i could think to do and started a Facebook campaign and a sonic fundraiser to raise money to support his family financially. I raised three thousand dollars for him. His care flight alone cost 10 thousand. The money i raised for him did nothing. </p>

<p>But i will never forget the look on his face when i first told him that 2 thousand of his classmates and neighbors had joined the cause and were donating, working, and praying in hopes that they could help him recover. </p>

<p>Never underestimate the impact of your actions, no matter how small or insignificant, on those who have all but given up hope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot we CAN do...</p>

<p>But...</p>

<p>Sadly...</p>

<p>No one does them, and it would take a fuckload of people acting simultaneously to actually make a dent. If everyone stopped paying debts, bills, quit their jobs, started learning what money REALLY was, joined in and started protests, educated family members, taught themselves how to be self sufficient, refused to pay taxes, turned off the TV, boycotted industries like mass media/fast food/walmarts/banks/collection agencies/major brands/shit like that than I think we&#39;d have a pretty good chance at winning the war waged against the human mind.</p>

<p>Sadly that&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p>Also, I think if someone or more likely lots of someones figured out how to &quot;hack&quot; the TV, strip the fucker of all those worthless shows, and broadcasted REAL educational material and truth as to how the world has been commandeered by psychopaths and money hungry war tyrants that would help immensely. Speaking from experience, when you try to tell people the opposite of what the heard on TV, you&#39;re crazy. If you tell them something surprising they haven&#39;t heard on TV, you&#39;re crazy. There&#39;s so much trust in the tube that I feel as if it could do real damage if used for good.</p>

<p>If mass media is used so effectively as a weapon against us than I see no reason that it couldn&#39;t be used equally effectively as a weapon FOR us.</p>

<p>I think, for a lot of people, being informed and genuinely intelligent is just too SCARY for them. Ignorance is a continuation of comfort and normalcy for people and when you unbalance their world view and daily routine, from what I&#39;ve seen, people become very threatened. </p>

<p>The truth is scary when you first break the surface but what people don&#39;t understand is the further you dig the closer you get to the real wealth this place has to offer, and it doesn&#39;t come in the form of money or gas or precious metals. There is some amazing information out there that could change the world forever IF ONLY PEOPLE BOTHERED TO LEARN IT, but most aren&#39;t willing to get their hands dirty and so they fear the shovel. For now. It&#39;s my belief and hope that it won&#39;t take much longer before we hit the 100th monkey and real, honest information spreads like wildfire.</p>

<p>And what&#39;s the proof that the sniper guy was asked to stop training people?</p>

<p>Not arguing any of this, I just like to keep us on the track of reason and logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate this. Based on simple logical argument, you do not need to prove something is true, only that it isn&#39;t true. As such, i have utilized that in saying he wasn&#39;t depressed, but you could easily use the same logical rule in saying that he was depressed because there is no evidence that he wasn&#39;t. So my question is this: was there any documented evidence that he was depressed beyond the fact that he was stressed by the legal implications he was facing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me MrChartruse, i meant no offense. </p>

<p>That being said, let me take the risk of potentially offending you a little more at 3 in the morning. No we don&#39;t live in a police state. If you knew had read more carefully, you would have saved yourself the hour it took you to write you poorly thought out response. I said: &quot;a police state is not far away at the rate we&#39;re going.&quot; Because i know you don&#39;t understand the difference between what i said and how you interpreted it, i will take more time out of my much needed sleep to spell it out for you. A police state is a state in which the government exercises rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic, and political life of the population. Our government does not currently exercise rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic, and political life of the population. That sort of behavior would cause a very dramatic reaction if exerted suddenly. But what if we allowed the government to take a little inch of our freedom every day? In 14 and a half years they would have taken a mile. We don&#39;t want them to take a mile MrChartruse. A mile means we do live in a police state. A mile means that us &quot;half-wits&quot; aren&#39;t all on r/conspiracy because r/conspiracy is illegal.  A mile means death or imprisonment for even up voting this post.</p>

<p>Do you know how ignorant you sound right now? I wish i could send you back 50 years, so that you could see that the &quot;paranoid delusional fuckwits&quot; who were discussing the injustice occurring in OUR country by OUR government were the same people who were fighting for respectable women&#39;s rights, fighting for the acceptance of homosexuals, and fighting for the suffrage of african americans. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you see that our efforts to question and raise awareness of current events ensure the freedom of generations to come in the same way our ancestors fought for the freedoms we enjoy today? </p>

<p>Just because &quot;we live in the best and most free period possible&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it is time to sit on our asses and give up the fight. And i promise you this MrChartruse, neither of us will live to see the day when nobody is being abused. When every man and woman alive is experiencing unthreatened life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p>

<p>Again, i apologize for any offense i have given, it is late and i am a little tired. I can get cranky. But i hope, at the very least, that you decide to stop considering the fight for human rights as won and done. Because the people of tomorrow could very well live in a police state or a peaceful one based on that decision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my analysis: it&#39;s not worth it to fight. Contrary to common sentiment, there is a much better way to win.</p>

<p>“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”- Buckminster Fuller</p>

<p>The globalists know very well that if they can keep us using &quot;conventional&quot; tactics (voting, arguing, using their broken system and power imbalances), that they will command an advantage.</p>

<p>Looking at the facts clearly shows the truth of the situation, but as long as the powers that be can <em>authoritatively</em> label us as rebels, radicals, renegades or some other form of &quot;outsider&quot;, we&#39;re not going to command any attention... so let&#39;s make <em>them</em> the outsiders.</p>

<p>I think the solution lies with seeing how production and consumption <em>really</em> interact. We&#39;re only slaves to the globalists as long as we <em>need</em> them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to see <em>Geitgeist the Movie</em>, <em>Geitgeist Addendum</em>, and <em>Geitgeist 3 Moving Forward</em>. All three are on Youtube for free, posted by the director. They are really good. The first shows how we came to be in this situation in the first place. The second touches more on what&#39;s been going on and possible solutions. The third focuses on what can be done and where we can go from here.</p>

<p>Jacque Fresco, the founder of the Venus Project, wrote for some of them.</p>

<p>I agree with you. To fight the old system we need to build a new one that makes it obsolete. The more people who get involved the better, because when we all work together there isn&#39;t anything we can&#39;t accomplish. And, we accomplish it peacefully, without violence, because that means stooping to their level. </p>

<p>What are the power-that-be going to do, kill us all because we choose to not live in slavery and servitude to a system that favors only the rich and the banks? They can&#39;t force us to accept their fiat debt based money. The way the system works now its a self-perpetuating system of debt. You can never pay off debt because doing so incurs even more debt. This is a very insidious form of slavery, because those trapped within it are unable to see their own chains.</p>

<p>Things will come a point to where the-powers-that-be will have to make the choice. Submit to the peaceful will of the people or try to crush us with military force. I think our men and women in the armed forces would rather throw down their guns and refuse to fire on those whom they swore to protect rather than obey the will of the minority oligarchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True words my friend.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the first two Zeitgeists, but neglected to see the third due to some core issues I see in TVP. It all really comes down to something you said in your post</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because when we all work together there isn&#39;t anything we can&#39;t accomplish. </p>

<p>And, we accomplish it peacefully, without violence, because that means stooping to their level. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to realize that there will always be a few who don&#39;t want to participate, that dont want to help the whole move forward or whatever. This isn&#39;t because they&#39;re mean or wrong, it&#39;s because they have different ideas of where &quot;the whole&quot; should be moving.</p>

<p>One of Jacque Fresco&#39;s tenets is the commonality of earth&#39;s resources. I&#39;m not sure what I think about this concept... I hate to sound alarmist, but it reminds me of the base premise of communism, everything belongs to everyone. I worry that in practice, what this means is all resources belong to a small ruling elite <em>on behalf</em> of everyone.</p>

<p>Believe in them throwing their guns down, but don&#39;t absolutely count on it. It&#39;s better to rely on reason than faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the other base tenants of TVP is no politicians. There is no small ruling elite in Jacque Fresco&#39;s vision of the future, because there is no central governing body. </p>

<p>I understand your concerns, so far in my study I haven&#39;t been able to see such a risk in his idea of the future. I&#39;m studying lots of material for a novel I&#39;m writing. Its a story about a man who was frozen using cryogenics, and is revived a future similar to Jacque Fresco&#39;s vision. He goes through culture shock, but the people of that era teach him the history of events that lead to the world changing so dramatically. Think &quot;<em>A Stranger in a Strange Land</em>&quot; only reversed.</p>

<p>I think it will also take more than a sociopolitical and economic paradigm shift to change the world. There will need to be a spiritual one as well, an understand that we are all One. That there is no separation, that what happens to one of us happens to all of us.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider myself Atheist. I don&#39;t believe in Christianity anymore. My core believes fall in line with the teachings of Abraham-Hicks, Neale Donald Walsch, Louis Hay, Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra, Bashar, and others. I don&#39;t see them as the absolute truth, but as guides to help me find my own Truth. Which is how it should be. Any other way and you start to slide down the slippery slope that leads to the formation of yet another religion. </p>

<p>Despite the police ruling his death as a suicide, no suicide note was found and he displayed no signs of depression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">http://www.aaronsw.com/</a>  If you followed his blog, you&#39;d know that he showed signs of depression for years, brought on by a relentless federal investigation.  This is why his family said the gov&#39;t killed him.  Not literally, but because the court case drove him to suicide.</p>

<p>Bradley Manning:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the DOJs pressure on Aaron Schwartz led to his suicide, but I think you implication that he died of more nefarious means at the government&#39;s hands is absurd.  The former might be called conspiratorial, but I highly doubt that there was a ringleader outside of the DOJ calling the shots.   I&#39;m with you on Bradley Manning, the Drone Program and the crackdown on Whistleblowers, and I think as the public learns more, that pressure will be properly applied -- we just have to keep being vocal until the public wakes up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the vast majority of people put their blinders on, watch the MSM, and tell themselves &quot;it&#39;ll be alright.&quot; They go to their jobs, make money, buy shit, and bury their head in their objects to distract themselves from what is happening.  The love of money is a very, VERY powerful thing, especially in a society in which the way others view you is based entirely off of your house, your car, your clothes, your jewelry, your flatscreen, your food, your cable package, etc.  So to the majority of people who are somewhat established and complacent in this country, its a scary thought after (most) of them clawed their way up there to risk having it all taken away and the slate wiped clean.  They&#39;d rather keep their place on the burning ship and pray the fire goes out before it torches all their clothes and belongings, than hop to a lifeboat and be on the same level as everyone else. It&#39;s sad really, because if the majority of them wait too long, there won&#39;t be any lifeboats for us to jump into, and then we have to get in the water with the sharks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that much wrong with you Americans. But now you sounds like all beta-males.</p>

<p>It is the Zionists and Israeli Jews that start to be nervous. They know that when the truth about their foul play become clear, and the extent, US will attack Israel and nuke every poor Jew there. </p>

<p>So they use all they skills and deception to cover up. They done it for ages and skillfully fooled you but since 911 the stakes raised sky high. They have neutralized you in many levels and layers so there is not without reason you feel low in esteem. Among things they use to  fool you are strange conspiracy myths. And many flourish here. But don&#39;t bite on that.</p>

<p>You have to soul search and question much of the so called American way. Not to mention the American dream. You have understand that that dream is a night mare by now? Huh? </p>

<p>But first you have to get rid of Israels control of your politics. Get rid of the traitors. Find out what Israel have done to you and let Israel face the consequences. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About 2.5 million people die every year in the United States, including about 40,000 suicides, 40,000 fatal car accidents and 15,000 murders.</p>

<p>Being an activist does not make you immortal. Everyone dies, and sometimes dead people were anti-government. This means literally nothing.</p>

<p>You could create such a list for <em>everything</em>. Dead circus clowns, tennis players, cheese factory workers, whatever, chances are you can find 6 examples of them dying. Would the latter be evidence for a secret government plot to take away our fondue?</p>

<p>And as far as society goes, nothing changes. They will act upon human nature and be jealous, greedy, disgraceful bastards.

<p>There&#39;s no sources for their bajillions of ammo claim but there is proof that the 21.6 million claim is not true.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the actual order, it&#39;s 240,000 rounds. If you start multiplying every number on the page together you get 21.6 million. Please don&#39;t multiply every number together.</p>

<p>To give credit where credit is due, i believe you are right about the inaccuracy of my ammunition numbers. However as far as the hollow point rounds are concerned, i did a little personal research. </p>

<p>Now before you blow up on me about sourcing or proof, please just acknowledge that i&#39;m not comfortable disclosing who this source is for his sake. A close friend of mine is finishing his SEAL training, he graduates in April and officially finished all of his training qualifications this past weekend. I just called him and asked about the use of hollow point rounds and according to him they never have, nor does he think they are allowed to, use hollow point rounds. They primarily use only full metal jacket rounds during live fire exercises.</p>

<p>Beyond that many incorrectly believe the use of hollow point rounds was prohibited by the geneva convention. In reality it has been prohibited in international warfare since the Hague Convention of 1899, in which they specified any bullet that easily expands or flattens in the body.</p>
