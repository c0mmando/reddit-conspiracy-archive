        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was thinking about conspiracy theories and I though... What if large corporations have formed a secret oligarchy where they manipulate the government with money and lobbyists? What if normal people like us are just herded like cattle and and we are taught enough in school to work for the industry and make them richer? Maybe that why it is so hard for small businesses to succeed these days.What if media is just an illusion created by the industry to make us people believe we are free but we truly aren&#39;t? And finally, if everyone begins to call conspiracy theorists crazy, wouldn&#39;t that prevent us from breaking out of the loop even if the conspiracy was true?</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s a reason for this, there&#39;s a reason education sucks, and it&#39;s the same reason it will never ever ever be fixed. It&#39;s never going to get any better. Don&#39;t look for it. Be happy with what you&#39;ve got, because the owners of this country don’t want that. I&#39;m talking about the real owners now... the real owners. The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.</p>

<p>Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls. They got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying. Lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I’ll tell you what they don’t want. &#39;They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. That’s against their interests. That’s right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fuckin’ years ago. They don’t want that.</p>

<p>You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your fuckin&#39; retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. And you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later &#39;cause they own this fuckin&#39; place. It’s a big club and you ain&#39;t in it. You and I are not in the big club.</p>

<p>By the way, it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted, folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good, honest, hard-working people: white collar, blue collar, it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good, honest, hard-working people continue — these are people of modest means — continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don’t give a fuck about them. They don’t give a fuck about you. They don’t give a fuck about you. They don’t care about you at all! At all! At all!</p>

<p>And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That’s what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes every day, because the owners of this country know the truth.</p>

<p>It’s called the American Dream, &#39;cause you have to be asleep to believe it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a teacher and I can verify this. </p>

<p>It is so hard to subvert the system. It is so hard to get beyond the obedience thing in my classroom. It is hard for me (for some reason) to not worry about obedience...however I will explain it like this: </p>

<p>I need to establish order in my classroom. However, I don&#39;t use it as a tool of oppression. I try to establish respect, but it is difficult. </p>

<p>I fucking hate rows, okay. I hate what they represent in our society. But I also know that if I make a big circle with my &quot;lower level&quot; kids everything will fall apart because they don&#39;t respect me, themselves or each other. </p>

<p>But I do it. I make a big circle (or used to have one every day), but then too much of my energy went in to maintaining order...</p>

<p>It sucks. I hate myself when I have kids sit in fucking rows. </p>

That was probably one of the best fucking summaries of today&#39;s society, I have ever read, just keep speaking the truth man. I&#39;m behind you, so are millions of others and millions of more who just haven&#39;t seen it yet. One day this shit is gonna come crashing down and these fucking slimy ass fucking scumbags will get their assholes fucking incinerated and that&#39;s when they&#39;ll realize the true magnitude of their fuckery, but it will be too late because there times driving fucking beamers and eating filet Mignon while they fucking rob the people of the earth blind will be at an end.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called power, they want power.  They want to bring back the old feudalism.  This is well documented over the course of the last century the big &quot;think tanks&quot; have laid out plans to set up Feudalism 2.0 under an oligarchical technocracy run by a scientific elite worldwide.  The UN <em>will be</em> the main government, operating under the guise of bringing &quot;world peace&quot; and &quot;environmentalism&quot;.  This is blatantly obvious if you do just a pinch of research into the subject.  Look into who started the UN, who funded it, who planned it out beforehand.  All people who wanted to set up a world government to be literal world dictators.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The leading theory is that they aren&#39;t human, or not completely. My friend and I agreed that the only explanation for such greed, such disregard for the world and their fellow human beings is that they simply aren&#39;t human. The spirit science series on youtube talks about a race of Martians that are what we might consider predominately left-brained. </p>

<p>There is enough evidence that Mars may have once been populated (magnetic surface only explainable by former magnetic field, evidence of water, etc) to give this though some credit. Evolving in a different environment will yield different end results, so again it&#39;s entirely plausible that this life form from Mars has a differently developed brain than ours. A brain that processes using more logic than emotion will no doubt have a desire for material wealth and ways to acquire it. Keeping themselves separate from their seemingly inferior cohabitants of this planet will be a big deal for them, and when you combine a superiority complex with reclusive tendencies you will no doubt grow to hate the population you believe is oppressing you. </p>

<p>And what do you get  when you combine a superiority complex, reclusive tendencies, and hate for everyone around you? A hunger for world domination. See &#39;Pinky and the Brain&#39; for details. </p>

<p>edit: The spirit science series also gives a reasonable explanation for why and how they came to Earth. With a population more focused on intelligence and know-how than art and beauty, it is also very plausible that they could have built spaceships to transport a portion of their population from Mars to Earth.</p>

This manipulated government has suppressed information, censored media, and even built mass public surveillance systems. This was the government originally built to serve the people, not enslave them. This is not the country that millions of brave soldiers died for.  Unfortunately, these are some of the problems that come with a representative democracy. As technology evolves so should the government as well as it&#39;s people. If we should fail to evolve, this great nation will fall apart as Roman Empire did 1500 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about the situation in the most general, basic terms. There are a few people who are insanely wealthy, who have so much wealth they literally cannot spend it or give it away fast enough. Then there are the vast majority who slave and struggle to find a job that pays barely more than a subsistance wage to buy the necessities of life. This is the situation in which we live, but does this situation even seem sane? That a few people should get billions of dollars for doing one thing or another, while the vast majority slave for minimum wage?</p>

<p>If you try to buck this system, you are killed. Think I&#39;m exaggerating? No, I&#39;m really not. If you defy the system, you involve yourself with the police and other law enforcement authorities, and if you continue to defy them, they will beat you to death or shoot you dead. That&#39;s the penalty for not going along with this insane system, and it&#39;s the main reason people go along with it.</p>

<p>Who would pay income tax, knowing politicians who are bought and paid for by special interests are going to waste your money on things you never would want it spent on? No one, right? It&#39;s the threat of them <em>killing you</em> that keeps you filling out those tax forms.</p>

<p>So how is this system really any different from the ancient feudal system, which had a noble in a castle with all the wealth, surrounded by a band of ruffian enforcers whose job it was to keep the peasants in line while they slaved for next to nothing to enrich the nobleman? I don&#39;t see any basic difference.</p>

<p>In America it used to be the case that a peasant had the possibility of moving up into the elite class on merit, by virtue of his enterprise or genius, but increasingly that is less the case. Those born into poverty are educated to be ignorant, and they stay in poverty.</p>
