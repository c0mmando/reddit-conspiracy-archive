       10 signs you’re about to be living under Tyranny:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The highest elected Official and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces does NOT have the highest security clearance. No other elected officials have oversight.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The names of bills and groups have the opposite of their meaning, such as the Patriot Act, Tea Party and Citizens United.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Due process is removed under the guise of safety and national security. The label of Terrorists removes all of your rights before conviction.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nearly every Senator is a Millionaire and to be elected, you would need to spend 10’s of millions for a job that pays $200K.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Federal Government hires private mercenaries.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Federal Government trumps States rights, which is why we have States in the first place, to prevent centralized power.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Citizens owing the IRS $2500 may be subject to jail, while a trillion tax dollars are funneled to Wall Street, where bonuses are handed out to executives in companies like AIG. No one serves jail time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The government exploits society’s most vulnerable citizens to fast track legislation controlling the tools of resistance.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Activists and whistleblowers are sentenced to stiff jail terms while not one banking scandal participant has been arrested nor was anyone brought to justice for the false intelligence that took us to war in Iraq.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every media event has an increasing number of disbelievers, and conspiracy theorists representing a now measurable portion of society questioning everything.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Bonus reason: The president signs executive order permiting the murder of US citizens with the use of drones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Change #1 to: The Pentagon admits losing $2.3 trillion dollars one day before the world changed.
(For those that must have something researchable to a specific fact.)

       Why is everyone arguing? I think op is stating we are headed to a tyranny, and is remarking on the obvious corruption within our current society. The rest is semantics.. Arguing over "spelling errors" is ridiculous and a waste of our precious time at this point, and sure seems shilly.... Just sayin.... 
Op makes post about corrupt government taking advantage of its citizens.
Citizens post to defend corruption...
Seems legit.

       We are not quite at the point where the barbarians are at the gate.  We are still at the point where the Pompeys and Crassuses are forcing their wars for more and more upon the backs of the plebs they despise.  The political cival war that has been brewing for the last 30 years will open the way for a tyrant to seize what is left of liberty and trash it.  I'd put the probability of another false flag within the next ten years at well over 50%.

       Folks i want to say i appreciate all the feed back negative and positive. This is my first post ever on reddit and i like the push for facts and the avoidance of lightning rod terms. I will be glad to make changes to reflect a more accurate list that would be tougher to chip away at. Your help in doing so is again appreciated. Your inspriation in this regard will ensure this gets posted elsewhere once refined.

       2 happens all the time, it isn't just powerful groups either. Google the Tax Payers Alliance or The English Defense League. The Democratic Republic of [wherever] comes to mind too. All groups use language to further their cause.

       ""The president is the one who established the security clearance system by executive order," said Steven Aftergood, a national security and intelligence specialist with the Federation of American Scientists. "Therefore it is nonsensical to speak of clearances higher than what the president has. As head of the executive branch and commander in chief of the armed forces, there is no information in government that could be denied to the president for security reasons if he determined he needed access to that information."

       yup.  and even if you have a secret or top secret clearance, you don't always have access to information granted to people with s or ts clearance, why?  it's called "need to know."

       He doesn't need to be aware. His clearance allows for him to say "give me everything on X event" and it will be done. Claiming that there's something hidden from him is purely speculation, and would only show bias in the one making such a claim.

       do you believe that the military always follows the rules and never breaks them?
      </p>
      <p>
       if somehow a pacifist president was elected, do you think all those generals who made their living by killing people who disagree with them would allow the president to shutter the pentagon or release all their secrets?
      </p>
      <p>
       there are a lot of very unscrupulous characters that have no qualms about killing, and it's not too much of a stretch to predict that they will (again) break the rules to protect their dirt.

       Look up bill clinton and uhh security clearance. pretty sure ive watched several documentaries that mention him trying to get clearance into some top security documents and he was denied. He was a little pissed about it. but there wasnt anything he could do (death threats I believe). anyways. the president youre looking for that tried this is bill clinton. pretty sure. correct me if im wrong.

       Yes, as I understand it, there are levels of security called compartmentalized  security based on "need to know" situations. Because presidents come and go, they don't necessarily "need to know" extremely sensitive data. I think I understand this correctly. I may be wrong.

       Not trying to spark an argument but what do you mean exactly? It's a location as far as I know. Maybe a code word for the things that go on  within Area 51 or similar situations related to it. Just curious is all :)

       I hold the opinion (probably wrong, like most of the ones here) that anything that happens to say 'Area 51' in the government is either a joke, a specific area at that crime-scene/state/whateveryouhave, or just code for anything that is only for certain eyes only and just slightly more classified than the 'classified' classification.

       I could see someone making (a bad) argument for this based on compartmentalization. From the perspective of command hierarchy, the President is above the IC, DoD, and DoE, so his interpretation of need to know trumps anyone else's who is setting classification.

       From what I've read even in clearance levels you have compartmentalization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you have a "Top Secret" clearance you can't simply read all documents that have a Top Secret requirement. You only get what you are working on at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       That can explain why it's hard for me to trust when these military guys do interviews because they only have a small piece of the cake, as high as their clearance may have been.

       Former Navy Intelligence Specialist here who held a TS/SCI clearance. The lowest level clearance is to Confidential information. Next is the basic Secret clearance. Then you have basic Top Secret, and finally there is Top Secret Sensitive Compartments Information. Also you have Special Access Programs, which usually require a TS/SCI clearance. My first assignment when I got to my first command was as a shift worker SSO's office so I got read into several very interesting programs. On those long 12 hour watches on a Saturday night I would open up a safe and read some really really cool pubs. I work would also check out some amazing imagery on the light table when bored to practice the skills I learned in Imagery Interpretation C school.

       To anyone that wants a great job in the Navy and hasn't done anything thing too stupid in their past that is documented to check out becoming an IS or a Cryptographic Technician (CT). I was on a 4 star's staff and had a blast.

       I am had the choice of re en listing, going out work for a contractor at my command or taking a job with Schlumberger back home in Texas. Since Schlumberger offered 33k vs the 22k of the contractor at my command the decision was pretty easy. Many years later after using my GI Bill benefits to get my Bachelors degree I am now a Vice President for JP Morgan investment bank...

       You're absolutely correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I was trying to make is that since the President is at the top of the hierarchy he can declare that he has "need to know" for any compartment. He may not be formally read into some compartments but that doesn't mean that he doesn't have the power to be. For example, he probably isn't officially in compartments for classified US crypto algorithms, but if he wanted to be, he could.

       it is entirely likely that it will be nearly impossible to prove parallel structures outside of the pres' purview. from all i've read, if MJ documents are legit, it would be outside of the president's access, being an international project of importance greater than swings of domestic political trends and budgetary cuts might allow. it is possible to prove that contractual organizations such as research groups within the defense establishment are not obligated to the president's desires for access, being militarily aligned, or private entities.

       Good sir, ALL of the actions listed above constitute tryanny appoaching. There is nothing dishonest intellectually here. The fact that we (the USA) now define it, is the point, we did not used to. So you have already moved your thinking to acceptance. stop that. Before 9/11/01 none of these things were set as they are today. Hence Tyranny approaching.

       But then you're simply taking "the U.S. defines what it is to be a tyrannical state" as an axiom of the system. In that case your title should have been "How you know you're living under tyranny:" with the post itself containing only, "you're living in the U.S.". The list becomes superfluous as the important factor of each of your given signs is that it takes place in the U.S., rendering the details themselves unimportant.

       I see what you're saying, and technically you might have a point if you look at the post too myopically or syllogistically. But if you step back you'll see that most points on the list are localized American examples of the 10 basic historically demonstrated/recognized steps for the systematic closing down of a free and open society that Naomi Wolf used as a framework for her book "The End of America". Don't let the title distract you; it examines the steps from a wide angle and points out historical examples throughout the world.

       I don't get this at all. I don't even think it makes sense. What are the "details" if they're not the list itself? And how does that make the list "superfluous" (definition: Unnecessary, esp. through being more than enough.). You didn't argue with any of the details, but made weird statements about the thing as a whole. None of which are coherent. And yet you're being upvoted as of now. The fuck?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're worrying about the "semantics" of tyranny (but again, I can't even tell if that's your point), then what's the word you would call it other than tyranny, and what historical examples do you think match "tyranny" that the list doesn't match?

       read all four of those definitions, and try to find one part of the list that does not match one, if not a few or all, of them. Then, if you have a problem with parts of the list, argue about that rather than petty semantics

       Tell me how any of that affects you. No general terms.. How has YOUR life been effected by what you think is going on? And no, I'm not saying that you shouldn't do anything until it would affect you directly. I'm asking you to tell me how your life has been affected by anything. You don't know what the hell freedom is. And I don't think you'd recognize any real incursions into your freedom if they bit you on the ass.

       I'm not downvoting anyone in this thread, but the argument "is it affecting YOU" along with the idea that if it isn't affecting me, that I shouldn't be concerned about it, is in no way more logical, nor is it using formal logic. Sorry to burst your bubble.

       I don't know why you're getting angry, I'm honestly just trying to have a conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start with his first sign. "The highest elected Official and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces does NOT have the highest security clearance. No other elected officials have oversight."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is obviously referring to the U.S. correct? But the U.S. has already been said to define tyranny. If that is the case then the only piece of evidence one needs to know to understand that they are living under a tyranny is that they live in the U.S. Adding conjuncts only makes this truth more convoluted. Let's take two arguments
      </p>
      <p>
       1- I live in the U.S., therefore I live under tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       2- I live in the U.S. and The highest elected Official and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces does NOT have the highest security clearance, therefore I live under tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both statements entail the conclusion that the U.S. is a tyrannical state, the only difference is that statement 2 has an additional "unnecessary" conjunct. It does not make the statement any more true.
      </p>
      <p>
       For your second point, OP has already claimed that the U.S. is what defines tyranny, not that the U.S. falls under a historical definition of tyranny. If I am to take this seriously then the historical examples of tyranny would simply be those that match how it is defined by currently observing the U.S.

       You're not trying to have a conversation, otherwise, you'd address what this thread's actually about. Right now you're just trying to box the OP into a faux "logical" and semantic arguement, when the thread wasn't ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF TYRANNY. Even here you're not actually addressing any of the points on hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since you're so concerned with what the definition of tyranny is and where it comes from:

      <p>
       <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tyranny">

If prior to 2000 then that adds some credence to his statement that the plan was to start WWIII in Middle East in 2000.

       I agree. I think this is part of the reason they concocted global warming, to hide the fact that we're running out of oil. They know that when a billion people die from starvation that global warming will solve itself. So the expensive new sources of energy are not really meant to combat global warming, but rather be the future energy supply for those that make it through Peak Oil (i.e. the rich and their servants)

       That's not true though, for example the CO2 will still be 380 PPM+. Also, then why would 'they' start a movement for global climate change, with the leading mentality being that it isn't big, but individuals that can change this. Why would 'they' give us power and warning, to keep us down?

       The reason being is because they want the tax money. If they just started spending billions to develop energy for post-Peak Oil, then people would freak out about Peak Oil. Right now there is almost no realization about Peak Oil amongst the general public and it's implication for depopulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if government just dropped the charade about global warming and said that when the oil runs out, people are going to starve. What would be the next question everyone would ask? "you mean my children will starve?". What is the government supposed to say "don't worry, we can sustain about a quarter of the current population".

       The funding into global warming is primarily for alternate energy sources. When the oil runs out, these will be where those that remain get their energy from.

       This is very straight forward. I think a lot of people have pushed aside the hype of global warming, so if you don't think the upcoming threat they're preparing for is peak oil, then what is it? Are you suggesting that you still believe in global warming? I don't mean that the planet won't be warmer (it will), but rather that it will be the end of the world. Do you think people will be burning alive in Florida?

       Solves itself? What about the temperature increase we've already experienced? You assume that greenhouse gases need to be continually replenished for the greenhouse effect to continue. But it doesn't work that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       CO2 in the atmosphere isn't going anywhere without a mechanism to remove it. What's going to do that, Einstein, trees? That's going to take years and years. Meanwhile, we will still be living on a planet with increased temperatures, which will effect ocean currents, wind patterns and global weather for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice try, but your understanding is rudimentary at best if you think running out of petroleum will suddenly reset the atmosphere. It won't.

       Actually it does. The gases, like CO2, get incorporated in things. Plants use CO2 to growth. They extract it from the air.

       Try to understand here. CO2 is at equilibrium. Adding more shifts that equilibrium. Think back to high school chemistry. When we add more CO2, some new plants will grow to use some of that CO2, yes, but not all of it. Overall, the equilibrium is shifted to a higher concentration of CO2, and that higher concentration heats the earth, causing global warming.

       Do you realize that the difference between summer and winter temperatures is much greater than 1 degree? In addition, we've been coming out of an ice age, so the 1 degree change was going to happen anyways. Regardless, whats the worst thing that you can imagine that you see happening today from that 1 degree change?

       Also I would like to see more middle class people run for congress. But if I was making 45k a year I wouldn't quit my job and run for congress. I would risk losing my entire financial safety net (my paycheck) if I lose the election, and I wouldn't be getting paid to run an election. Also it's hard to start a campaign with little disposable income.

       That part of the equation has been going on longer than any of us have been alive. Old movies like Mr Smith goes to Washington touch on this 60 years ago. The Federal Reserve is now 100 years old. We jsut need to point out more often where they clearly choose business over the people to a detriment. We currently live in an era rivalling the robber barons.

       The military is constitutionally bound to serve the interests of the nation (or the people of that nation) Blackwater is a for profit military mercenary group that can be hired for personal interest. That by definition is unconstitutional if you are hiring a separate military to serve other interests than that of your people.

       Both oligarchies and plutocracies have been largely tyrannical through out history. So we would be splitting hairs. i think we can agree things have turned pretty bad since 2001.

       The president doesn't need a security clearance. He is the highest granting authority for everyone else's clearance. When you fill out an sf-86 you are asking for executive branch (OPM) permission to view files that the executive branch controls. The president is the head of the executive branch, so he effectively decides who gets to see what.

       I meant the guy, not Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton actually said this. You corrected "what he meant to say," when he was actually telling the truth. I can't stand for that. Sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not it's true, I haven't a clue. Bill Clinton got in trouble for being a bad liar while he was a president, and the interviews I've seen where he mentions his interest in possible UFO secrets, they were convincing. Especially in the context of the situation, I mean, the entire interview. He's not obviously tip-toeing around things when he talks about it, and it seems like he's saying as much as he knows. He's also talked about the subject of UFOs in several other interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need convincing, though. I wouldn't be surprised if he was lying in the interviews. RIGHT THROUGH HIS PRETTY TEETH

       What does this have to do with security clearances? Are you saying there are records that he couldn't get access to because he didn't have the right clearance? Or that the records just don't exist, or they used to exist but were destroyed, etc?

       He just says IF there were any documents they were concealed from him. He doesn't know whether there actually were any documents, nor does he say it has anything to do with security clearances.

       Subordinates doing stuff without their bosses knowledge is not evidence of a lack of security clearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton never said he lacked a security clearance. Here is a quote you might be referencing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I did attempt to find out if there were any secret government documents that revealed things. If there were, they were concealed from me too. And if there were, well I wouldn't be the first American president that underlings have lied to, or that career bureaucrats have waited out. But there may be some career person sitting around somewhere, hiding these dark secrets, even from elected presidents. But if so, they successfully eluded me…and I'm almost embarrassed to tell you I did (chuckling) try to find out."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here is a real factual account of the president's security clearance: he is above all security clearance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The president is the one who established the security clearance system by executive order," said Steven Aftergood, a national security and intelligence specialist with the Federation of American Scientists. "Therefore it is nonsensical to speak of clearances higher than what the president has. As head of the executive branch and commander in chief of the armed forces, there is no information in government that could be denied to the president for security reasons if he determined he needed access to that information."
       </p>

       I think it is valid to say Eisenhoweer gave a speech warning of (his words) the military industrial complex. JFK then gave a speech about secret societies, was murdered, then we have been at war ever since. The police are being militarized and we have expanded exponetianally around the world. 150+ military bases. It is all connected.

       You realize that at least one person has said something that has 'been connected' or that happened right? I mean hell, I could make six videos saying that 6 different things will happen. I guarantee that if even one of those came to be, people would flock to me and wonder how I predicted it. Now change that one person to 7billion, and everything that happens is going to be said.

       I hate to break it to the rest of the world, but when America falls, most every nation will feel it. Even China, China has invested billions in the USA, if we default on them, they will have issues as well. International bankers want the system interdependant.

       Why would money matter to them in the first place? Probably not only whatever form of illegal taxes, because only in America do people get so excited for getting taxes back...which is money they earned but was stolen from us and blah blah..but mostly from the pockets of the most corrupt people in this Nation.

       So then why didn't they use the same method as with Bill? I mean almost everyone knew JFK was a dog, it wouldn't be that hard to get him impeached for that.

       Although I can definitely see the benefits to him being unable to share ideas anymore.. That's for the conversation(s) RageMojo! It was fun, and a learning experience for both of us.

       Well i believe those behind the central banking system are pulling the strings in legal ways. As a nation we do not need a private central bank, we can print and control our own money. I will be glad to change the post and reorder them, i am merely trying to represent the existance of tjhose things like the CIA running coke and overthrowing  Iran and putting the Shaw puppet in place.  Help me define the point to express that. that there are elements of our governemnt doing what ever the fuck they want and taking us to war where there are no WMD's.

       I did not twist his words. I had two suppositions, that were each supported individually by his own statements. That he was unwilling to join those suppositions is not my fault, nor is it unfair when I point out that he was objecting by saying "I don't believe A+B, but I believe A, and I believe B," and I responded, "So you DO believe A+B, by believing each part in turn."

       He said "But I don't think there is concrete entity which actually runs the government", then "(like a group of global bankers who control every single thing)". So he
       <em>
        did

       " I was on the inside of government, so I know there is more out there than meets the eye. You know, when I was elected, but before I was inaugurated, someone, a total stranger, whom I met on the street asked me to look into Area 51 and Aliens in Roswell, New Mexico. I laughed, but decided to buy a book about the subject. It was very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked my good friend Webster Hubbell to investigate the matter. When Hillary talked about the fast right wing conspiracy, she was mocked. Maybe the conspiracy wasn't a right wing one, but something else. I never did get a clear answer about Area 51 from the ones with the security clearance. And I was the president.

       The lid was blown wide open on this by many who basically died trying to get us the information. The agenda is not for the people by the people, but rather for the corporations and a select few families at the top. Rothschilds come to mind.

       I can point to changes since the JFK assasination, but since the Regan era the neo-cons went crazy behind the scenes, first made public with the Iran contra affair. Since 9/11 our Constitution has been shredded and due process eliminated. Obama the Black democrat didnt do anything different from the white republican. He gave wall street a trillon of our tax dollars, and did not close G-bay. Under Bush in Pakistan 1 drone kill every 43 days, under Obama 1 every 4 days. Does that sound like a diffence in party policies? We are already in trouble, what is to come will be painful at this point no matter what.

       But you are avoiding my question. And of course all of that happened and there was change. You were also changing. Shit changes. So, is that when you think it started? Because if so, than why would they have let LBJ be president, and what about his presidency?

       you're joking right? JFK was killed and then we get the Gulf Of Tonkin which isnt even a conspiracy anymore since Robert McNamara admitted it was a set up. We then fight the war in the worst possible way, the fighters have tons of stupid rules etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way there doesnt have to be a formal conspiracy at all, they dont have to call a meeting. Like minded people with similar interests that graduate from the same schools and belong to the same groups, orginizations and country clubs will do what is best for them, and they have.

       What you said in your last sentence is the problem with this subreddit. There is no need for far out conspiracy theories like those that pop up here all the time. I'm as critical of recent developments as the next guy, but the thought that everything has to be a
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       ("an agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful or subversive act", to quote the first definition at hand). It puts too much empasis on intentionality. Which is hard to prove, doesn't really explain much anyway and, in the end, is simply wrong most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact is, almost everything problematised here can be explained by looking at the social structures, the political and economic systems of western societies. If everybody here would read some basic social science books, a lot of the useless speculation would vanish. And you could tackle the problems at their actual roots.

       Those social structures are shaped by the financiers. Those behind the Federal Reseve have enough money to influce the laws being changed. The structure our institutions take. What is taught in schools. Thery have us by the balls more than you know.

       We are in an era of people saying well thats the law, while the origin of the law was bogus and conspiratorial on some levels. Most americans dont think lee harvy oswald was the lone assasin of JFK. What does that tell you.

       Are you seriously saying the structure of modern society, especially the structure of capitalism, as it has developed over centuries has been orchestrated by a financial elite? Capitalism with its fundamental principles, imperatives and concequences to political and social life has emerged over an incredibly long period of time. That isn't something a few people have "created" out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, the shape our society is in and has been in for a long time has highly problematic consequences for the influence of elites etc., but that's exactly what I'm trying to say here. It's not a conspiracy. It's socio-historic development that doesn't necessarily (or even at all) rely on a group of people intentionally orchestrating it. And you don't even need to assume some sort of conspiracy by the elites to explain the shape of our current societies. In fact, it has been explained by literally thousands of works by historians, social scientists, philosophers and humanities scholars. Reducing everything to the actions of a small elite, on the other hand, is incredibly and ridiculously reductionist.

       I am saying the USA was highjacked by Bankers in 1913 with institution of the Federal Reserve. Then 16 years later the Federal Reserve which was put in place to prevent depression, made depression worse and then consolidated banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who create institutions and fund institutions, wield power over those institutions, including government institutions. But fyi the Federal Reserve is not a government institution, it is a private bank. and no country needs a private central bank, the government can control it own money. we have bought into a scam because we were born into it. that doesnt make it right or even ok.

       I made the list and if you find something wrong or evidence to the contrary, or if you have a better piece of evidence to add, i will be happy to change or alter the list. The only controversial item is #1. Everything else is easily researchable or observable in the daily news.

       " I was on the inside of government, so I know there is more out there than meets the eye. You know, when I was elected, but before I was inaugurated, someone, a total stranger, whom I met on the street asked me to look into Area 51 and Aliens in Roswell, New Mexico. I laughed, but decided to buy a book about the subject. It was very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked my good friend Webster Hubbell to investigate the matter. When Hillary talked about the fast right wing conspiracy, she was mocked. Maybe the conspiracy wasn't a right wing one, but something else. I never did get a clear answer about Area 51 from the ones with the security clearance. And I was the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than that you know what happened to me during my second term. And you know what happened to Hubble. He died. Sometimes you shouldn't ask questions why, you just have to accept reality." President Bill Clinton

       I agree, but if we allow feds to come in and kick in doors where the state said it was ok, (example: pot laws) then we have an even greater problem. Some states will natuarally align with the feds and those that like that can live there. Personally i suggest not living in those states.

       it's a bit silly. there isn't really a 'highest' security clearance. security clearances tend to work on a need to know basis. as the president, one delegates various secret tasks to other parts of the executive branch. the president his/herself doesn't need to know any of the details of said operations as knowing them would be another possible security hole in the secrecy system.

       Good sir, i could post videos for hours and hours of CSPAN and video right from the congressional floor of Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke refusing to answer questions or explain things. They also admitted in Congress that adding money to the system is a tax on the people. Therefore we also have taxation without representation, the very thing that was the final straw sparking our first revolution.

       infaltion is a tax, but it isnt always controllable. Adding money is a choice and an action with consequences. I am not getting bogged down in your pet subject. No country needs to pay a private central bank to run its own money.

       Are you fucking serious? Sorry to get upset but everything that you just said was literally talked about in the first week of Macroeconomics 101. But money isn't nearly the only way that inflation, obviously it is a 'tax' but it is bad for the government too, as high inflation just brings down the value of our dollar compared to the other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, NO SHIT ABOUT THE VALUE, that is the most obvious consequence of not having money tied to a gold standard (which I would argue is worse world-wide anyways as it allows for a greater bullying of small countries). Our currency is the measure of how much trust our citizens have in our government essentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I am really curious, what
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       are you unsure of about on the 'workings' of the Federal Reserve. I will definitely help you understand it!

      <p>
       Interesting way to look at this, but I would argue the worth of monies is closely related to how powerful a government is and how much of a power they have to regulate the worth of a money.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Germany sets the tune for the Euro, and the rest of the morons dance to it, whether they want to or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, due to a super powerful military, USA sets the tune for the dollar, and the rest of the world adjusts AND uses the US$ as reserve currency - or else, shit happens.

       Sir, that is an absurd paranoia you wield.  Reconsider your unbegotten trust in the $ symbol, I beg you.  I assure you, if you simply stare at the insignia on a dollar bill, for at least one hour a day, while placing your faith in it and in the power it wields, your life will improve substantially.  Take a chance on $, you won't regret it.  Make it the core basis of your inner spirituality and I promise big things will come your way.

       No worries.  We need men like you to fight the good fight in upholding the outstanding reputation of the Federal Reserve.  If it weren't for foot-soldiers such as you and I, why, people might lose their faith and we could all lose out on our share of the profit that The Fed generates for the citizenry.  Hold strong, comrade.

       The Federal Reserve is here to

       you, it is run by well-meaning experts who hold your prosperity dear to their hearts.  They do not answer some questions of the buffoons in Congress because it would expose their philanthropy, which they prefer remain anonymous, as it would be bragging to expose it openly.  Would you prefer our financial wizards

       There are certain documents and pieces of information that only people with a certain approved level of access can see. There are very basic security clearances which still require a thorough background check and polygraph, and then these lead all the way up to super high security clearances that allow one to see top secret documents.

       Sir that does NOT give authority over the states. Makes the Constituition the highest law of the land for all states and gives the feds the right to make treaties on behalf of all. So say Texas cant wage war with Canada against the other 49 states will. Ok bad example, but this does not give fedral control over the states. That is what they want you to believe so they can push their agenda. Which BTW started with the war on drugs and is still being played out in that context. Our Constitution clearly did not want centralized power.

       The more I read and think about this stuff, the sicker my stomach feels.
      </p>
      <p>
       From Wiki:
      </p>
      <p>
       In September 2010, President Barack Obama informed Congress that the State of Emergency in effect since September 14, 2001, will be extended another year.[9][10] The National Emergencies Act grants various powers to the president during times of emergency,[11] and was intended to prevent a president from declaring a state of emergency of indefinite duration.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least two constitutional rights are subject to revocation during a state of emergency:
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of habeas corpus, under Article 1, Section 9;
The right to a grand jury for members of the National Guard when in actual service, under Fifth Amendment.
In addition, many provisions of statutory law are contingent on a state of national emergency, as many as 500 by one count.

       I think if you put this together in a way that most people understand and can plainly see, they will "wake up," as it were. Most people will just think you lied if you said Obama passed a law that allows drone strikes on Americans within the US. But, if you show them that they interpret current law claiming that it allows strikes on Americans in a foreign country, and refuse to clarify if this applies to US soil as well, and show them where they refuse to clarify, they must accept it because it can be plainly seen.

       Right after the initial invasion of Iraq was complete the federal government hired a mercenary force called Blackwater started by an ex navy seal. In the begining they were actually called mercenaries. But that was scrubbed and you will only find them called a "security company" now, but these are not fat Brinks guards. These are freshly retired military specialists.

       Is there a source for the bonus reason? I don't think the NDAA specifies drone use on those on the kill list within the United States, however, I don't see why drones could not be used.

       Thanks. Am I correct in assuming that this memo detailing the legal justifications for using drones on Americans within the US is not an executive order as claimed in the op?
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that the president will eventually make it legal to kill Americans within the US using drones, but I'm assuming this is not the case right now. The memo is shocking, but it does not mean the law was passed yet.

       The executive order was already given. The Justice Dept memo is their legal justification for when they do it. They are not waiting for permission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Executive orders are not laws, and this is part of the problem. Since 2001 excutive orders have shredded the Constitution.

       The memo states that the president has the authority to kill an American citizen who is outside of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       This memo was created because of the backlash he received from killing those 3 Americans who were outside the US.

       Sir, we have slid down the slope, we now have drones over the USA, but you presume these same evil fucks wont use it here? There authorized the use where ever it is needed. Time will prove this correct.

       I am simply pointing out the fact that the memo specifically says "outside of the United States" and your post says "within the United States." If you want to pretend that the president authorized drone strikes within the US, and mislead everyone who reads your post, fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying the president won't eventually authorize drone strikes within the US, but I am saying that it is currently illegal.

       I thought it was something other than that, because Regan definitely knew about Iran-Contra and I'm sure Clinton was told about Groom Lake. Just because either one claims otherwise doesn't mean anything.

       no, you are missing the point. There are elements of the government specifically in the CIA and DOD that take actions with out approval. The President does not know about them. Also Bill Clinton specifically asked to go to groom lake and was denied.

       I agree with our rights being taken away and your original post I am just making the point that if Clinton said that he was told about Groom Lake and there was nothing there you wouldn't believe him, then why believe him when he says they wouldn't tell him?

       because it is infinitely more important. If the president says there is nothing there, then we can believe him or not, the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was denied access, then who the hell is deciding? And what are they doing that even the leader cant know? It proves the existance of a shadow government if correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       But $2.3 trillion gone missing, then announced on 9/10/01 is highly suspect as well and $2.3 trillion buys you a shadow government while the citizens bicker over a $300 million medicare package.

       I don't live in the US, but I live in Canada which can be effected by stuff like this, and is effect by some bullshit. But just thinking about where the US is going and what it is becoming and how the people just willingly choose to ignore it... It sickens me, it's fucking scary, and it makes me question what's the point anymore?

       Those articles are just plain wrong.  I know plenty of people with SCI clearances who have done drugs, owned property in other countries, have family / relatives overseas (including many people who were naturalized citizens who still have close family in foreign countries, some countries we're not so friendly with).
      </p>
      <p>
       And Allen West's comment was just an attempted attack on the Obama similar to the other articles you linked to, not a claim that he had clearances the Commander in Chief didn't have:
       <a href="http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/sep/24/allen-west/allen-west-says-he-has-clearance-even-president-un/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say that there may be SCI / SAP activities the president hasn't been read into, but there's no reason why he wouldn't be granted access (or simply granted himself access as the CINC).

       I'm not going to dispute anything about the bullshit stuff the government does (and, ohh, is there a lot of it), but #6 is just stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point of having a federal government is that it trumps the state. There would be no point to having a federal level is the state could opt out of it, at which point the state may as well be it's own sovereign nation at that point. It's "these united states" for a reason, and not "a collection of countries that just calls itself a bigger country".
      </p>
      <p>
       Does a county whine "county rights" when something is done on the state level? Does a county get to opt out of something that the state decides the whole state needs to do? Of course not.
      </p>
      <p>
       A state is essentially a collection of counties, and the country is a collection of states. Each level gets to dictate things at it's own level, and everyone under that level has to follow. To reiterate, if the federal level did not trump the state level, there would be no point in having that state be part of the collective. What's the point of having a state that can say " I do what I wan' "? They're not a state at that point, they're a sovereign nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, what's up all this hate against specifically the federal government? Every level of gov't is fucked up and does fucked up shit. Some states to way more fucked up shit than the feds.

       You need to read the constitution. That is exactly the point of the states. If one state wants to outlaw drinking or have a speedlimit set to 80 they can and other states dont have to agree. The role of the federal government is to handle treaties and defense, thats it. The role of the federal government has incrementally crept up on us. Dont buy the BS they are telling you today. The states are a checck against centralized power.

       The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791.[1] The Tenth Amendment states the Constitution's principle of federalism by providing that powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the States, are reserved to the States or the people.

       Yes, that would be an example of something a state could do. An example of something a state cannot do is make slavery legal. An example is that they cannot cancel the bill of rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitution is a federal document that applies to all states, whether they like it or not. If all the federal gov't did was handle treaties and defense, there would be no bill of rights or constitution or amendments that all states have to observe. Yes, states get to do their own thing, but they still fall under the federal level if they want to be included in "these united states". The point of a state is to be included in "these united states", and to have the benefits that brings, while still maintaining some amount of autonomy. Unfortunately, that sometimes means you have to follow certain rules the federal level makes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, if a state is supposed to be a check against centralized power, what is the check against the state becoming the centralized power? You still live in the state just as much as you live in the country. States get away with so much bullshit in the guise of "states rights" it's pathetic.

       You are assuming too much, i didnt praise the states.  It is a check and balance jsut like the 3 tier system is supposed to be. you know to help prevent tyranny. So stop helping them.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is simple, if there are states that can make their own rules then we all have options to live in the USA but in a state that shares our values. Perhaps OK outlaws abortion or Colorado sells pot. People have a choice. When laws are handed down from the fedral level in washington, there is no choice, no options, no need for states. Which is exactly what they want. You see the government take us to war in iraq over complete lies, but we should lay down our rights more and more to them? you are insane.

       No, The evil people have been twisting the words of the contitution around. The Fedral governemnt is to up hold the constitution and make international treaties, and organize a defense. It is not to trump states rights. In fact if the fed had clear power over the states, the states would be pointless to a large degree and there wouldnt be the controversy in CA and CO about what the feds are doing. Dont buy into that BS. The feds DO NOT trump States!

       That term is in reference to people who would never stop to read something like this. The term has been used since the JFK assasination.  I hate to break it to you, but there are alot of brain dead morons going through life caring more about what Taylor Swift did than what congress is doing with our taxes or who we killed with a drone today. They ARE sheeple until they awaken.

       But calling them sheeple will only push them further away from your cause. Yes, you may feel these people are dumb for not paying attention or believing in your cause but only respect will win people over. Have you ever seen a successful company or business call the people who don't use their product idiotic or a disrespectful name like "sheeple?" No, because it doesn't work.

       I can acknowledge people beliefs, that doesnt mean i must respect them, there is a huge difference. And again those people we are talking about are oblivious and not present here. Those types of people are largely not on reddit at all. They are watching E entertainment channel and reading People magazine.

       Maybe people don't stop to read stuff like this because it is riddled with errors and thus can't be taken seriously. 
Explain #1. If you're saying that Obama doesn't have the top security clearance in the nation then you are out of your mind.

       Why does he even need to have top security clearance? The military is compartmentalized, you can't simply say: "I have the highest clearance therefore I want all documents ever classified in the military."

       Clinton telling that he is probably not the first president that have been in the dark about secret documents. It doesn't take much more than logic to reach that conclusion, but there you go the ex president himself speaking.

       But that is a conscious effort by the President, and actually probably a much stronger effort from his advisers and staff, to keep him from knowing some of the shadier U.S. actions for the sake of plausible deniability.
      </p>

       If the President made it his goal, ANY information would be cleared for him. It's just better policy for him to stay in the dark.

       But then you're simply taking "the U.S. defines what it is to be a tyrannical state" as an axiom of the system. In that case your title should have been "How you know you're living under tyranny:" with the post itself containing only, "you're living in the U.S.". The list becomes superfluous as the important factor of each of your given signs is that it takes place in the U.S., rendering the details themselves unimportant.

       read all four of those definitions, and try to find one part of the list that does not match one, if not a few or all, of them. Then, if you have a problem with parts of the list, argue about that rather than petty semantics

       The lid was blown wide open on this by many who basically died trying to get us the information. The agenda is not for the people by the people, but rather for the corporations and a select few families at the top. Rothschilds come to mind.

       I hate to break it to the rest of the world, but when America falls, most every nation will feel it. Even China, China has invested billions in the USA, if we default on them, they will have issues as well. International bankers want the system interdependant.
