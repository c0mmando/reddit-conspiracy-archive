       Conspiracy is more about enlightenment and awakening than ever before. We are no longer the bat-shit crazy wingnuts that we are portrayed to be by popular media, but the foundation for an inquisitive and informed populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "Conspiracy" is harmful to those ends. As many of you may know, it is difficult for many people to accept that the system that they have trusted for so many years does not have their best interests at heart. Consequently, today's conspirators are not only those with bad intentions, but those who are slaves to stock-holders and corporate interests and are unwittingly stressed to fir into the only society that they have ever known.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I propose that anyone who considers themselves a "Conspiracy Theorist" start using the term "Corruption Analyst". Power, money and influence corrupt before they get a chance to conspire. The more focus is put on the patterns of corruption, the less it seems like we are making value judgments of people we have never met before...and isn't that what frustrates all of us more than anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for reading. If this gets enough attention maybe we can start another subreddit? What do ya think?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR "Corruption Analysis" seems to be a more appropriate name for this field than "Conspiracy Theory"

       That or 'conspiracist'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists aren't ridiculed because of what they label themselves, they're ridiculed because what they believe is often non-sensical and lacking any kind of credible evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insisting that you're a 'truth-seeker' (which has its own negative connotations, btw) or 'corruption analyst' (what are your qualifications?) is only going to lead to more ridicule.

       Why do "we" need a name at all? Personally, i wouldn't want to be associated with most of what goes on here, because it would make me look crazy. Calling yourself a conspiracy theorist makes it sound like you're in some sort of club, and that anything anyone considers a conspiracy, you're interested in. It makes it sound like you do it for entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no interest in this being a hobby, i have no interest in being part of a group, i have no motive whatsoever for doing this. I simply want to know the truth about what goes on in the world, and this is a decent place to get alternative reports and opinions on world events. Sure, you have to pick through a bunch of shit about aliens to get to a story actually worth reading, but that's fine by me. And at least you can have a civil discussion here on matters like this, rather than getting insulted when you post your opinion on r/politics or the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, stop trying to give yourself a name. Giving a name to your views serves to set you apart from other people, and this makes them infinitely less likely to listen to those views in an open manner. I'm a normal person, just like everyone else; i just happen to have an alternative view of the world, based on things i've seen/read/heard.

       For their to be a holocaust you'd have to first be a racist and accept that there's a moral difference between killing a jew and killing a non-jew. It was a genocide. Don't ignore the gay, the gypsies, the revolutionaries, the "others".

       Yes this is true. Judaism expressly informs its followers that they are better than everybody else. While I'm certain many a modern Jew knows this not to be true, it still leaves fundamentalists to wage war and claim superiority. Strange that when we think of fundamentalists doing these things we either think of Christian Nazis or Muslim "revolutionaries".

       I think many a modern Jew understands that it's not very popular to say such things out loud and directly.  However, if you grow up in a household indoctrinating you with such ideas, you're bound to have them in one way form or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of how many Jews (modern or not)
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       believe this, however, it seems that it's the ones that DO believe this and are acting on it that are are making the most (negative) noise and causing the most harm on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like it doesn't matter if you have 100 "agents of good" in a system and only 10 "agents of bad" if those 10 are managing to fuck up the whole system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world's problems are NOT all because of Jews.  Of course not.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're certainly not helping though.

      <p>
       Not so strange when you realize that the reason we think this is because we've become indoctrinated by the MSM from an early age to think about things in this very manner...and the MSM is almost
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       owned by Jews.

      <p>
       Makes total sense when you realize

       Yes, the MSM is almost entirely owned by Jews. As well as a majority of the world's wealth. But there are plenty of wealthy non-Jews, and new religions are being used such as Mormonism and Scientology to create structures of superiority and secrecy.

       I think this is going to sound difficult or not very promising to many, but I think what we should do/need to do is to work outwardly as much as we can to make things better (protest and get involved in/start demonstrations if one wants), but really we must find our true liberation INDIVIDUALLY within ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can TOTALLY start our own truth seeking
       <del>
        religion
       </del>
       movement - yes - but you know what?  I think it has to actually be a movement of ONE - i.e. start the movement, but it might need to be a movement that you are the president, executive, sole arbiter, and
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       member of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?  Because in the end, it seems no one can help you out of the particular situation or entanglement called "your life" but yourself as an individual.  Divine Providence can throw the rope down the dark cave that we're in - we certainly get help and helpers that aid us along the way - but we must grab on to that rope and make the arduous climb up on our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this planet is the celestial equivalent of a jr. high school of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are essentially young school children asking each other "How can we finally get out of 6th grade?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, we GO through it, do as best as we can while in it, learn as much as we can about it, get as good a grade as we can, and then hopefully graduate to the next grade and never return to this one again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, though, it seems we have to GO through the grade before we can graduate from it...
      </p>
      <p>
       And this grade?  Seems to be a pretty darn shitty one if you ask me.  I personally can't wait till it's over.

       Entirely depends on the theory. You can range from:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Conspiracy Theorist", who believes stuff like interest rate fixing and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nutjob, who believes in the NWO.

       I like the idea of alternative narratives. Too many people on here get caught up with whether something is or is not a conspiracy. Or put too much belief in their theories. Alternative narratives is simply suggesting another way of describing how the world works. One that is then up for finding evidence for or against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for example that there was life on Mars that came to earth or that there was a civilisation in Atlantis that seeded current civilisation is not really a conspiracy, but it is an alternative narrative that will never be given serious time in the mainstream.

       Revisionism implies that the facts never happened and we went back and rewrote it.

       I assume most MSM theories to be revisionism. I.e., 9/11, JFK, the moon landing,

       "Conspiracy Theorist" is one of the stupidest fucking names ever.  It's actually a name that got coined by TPTB in order to discredit those individuals searching for the
       <em>

       No. Skeptics look for answers. Conspiracy theorists make up crazy claims and then try and make things look like they fit.

       Conspiracy theorists actually do the opposite of good science, they are more like apologetics.

       You can hypothesize, but in order to become a theory you have to prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists never prove anything, they just make baseless assumptions and call them truth. Not only are facts not in the equation, but they abhor them. If someone brings facts into a conspiracy thread, they get downvoted. I can show numerous examples of this.

       Lmao, Nebz604 proclaims to be a skeptic. In reality he is a shill for Wrigley. The only facts he questions are those that haven't been pre-approved by his boss, Mr. Wrigley.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nebz604 follows his own brand of crazy bullshit. If you follow his posts you'll see he likes the MSM and trusts them. His kind of "skeptic" follows the mold of James Randi, who is more of a debunker than a tried and true skeptic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nebz604 is a skep_dick who would claim that fairy dust is the active ingredient in all homeopathy because he was too lazy to read the literature and learn that modern medicine came from natural remedies.

       Fringe theorist. We need to defeat the annotations that come with the term "conspiracy theory/theorist". It's just a negative buzz word that politicians use to discredit us. Or truth seeker. That sounds pretty cool.

       It doesn't make any difference what new term is used. Government and a complicit media will make short work of turning it into a derogatory term.

       Yes. I think that we need to embrace the term conspiracy theorist. The only reason it has a negative connotation is if we allow it to.

       Conspiracy theorist works fine for me. I say embrace it b/c the fact is that people conspire to attain power over other people, and people with power conspire to keep it. Science is a bunch of theories, and people treat science with respect (too much IMO).
