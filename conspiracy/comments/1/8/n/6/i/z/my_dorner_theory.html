        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My feelings are that the purpose of this exercise was to garner support for measures to implant citizens with RFID chips or similar devices. I believe this is also why the police were so aggressive in their means of pursuit. Maybe leaving innocent civilians dead, searching cars/homes without a warrant and using drones for domestic purposes were all attempts to increase animosity between citizens and the police force. The police can then ADMIT they did wrong and offer a solution. All of this could have been avoided had each citizen been implanted with a tracking device. So essentially the most extreme form of surveillance would be offered in order to avoid illegal searches and loss of innocent lives. </p>

<p>Now why would this be accepted by the general public? Well, first I would say that this would not be accepted right away. Several other exercises similar to the Dorner exercise would have to be triggered in other parts of the country and repeated. But ultimately, the reason people would accept this over being harassed, searched and/or killed is because it is out of sight and out of mind. Having a chip implanted would not stick in an average person&#39;s memory as long as having a police officer kick in their door or drones constantly flying overhead. This can be offered as a solution to protect THEM from US and US from THEM. Anyway, just a thought. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>TLDR;
Dorner exercise could be used as an excuse to implement RFID chipping to avoid civilian casualties, illegal searches and excessive use of drones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, to get a drivers license now, you must have your fingerprint taken, thanks to the REAL ID Act which passed (in 2005 I believe), in addition to proving an address showing where you live.  This is why DL&#39;s must be mailed now - before you could have it printed immediately.  The REAL ID Act was passed at a time during the fear talks about immigrants taking over our country.  Consequently, this Act passed with support from both Republicans &amp; Democrats.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, NORAD Annex North?  Well that is so hilarious I don&#39;t know where to start.  I could start with pointing out that emigrating to Canada from the U.S. accomplishes nothing for the person who actually <em>needs</em> to emigrate.  Canada justice authorities fully cooperate with the U.S., just ask Marc Emery -- a very nice guy that I once bought seeds from before he was imprisoned here in the U.S.</p>

<p>Aside from this obvious flaw in your suggestion, it is my understanding that a person cannot simply immigrate to Canada from the United States.  At the very least, a person must have a Bachelor&#39;s degree to do so, or own a Canadian business.  Is that mistaken?</p>

<p>Canada???  Might as well emigrate to Israel by that measure.</p>

<p>I have a Chase CC and it has the contact-less RFID chip. Also, Google Wallet is available on certain smart phones that allow you to pay by contacting your phone to the contact-less reader. It&#39;s the technology that is marketed as &quot;Tap To Pay&quot; etc. from companies such as MasterCard. </p>

<p>The title of the thread has two important words in it <em>&quot;My&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Theory&quot;</em></p>

<p>Yup that&#39;s the point.  He&#39;s just speculating.</p>

<p>This contributes nothing.  As it is your opinion.  Quit trolling.</p>

<p>No, being a dick is the response I get when I politely say no. Your posts are evidence of the lack of critical thought put into such theories. </p>

<p>Are you illiterate? It has nothing to do with the fact that you disagree. It&#39;s that you aren&#39;t willing to discuss it. I wrote that. Did you not understand?</p>
