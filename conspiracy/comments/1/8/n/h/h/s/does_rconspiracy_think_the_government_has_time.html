       Please be at least open to the idea.  There is some evidence of it in the conspiracy space around the net.  Project Pegasus being one of them.  What are some ways other than infrared lighting we can fight it if they do have the tech?

       Well I think that since infrared light has a lower frequency than visible light it will disrupt the equipment for faster than light travel since it will probably be based on visible light.

       I never said time travel is impossible. And only jokingly referred to you as a shill.

       Im just stating that if they were using time travel, we'd be in a whole different situation.

       You actually think they would shape the present time into what it is today? I highly doubt it

       Time travel doesn't mean they are omnipotent.  There is still the huge entropy of the universe they have to contend with.  For everything they change there are other reactions in society they need to contend with.  They don't know what will lead to what so they need to be careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time travel is a big deal and a hell of a tool for the NWO but that doesn't mean they can shape society into exactly whatever they wish.

       Oh you're a physicist? So light we see from the sun is slowed down by infrared light? So we should be able to see in the past by simply setting up an array of infrared lights?

       No its just their equipment will be most likely based on visible light.  Infrared light will throw it off base.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to get weird lights in the sky and on the ground outside my house that I think were time travelers popping in and out of their created wormholes.  I have surrounded my house with infrared lights and since then I haven't seen the lights or strange occurrences.  I believe it is an effective tool in disrupting their technology.

       So you're saying, if i step through a time portal, I will come out the other side a couple feet on the planet from where I stepped through? Even though the planet's location in space is millions or billions of miles from where it was/will be, at the time I stepped through?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so say you can time travel and end up on earth no matter what point in time you travel to... If I chose to go back 50 million years... my portal opens on top of a mountain in my current time...50 million years ago, that mountain was not there...I step through to the other side of the portal...what happens? I fall right?

       That's exactly what I'm saying. Except the entire planet earth wouldn't be where you are right now at this moment... If you were on the leading side of the planet and travelled 5 seconds into the future, you'd end up underground, like a simple rock. Buried. If you travelled 5 seconds into the past, you'd end up in the sky.

       You really need to be more open minded.  I don't know all the ins and outs of their technology but to me its pretty clear they can do that stuff.  I believe they sank the titanic by going back in time and killing an opponent to the current NWO.  Also the Hindenburg is a possibility.

       So was hitler a valuable target? Was jesus, if he even existed, a time traveler? Why wasn't JFK saved? Why not MLK? Why hasn't the there been a retroactive edit to the story of the plane hitting the pentagon, to where conclusive video is available to hush all the conspiracy theorists? Why are tasmanian tigers extinct?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no being open minded about it. Time travel is not possible. If it were, we'd be living in a utopian society right now. The one world government would have already been set up and running hundreds, if nto thousands of years ago. Any uprisings would have been retroactively put down. Your logic is flawed. Let me smoke some of that shit you got...

       They needed hitler to do what he would do.  Jesus, or the ones who wrote the bible could have easily been time travelers.

       You are saying if we had time travel tech they would just go back and fix everything.  This is false logic.  A utopia is not attainable and government control with fear is.  Bad things need to happen for the government to advance its goals.

       Right...so why wait hundreds or thousands of years to do this? Why not prevent the murder of Julius Caesar and steer him and his forces, since you already know what will happen to him? Why was there an American Revolution if the British Royalty controls the world? Why make it harder, if they could have just remained in control the entire time?

       That does make some sense but even so the people who believe in the NWO aren't a large entity by any means. Without resources how can 1 thwart a group that rules the world?

       Without proper intel it would be near impossible to identify someone who is  a part of the NWO. The only real factor seems to be money and or Jewish. I'm not even how one could get intel and verify its authenticity.

       I personally see a bit of possibility to Project Pegasus, but not enough to warrant much more than casual speculation. We just don't have enough evidence that time travel is possible, yet. I have no doubt that we will be able to perform feats such as time travel in the future, though.
If the NWO were able to time travel, I think that we would definitely have more evidence of their actions throughout history; and they would also be MUCH better at covering up their tracks in the present time.
Would you care to elaborate on the Titanic theory, though, OP? To be perfectly honest, I have been considering time travel as a possibility, but am getting nowhere with it. I will definitely say that I feel as though the narrative of history (and ancient history) is VERY skewed. Whether this has anything to do with time travel or not, I have no idea.

       According to John Titor,
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       government will no longer exist by the time it comes online in 2036. He implied it's the true purpose of CERN (for those who paid for it anyway), but I disagree; they are after an antimatter weapon, though time travel could easily be a by-product of that. If Titor is legit, your lights do nothing.
