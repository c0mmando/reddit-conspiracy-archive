    <div class="md"><p>For the same reason I&#39;d deride people talking about aliens, reptiles, hollow earth, whatever else. There are simply to many very real, very serious events happening right now. The U.S government is going down a seriously dark road and people here seem to be among the few that are paying attention. Let me be frank with you: I just don&#39;t have the <em>time</em> for that kind of stuff when we need to be discussing the out-in-the-open violent murder of U.S citizens by their own government without a trial, when our Constitutional rights are being stripped away without any resistance, when our privacy is being invaded in new and humiliating ways everywhere we go. 
There&#39;s just more important stuff to be worried about.</p>

<p>The government is withholding important information on all possible aspects of human life, so I guess our mission is to find it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can i please remind everyone what UFO stands for. <strong>Unidentified</strong> flying object.</p>

<p>Unidentified means we don&#39;t know what it is. It does not mean alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for crazy theories, i think they&#39;re awesome to think about, but to me it falls into the same realms as ancient aliens and Joe Rogan&#39;s pot-fueled &quot;zOMG THE UNIVERSE&quot; rants. I love Joe, i love his rants, i love the way that these things make you think about the world we live in, in a completely different fashion. But that&#39;s all it is. The problem other people have with this, is that you&#39;re putting the visitation of aliens and the possibility of time travel in with the same subjects as the JFK case and 9/11. They&#39;re not even close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with you here. i like to entertain all types of conspiracies even if i dont necessarily believe in it. I always end up getting something out of it. I like to believe there is always some truth or reasoning behind a conspiracy, even if it is something ridiculous like reptilian shape shifters, hollow earth, people surveying us from the moon, etc.. there is SOME reason why people think this way, whether it be true or not, it could reveal something else.</p>

<p>I realize on this subreddit there are people who intentionally post things to make all of us look crazy, im not talking about those people. I&#39;m talking about people who stand up for what they think even if it is something ridiculous, and try to have a real discussion about it. that is why we come here right?</p>

<p>I like jesse as well. even if he could be used as a pawn by our government to delude conspiracies to a silly tv show in the ranks of something like ghost adventures or the like (im not saying that is true). But at least you can tell HE believes in himself and he tries to do something about it. whether someone is to make a mockery of it is up to them. i say hes a good fellow. as are you!</p>

<p>I dpnt belive in the reptile, hollow earth stuff. But I do belive in alien life. </p>

<p>That being said - It doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is here and now and whether or not we have a future. The current scene hete with Earth governments is the difference between life and death, or at least life and slavery. </p>

<p>To talk about aliens, or time travel or reptile overlords won&#39;t get us anywhere. Getting people to see what&#39;s right in front of them in their own countries and homes is what&#39;s going to bring about a better world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, given the size of the universe, the time it has been here, the complexity for life to arise in the first place etc.  the real chances of intelligent life is quite remote.  Sure, there could be thousands of planets where life exists, micro organisms could be all over the place, there might even be animals on other planets.  Nobody knows why humans are intelligent, why we can question our own existence, build complex devices, understand and evolve complex scientific theories and laws.  </p>

<p>If you look at life on our own planet, all a creature needs is food, water and defence from predators.  Once it has these evolved, it doesn&#39;t need anything else.  Life on other planets will more likely resemble the life of the 99.99999% of species that we have already, and not the .0000001% that humankind represents. </p>

<p>As for UFOs, it is more likely an inter dimensional event.  That&#39;s presuming any real UFO has ever really existed.</p>

I&#39;ve seen that video you linked, and have read or watched nearly everything else I can get my mouse in related to time travel and aliens. A lot of it is ridiculous, but some things do have credibility.</p>

<p>What I see on this forum are trends...Aurora Theater videos posted over and over and over. Sandy Hook videos posted over and over and over. Dorner videos posted over and over and over. Not saying that there is anything wrong with #trending topics as twitter would call it, but it&#39;s the same shit here. People focus on one thing, the thing that&#39;s hot, the thing that&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>If there is something groundbreaking, something new in the time travel area, I bet this forum would be all over it. But most of the &quot;new&quot; stuff posted is just rehashing the same stuff over and over that was reposted 300 times previously with no new info added.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with time travel is that it generally violates the laws of physics somehow. Especially traveling back in time - violates causality, not to mention generates a sort of &quot;feedback loop&quot; which threatens the integrity of the universe. Also, it would take an insane amount of energy - or a way to make quantum foam - none of which is feasible at the moment.</p>

<p>Most of us are pretty laid back, but the very vocal minority in this subreddit ruin it for the rest of us. I don&#39;t know about you, but I came here to learn the other side of the story in everyday life, but some people take it waaaay too far. For instance; I can&#39;t see why anyone would look at Chris Dorner like he&#39;s some sort of hero. I have voiced my opinion and taken the down votes for it. Had to deal with some very rude people because I just don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; when it comes to Dorner. </p>

<p>About your time travel posts; this probably isn&#39;t the place for it (I know, right? Should be...) because once you get down voted in this subreddit enough, you go on a timer where you can only post once every ten minutes. Bullshit, huh? If you have a unpopular enough opinion, it&#39;s just one way they silence dissenters here.</p>

<p>Hope you find a better place to get your TT theories out there! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you dont get it man.  everything happens at the same time.  Past, present and future are all happening at once.  Only when observed by humans do we separate between.  Yesterday is only different because we perceive it as yesterday.</p>

<p>Take a look at the &quot;double slit experiment&quot;.  Reality changes when observed by humans.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc</a></p>

<p>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment</p>

<p>NOTHING is certain until it is observed.  If we observe anything as past, present or future it becomes such.  Not to mention that the universe is infinite.  Therefore nothing and everything is always happening NOW.</p>

<p>Do a bit of research of what NOW means, you will understand what I&#39;m talking about then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theoretically time travel is possible , time travel to &quot;the future&quot; is &quot;easy&quot; you just need higher speed , if you spend like 1 years on the space station you&#39;d travel 2 seconds into the future . Traveling to the past needs even more energy more like infinite energy , stating that people traveled to the past means they already developed infinite energy source  ad that&#39;s so unlikely .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But going into the past is like asking for an old document in am archive. But if you don&#39;t find this document our it doesn&#39;t exist then there is no way getting in to the past.</p>

<p>Travelling into the past must mean that somewhere the x,y,z position of every particle in the universe must have been recorded. The time-machine could then request this data and create a new universe out of it. But you never went back in time, you would only entered this new universe. And everything you alter there would not affect the dimension you originally came from.</p>

<p>Time travel into future is possible. But is travelling into the past just the reverse?
As you say travelling into the future requires going into space, so would going into the past require the opposite? You said, you would need an infinite amount of energy. But wouldn&#39;t that take you infinite years into the future?</p>

<p>If you were a time traveller going to the future and another person not travelling through space was watching you he would see you in super slow motion. For you time is going normal. You don&#39;t see what is going on around during the travel because it is going so fast.</p>

<p>I believe that everything you do, think and whatsoever is propelled by your environment (there is no such thing as free will under the name of god [i&#39;m an atheist] but rather your physical body being propelled by the environemnt taking rules like, when your hungry you take food, and when your tired you go to bed).</p>

<p>SO if you could somehow reverse all of this, history would go backwards. But in the same speed when going to the future. Time itself would still be going forward but the world, visually, would be going backwards.
Now, if you could somehow get out of this reversal state, you could normally travel into the future (the world backwards), and when you arrive you&#39;re desired time you could reverse the laws, make your alterations and travel back into the future.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this is possible at all and I find it very unlikely that time travel into the past is possible either.</p>

<li><p>Because it&#39;s bullshit. What if gravity travel were possible both ways? How many toddlers and Alzheimer patients would float to space and explode? What if all nature worked the way it works AND the way each of us secretly dreams it did? That would be a disaster, to put it mildly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We fear death and come up with crazy things in attempts to fool it - time travel being one of these crazy things. We can&#39;t fall up, we can&#39;t fly, we can&#39;t breathe under water, we can&#39;t visit those wonderful places from our dreams. We live 70-100 years, slaves to gravity, oxygen, lust and carbohydrates, and disappear. Everything else is denial.</p>

<p>The world that one hasn&#39;t created to his liking is a prison. Making guesses about who and how exactly runs this prison or what if this prison worked differently is a real waste of time. Anyone who claims to be a conspiracy nut, but doesn&#39;t fully concentrate on the escape from the prison, only makes the prison stronger.</p>

<p>Can you tell me which theories are &#39;very credible theories&#39; and will you tell me whose conspiring to manipulate our current reality?</p>

<p>9/11 truth = Has no scientific backing.</p>

<p>Chemtrails = Has no scientifc backing.</p>

<p>Anti Vaccines = Has no scientific backing.</p>

<p>Holocaust Denial = Has no historical backing.</p>

<p>Climate Change Denial = Has no scientific Backing.</p>

<p>There are no theories that have the scientific backing of any group or body of researchers working in ANY field related to 9/11.</p>

<p>Every society of civil engineers in the world  agree on the reason for tower collapse. Just because you can find quotes from a handful of engineers who disagree with the findings, doesn&#39;t make it a credible fucking theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also possible of course that you are just a wanker.  </p>

<p>9/11 support has no scientific backing.
Pro-Vaccines has no scientific support
Holocaust support has no scientific support
Climate change belief has no scientific belief</p>

<p>these all being true then why wouldn&#39;t chemtrails also be possibly harmful.  Trails of chemicals could easily be harmful.</p>

<p>Its strange that you use science like a libtard troll uses science.  Like its a slogan and not like its science.  It&#39;s strange too that you are so desperate to use it on the very issues which science does not agree with you with instead of say sandy hook or illuminati.</p>

<p>You are called a shill because you are a callow wanker.  It&#39;s nothing to do with someone who is sincerely perplexed about advanced future society and time travel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that likely though to be the opinion of someone who actually believes in time travel conspiracies?  No, of course not.  Every example you gave of your slogan term &#39;science<sup>TM&#39;</sup> just reveals you as a wanker.  There is no actual scientific support for any of them.  Compare the examples you give as &#39;Science<sup>TM&#39;</sup> with Sandy Hook or the Illuminati you didn&#39;t stick with for example.</p>

<p>It is also characteristic of libtard retards that as well as obsessing over how clever they are they also express this in blank faced screeching of incomprehension - that couldn&#39;t possibly be a result of their being retards of course or wrong so therefore is always valid.  And always the sign of a genuine sociopathic retard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you keep mentioning sandy hook and illuminati when you talk about science?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mention scientific backing for those 2, because they have absolutely nothing to do with science. Illuminati is a made up satanic cult, and sandy hook was a guy shooting up a school...</p>

<p>When was the last time you went to see a doctor? I really advise you stop coming here, because these upvotes make you think you&#39;re actually right, and it&#39;s making your mental illness more severe. It&#39;s validating your schizophrenic ramblings and causing them to become more and more severe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again this attempt to get people to stop &#39;coming here&#39; is another sign of a semitic Anti-Semitic racist &#39;fundie more fundie than his mummy&#39; atheist.  In other words a troll which is why people are treating you as a troll and a dickhead.  Because you are one as  your every post on this thread shows.</p>

<p>As for upvotes they have no effect on me.  Not everyone is actually effected by a need to belong to a herd.  Semitic Anti-semitic racist cattle like you fundie brats are shaped by that type of thinking of course.</p>

<p>This is my actual upvote downvote history by subreddit.  My rating in most upvotes is at the top for r/todayilaerned and my rating for most downvotes is at the bottom with r/conspiracy.  I know that it is at the bottom because I am always attacking scumbag semitic anti-semitic fundie status-faggots and their attempts to enforce a republican democrat dichotomization on everyone and that my - because I am British perhaps - indifference to that enrages them.</p>

<p>By your logic it is r/todayilearned that I should be avoiding like the plague and putting the boot into scumbag status-faggot fundies is what I should spend all my energies on.</p>

<p>You dumped Sandy Hook and Illuminati because lots of people would agree with you.  Which is not what you want being hostile as well as trying to threaten people to stay away from the subreddit.  Like all zombies grooming as excluded anyone who is not a zombie all you want is for no one to have any opinion different from yours but you stuck with the most idiotic theories that no one would agree with you about so you were just circle jerking here. </p>

<p>Your entire argument about upvotes has failed and just rebounded on yourself so you are now going to resort to libtards obsession about &#39;Cleverness<sup>TM&#39;</sup> and not understand why I keep laughing at you. </p>
