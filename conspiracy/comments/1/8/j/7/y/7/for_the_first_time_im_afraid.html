        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Other than the occasional herb, I&#39;m a law abiding citizen.  I work, I went to college, I drive the speed limit, I pay taxes, and I don&#39;t terroristically plot.  I&#39;ve been following conspiracies for a little over two years now and have found many convincing clues to the world we are living in/about to live in.  What clues?  $222 trillion dollar fiscal gap, disarming of citizens, DHS bulking up on ammo, DHS trying to pass FEMA camps, CISPA, NDAA, the entire eastern hemisphere is on the brink of war/nuclear war, massive climate change, frequent drone usage, assassinations: the list goes on.  I have a feeling the economy is going to collapse right around the time half the world decides to go to war.  Many places in the US will have no access to resources like fuel, food, medication, then necessities such as water( or pleasantries like electricity and internet ).  People will be rounded up and sent to these camps in the guise of protection, but they will never be allowed to leave.  Anyone who opposes will be dealt with accordingly.  People will be forced to work in these camps in order to pay their stay, much like what happens in prisons. </p>

<p>Is this the only possibility?  Of course not.  We could also be on the brink of an ice age following one of the hottest summers on record( I read something the other day that mentioned by 2015 there will be places too hot to live on earth ).  </p>

<p>So why am I afraid for the first time in a long time( that same fear I felt the first time I started studying the Kennedy assassination for finding out there was so much that&#39;s hidden )?  I&#39;ve always said that I would be willing to fight back, that I would never give up what few guns I have, that I would be more willing to go live in the forest than ever go stay in a camp or work as a slave.  While watching the cabin shootout with Dorner, it really scared me.  There was a small army of police officers firing a non stop wall of bullets towards that cabin, right before they burned it down.  No man could live through that, at least not by himself.  I&#39;ve always been good at placing myself in someone else&#39;s shoes, being able to see and experience what they see.  So I did that with Dorner.  What if I was Dorner, I was innocent - hadn&#39;t murdered anyone( regardless of what actually happened ), and I was just running for my life?  It&#39;s terrifying.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anything will change due to politics at this point.  &quot;Peaceful revolution&quot; is no longer possible. Our voices are shut out before anyone can listen, and anyone who disagrees with the public narrative is crazy.  Think you deserve internet privacy?  You must be a terrorist.  Want to keep your guns?  You must want to shoot up a school or movie theater.  You don&#39;t want drones with killing power flying over your house?  Only enemies of the US need to be afraid of those.  Don&#39;t want fluoride in your water or pesticides on your genetically modified crops?  Obviously you&#39;re schizophrenic.  </p>

<p>So should I be afraid/worried?  If yes or no, why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Fear is the mind killer.&quot;</p>

<p>Whenever I begin to feel fear creep upon me, like a paralyzing poison, I ask myself, &quot;What are you afraid of?&quot; My answer changes from time to time, but consistently I find myself responding, &quot;I am afraid for the human race&quot; or &quot;I am afraid to die without first helping to raise humanity above this stage of life&quot;. I take solace in this knowledge, because I believe that many people on this planet are afraid of the very same thing. Fear is a very real part of the lives that we lead during this phase of life, and to deny it&#39;s existence or pretend as though it does not affect you is as terrible as to succumb to it. Let fear motivate you for courageous acts, to do things that you would not be able to do unless you had the power of fear inside of you.</p>

<p>I also reflect on the many minds that I have encountered in life; beautiful, creative, unique minds who think for themselves and will not submit to control and oppression. We are not alone, OP. Fear can sometimes make us feel as though we are, but know that no matter where you are or what situation you are in, you are a part of something larger, and there are people who will support you when you fall, and carry on your fight when you taste your last breath. </p>

<p>The forces that align against freedom <em>know</em> that we are afraid, and to think that it will be an easy task to bring them to justice is very naive. But they are also afraid, afraid of this justice, because they are just as human as we are. What defines us, what makes <em>us</em> diffrerent from <em>them</em> is how we use our fear. They have used fear to control us, prevent us from reaching our true potential. We will use fear to free everyone; even those who have sought to control us.</p>

<p>When I reflect on this, I&#39;m no longer afraid. I feel... hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you should feel liberated. Mystery is an intellectual process. Suspense is an emotional process (Alfred Hitchcock). So be grateful that you took your time to observe the world around you and be active. For example, ask friends and family some questions that they most likely won&#39;t know the answer to, but is well supported as fact i.e. 9/11 Building 7, the terrorist&#39;s passport that managed to survive a plane crash, or Dorner&#39;s multiple wallets found (1 even survived the cabin fire). </p>

<p>Remember, knowledge is power and the pen is mightier than the sword...  peaceful revolution is still possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the record, Occupy was doomed to fail from the start. 
As someone who spent weeks at my local Occupy camp, I can tell you that EVERYONE there had their own agendas for being there. Pretty much no one had a singular goal in mind. Half the attendees (in my city at least) were just homeless folks looking for a place to camp. Another quarter of the people there were literally just there to be able to say &quot;I went to Occupy, I&#39;M A PROTESTOR!&quot;.</p>

<p>EDIT; Not to mention the people who rolled up Friday evening and whipped out &quot;SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT!&quot; signs, then rolled out back to work on Sunday evening. Funny the number of them driving big ass SUVs in the city.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not use their own tools against them?  Start finding personal information of &quot;yes men&quot; and corrupt officials.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need this to start in a guns blazing fashion, i think it would be much more effective to make some of them go &quot;missing&quot; before to many of you true Americans go missing.  What better way to stop them in their tracks then for them to think they are not safe unless fully guarded at all times?
People seeing regular old politicians with personal guards everywhere, all the time, might send a stronger message, and be less malleable for the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds more like you are waking up, which is a terrifying experience.  All those safety pillars built in your head come tumbling down.  Those pillars were built by someone else, but now you are liberated.  </p>

<p>Fear is often an irrational response and sometimes we cannot control it.  Take the fear of flying - why are people terrified of the safest mode of travel?  Because our minds are polluted with negative images.  Changing your perception is much more effective than changing your world.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, in all of your existence - how much of your life has actually been in danger?  I suspect it&#39;s quite low, and that fact hasn&#39;t changed - only your minds perception of realty has.  Throughout history, the idea of &#39;armageddon&#39; has been pushed because a scared populace is easily managed; we&#39;re just at a new chapter.  You will, without a doubt become a stronger person through all this.  Become responsible for your thoughts, words &amp; actions.  Do not depend on &#39;the state&#39; <strong>for anything</strong>; instead treat it with respect and a healthy does of wariness.  You are a part of something bigger, that isn&#39;t physical, that cannot be destroyed.  You aren&#39;t a sack of feeble meat, reduced to basic animal instincts.  You are a spark of infinity, realize this and you will rise above your fears.  I wish you well!</p>

<p>The FEMA camp thing has been a red herring since the beginning of FEMA. The first time I heard about them (I&#39;m in my late 30s), they were Clinton&#39;s idea to round up all the Christians and put them in jail. The next time I heard about them, they were W&#39;s idea, and were to round up all the liberals and minorities and put them in jail. And here they are again, but now they&#39;re Obama&#39;s idea to put... I guess Christians back in jail...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the entire eastern hemisphere is on the brink of war/nuclear war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it really isn&#39;t. I live in Japan. I&#39;m not even slightly worried about it. Not even a little bit.</p>

<p>China is literally and figuratively testing the waters to see if they can get away with stealing some islands that are pretty clearly not theirs, because there are natural gas resources under them. They are basically playing the &quot;I&#39;m not touching you&quot; game with the Japanese navy to see if they can prompt a small altercation, which will give the weakening Chinese government a bunch of populist cred back home, because if there&#39;s anything a brainwashed Chinese peasant hates, it&#39;s the Japanese, who are responsible, somehow, for their grandparents&#39; and great-grandparents&#39; generations&#39; military misadventures in China, which the Chinese government have mostly fabricated. They want to see what the US does. They&#39;re playing stupid games, and that&#39;s all. </p>

<p>North Korea just wants some more pies because Jong-Un ate them all. The only thing I really see happening here—if anything does happen, which it won&#39;t—is China finally giving the blessing to S. Korea and the US to finish the Korean war. But until they do that, it&#39;s just going to drip away like it has been doing for decades. </p>

<p>Do you see what I&#39;m getting at? The big players in Asia are China and the US, and China and the US are sure as shit not going to go to war. So relax.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>massive climate change</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, and man-made, too. But unlike what Gore and others tell you, this isn&#39;t really going to be that big a deal. They love to talk about refugees fleeing the coasts. Not going to happen. It&#39;ll take decades at least for the water levels to rise, giving people plenty of time to <em>just move.</em> Land changes all the time. It doesn&#39;t cause refugee disasters. People just get a different place to live. </p>

<p>We will get through climate change. I promise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>frequent drone usage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is bad shit. But again, it&#39;s mostly in the open, and if it&#39;s in the open, it can be regulated. We just need to get some laws on the books. It&#39;s doable, and would be popular.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>assassinations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a new thing. This has been happening since the beginning of time. It&#39;s bad, but it&#39;s just noise. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a feeling the economy is going to collapse right around the time half the world decides to go to war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The economy may indeed collapse. But ask yourself this: If money disappeared, would you die? It doesn&#39;t exist. Cows don&#39;t stop making milk because no one is there to give their owners some worthless scraps of paper. The land doesn&#39;t stop producing plants if some numbers on a screen get bigger or smaller...</p>

<p>If you&#39;re in the US, you&#39;re fine (unless you live in a big city, in which case, I suggest you have a plan for getting out if you need to). I live in frickin&#39; Japan. We only have 40% food self-sufficiency here! If the world economy flatlines, we starve!</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not actually worried about that. I think we&#39;re going to go into some very hard times, all over the world, over the next few decades, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be <em>Mad Max.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>So should I be afraid/worried? If yes or no, why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You—all of us—should be ever wary and watchful and thoughtful. We must oppose impositions on our liberties in the name of security or morality (it&#39;s actually the latter that is used more frequently and more effectively—people are all in favor of making sure that perverts don&#39;t touch their privates while looking at pictures of kids, even though that means that everyone&#39;s online activity will be monitored; in a free society, we&#39;d only really care about the asshole hurting the kid, and consider the moral crusade to more dangerous than the socially-irresponsible masturbation it tries to root out). We must demand transparency and accountability. We must remember that we are <em>not</em> slaves, <em>not</em> subjects, and refuse to act as though we were. And we have to encourage others to think the same way.</p>

<p>The government has no power. None. Why not? <em>Because it doesn&#39;t exist.</em> It&#39;s an entirely human invention, which only has <em>control.</em> The difference between power and control is that the latter is <em>consensual.</em> If I&#39;m really strong and trained in hand-to-hand combat, I can have power over you. But that really isn&#39;t very useful, because to use it, I have to beat you up all the time. It&#39;s too much work. So what I do is I beat you enough that you <em>give me control,</em> in return for not beating you up. That&#39;s a lot more useful and convenient for all involved.</p>

<p>So, in the case of a large organization like the government, what would they do to assert their power if they were losing control? They&#39;d call the military, right? <em>BZZZZzzt!</em> Wrong. The military is made up of the very same people who have to submit in order for the government to have any control. &quot;Go shoot your grandma!&quot; is not really an order that is likely to be followed, especially against the backdrop of widescale civil disobedience and an erosion of the perceived legitimacy of the state.</p>

<p>Who do you have to fear, then?</p>

<p>Cops. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it. Those guys are nuts. Or, rather, a large enough minority of them are nuts as to make the whole organization dangerous. Avoid the cops, and you&#39;re fine.</p>

<p>Calm down. Conspiracy theory serves an important role in preserving freedom, because it asks &quot;what if.&quot; It extrapolates from the known, into the unknown, and identifies dangerous trends. It is totally healthy to think about it, but keep in mind that no one in this &quot;field&quot; actually knows any more than you do. Think rationally and critically, and when you talk to others about it, approach it that way. The more people we can get to keep a skeptical mind when watching the news, the stronger, safer, and happier our republic will be.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM:</p>

<p>I just re-read my comment and wanted to expand on this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The economy may indeed collapse. But ask yourself this: If money disappeared, would you die? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I lived in Japan during the earthquake and its aftermath. Now, I&#39;m a long way from the worst of it, but it really gave me hope. When shit hits the fan, people figure out what to do. We&#39;re not robots. We&#39;re not cattle. We&#39;re human beings, and when we need each other, we&#39;re genetically programmed to put aside differences such as what piece of wood someone prays to, or who they voted for, or what&#39;s between the legs of their life partner and <em>get shit done.</em> Humanity is invincible. We will survive. We will <em>thrive.</em> We must be ever vigilant in rooting out the bad habits that keep us from our potential (protectionism, busybodying, moral outrage, dishonesty, oppression), but as long as we stay connected to each other, we will always win. We don&#39;t need internet access. We don&#39;t need TVs. We don&#39;t need political parties. Our needs are very basic, and I&#39;m not afraid of losing them.</p>

<p>We are not slaves. We are not subjects. We are free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well spoken. What&#39;s basically happening is the establishment is trying to make us afraid. The news media is usually the best way they do this. Oh, there&#39;s liberal media and conservative media, but consider that the majority of them are controlled by only a few international corporations that share the same agenda. Essentially, the opposing sides of Liberal Media vs. Conservative Media by the end of the day is more than likely no more real than any other show on TV. So, a fearful populace is a populace that&#39;s easier to manipulate. Fear was used to get the public&#39;s support for two illegal wars, and the passage of laws which limit our civil liberties. Fears was used to get the public to support bailing out the &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks rather than punishing them for crashing economy.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t really anything to be afraid of, as you said. Its just an illusion, mere window dressing, yet more often than not it works. However, more and more people are waking up around the world. They&#39;re seeing through the illusion and they&#39;re not afraid. The fears Stevo182 talked about result from the establishment being in a panic, and they&#39;re making mistakes. Fear has always been their most effective tool to get their way, but now that tool is loosing its power. That power was never real, but it had influence over the people only because they allowed it to. This is changing, and now the establishment is afraid.</p>

<p>Have you seen the new series by the guy who created the Zeitgeist movies. Its called <em>Culture in Decline</em>, a very thoughtful and rational commentary on the state of things in our world. They&#39;re being released on Youtube, he has three episodes up now with a forth coming in March.</p>

<p>More or less. Political parties (or, more precisely, their donors/owners) find a fearful populace to be easier to control, and that makes it easier to get away with whatever selfish idiotic thing they want to do today. </p>

<p>They are aided by a complicit mass media, who has found that fear sells. Also, as you note, these things are so rich these days that they are also the hands on the political purse strings, so all together you have a vicious cycle of fear and abuse. Turn it off and look around you. The vast majority of people are pretty frickin&#39; great. Connect with your neighbors, and invest in your community. Bad news from the other side of the world can&#39;t hurt you. </p>

<p>The entire &quot;liberal vs. conservative&quot; thing is a ruse. The philosophical universe is <em>a la carte.</em> You don&#39;t have to buy your viewpoints in bulk. I, for example, have quite a few strong opinions that are associated with libertarian/anarchist beliefs, as well as some pretty textbook liberal positions.</p>

<p>Same here. Nothing is ever just Black &amp; White, its always different Shades of Gray. The whole <em>Left Wing vs. Right Wing</em> thing is just meant as an instrument to divide us. Granted, there are some out there who have taken their views to the heights of lunacy, but the majority of so-called Right Wing Conservatives have very reasonable views.</p>

<p>To effect real change we need to first overcome the artificial barriers erected between us by the media, by politicians, and by the church. Once we start working together we&#39;ll discover that we&#39;re not all that different from one another. The establishment has put a lot of effort into making us afraid of one another, but the truth is it is us that they are afraid of. They&#39;re afraid of what we can accomplish when we all work together, when ours thoughts and will are united as one.</p>

<p>This is why they perpetuate the Myth of Us vs. Them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t give into the fear. We are indeed, embroiled in circumstances which would make any cogent person be afraid. Pretty much everything you listed there I have researched and concluded that what is not conspiracy fact, is at least extremely suspect. But fear is the mind killer, and if we want to make this a better world we have to focus on that goal, and live in hope. As I&#39;ve been going along this path of learning, I&#39;ve come across amazing, astounding information that is incredibly positive, and in so many ways it outweighs all of this Illuminati, NWO, the elite against us, business. Just share what you know, and have hope. And to echo jimmy8489, knowledge is power, and peaceful revolution is still and always possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing new about deception. It&#39;s not something reserved only for this generation of people or only regarding doctrines about the end times. Men have been deceiving people from the very beginning and have been responsible for the fall of many societies before ours.  We, as a society, have blindly followed what we were told; jumping onboard with this theory or that one until we&#39;ve entirely lost our compass or ability to ascertain evil at first sight.  We&#39;ve believed it and taken it to heart until it&#39;s become the mindset of our entire society.  The fact is, those men weren&#39;t born evil, they acquired it somewhere along the way.  Be it, greed, power, money, hatred, perversion or self aggrandizement, they obtained it from somewhere.  Ask yourself where it came from, see how it&#39;s blossomed over the thousands of years since the beginning, and then think about who told you about it beforehand, so you could be prepared for it and not be afraid.  I&#39;m not afraid, a little worried maybe, but not afraid.  I know how it&#39;s going to end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Fear is only present in the absence of true danger.&quot;- Eckhart Tolle</p>

<p>Basically, you feel fear because you are not actually in a life threatening situation, while you are placing your mind in a life threatening situation.  In an actual life threatening situation, you don&#39;t feel fear because the body knows you don&#39;t have room for it.  It&#39;s fight or flight.  And in Dorner&#39;s case it was fight.  </p>

<p>I hope that if/when things start to unravel, and the government gets more and more tyrannical (FEMA camps, martial law, censorship and loss of first amendment, gun bans/confiscations) people realize you don&#39;t need to be afraid.  If you fight like Dorner did, for a GOOD reason (not necessarily the killing family members part but the exposing the truth part), they can&#39;t win.  They can kill you, but if they kill one of their own citizens standing up for what is right, they&#39;ve lost.  I would rather die fighting a government that was oppressing it&#39;s own people than live in fear under it.  At that point, you can die laughing in their face while they are shooting you, because everything you fought for and believe in, everything they brainwash you into thinking they would never do, they just did.  </p>

<p>But I&#39;m comfortable dying for a good cause, (how much worse can death be than a FEMA camp?).  And I don&#39;t even know what to believe happens after death, but just like when you do something you&#39;ve never done before (the unknown), you get into it and realize that you can make it through it. The after-life (if there is one) is the same way.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid man, when push comes to shove, the American people can push harder than the government can shove.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might consider who has a vested interest in you believing in a purely material world.   </p>

<p>How has the elite managed to keep hundreds (if not thousands) of people quiet about 9/11, the Oklahoma City bombing, the 7/7 London bombings, the 60s assassinations?  Most likely through financial inducements and threats on participants&#39; lives.   Take away the fear of death and the PTB would lose the biggest lever they have to force compliance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think many people take the idea of an afterlife completely wrong.  Will you continue influencing the events of reality after death?  No.  Will you still be you after death?  Of course not.  When you die, all of your senses also die.  You lose the ability to experience.  Does that mean that everything that is &#39;you&#39; ends as well?  Not necessarily.  Defining the self as well as consciousness has taken many years and many thousands of scientists and philosophers alike to still be inconclusive.  Your material body, your memories and actions will always be locked to this realm, re purposed back to the earth and eventually the stars.  You go back to being everything, and yet nothing at the same time.  It takes experiencing that to believe it or have any fathom of what it&#39;s like to die.  It&#39;s an ineffable state of being, and in life and death you are always &#39;being.&#39;  I don&#39;t believe in a personal god, nor do I see a god as a separate entity from the universe that we occupy/ourselves, so Pascal&#39;s Wager is irrelevant.  I can point to dozens of cases of NDEs, psychedelic revelations, and periods where people were literally brain dead while experiencing eternity that are all based in science&#39;s understanding of our physical realm, but without going to the edge of the universe and looking back in from the outside, there&#39;s no way you could ever know what it was like until it happened to you.  We&#39;re part of something very beautiful, very infinite, and very complex.  It&#39;s a shame to spend so much of it fighting about who is right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t understand it either. It&#39;s faith. Pure and true. No facts or evidence needed, you just believe in it. Its dumb but I even catch myself &quot;praying&quot; for things to go better, Please don&#39;t let it rain and yatta yatta yatta. There is no proof and any proof would be questioned anyway. If &quot;god&quot; came down tomorrow and said fix this shit or you all die, niggas would be like &quot;project blue beam bitches&quot; and nothing would change. Trying to understand faith is like explaining why all retarded kids make the same noises, who taught them those noises anyway or is it just retarded kid intuition, &quot;instead of coherently asking for a glass of milk I&#39;m gonna scream &#39;nyyaaahhhhh&#39; and flail my arms around&quot;, is it a thought at all or just pure action in the moment. Just like magnets dude, just enjoy its power and the entertainment it provides. Seeing pastors get busted for coke and hookers makes everything fall into perspective, faith or no faith we&#39;re pretty much all disgusting bags of flesh that exists to make things interesting for a little while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elites are very likely thick with psychopaths.</p>

<p>Psychopaths use fear and confusion to control their marks.</p>

<p>The brain, when under stress, shuts down in a systematic and predictable fashion. The first thing to shut down, under stress / fear is the pre-frontal cortex. This is where your deep thinking happens. It&#39;s also where empathy and reason reside. You are then reduced to mamalian thought Which is tribal and still compassionate, but not as sophisticaed in terms of subtle decision making. When you&#39;re under high stress - like mortal danger - you go all the way down into the reptilian brain for your thinking. This is pure survival. Yes / no is about as complex as you&#39;ll get. </p>

<p>Do not submit to fear.</p>

<p>Why? Because at that point you&#39;re no better than a psychopath. </p>

<p>We need as many fully functioning humans as possible. You&#39;re not going to be the one that saves all of humanity. You <em>are</em> humanity. The more aware people we have who are clear thinking and level-headed the better. Don&#39;t listen to fear porn [Alex Jones] and don&#39;t let the psychopaths scare you [businessmen / politicians]. You make decisions for yourself and do so with all the wisdom and insight that you can. This is achieved through study and contemplation - tools that are not in the psychopathic mindset. Just by being the best person you can be you&#39;re already on the winning side.</p>

<p>&quot;They may break my body, but they will never have my mind.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i know how you feel, my fiancee today said that there is something not right with this dorner case, she said the LAPD seems like they are covering something up.   And she is not a conspiracy believer either.   Maybe its a good thing that people like her are able to see the light now.  Just last night i was listening to C2C am with george noory and the first guest was a psychologist who compared dorner to the school shooters and said that he was like a child who didnt get his way so he started killing people as a way to act out.  Now before this statement i had always thought of the show as a theater of the mind program, something to spurn the imagination with. But now i realize that it is nothing more than controlled information being released by a fringe organization in order to marginalize those who think differently.  Because after the guest said this george said &quot; there are a lot of people who support this dorner guy, whats wrong with them?&quot; Having read his original manifesto i can see how he could have snapped.  And i dont agree with killing, but i do support the idea of reforming the corruption that is rampant in the LAPD.  So Being told i have something wrong with me because i believe in fairness and lawful conduct by a police force is a slap in the face.</p>

<p>For the first time, I&#39;m afraid.</p>

<p>Good.  The reason for this is because you finally feel and understand that the shit that was &quot;out there&quot; that was happening to the world and &quot;everybody else&quot; is now at YOUR front door step and can happen to <em>you</em>.  What you need to do now is get ready to ACT.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid.  Be prepared.  Arm yourself both figuratively with continued knowledge and literally with fucking guns.</p>

<p>Get ready.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, don&#39;t worry about the so called climate change.  It is a pack of lies that the gvts are using to squeeze more taxes out of everyone.  The poles move all the time.  Seeing videos from the North Pole are meaningless, because the true North Pole is now somewhere in Canada, so the historic NP has thawed considerably. </p>

<p>I live in Thailand, and can state categorically that the temperatures are the same as ever. Hot n humid :). Actually, the last couple of years the temps have been a bit lower than normal.  I don&#39;t think we had many days that broke 100f.  Australia was very hot this year, but next year it&#39;ll probably be cooler.  The weather just happens!  If you want some perspective, go up in a plane and look down at industrial China.  Even flying over the most heavily industrial areas where you can see smoke rising, it is an insignificant, not even the size of a pin amount of pollution.  Sure it looks scarily seeing it belching out from close up.  Take a step upwards 30k feet and you&#39;ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>War very wel may happen, but the US army are now so well armed, so well trained.  Nobody but the completely insane would try it.  Sure North Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia all kicked the US&#39;s ass a few decades ago, but they weren&#39;t as well trained back then.  They went in thinking it was going to be like a John Wayne movie.  Not the case now!  The US army is now the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen.  If Iran or N Korea were to have a go now they&#39;d be almost instantly smashed into the ground.  After six weeks of constant carpet bombing, 24 hours per day, anyone left alive is completely insane and just want it to stop.  If N Korea launched a nuke or even a few the US would retaliate with such ferocity that there would be no N Korea.  What is most important is that the Iranians know this and the N Koreans who are clued up (high military and those in gvt) also know this.  None of them are in the mood to commit suicide.</p>

<p>Disarming of citizens will not happen.  It is a liberal movement and as such it is getting a lot of media attention, because the media is liberal.  However, the right to bear arms is a constitutional right that cannot simply be done away with.  However, the liberals do have a fair point.  Weaklings use guns, they are an easy weapon.  It is very difficult to go on a knife rampage and murder 30 people in five minutes, but any faggy kid can do that with guns.  However, saying this the USA is a country where you have the right to own a gun, so tool up!</p>

<p>Peaceful revolutions are a myth.  Violence or the threat of it is what causes change.  Sure M. Luther King wrote some amazing speeches, but nothing happened until Malcolm X advocated the use of weapons, and the black panther movement actually started to get some legs.  If things hadn&#39;t have changed when they did an awful lot of rich white folk would have been murdered.  Same with Ghandi, the British didn&#39;t leave until it got a bit nasty over there.  The Berlin Wall came down relatively peacefully, but again, the system had reached the end, everybody knew it, if the gvts of the old eastern block tried to fight it (as some did) there was such an overwhelming feeling of boredom with communism, even amongst their own military that it just had to go.  If it hadn&#39;t then it would have turned very nasty.  As it did in the countries like Romania, where the ruling elite still felt they were having a good time.</p>

<p>Fluoride, pesticides and modified crops have been in the EU for 40 years, life expectancy has risen to well into the 80s in all of Europe.  I believe the EU people live almost a decade longer than folks in the US.  Again, don&#39;t worry!  Fluoride occurs naturally in water anyway, yes it&#39;s deadly in high doses but nobody is about to be guzzling the kinds of amounts that&#39;ll wipe anyone out.  If you&#39;re really worried why not buy spring water.  Or better yet find the closest natural spring to you (they are everywhere).  If you don&#39;t like pesticides then grow your own fruit and veg, it takes only a small amount of land to grow stuff and you can get a greenhouse for more exotic things.  Or just buy organic.</p>

<p>Stop buying into the hysteria.  Your media loves making you feel insecure.  Take mine and many others advice.  Stop watching the TV, stop watching movies, stop reading the news.  Set your Internet home page to a hobby page like dpreview or Engadget.  Do not even pick up a newspaper to check the sports scores.  Keep all conversations with friends and work colleagues light hearted, if anyone starts talking about current events just politely walk away.   The most empowering thing anyone can do is to give power back to themselves by not playing the game.  If you no longer see, hear or read about anything that&#39;s going on, none of it will concern you.  You will learn that the gvts have very little real power, you can live your life pretty much as you like.</p>

<p>I personally love the intrigue of supposed &#39;current events&#39;.  I also think its great that more and more people have caught on with the &quot;it&#39;s all lies&quot;.  Because in truth, it is all lies.  Chris Donner may never have even existed in the first place, all a stage managed event using secret service actors.  Either way, his life and death, real or fiction will lead to zero effect on yours or my life.  Let the fall of the Berlin Wall be a lesson.  Only once everyone becomes bored of a system will it ever truly change.  Once you are bored of it, you will just stop watching and stop discussing it, because its boring!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those of you who come in here peddling spirituality, please don&#39;t.  I would consider myself an entirely enlightened individual with inner peace, as I set several months of my life aside quite some time ago to explore reality and read everything I could get my hands on.  I&#39;ve considered every possible theory posited by this or that, spirit science, extra terrestrials, consciousness.  I&#39;m centered and don&#39;t necessarily feel spirituality has much to do with it at this point.  It&#39;s somewhat different now though.  Everything seems so sudden, like so much more is happening all at once, and no one is trying to hide anything it just hides itself.  I would know how to survive if a scenario came where I had to as I was educated on it a lot as I grew up.  I also subscribe to <a href="/r/Survival">/r/Survival</a> and <a href="/r/collapse">/r/collapse</a> just for educational purposes.  I&#39;m worried about everyone else more than myself, and mostly I&#39;m curious about what&#39;s to come.  My fear stems from being helpless in a situation like that, being framed, being killed, because it is allowed to happen.</p>

<p>As for the political situation, there you may have reason to worry. Not about war ... when has America ever been attacked by a foreign army? It&#39;s been a long time, right? And don&#39;t say WW2 -- there was no serious attempt made to attack during WW2. But you may need to worry about the fascist police state, and about a deliberately-engineered economic collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s bad enough out there that I&#39;ll say this. (Bring on the down votes!) </p>

<p>If you fear anything Fear god and his Will, which is in part that most of us are trapped by our own misdeeds and emotions that we continue to suffer because we deny our own true divine natures. </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to us individually to break free of all our illusions that hold us back. Fear is one of the bigger illusions. Fear of ridicule, aggression, down votes. It&#39;s all temporary bullshit. </p>

<p>How can someone brought up knowing only fear transcend it and learn Joy? Ecstasy? Most won&#39;t because they are too busy being afraid to see the silver lining or the truth. They&#39;ve grown accustomed to the darkness in their minds and shrink from the light of Truth.</p>

<p>This is the place where spirits and souls are stolen and lost to the enemy. Many from the day they are born! Seriously. Think with the right hemisphere of your brain. Their are a multitude of realities, some of them are even sacred and full of Love, Joy and Compassion, connection, oneness. Few people ever get to experience that reality but we all have access to it. It is our birth right.</p>

<p>For just a second convince yourself The Creator God actually exists and operates mainly in those realities. I know that He does. Beyond fear, beyond Hate. Beyond all description. All pervading and infinite, your soul is a spec of that infinite divine nature. Pure consciousness. Call it Tao or Nature or the Universe. Whatever. We are all connected to this matrix through divinity. So what&#39;s holding us back?</p>

<p>We needlessly cling to temporary bullshit. The media drama of the week, Failed relationships, material wealth, flawed world views, Ideologies etc...  Mostly we are too afraid of our own death and imprisonment to risk rebelling in any meaningful way. What empowers me is that they can&#39;t kill my spirit and they can&#39;t cage my mind. They can do it to anyone else, even those I know and love but not me. I&#39;ve seen too much to turn away now. Well that&#39;s my rant. I&#39;ll leave you all with this old boring quote:</p>

<p>“I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn&#39;t, than live my life as if there isn&#39;t and die to find out there is.”</p>
