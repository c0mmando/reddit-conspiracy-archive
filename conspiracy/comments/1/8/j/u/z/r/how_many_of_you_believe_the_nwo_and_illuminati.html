       I was just reading through some posts on this subreddit and noticed a lot of people saying to get right with God and whatnot, which is weird to see on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just confused about it. I know that in the book or Revelation, a one world order and everything that tptb wants is prophecised, and now with the pope resigning and the "Prophecy of the Popes" got me even more freaked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just hoping for some opinions.

       Religion is to keep us away from finding out true power locked away in ourselves. Look into DNA and light-photons. Look into the codons that are being more active in children being born in the last 10 years. It's interesting stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to control us from every angle from religion to entertainment. Look into Mystery Babylon.

       That's still not proof. They could be your friends hands, or mom's, or whoevers. I don't know what you look like, so it's impossible for you to actually prove you are showing me YOUR two hands.

       I can type with one hand, and I could very well get someone to type for me, or use the software to do voice to text.

      <p>
       You say "With this evidence" Yet you have shown me nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You definitely have
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       proven in any way that you have two hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're going by our word, instead of showing each other actual physical evidence, I'll rest my case by saying that when I asked Jesus to heal me of depression, He did. So, therefore, He is proven real.
      </p>
      <p>
       You use the effect that your supposed hands have on the keyboard (allowing you to type) as evidence for your hands (which isn't evidence, but I'm playing this your way), so it's logical for me to say the effect of me praying to Jesus and me being healed proves He is real.

       It's logical, as most people have hands, and use two hands to type on a  keyboard. Therefore, you can deduct that I've two hands, by determining at the speed I write, and grammatical errors I make, or lack thereof.

       Sound arguments and valid points, yet you have not irrefutably proven to me you have two hands. Okay, the flying spaghetti monster exists, but he is not as powerful as God :)

       Life on earth is balanced on razors edge. If the sun were a few degrees away, we would freeze. Any closer, we would burn up. A scientist put together some numbers after calculating all the impossibly balanced things that allow life to exist on earth. How insanely precise it is. The chance of life randomly happening were 0.000001 --- with so many zeroes, easily one hundred, that the chance was literally zero that life just happened the way it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logically it is more likely that we are the product of an all powerful Creator. It makes sense. When you look out at the beauty of the universe, the earth, mankind, and other life, it's only logical to think, that with the literal impossibility that this was all chance, that we are the product of a higher being.

       I have a very liberal way of looking at Biblical texts. I see them as inspired but not completely infallible. It's incredibly arrogant of man to think that the God could be anthropomorphized within our limited systems of understanding. Language, logic, physics? All great feats for intelligent apes like us but to be quite frank, we are barely skimming the surface concerning epistemological issues. A wise man knows that he knows nothing. Of course, he knows a
       <em>
        few things
       </em>
       ; certain ontological truths as verified by our 5 senses. However, these become vanities; they become delusions even when we start to believe that all we can perceive is all that can exist. Therefore the most honest and humble men, those who were not blinded by egos, motivated by pride, all held a position of skepticism or as some would call agnosticism. Not materialism and definitely not atheism.

       People who believe in the Illuminati are almost always Christians, as it is a theory that satanists are running the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       NWO comes in split meanings, recently it is referencing a nefarious group a la Illuminati.  More appropriately it is used not as a group, but as an agenda pursuing global government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not noticed a single fervent christian on this sub, though there is the occasional man of faith.  It seems to me that not many people here actually believe in the Illuminati nonsense.  It is usually brought up with little backing besides artistic freedom used in music videos (aka: rock-solid evidence), and those who post such tripe generally don't participate in their own thread, much less the community in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, imho, the terms NWO and Illuminati should not be used because you sound like a nutjob.  I simply refer to them as TPTB (the powers that be).  The term is entirely interchangeable with iluminati/nwo, but also expands the context beyond their limited realms.

       When God cast Satan down to the earth, satan started plotting. Fast forward and now you have a world run by people who are under his influence. The only hope mankind has is Yeshua coming back to get rid of evil once and for all.

       I believe the original Illuminati ones were.
      </p>

       Now I feel that the "Illuminati" is either some sort of metaphor or overall term used for those in power who we don't know, or just some sort of running joke.

       I think the interesting part is that religion tells an important story, but people worship the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NWO wants to eliminate the message of the story, and the people are only worried about not being able to repeat the details anymore. The focus is on eliminating your spiritual connection to Creation. How you make that connection doesn't matter, what the NWO concerns itself with is total control of your mind, body, and spirit. If you are
       <em>
        spiritual
       </em>
       , then they must either become God or make spirituality unimportant to you. Otherwise, there exists within you a space they cannot control, and THAT is their biggest fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every moment the NWO does not have total control over you, there exists the possibility of successful insurrection against their plans.

       I think you can find a certain "conspiratorial" subtheme within Christianity. The City of God versus the City of Man kind of stuff. But down to the particular stuff like Malachy's prophecies (which have been proven to be a forgery) and The Book of Revelation (which isn't really about the end times), I don't like to read into those things.

       If the amount of christians (rougly 3 billion) actually did what Christ said to do, which is warm believers of hell, I think the world would have killed us all by now. But, nope, 90%+ of those who profess to be christians don't care at all about the people around them going to hell.

       Why not go ahead and challenge yourself by reading or entertaining opposing views. You seem quite proud to espouse your under-researched faith as truth yet unwilling to consider contradictory information. Religion is weakness. Spirituality has value. But to subscribe to the idea "my God is supreme God" is like fighting over whether Batman can beat Superman.

       It doesn't have an effect. I'm saying it for YOUR benefit so you know that all christians don't just blindly follow their faith, therefore you are now armed with knowledge that you can use to not assume that all christians are blind sheep. Because when you assume that a person like me who is obviously a christian needs to challenge themselves by pondering other view points, you come off as arrogant and ignorant.

       As I've read through some conspiracies, at some point in my research I come across religion. As an existentialist that studies all religions (albeit, new to some) I have a fear of another "Noah's ark". But again, religions have taught me there will always be good vs evil, yin/yang. Karma etc. and I feel we will be our own demise an it may have been prophesized. But I will continue to grow my organic food in my back yard an donate it an give what I can to be "good".
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, TPTB MAY be dark forces...or just assholes. And really, doing good is the only way to prevail. So...just be good, an everything will be okay IMO.

       No matter what religion you believe in, the ultimate truth will be revealed upon the next stage of life (death) until then humans will always look to the heavens and believe in a god or no god that fits their life experiences and conditioning. One thing for sure is that the powers at be will try and wipe Christianity of the face of this earth.

       Have you flipped through the Talmud? The Jewish "holy book" preaches fucking over anyone who is not kosher (aka goys). Religion is a poison for the benefit of popes and kings. Religion divides the masses and keeps the proles too busy to realize they are being screwed over by the 1%.

       When Jews are sworn into office, do they put their hand over the Talmud or the Tanakh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, religion is for population control. That's why they hate Christians because it has no central point of authority except through Jesus Christ who is the High Priest, Lord and King.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Catholicism is a religion (has Pope for central control),
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Islam is a religion (has Caliphate for central control),
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mormonism is a religion (has President for central control)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       A Christian's High Authority is Jesus Christ. We can't be controlled by the NWO because of that and they don't like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: That's just one of the reasons why they don't like Christianity.

       I'm not sure where this division comes from? As a christian I believe Jesus is the ultimate truth, yet I do not hate atheists or any other religion. I would gladly stand with any of you regardless of your faith or lack there of, if you were in need.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only division I believe in is when Jesus comes back and separates those who love Him from those who don't.

       The bible states that the earth is a sphere, while the earth believed it was flat, thousands of years before we had the technology to prove it was round.

       You're exactly right. The bible states it is a sphere, so why people claiming to follow this book still thought it was flat is beyond me.

       Regardless, your argument isn't going anywhere, because the earth is round, and like I said, the original translation in hebrew was wings, we translated it to corners because it's the best word we have. People still use the "4 corners of the earth" statement even though it's not fully accurate. As a figure of speech it works out just fine.

       Aside from whatever opinion you have of the Bible, the fact is, it would actually be impossible for the supernatural to be absent during a meeting between Jesus and the devil, as described in Matthew 4:1-8. How else would the devil manage to find Jesus in the desert in Matthew 4:3? How else would the devil bring Jesus to the 'the highest point of the temple' in Matthew 4:5? And how else would he transport Jesus to the 'very high mountain' in Matthew 4:8?
      </p>
      <p>
       Matthew's portrayal of the meeting between Jesus and the devil involves the supernatural. So how did the devil represent to Jesus 'all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor'? The answer seems obvious: by means of the supernatural.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why does the devil take Jesus up to a 'very high mountain' when he could have used his supernatural powers in a valley, or in a plain, etc., to show Jesus all the kingdoms of the world? Because, a king is elevated. It is the king who has the highest seat in a palace. It is the king who has the highest seat in a coliseum. It is the king to whom others lower themselves by bowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the devil is going to tempt someone by offering to make him the king of the world, where else would be more appropriate than the top of a 'very high mountain?'
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the succession of temptations in Matthew 4:1-11:
      </p>
      <p>
       • The first takes place in a desert.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The second involves the highest point on the Temple in Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
       • And the third takes place on a mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pattern is clear: As the loftiness of the temptation increases, so does the height from which it is offered.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, for the sake of argument, what if a person, who lived during the time of Jesus, actually thought that the earth was flat? Would that person really think that if he stood on a high mountain that he would be able to see the entire world - all the kingdoms in their splendor?
      </p>
      <p>
       That would be easy to doubt. You don't have to be a 21st-century scientist to realize that there are limits as to how far the human eye can perceive detail and color. Anyone standing on a hilltop overlooking a valley, or standing on a shoreline looking out to the sea, would realize that the human eye can see only so far before details are washed out into the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even a person living in ancient times would have realized that he could not see far enough, under any normal circumstances, to see all of the kingdoms of the world from any one vantage point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the ancients traveled by foot. They often measured their journeys by the number of days that it took to complete the trip. The Bible records many examples of this. A man living in ancient times, taking a journey that lasted a day or more, would have realized that even when there are no trees or mountains or hills to obstruct your view, you still can't see your destination point at the start of your journey.

       Definitely not saying everything in the bible is to be taken literally. When Jesus said "take this bread, it is my body." Was it actually His body? No, it symbolized it, as the bread was broken, so was His body.

       Really? The bible also states that the sky was a water canopy, that Jewish slaves built the Pyramids, and that an old man built a big enough boat to fit two of every single animal on earth. None of which are true.

       "Prove its not the truth" there are facts in the book, like that their were people on earth and they had names. Why didn't they put any of the other original gospels in? Because they were even more shitbrained than the ones in use now.

       you'd probably enjoy this, especially with amanita and jesus. Also, our brains look for patterns and coincidence in everything we happen to catch with our senses. It's the reason we see faces in burnt toast. Religion, science, nothing is completely concrete. The moment you think you know is when you stop thinking naturally. If god is real, and you have been a good person for your life, and he doesn't let you into heaven because you didn't believe some book written by some people however many years ago and you didn't kiss his ass with your thoughts then fuck him. Seriously.

       You don't know every single atheist's view on life. As stated, I'm an atheist and I don't even step on bugs. I'm a pacifist, and if I could, I'd be a conscientious objector even.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because someone believes in sky cake doesn't mean they are peaceful people. See: the crusades, the inquisition, founding of the Americas, the Salem Witch Trials, the Bible, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY DORNER IS AN ATHIEST? I dunno, lemme go ask him. Believe it or not, I never met the guy. Why he himself chose to be an atheist, I haven't the faintest. My guess, if I was locked in a flaming cabin and forced to give an answer, would be because he seems like an intelligent fellow.

       It's logical, as most people have hands, and use two hands to type on a  keyboard. Therefore, you can deduct that I've two hands, by determining at the speed I write, and grammatical errors I make, or lack thereof.

       Definitely not saying everything in the bible is to be taken literally. When Jesus said "take this bread, it is my body." Was it actually His body? No, it symbolized it, as the bread was broken, so was His body.
