        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>OK.
The conspiracy garbage has got to stop. I am so sick of this shit - from newtown to dorner - enough is enough.
This community has REALLY started to disgust me.
THE COPS DID NOT EXECUTE DORNER. I dont care what you think you heard on some scanner, taken out of context. Poor taste? Sure. And the officer should be held accountable for that. Felonious arson, pre-meditated murder/execution of some folklore hero? I think fucking not.
Dorner signed his own death warrant with his manifesto. He didnt want a trial. and you are all falling for this stupid shit because of your unbelievable negative bias towards cops - the exact same nonsense on here I see for soldiers etc. There isnt a single person I know who has ever had a reason to have this much distrust/hate for the police. 99 percent of you are probably white suburban men and women whos sole contact with the police was probably limited to speeding tickets you got...WHEN YOU WERE SPEEDING, or a arrest for weed - WHICH IS ILLEGAL. Im not saying all cops are good - some arent. But the VAST majority - and im talking like 99 percent - are GOOD people who care about you so much, that they are willing to put their lives at risk on a day to day basis to keep you safe. They dont deserve to be cannonized - any more than anybody else doing a job - they dont expect a thank you - but if you could stop being so fucking retarded every time ONE STUPID THING HAPPENS - that would be great, and I&#39;m sure they would appreciate it.
For one - hes not some fucking freedom fighter. Hes not even a good person. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get fired as a cop? Well - let me tell you, its not easy. Same with the military. In order to get fired, you have to have a SERIOUS history of bad conduct. To get fired from both and have your clearance stripped? You are probably one seriously jacked up individual. You have chances for appeals - MULTIPLE chances. It is borderline IMPOSSIBLE to have this happen to you. This isnt my opinion, this is validated by every cop I know. He was a deranged individual - thats final. Sane people dont go on murderous rampages.
Maybe..hes the kind of individual who would release a 10k word MANIFESTO online, which takes the time to thank charlie sheen, while simultaneously listing high value targets on your kill list, and talking about the imaginary surface to air ordinance you have in your garage. LET THAT SINK IN.
WHAT KIND OF SANE PERSON WRITES A MURDEROUS 10k WORD MANIFESTO? WHAT THE FUCK PLANET ARE YOU ON?
I&#39;m glad we got that out of the way. Lets talk about his &quot;execution&quot;. What option did the police have? Did Dorner try to surrender? NO. What he DID do, was KILL or MAIM every cop he saw, at every opportunity he had to surrender. Hugging it out, was CLEARLY out of the question - and THATS NOT some interpretation. He SAYS in his manifesto that hes going to kill as many cops as possible - HE SAYS hes not going to live. He never wanted a trial. Dormer, like the spree killer in Newtown, or the shooter at VT - wanted attention, wanted people to feel sorry for him, and wanted ultimately, to die. TLDR? THE dude killed 3 people. THEN the manifesto comes out saying hell kill more. You have evidence at this point towards the end of him being serious. Ok, well the rules of engagement have just changed. And for a Logical reason. Not to silence him - not to deny him a trial. Not to hide bad behavior.
Just to throw this out - the dude lied about having surface to air missiles. Hes a cop. Last time I checked - cops dont have, or even if they did, TAKE HOME surface to air missiles. AND LETS JUST SAY WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THE LAPD HAS SAM&#39;s. I can bet, dollars to fucking doughnuts those things would probably be highly regulated - JUST LIKE IN THE MILITARY. Its not a item that just goes missing - &quot;oh, ya sorry boss, I left those SAMS in the back of my truck. I had no idea I left them there. Ill bring them back after lunch&quot;. One lie takes away credibility. And before you stay at home call of duty experts with no experience try to make up some nonsense about why his manifesto was genius - let me break this down from a tactical perspective.
From a tactical perspective - there is no point in a manifesto. There is no point in lying about or explaining his capabilities. He had more of an advantage than any other spree killer in history. He had military and police training - and he fell flat on his face. The police are the softest target imaginable. They HAVE to react to you. HE COULD dictate their op tempo, where/when/how he would fight - set up ambushes from burner phones via 911 calls, thus dispatching units to locations he had prepared and kill kill kill to his deranged hearts content - then evaporate, nameless, faceless into the night. Why talk about your capabilities? Why not stay unknown for as long as possible. Why not have a suicide note? Which would explain your story just the same, but after you had worn out your advantage?
He would know this. Just the same as I do. The difference between us? Hes fucking insane - and Im not. He wanted to die - and left the police no choice. The only genius in his plan, is knowing how stupid most people would be, and how even the ACCUSATIONS he made would make him some sort of victim while on his crusade. Congratulations Dorner - you win. The world is every bit as stupid as you hoped it would be.
THAT BEING SAID - do you think that he wasnt offered a opportunity to surrender at that cabin? He could have come out at any time. He could have surrendered to the media - who would have ATE That shit up. HE could have had media come to any location, and escort him in - GUARANTEEING him a trial. He could have called on a cell phone and asked to surrender at any point - and guess what? They would have let him. He didnt want to surrender - he wanted to kill more cops - so he shot at more cops, had explosively deployed teargas canisters, smoke grenades and flash bangs thrown into/near shocker a WOODEN BUILDING - and low and behold, the building caught on fire. HOLY SHIT. Somebody get me my tinfoil helmet.
Even BULLETS fired into or from the building could have caused a fire, depending on where they hit. Think about it.
Spree killers like dorner deserve to be erased from the history books. When the cops find out who did it - their birth certificate should be deleted. Their passport burned. Their social security number reassigned. Every record of them should be stricken from the world. Nobody should speak of them. Nobody should remember them - and media shouldnt cover them or glorify them. They should be looked upon with the same disdain we have ror rapists and child molesters.
You all expect the world from police - yet you value one of the most important roles in our society at a going rate of about 15 dollars per hour or less. About the same as you value mcdonalds managers.
IF you want BETTER people, and BETTER Training for cops - how about you talk to your local government and make it a priority to get them pay raises, to attract the better people you think would solve the problem. How about you pay for the training they need. How about you make it important that there are enough cops in your city to lower the response times to sub 2 minutes. That would solve problems. Not complaining on the internet.
You want to feel safe, but you dont want to pay for it. You are totally content being out of the arena, clean and safe - and fucking HAMMERING the dudes on the ground, who are literally doing EVERYTHING they can to keep this whole motherfucker from falling apart. The truth is - you arent willing to put shit on the line. You dont want to have anything to do with the dead kids, rapists and murderers. You want somebody else to do it for you - and most importantly you dont want the responsibility.
They are not perfect - but there is fucking honor in the life they chose. They will make mistakes - and its up to us as a society to give them the tools to allow them to be successful. Hold them accountable - even to a higher standard - but kno they are human. They are a representation of US. Not the other way around. You get what you pay for.

    <div class="md"><p>wow... you&#39;re a fucking moron, they were referring to an arson in riverside, I was in san diego.  you can&#39;t possibly justify detaining someone counties away for something as thin a lighter and no smokes.  I tried asking if I was under arrest or free to go... I was told no, I&#39;m not under arrest, but was physically prevented from leaving (I won&#39;t say attacked, because I wasn&#39;t hurt) which as far as I can tell is as illegal as fuck, but do you think anything came of my complaint?  pffft!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dorner said he would execute assymetrical warfare, so anyone like the Quan girl would be collateral damage in terms of achieving a goal (In his eyes),  If you were ever in serious operations, you would know about damaging one thing to cause more damage to another.  Was he wrong? Yes, you don&#39;t have to hurt innocents to make a point here. But he did bring up an important conversation upon his death that many people are JUST starting to realise: Humans are greedy and corrupt in nature, and the LAPD is an exagerated version of that example.
P.S to say ANY opinion on Chris Dorners&#39; demise 24 hours before we even heard a coroner statement means you do not care about facts, you just feel something in your ape heart and start spouting off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assymetrical warfare is two groups of people in conflict with totally different numbers, skillsets, resources and MOs. The most common way asymmetric warfare is utilized, is a small faction fighting against a big faction. You give up the ability to duke it out, in favor of mobility and invisibility. That has nothing to do with what happened with the quan girl. I was involved in serious operations, and those actions directly resulted in the demise of the number 2 HVT we have ever killed in the war on terror. I TRAIN law enforcement. LAPD is no more greedy or corrupt than any corporation on the planet. The difference between them, and MONSANTO say - is that they are TRYING to be good, while monsanto is TRYING to make money. A coroners statement means nothing in terms of MO. I am defending with common sense, the accusation that chris dorner was assassinated by the LAPD/other agencies, or that he was some guy who got screwed by the system who deserves one iota of attention. I dont NEED a coroners report for that. </p>

<p>What you are talking about - are what we refer to in the military as 2nd or 3rd order effects. IE effects that cannot be planned, but are a direct result of actions taken. If his goal was to hurt the LAPDs public image - sure, I guess that worked out. But there is NO way he planned that. Random luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LAPD is not trying to be good, any but. The job of police is to either lock down a suspicious person, or lock down a crime after it happens. Anything else is extracurricular.  You can say the LAPD is corrupt as any corporation, but the damage is more direct, where a person can usually choose from corporations.  The LAPD used to be notorious for racism and cop-comradery, anyone can tell you that, but anyone local or past the blue line can tell you how little it has changed. The shame is, you can&#39;t get a good idea of how fucked police are until you experience it firsthand. Until then, pyschos are gonna keep comin out the woodwork, hopefully not as nonsensical and violent as Dorner.</p>

BTW guys, Justin here <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-09-12-soldier-anguish_x.htm">knows a thing or 2 about conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gc5lb/iama_ex_military_whistleblower_who_turned_in_most/">and yes, its him</a>. so before you start running on with the same bs you give every skeptic who rolls through... you might want to consider showing a little respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LAPD is not trying to be good, any but. The job of police is to either lock down a suspicious person, or lock down a crime after it happens. Anything else is extracurricular.  You can say the LAPD is corrupt as any corporation, but the damage is more direct, where a person can usually choose from corporations.  The LAPD used to be notorious for racism and cop-comradery, anyone can tell you that, but anyone local or past the blue line can tell you how little it has changed. The shame is, you can&#39;t get a good idea of how fucked police are until you experience it firsthand. Until then, pyschos are gonna keep comin out the woodwork, hopefully not as nonsensical and violent as Dorner.</p>
