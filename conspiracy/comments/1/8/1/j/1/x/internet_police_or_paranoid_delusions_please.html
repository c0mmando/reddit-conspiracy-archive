        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>ok. so it all began about 2 days ago after a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/17t7o3/netanyahu_unaware_of_camera/c88rsb4">very interesting conversation</a> with a person claiming to be an IDF soldier. towards the end of the conversation my computer experienced a heavy load for several minutes; my browser and all my shit became unresponsive. after several minutes, cpu usage seemingly returned to normal until i powered down my machine. note that that entire day, i had done nothing but switched between reddit, anarchy online, and torchlight 2.</p>

<p>the very next morning, i turn on my computer, which i have set up to dual boot linux mint 14 and windows 7, to discover that windows 7 boots to a black screen where only the cursor is visible. ctrl+alt+del does not function. so i reboot into safe mode with networking, same deal. reboot into safe mode with command prompt only, same deal. </p>

<p>i am visibly perplexed.</p>

<p>i proceeded to run various antivirus software in an attempt to fix the problem. finally, after scanning with clamAV on linux mint 14, it becomes apparent that there is a bootkit present in the master boot record as well as 30+ other malware/trojans/exploits. i deleted the things, or so i thought.</p>

<p>i reboot windows and the same black screen problem persists. FUCK</p>

<p><strong><em>DAY 2</em></strong></p>

<p>i format and do a clean installation of windows 7.</p>

<p>the very moment i install wlan drivers and connect to the internet, i checked task manager to view the processes running and discovered this process running which has my cpu idling at 40% and almost 500mb of ram. it was also utilizing my internet connection at a rate of mostly 150-500kbps and up to 1.5mbps. the free space on my hd is also decreasing at a similar rate. i dont know what is downloading or where its going.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>svchost.exe(netsvcs)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>now, i understand that svchost.exe is a regular function of windows which does a handful of different things.</p>

<p>what i dont get is, this.</p>

<p>i opened up resource manager to get a closer look at this service causing havoc to my computer. i checked the tcp connections the service was making and i discovered literately hundreds of connections to various cloud servers associated with companies such as amazon, at&amp;t, ntt america, gannett co. inc. softlayer technologies, and to my surprise <strong><em>ripe network coordination center.</em></strong> (whois is your friend)</p>

<p><strong><em>ripe network coordination center.</em></strong> hmhf.. how peculiar?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ripe.net/internet-coordination/internet-governance">RIPE Network Coordination Center</a></p>

<p>The RIPE NCC engages in a range of activities that can be defined as “Internet governance”. These activities include working with the technical community, governments, regulators, civil society and law enforcement agencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>what do?</em> this is quite possibly the craziest shit ive ever seen happen to a computer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You did a clean install of windows 7 and when you first connect it bogged you down?  Simple explanation: Windows was doing it&#39;s software updates as was all the other programs that windows installs with itself.  One of the things I hate about doing clean installs or working on a computer that has been offline for months.  As soon as they get an active connection, and &quot;automatically download and install updates&quot; is selected in windows updates, it tries to download all the updats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take those IPs and use the RIPE whois tool to query RIPE. ARIN and RIPE have jurisdictions. ARIN is telling you to go ask RIPE. </p>

<p>Also, turn everything else in the house off. change your external-facing IP, and run your experiment again. See if the results are the same. My guess - you were torrenting something recently and the traffic you see is residual incoming attempts to download by the torrent swarm. Or did you say they were outbound?  What kind of packets?  SYNs?  Did the 3-way handshakes complete?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the sarcasm? Did you even read op&#39;s comment or even go to the RIPE link he provided? That company is doing real deal shit, things that can change the internet as we know it.. </p>

<p>Did you see some of the projects they are working on or what they even offer? </p>

<p>Its pretty dismissive of op&#39;s concerns to assume hes a nut job hiding in his closet, he could be just an average guy who noticed something strange and investigated. One should never just dismiss someone&#39;s claims just because you cant understand it, not understanding dose not mean its not real.</p>

<p>Op I don&#39;t know what to tell ya, I don&#39;t know what your into or what sites you go to or what you download, but that shit is strange. But to say there is nothing to your claim would be false.. All of you should watch this</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/spy-factory.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/spy-factory.html</a></p>

<p>It will give you an understanding of how much everything on the internet is watched.</p>

<p>Op you should look for people who have posted similar stories on the internet and see what you can gather, post your findings its very interesting.</p>

<p>Also, the guy you were talking too, very strange, in his AMA he was politically correct but in his other post he is pretty vicious.. He shits all over a lot of different people, cultures and countries. I wonder if his comments are a microcosm of his culture, being that when the cameras are on they say one thing but when they are off its a completely different ball game.</p>
