<p>Decision of the Board: &quot;The Board also noted that Gettler’s mental illness affected his ability to give an accurate account of the incident and found that Gettler’s videotaped statement, alleging one kick, was not credible.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Testimony of Richard Gettler</p>

<p>Richard Gettler testified that his son was schizophrenic with severe dementia. He explained that his son sometimes was verbal and able to respond, but other days he was not responsive. Gettler sometimes wandered from home, but his father usually did not report him as missing because he knew the police always brought him home.</p>

<p>Gettler’s father stated that when the officers brought his son home on July 28, 2007, he asked Gettler if he had been in a fight because his face was puffy. Gettler told him that he was kicked at the hotel, so they drove around until Gettler directed his father to the DoubleTree, where Gettler pointed to the wall and indicated the incident happened near there. Gettler told his father he was kicked in the chest twice by a police officer, but his father decided not to report it because he assumed it was an accident and Gettler was not hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Testimony of Christopher Gettler</p>

<p>The Board brought Gettler in to question him during the administrative hearing, but his responses generally were incoherent and nonresponsive. A videotaped interview of Gettler, taken on December 8, 2008, was shown at the administrative hearing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Board reasoned that, although there were inconsistencies in the testimony, the testimony of Adrid, Sergeant Perez, and Sergeant Hernandez was consistent with the original report by appellant and Sergeant Evans. Although Richard Gettler’s testimony supported appellant’s assertion that Sergeant Evans kicked Gettler, the Board found his testimony not credible because it was inconsistent with his son’s testimony. The Board also noted that Gettler’s mental illness affected his ability to give an accurate account of the incident and found that Gettler’s videotaped statement, alleging one kick, was not credible.&quot;</p>

<p>What inconsistencies? The only thing in the video he has a hard time with remembering is the hair colour. If this isn&#39;t a cover up then what is?</p>

<p>His son has a mental illness, this guy was defending him unlike those bastard Fullerton police officers killing that mentally ill kid.</p>

<p>Why does everyone assume he killed those people? In America you are innocent till proven guilty. Is there video of him shooting these people? Or because FOX NEWS says so? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re fucking retarded. There is literally no circumstances that he could turn himself in and not be instantly mowed down. None. Those cops DO NOT GIVE A FUCK. He could turn himself in in the middle of the most popular mall in the city and I bet you every penny I have they would still mow him down and most likely some civilians in the process. They&#39;ve already killed 1 person and injured 2. They are corrupt as corrupt can be. You&#39;re a fucking moron.</p>
