        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>LAPD and the fucking shitty MSM are keeping that story as hush hush as possible, but what&#39;s REALLY going to happen if that lady actually dies?</p>

<p>And she&#39;s 1) old.  She&#39;s a senior citizen in her 60s/70s (I forget how old, but the point is she&#39;s up there in age), and 2) she&#39;s in critical condition.  Put two and two together:  A female senior citizen that&#39;s in critical condition because she got shot (a very traumatic thing in itself) does not stand a great chance of pulling through.</p>

<p>Thus far the MSM gets the opportunity to sugar coat their hairy shit ball by saying &quot;citizens were &#39;injured&#39; by LAPD gunfire.&quot;  What can they say when it turns into &quot;LAPD <em>killed</em> a defenseless citizen&quot;?</p>

<p>Anyway, the moment anyone finds out, <em>post</em> it for sure.</p>

<p>That it all.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>No, no.  They wouldn&#39;t pay anybody actually.  That wouldn&#39;t happen.  If anything, they&#39;d get some piece of shit judge to write up some sort of bullshit court order or something, find out who her next of kin is, track them down, and then tell them that they aren&#39;t legally allowed to post anything online about the lady&#39;s status if she passes away &quot;To help our ongoing investigation and search for that <em>criminal</em> Dorner.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wo.  Wait a minute.  First of all, I thought it was two <em>Asian</em> ladies.  Those women were Mexican/Hispanic.  Secondly...they were DEFINITELY in stable condition.  The lady who was supposedly shot in the back was quite aware and awake and talking to the EMT about where they were taking her.</p>

<p>And the other one was actually VERY okay, as she was being walked of her own volition without a stretcher to the ambulance truck.</p>

<p>Yet there&#39;s the blue truck that is absolutely RIDDLED with bullets.  Shouldn&#39;t those two ladies have been practically <em>dead</em> after having had that many bullet holes go through their their truck&#39;s back window?</p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>Thanks for the info, however.</p>

<p>Look at how the cops fired into the tailgate of the truck, those rounds were wholly ineffective.  Then the shots into the window would have been coming from ground level and surely missed.</p>

<p>I imagine the woman shot in the back was hit by a ricochet.</p>

<p>Yes, they were first reported as Asian. That&#39;s how news reporting works. Report as fast as you can with whatever information you have, let the details trickle in later. That&#39;s why it&#39;s all for entertainment.</p>

<p>Certainly.  They put quite a few in the windows though.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily.  At ground level - i.e. if the cops were simply crouching a bit - it looks like those shots could have/should have been head shots.</p>

<p>Note there are shell casings in front of the truck as well as elsewhere.  I haven&#39;t seen any pics from the front of the truck nor the side but also there is a bullet  hole in the windshield of the police cruiser.  Wondering; did all the shots originate from the back of the vehicle?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck the news.  I <em>don&#39;t</em> &quot;search for news&quot;.  And the fact that it was THE NEWS ITSELF that said they were Asian in the first place should let you know that I&#39;m at least <em>somewhat</em> aware of what they say.  That <em>was</em> after all, how they did initially describe the two ladies - as being Asian.</p>

<p>I, of course, have since found out that they were Mexican/Hispanic women.  I also know that one theory behind why they were erroneously categorized as Asian is because &quot;the news just pushes whatever information out pretty much immediately come what may of the accuracy of the data.&quot;  I know that.  Again, I was simply going by what AT THE TIME the race of the two victims was assumed to be.  I&#39;ve (again) realized that they <em>aren&#39;t</em> that race.  I was also pretty quickly informed that although one of the ladies is (was?) said to be in the ICU, she <em>went in</em> to the ambulance pretty darn cogent, aware, and talkative.  So there&#39;s that.</p>

<p>Anyway, a lot of information has since come up that I&#39;ve become aware of AFTER I posted the OP.  At the time I did post the OP, however, that information wasn&#39;t anywhere near as greatly circulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What?  I &quot;listened to the news Thursday&quot;?  What the...</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t listen to the news <em>any day</em>.  Not in the sense that someone like you might think anyway.  I don&#39;t even have a tv, man.  I just get/got whatever information I get/got from wherever on the net I got it from.</p>

<p>And the reason I haven&#39;t edited my post is because 1) you can&#39;t edit Reddit titles anyway.  They are what they are.  Also 2) I&#39;m not a type that tries to be disingenuous.  If I made a mistake of whatever type, I certainly try to correct it, but everyone makes mistakes, so I don&#39;t try to run or hide from having made one.  I&#39;d just as soon let it stand, and if someone is so interested, they&#39;d be able to see that I&#39;ve since amended and corrected my understanding of the issue in question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wo.  Wait a minute.  First of all, I thought it was two <em>Asian</em> ladies.  Those women were Mexican/Hispanic.  Secondly...they were DEFINITELY in stable condition.  The lady who was supposedly shot in the back was quite aware and awake and talking to the EMT about where they were taking her.</p>

<p>And the other one was actually VERY okay, as she was being walked of her own volition without a stretcher to the ambulance truck.</p>

<p>Yet there&#39;s the blue truck that is absolutely RIDDLED with bullets.  Shouldn&#39;t those two ladies have been practically <em>dead</em> after having had that many bullet holes go through their their truck&#39;s back window?</p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>Thanks for the info, however.</p>
