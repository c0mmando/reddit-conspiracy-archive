       Those cops? The ones that SHOT UP 2 women delivering papers?

      <p>
       Have they been arrested for attempted murder?

      <p>
       No?

      <p>
       Ask yourself this. As a "civilian" even if you thought your life was in danger - if you opened fire and fired dozens of rounds into the paperboy... would you not face charges?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are the charges against these FUCKS?

      <p>
       Where are the arrests?

       As fellow "conspiracy theorists" I call on you. Call out these FUCKS. Find out who they are. Post their NAMES. Demand JUSTICE for their CRIMINAL actions.

       You know what cops? I know you read this shit. If you dont call this out? If you dont stand up for these women? Then man.... WTF? Then why should any citizen ever EVER fucking trust the police? WHY? Tell me?

       This world? Just move countries. I live in New Zealand and the police don't even have guns. Hell, one of our politicians got fired because she bought her dinner with a government credit card. There is pretty much 0 corruption here, and if there is, there is always someone higher who is clean to wipe away the filth.

       i never said it was going to be easy.  i doubt our forefathers thought it was going to be a walk in the park to throw off the yolk of imperialist Britain, but they got it done with fewer people and crappier weapons then what we have today.

       not really.  there aren't that many.  hell i could probably get any two rednecks with a high powered rifle and binoculars, and we would be right as rain.  just makes sure we don't give them the beer they ask for until after they take the bird down.  also, who to say we couldn't make our own?

       that may very well be a possibility.  hell, the things crash all the time if you pay attention to the news.  we can't go into this with a defeatist attitude.  they may have an army, but i severely doubt it will retain 100% of it's forces if they started telling them to shoot american citizens.  that, and the fact hat there are 300+ million of us makes the odds slightly in our favor.  assuming they don't use nuclear bombs on us there isn't much we can't combat with moderate to strong efficiency. keep in mind, yeah some of us might get the shit bombed out of us by drones, or blown up by a tank shell, but we don't live in a fantasy world.  people die all the time and in extreme cases people have to doe.

       Look, intelligence has not been a desirable trait in humanity, and has been slowly propagated out with pills and names of disorders that target individuality and creativity. We have a whole lot of learning as far as society goes when it comes to healing the wounds of propaganda before we can even contemplate building a better society. I'm afraid of acting without a plan, and hardly a think tank dedicates themselves to the true issues of our world.

       haha I really thought you were being sarcastic..  How in the fuck is getting mad online going to change anything?  Its terrible what happened to those people and the cops will be punished, but like any shooting, it has to be investigated.  Even if its obvious the cops were 100% at fault, they will investigate it.  These people will sue the department for so much that they will feel justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW.. Much more callous and heinous violent crimes are commited KNOWINGLY each day, trying to crucify these idiot cops is pointless.

       the cops are going to get a paid vacation for their trouble and nothing more. in fact, i am pretty sure the cops who shot the two asian women got exactly that, paid administrative leave.  you really think that a police force that fired a man for speaking out against corruption is going to do anything about these cops? it is this kind of attitude and ignorance that has led this country to the state that it is today.  also, violent crimes have nothing to do with corrupt police officers and their abuse of their powers.

       Every cop gets paid leave when a shooting occurs.  They have to investigate it to find out if its justified or not.. Of course it wasnt justified in anyway, but I can understand the situation of how it happened.  My point about violent crimes is that there are hundreds of them a day, without people taking up arms or trying to stop it..  Cops are on edge and made a STUPID mistake.

       i thought the cops where supposed to stop those by taking their own arms.  that is what they are for right?  i can see why that would be hard for you to understand with the state our police force is in however.  and it isn't a stupid mistake when it is something they do all the time.

       Hard time understanding what you are writing.  My point on violent crime is that people are going apeshit because of a terrible mistake that stupid cops made but dont raise an eyelash to other terrible violent crimes commited daily.  Also, cops dont go around shooting people because it COSTS too much money for the department to investigate and deal with the aftermath.  Some cops go decades without using a gun, while other cops in high crime areas must use it constantly as leverage instead of ACTUAL FORCE.

       the violent crimes are irrelevant since they stem from the corruption that is american society.  the issue here isn't with the cops that don't use excessive force.  the issue is the cops that use their uniform as an excuse to be psychopaths and kill on a whim.  if they where good cops they wouldn't have shot at a vehicle that looked nothing like the suspects vehicle, they wouldn't have shot people that looked nothing like the suspect, and they would actually do something about the cops that did the shooting.

       Yeah, love how one caption under the shot-up truck reads something like "a truck was shot after police opened fire."  A
       <em>
        truck
       </em>
       was shot?  How about the women inside the truck?

       Some Police Departments get federalized not because the feds want to control it, but because the city that runs it fucks up so much that it needs to be "audited" in a sense and needs to be given new direction.

       . Anything that some what contradicts a view point you have is instantly met with hostility. Look at all the major departments that is happened to. The Feds didn't take over New Orleans because they like the power, they did it because it was a cesspool of corruption. Clearly the city and state couldn't fix it so the feds came it to turn it around and fix things. Once it meets a certain standard it is then turned back over to the state/municipality running it. Not everything is a huge plot to take away your rights.

       I'm sorry maybe I'm a pathetic sheep paid by the government cause I'm not understanding something. Why in the world would anyone believe this guy, where is the evidence? This theory is no different than if I went outside and started yelling that Obama is going to take away everyone's first born son for labor. Quick! Get this on the news! 
Seriously though why should anyone believe this when there is no evidence for it and its down right silly?
Hes also offering a lot of his crazy ideas as pure facts, saying "yes obama killed these people. For sure, I know everything sheeple, I'm 'in' "

       yeah- the guy has a little bit of the crazy-convincing-you-by-staring-stare going on, so I'm skeptical. But for his hyperbole, I don't doubt there's a kernel of truth in there. For me, it's about comparing this nugget to all the others I find and seeing where they overlap. So. Interesting.

       Well, you see I never actually looked at him - I just listened to what was said - so my perspective has nothing to do with the individuals eyes or whatever because I never actually
       <em>
        looked
       </em>
       at them.  I wouldn't say I'm "convinced" of anything whatsoever.  As I mentioned, I felt it was an interesting perspective, and one to definitely think about and consider, but the word "convinced" has little to nothing to do with anything here on my end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, don't be too quick to hang your hat too much or too long on being "skeptical".

        I personally am as critical of that word and the manner that it's used as I am about the term "conspiracy theorist"

       .  Just be critical, observant, and analytical, and open minded.  Skepticism is never needed if you have sufficient levels of those things.

       I will save this video for later use. I think I will have to teach people that martial laws, the civil unrest and the civil war were anticipated and preplaned by the US government. And also that people saw the movements, realised what was going on and tried to warn people. Maybe it will teach some sheepel something they can not ignore. "Shall not be infringed" is well understood even by europeans. I am sorry to say, but USA you are fucked. Good luck.

       I work in the electronic department of a retail chain and always keep the store tv that receives cable on the news to keep track of basic info released over matters like these. All day, I didn't hear or read a single word about Dorner, the LAPD, or the women who were shot. The images of old people standing in a light flurry mist and small dogs wearing sweaters really must have exceeded importance on the subject.

       They shot 30 times into the back of a royal blue Tacoma... Dorner drove a grey Ranger... maybe a grey Nissan...  they shot the truck because it turned onto a target's street and rolled their windows down and began slowly going down the road... to throw papers. An understandable mistake but had they followed policy rather than assassinate whoever was in the truck, maybe the women would not be shot.

       this is not true. your guns will NEVER be taken away and they won't because of the very same corporate corruption that controls everything else in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       there's too much money involved in selling guns.  they will never be banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       stop repeating what you have been programmed to repeat by the gun lobby.  there's no basis for your fear-mongering, you're simply helping them them fuel very profitable hysteria.

       What's idiotic too is that if you look for a story just about the two women shot each article is filled with villifying Dorner, as though it's his fault that some trigger happy pigs shot up some innocent women.

       Be active, not reactive. Keep the pressure up that ALL COPS need to be held accountable for action. No blue line, no code of silence, no bullshit. These cops are paid in taxes, they continually push a failing war on drugs, destroying countless millions of lives in their paths. Costing taxpayers billions nationwide with over uses of force, lawsuits.

       ...... u/foullbastard is troll? I didn't ever consider him a troll; he's funny! He injects a lot of humor in what can be a joyless subreddit (joyless because of the topics covered; not making fun of anyone here) sometimes. A troll doesn't make self posts calling for justice in my experience.

        Here are the reasons the (IMO) why there's a media blackout:
       </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        If people look into what's been happening they'll find out more about this guy, his story, and why he's gone rogue.  The last thing they need is a professional and honest journalist to find out exactly what his motive is and publish a story depicting his thought process, the unfair termination of his job, and the corruptness of the LAPD.  This would give him a protagonist light and then he'd (albeit) get supporters in the public eye.  This would draw lines in the sand.  Not only would this shed light into the LAPDs corruptness but make those in their own cities aware of their own police force.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Copy cats.  I'm sure there are a few guys on here that get pissed off, but out in the non-redditor world there are
        <em>
         tons more
        </em>
        violent people ready to go out there and do something about it.  The LAPD wouldn't be able to tell the difference whether it was Dorner or a radical.  That one scares me the most because if it does escalate out of proportion then LA is going to be like an American Syria, or as Colbert would say Syrimerica.

       Detecting doublestandard is the first step towards a painful awakening.

       When you compare the most propangandiced moral values of western societies then you will realise that there is no objective equal treatment at all. Read the news and replace some of these pairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Palestinia vs Israel. Jews vs Muslim. Politician vs Civilians. Police vs Civilians. Banks vs random business. Europe vs Africa. Northamerica vs Southamerica. USA vs Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would they in mainstream media ever say the same with the same words and the same conclussions in the same situations but with replaced names? If it is a no, then you know there is a agenda behind it.

       You should draft that up into a letter and send it of to the mayor the governor and California's senators and congressman. Would be a little more helpful even to send a copy of to your own supposed representatives.

       The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that the people responsible for upholding law and persecuting the unjust are the ones breaking the laws. The only entity that can help are American citizens themselves. There is no governing body that will fight for you; they are actively fighting you, so that they may prosper. Short of large scale protests in which these evil doers are

       The reason most people tolerate rampant police abuse is because a police is useful to stop most abuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment they start abusing outrageously and never do their function they start being redundant and even a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US police start being more and more like a free company more than anything else.

       not a single person able/willing to play devil's advocate? ugh fine:
1-the target they intended to shoot presented a clear and present danger to society. quite a bit different from neighbor x attempting to shoot neighbor y at a traffic light.
2-the subject of the manhunt has a police scanner (or it must be assumed that he does)[the subject alluded to this specifically in his manifesto] - thus no license plates can be called into dispatch
      </p>
      <p>
       {is there any such intention that it absolves you from shooting an innocent civilian? no. you must face charges for that. but I assure you there is another side to this story}

       1). Yes the man they were looking for may be dangerous. But these LEOs violated a number of very basic rules for engaging a person. First and foremost you HAVE to identify your target, plain and simple, there is no guessing. Second you have to determine if the suspect is armed. The LEOs did neither of these things. The LAPD did this not once but TWICE in one hour!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       2). It doesn't matter if he has a scanner or not you don't get to open fire on a target based on a hunch!

       I SO agree with you.  Few years back a DOE security man in Albuquerque shot a suspected robber who turned on him with a cell phone which the off duty security man thought was a gun.  Could not find an old report to link too.   He was charged and sent to jail.  If he was a full police officer, I think he would have gotten off.    It was double standard on the other side of the picture.  I felt he was in his right as it was his car that got robbed and he was a law bidding man with all the right permits and training. 
But I do admit I do not know all the facts.
