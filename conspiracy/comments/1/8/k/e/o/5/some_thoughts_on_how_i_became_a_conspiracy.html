        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After some sober self-reflection, I&#39;ve realized that my interest in conspiracies wasn&#39;t rooted in something honorable or valorous such as spreading the truth and awakening the masses. <strong>It was actually an escape.</strong> It was a defense mechanism which moved me to project my personal shortcomings out to the rest of the world. Rather than be accountable for my own flaws, rather than deal with the reality that I wasn&#39;t good enough to be the man I wanted to be(I had set the bar pretty high for myself), I instead blamed everything and everyone else - It was a poor education system. It was religious brainwashing. It was government corruption. It was the illuminati. I convinced myself that the whole world was against me; that there was a conspiracy to undermine my greatness.</p>

<p>What&#39;s strange and beautiful about this whole ordeal is that I then <strong>stumbled upon &#39;the truth&#39; purely on accident.</strong> You see, it was never about loving myself, loving mankind, or protecting our planet. It was never about exposing evil men. It was about me denying my own inadequacies.</p>

<p><strong>But Fate truly has a sense of irony.</strong> By running away from a smaller truth, I ended up running into the biggest truths of them all.</p>

<p>This happened through a series of four stages. They weren&#39;t as rigid as I&#39;m portraying them to be. There were lots of jumping back and forth between the stages and overlaps, and this happens till this day.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>I enthusiastically soaked it all up.</strong> Read as much as I could. Watched documentaries. Discussed with friends and other Redditors. Similar to a preteen who discovers masturbation for the first time, I couldn&#39;t get enough.</p></li>
<li><p>It all dawned me on at once. Ho. Ly. Shit. I was scared. I was paranoid. The <strong>fear</strong> crippled me. I was lost, confused and very very afraid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anger.</strong> Anger at the level of evil; all the suffering they were causing around the world. This anger numbed the fear in a lot of ways.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, it was <strong>love</strong> that truly set me free. What compelled me to have my most lucid moments of clarity was when I thought about my family. How much I loved them. And what I would do for them. This healed me from all the fear and anger. Morever, it empowered me to no end.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One final point that I&#39;d like to make is that had I not failed so miserably in my goals of becoming a multi-millionaire, an astronaut, the POTUS, whatever my silly dreams may have been, I would not have become a conspiracy theorist. And I would not have been exposed to all of these truths; all of this evil and suffering around the world.</p>

<p><strong>This is why I believe so many conspiracy circles attract the broken, the misunderstood, the drugged, the rejects of our society; and simultaneously, why the rich, the popular, the ones content within our societies militantly reject conspiracy theories: not because they don&#39;t see the evidence, but because they refuse to.</strong> And why would they want a reality shattering truth to be introduced to their psyches? Everything they worked for(in their materialist mindsets) would be exposed as self-aggrandizing bs. Further, they would now have an obligation to give up their empires of dirt and join in the good fight, lest they be deemed unethical or cowardly. And the cherry on top of all this is that a lot of these reality shattering truths are coming from people like us, the broken and perceived neurotics of society. It&#39;s a recipe for denial. I had thought it was the agenda to defame all Conspiracy Theorists that were holding us back, and while I&#39;m sure this has a great influence, we are in a lot of ways just doing it to ourselves.</p>

<p>If you are still conspiracy gazing as a hobby, that is entirely your prerogative and I&#39;ll save you the talk of how we desperately need everyone to get involved. However, if you&#39;re someone who is using conspiracy theories as an escape, <strong>I encourage you to see the big picture.</strong> Whether intentionally or completely on accident, you have stumbled upon the truth and very important truths at that; that there are evil men conspiring to enslave the entire human race. And most importantly, that you have the power to stop all this. <strong>It is my belief that there is an immeasurable, unfathomable power within all of us.</strong> That if we believe in something, if we truly set our minds to it, anything becomes possible.</p>

<p>In closing, I encourage you all to keep on climbing. Keep on actualizing your hidden potentials. <strong>Do<del>ubt</del>.</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Start with yourself.</strong> Being the change you wish to see in the world: conserving energy, recycling, not littering - as far as the environment is concerned. Be responsible for your health. Proper dieting and exercising. You need to be strong physically to fully unlock the powers of the mind and spirit. Continue to think critically and for yourselves. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Then we raise awareness</strong> in our respective communities, Facebook communities, church communities, town meetings, what have you, and thereby using the power in numbers to vote in the right congressmen who will fight for what what is right.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In love,</strong> I&#39;ve learned that there&#39;s no need to be afraid. Completely on accident admittedly, but I&#39;ve learned to be valorous. I&#39;ve learned about honor; to continue to believe when all the cards are stacked against you. Continuing to speak up while everyone doubts you. And fighting for what you believe in, even if it means it will place your life in danger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it really depends on the context. I openly refer to myself as a conspiracy theorist on facebook and to my friends. It&#39;s a way I turn the stigma on it&#39;s head. Kind of like, &quot;Hey I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist so take all this with a grain of salt (people don&#39;t get defensive) but 1. shocking fact 2. shocking fact 3. shocking fact 4. some more facts 5. But i encourage you to research all this on your own.&quot; I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s more effective taking yourself too seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Informative piece. Thanks for sharing. But as I&#39;ve used the word stigma in my earlier comment, I&#39;ve known the term conspiracy theorist has a negative connotation used to defame an individual asking certain questions.</p>

<p>To use your example, I&#39;d even call myself a stupid nigger if that would get them to listen. The thing is, the agenda against conspiracy theorists is so wide spread now that people will already label you one when you start talking about stuff like building 7 or the gulf of tonkin. So while it&#39;d be a bit different if a third part was attempting to discredit me before an audience, my openly acknowledging that, &quot;yes I am in fact a CP,&quot; has the opposite effect of what those who intended to defame us had in mind. Especially if you show that you are not crazy, you are not defensive and paranoid, and illustrate the desire for open and honest discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think that just feeds into it. People are already conditioned to think &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are a crazy bunch of morons. So, the best plan is to move away from that attack and focus on facts. If you call yourself a conspiracy theorist or refer to yourself as one then you just propagated their idea for them.</p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t feel that way, the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; should only apply to idiots who just invent theories out of thin air and stick to them. I for example, only care about facts. Critical thinking. </p>

<p>tl;dr - Not only should you not use the term as you do nothing but discredit yourself, it also should not even apply to you.</p>

<p>Why have you added a <em>Jolley et Douglas</em> link to your posed question? </p>

<p>Since I can access only the abstract of the article, I am not certain if your link has some merit, but from what I do know about their research this is not what they say. Their research goes into a different direction and they never made such claims, assumptions or theories as you want to insinuate here. </p>

<p>They only found that people who believe CTs are less likely to believe that voting makes a difference. </p>

<p>Neither do these social psychologists argue that conspiracy theorists are less likely to invest their time in grassroots movements which work for a change, nor do they make the claim, that the government puts out these theories, or that conspiracy theorists in general believe that conspriacy theories are government created.</p>

<p>Here is a lecture of Karen Douglas. Watch from 35:01-41:14</p>

<li><p>The formation of investigative bodies like the Church Commission and the HSCA were direct results of public demand which was ignited by <em>conspiracy theorists</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>After Oliver Stones movie JFK, public demand pressured the government into signing the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. This resulted in the declassifiaction of many important documents. </p></li>
<li><p>A similar movement today which tries to bring more accoutability to the political system is wearechange.org.</p></li>
<li><p>The tea party movement has also influenced some change. At first the movement wanted accountability and had some good ideas.

    <div class="md"><p>political activism isn&#39;t &quot;true revolution&quot; necessarily. i think it could be argued that dividing the population into small insular political groups is preventing true social change.</p>

<p>i would argue that your example of the tea party is a perfect illustration of this point. small, grass roots movements are easily misrepresented, misdirected or abused by those who want to impose order from the top down and all the will to affect change is drained from the group. the more groups there are the easier it is to control the whole population.</p>

<p>also <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conjecture">conjecture</a> can be defined as theorising without evidence. i was just attempting to get a little meta about why people become conspiracy theorists. for some reason my stupid little mind made me think of <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/103769/plug-these-leaks">an old south park episode</a> (i would link the whole ep but its blocked in my country) while i was reading the post.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>True, but before a &quot;true revolution&quot; can be started, a critical mass of citizens have to get angry at the system, or perhaps even become desperate.</p>

<p>The opposite of the typical conspiracy theorist is a person with an authoritarian mindset. Someone who listens and follows the appeal to authority. Someone who blindly follows the leads which are given to him by the MSM and by the leading politicians of his preferred party. </p>

<p>I believe someone who doesn&#39;t doubt the official versions of events is much less likely to start a &quot;true revolution&quot; than the average conspiracy theorist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s true that revolution will not come while the people remain in thrall to system as it stands and we need those people to become aware that the system is not looking after their best interest. however, after they do start to question the system the people are vulnerable. which is an opportunity to misdirect the individual away from the truth. now i am not going to claim that micheal moore, luke rudkowski, alex jones and david icke are government agents but, the cult of personality surrounding these people misdirects individuals from &quot;true revolution&quot; and in doing enables the system to not only continue but to profit off them as well. it&#39;s kinda like going back to sleep. therefore critical mass is never reached.</p>
