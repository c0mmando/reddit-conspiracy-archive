       This is fucking disgusting, especially in the wake of recent events where "official" stories have changed dramatically in order to sway public opinion a certain way.

       is the post.  Notice the very end, where this idiot is drunk on his own power, telling everyone who doesn't like the fact that he is blatantly censoring a default subreddit to go fuck themselves.  It's hilarious how throughout the post, the mod is trying to tell everyone that this isn't censorship, so they should be ok with it.

       The news channel RT is classed under 'sensationalist'. Is that right? I've never thought they were. Just told the truth in a way that would obviously upset certain Americans.

       They sure have often interviews with guest who believe the worst of the US government and are sometimes careless with their accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But exactly the same can be observed in US newspapers and in US TV. Here the pro-US-government standpoints are pushed and countries like Iran, Russia, Venezuela etc are villified by a sycophantic group of journalists and
       <em>
        pundits
       </em>
       who are heavily biased and don't know very much about the issues they are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's remember that
       <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-06-poll-iraq_x.htm">
        70% of the US population
       </a>
       believed that Saddam was personally involved in 9/11. The number of people who believed that Saddam had WMDs and could give them to
       <em>
        terrorists
       </em>
       in the future was even higher. The people who believed these things didn't get their news form RT and blogs, they did get it from the Washington Post, NYT and US TV.

       I like Abbey. Not everyone who is on RT and attacks the US, Israel and NATO is careless. Many attacks are justified. Another good example is Grant F. Smith who can always back up his claims. This is not necessarily true for people like Webster Tarpley, Alex Jones, or Stephen Lendman.

       RT has actual news, not how to make a good cup of coffee, or what celebrity had a nipple slip, or what the president shot in golf that day.  Yes, it is edited (imagine, that a second hand source edited) by the russians who no doubt put a certain spin on stuff happening in America (as if we don't do the same to them).  Regardless of that spin though, there are still facts in their stories that if you pick apart some of the blatant bullshit you can easily spot, and American outlets completely ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl:dr- american news is waayyyyyyy more sensationalized than RT. But all news is, if you don't want sensationalized, you have to be there in person.

       That's the
       <em>
        same reason
       </em>
       I read RT, PressTV, and Al-Jazeera.  Yes, they are edited with a spin, just like US news providers.  But, most of us are smart enough to separate facts from sensationalism... and it's nice to hear something from
       <em>
        outside

       the whole, "The U.S. does no wrong!"-local news sources.  Seeing other sides of any news story can expand your ideas on how we (The US, in my case) are viewed throughout the rest of the world.

       Its amazing how many people 'defending' reddit have no clue how reddit works.  If you don't like a way a sub is run then you start your own.  That's the beauty of reddit, not the upvote/downvote system that only promotes the lowest common denominator to the top of the pile.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mod of
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       even listed a whole bunch of 'news' subreddits that purposefully have no moderation and the bulk of the responses are faux outrage about 'censorship!!!' and 'free-speech!!!'
      </p>
      <p>
       It's laughable.

       Don't be naive.  The Front Page of Reddit has become nothing more than a viral marketing space for paid advertisers.  Whether it be innocuous name-dropping posts coming seemingly out of the blue, followed a day later by an AMA from (coincidentally) that same person, or some new product or website getting beaten to death, all someone with an agenda has to do is go to a site like
       <a href="http://www.buyredditvotes.com">
        www.buyredditvotes.com
       </a>
       and their message gets promoted to the top under the guise of having popular support.

       This is serious.  This is a blatant attempt at censorship, and plenty of idiots are getting behind it and supporting it just because someone told them that they should.  It should raise red flags to everyone that default subs would simply block entire websites rather than filter content on a case-by-case basis, if it bothered the mods so much.

       Well to be honestly there are a lot of terrible news sources that get cited constantly.  I'd be on board with a banned site list; however, it's likely going to exclude all alternative media.  Default subs are demopulican circle jerks anyway.  My first post was in jest obviously.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       largely believes there's a media conspiracy to not report certain things they consider news. So by banning a lot of the sources of the "independent news", some on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       interpret that as "hiding the truth" or something similar.

       Might a Supreme Court case won by one of those news organizations stating that news organizations in America are protected from having to tell the truth by the first amendment suggest, by virtue of the time money and effort spent on such a legal battle, that at the very least that specific news organization had an active interest in lying in the guide of news?

       Winning that case removes the liability they have for articles later being found to be false.

       Strictly speaking, what legal grounds would you argue that a news source has to be required to be factual?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, the case you cite also protects the sources that have been banned on

       I would look up the legal reasoning behind fraud and truth in advertising laws and base my argument off of that. It seems to me that calling known lies news would constitute defrauding the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point isn't that these sources are more reliable, but rather that they are no less reliable. Do you have an argument as to why Fox or CNBC would be more reliable than whoever else that does not seem from an argument to credibility from authority?

       Deal with it.  r/News has never been hurting for traffic, and if you don't like the source, you are perfectly capable of clicking a different link.  Basically, you support people only getting one side of the story, the exact way that the Associated Press wants to present it.  Just because someone disagrees with the sentiment that the AP shoves down everyone's throat, does not mean that they should be silenced.  Don't be so ignorant.

Reddit removing websites like Truthdig, Motherjones, RT, EFF because they don't consider those websites to contain news
---is CENSORSHIP---

        This is ridiculous. You could, I don't know, learn how to be critical in the news stories you read, how to identify biases, and how to separate the good reporting from the bad. Or you could just ban entire sites. Yeah, the latter seams way easier for you guys, so why don't you just take the lazy way out. Good job.
edit: While you're at it, you might as well ban CNN and Fox News, etc. for reporting stories such as "Ryan Lanza was the shooter! The Supreme Court shot down the Health Care bill!"

       I mean, I could go on and on and on, every single comment is against banning sites.  I think it's funny that, in an attempt to bolster your argument, you decide to only copy half of one comment, a comment that was actually against banning sites, had you copied the rest of the comment.  Conveniently, you did not.  Typical.  Not surprising that you would be in favor of only letting readers have access to the information you would like to present to them...

       I'm not arguing that there are people that don't like the idea. I'm arguing that it doesn't matter because there's tons of places on reddit to go for your news, and many are taking that advice. You're on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       which was created for this express purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm saying that posting this on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is pretty ridiculous since the people that are here already aren't going to be affected all that much by unsubscribing from
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       . You'll find your shitty "news" whether it's posted on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       or not.

       Similar to how msm can report who wins a presidential election within minutes of poll closing, with 1% of precincts counted.. Seems legit!

       There is a large difference between "news" and "opinion". The most glaring example there of a news site getting lumped in with opinion sites is Torrent Freak. I find their articles to be objective and at times too much slanted towards copyright holders.

       Remember,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       largely believes there's a media conspiracy to not report certain things they consider news. So by banning a lot of the sources of the "independent news", some on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       interpret that as "hiding the truth" or something similar.
