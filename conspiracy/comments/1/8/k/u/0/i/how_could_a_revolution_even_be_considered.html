Right now we have all the technology available to give every human organic food, clean water,shelter,education and free internet.

    <div class="md"><p>Just saying the civil rights movement didnt work and if anything is continuing today. Black people may have more oppurtunities today but when you look at what was fought for and what actually happened, I think most of the CRM leaders would roll in their grave or on their couch if still alive. Racism still is ever prevelent, most of the incarcerated population is black, the only oppurtunity for a lot of the younger blacks to get out of the hood is mcdonalds, gangs, or sports. I dont say these things to be racist its just truth. I believe the civil rights movement barely helped anything and most likely was set up like that so we would be happy with little changes and can say we did something. Peaceful revolutions are good and I support them but as far as im concerned ive never heard about a peaceful revolution actually happening and lasting. As long as there are differences In governing a mass of people, power split among them, war and killing is inevitable</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re thinking about revolution all wrong. Its too impractical to eradicate the current system and replace it with a completely different one. This has been tried in the past hundreds if not thousands of times and all that happens is the new regime becomes corrupt. A new system needs to be implanted gradually.</p>

<p>The real problem all of us have with the system is that the people with power, the ones making decisions controlling the flow of community money and resources, are making decisions not necessarily in the best interest of the majority. Its not entirely their fault. We&#39;re all human and the power that comes with leadership positions can corrupt any of us.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t have leaders or that we should live in anarchy. Most people don&#39;t want to live in isolated anarcho-communes. If we wait until society collapses, order will just reform naturally via violence instead of rational discussion. Communities that pool their resources and solve problems as a group will always have the advantage. We just need to elect leaders that actually do what the people want. We need to decentralize leadership.</p>

<p>I propose we make a system similar to reddit to propose and vote on legislation as citizens. This is digital direct democracy. Then we elect a leader in our democratic republic who makes his sole campaign promise be to use this digital democratic system to make decisions. It would be similar to what the US government already does, it would basically combine public congressional website with the whitehouse petition website. I call this idea hacking democracy: <a href="http://hackingdemocracy.wordpress.com">http://hackingdemocracy.wordpress.com</a> This elected representative wouldn&#39;t need millions of dollars of campaign money if he got a youtube video to go viral. Hell the msm would have to cover it if he got big enough on Twitter.</p>

<p>We know what doesn&#39;t work: the existing system, violent revolution, occupying, protest, petition, etc. Let&#39;s try something new. I think all of humanity is ready for a paradigm shift in how we&#39;re governed. All we have to do is make a transparent digital direct democracy system and let society determine what its laws should be, instead of individuals who tell us &quot;what the american people want.&quot; Once this system is made, anyone will be able to spread the meme simply by upvoting or posting the candidates video on Facebook.</p>

<p>Look maybe this won&#39;t work, but at least its something we haven&#39;t tried.</p>

I like the idea, but people forget that its not just our elected officials who can go corrupt but the nations people as well.

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the many questions answered in the <a href="http://hackingdemocracy.wordpress.com/faq/">FAQ</a>: &quot;What about tyranny of the majority?&quot;</p>

<p>First of all, what do you mean by &quot;corrupt laws?&quot; Laws that you personally don&#39;t agree with? Pretend the majority of society voted to explicitly legalize male genital mutilation. Why should any individual have any right to overturn this legislation? If they can get enough popular support to pass counter-legislation, then good for them. If they can&#39;t, and they still disagree with most of society on what should be legal, they can leave or take the risk of violating the law with other consenting adults. No one in society is &quot;more right&quot; than anyone else. Especially not people who have felt the corrupting influence of power for long time, as many current politicians have. As frustrating as it may be for Christians, we need to remember that morals and ethics are fluid and different laws work for different groups of people in different locations in space-time.</p>

<p>Secondly, our current democratic republic system claims to be a tyranny of the majority on paper anyway. The &quot;mainstream narrative of government&quot; is the majority of society votes who they want to represent them to congress or city council, and then the majority of congress votes on what legislation to pass. Of course, as we all know in real life this system quickly devolves into a convoluted political game, where representatives spend most of their time trying to run a campaign, smearing their opponent, and raising their own salary. The rich acquire decision-making power over society and use it to get richer. Counter-intuitive legislation is passed such as continuing endless wars and bailing out bankers. A lot of the problem is politics. Politics is high school popularity bullshit; there&#39;s no governing actually involved in politics. When most people say they want money out of politics, they mean they want bribery out of government. <em>I think we need to get politics out of government.</em></p>

<p>What if the majority of a community passes a law saying &quot;it&#39;s legal to kill black people?&quot; This kind of thinking is becoming less and less prevalent as humanity connects via the internet. But let&#39;s just pretend that it did pass. It should go without saying that society would change. It is highly likely that society would be much worse if legislation such as this is passed. Many more people in society would be unhappy, and this dissatisfaction could easily be expressed in legislation repealing the legalize genocide law. In the unlikely case that society is, for some reason, actually more pleasant with legalized genocide than what&#39;s the problem? I believe that it&#39;s impossible to draw a line about what should and shouldn&#39;t be legal that is applicable to all people in all times. As long as we have a fluid system controlled by the population, we&#39;ll always be able to efficiently deal with problems like this as they arise.</p>

<p>For instance, it&#39;s quite possible that in the future, the majority of people will think it&#39;s &quot;moral&quot; to euthanize old people due to the potential lack of resources in the future. California already sterilizes pedophiles, Texas already kills murderers, and we used to sterilize gays. If Egypt passed a law saying it&#39;s okay to kill Jews, most Jews wouldn&#39;t stay in Egypt and demand that the majority of society repeals the law the majority of society agreed on. The smart ones would just leave. This would still be better than the existing system. Gradual changes are the key.</p>

<p>If the majority of society decides to pass a stupid law, then society will learn the hard way not to pass it in the future. This system doesn&#39;t put a genius in charge, it decentralizes leadership. Bad decisions can still be made, but at least we make them as a community. And if you still need to &quot;hold someone accountable&quot; (whatever that means) the name and location of the the person who proposed the legislation will be available for all. You can&#39;t be a citizen if you don&#39;t have an address in the community. This is exactly how it is now in pretty much every country.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t guarantee my exact plan would work, but similar decentralized leadership systems are already used quite successfully by organizations such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Valve, or even the country of Switzerland. Oh yeah, and systems such as <a href="http://www.weusecoins.com/">bitcoin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Wikipedia_Works">wikipedia</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">human brain</a> and the <a href="http://www.investintech.com/content/historyinternet/">internet</a> have been wildly successful using decentralized systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bravo. That was a nice in depth answer. I agree with your idea, ive thought about it myself a few times. The only thing I cant get over is the fact that the masses are easily influenced. Lets say instead of putting people to death we made them fight each other until one killed the other. Well say it was voted in by the people that you could watch convicts kill each other on live t.v. at that point society agreed that watching a human die for sport is acceptable. Would you agree to this law? Yay or nay doesnt matter because its legal. So because humanity changed and bloodsport is now legal, there would be no way of knowing where else it would go. Again my situation is hypothetical but with out limits on what the people could vote for and a common agreement on what is right and wrong society will crumble away anyways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>The masses are easily influenced, but good memes are far less transient among the masses because they improve the lives of individuals in pragmatic ways. In any case, this isn&#39;t any different than the existing system. At least the actual decision-making would be in the masses hands this way once people started waking up.</p>

<p>As for whether or not I agree with this law, I personally would. Humans are not inherently good or bad, and the system I&#39;m proposing is not a utopia. It&#39;s practical way to at least give most of society control over themselves (effectively giving ideas themselves power), as opposed to individuals controlling society. However, I do believe that allowing decision-making to be more fluid will allow at least a portion of society to eventually diffuse into a utopia. This utopian way of running society would begin spreading virally due to the reports of people who live there. </p>

<p>If I really disagreed with this law, I would propose legislation repealing the bloodsport amendment. Also I would have a strong enough argument for this and enough tangible evidence to convince the majority of the population to pass my legislation. If I didn&#39;t, I guess I would either move to a place where they didn&#39;t have this law, propose legislation for an existing political entity to secede, or never get caught breaking the law &amp; criticize people for thinking bloodsport is okay. Every single individual will never agree with every single other individual in society on what is right and wrong. This system doesn&#39;t address this timeless problem. What I&#39;m proposing addresses the problem that government is not currently a conduit for the decision-making power of society, but rather wealthy individuals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they choose not to obey laws agreed upon by society, they can leave or propose their own legislation to change laws to be how they want. Theoretically, this system could even be used to legally secede. You could use this system to theoretically create an anarchist community, it just uses the framework of the existing system to make these changes. Despite what politicians tell you, every law ever is just some words in a document. Laws are just made-up, agreed upon reality. If the president and all the other people in government simultaneously agreed that they want to remove parts of the constitution, they can (and did). Hacking democracy just gives that decision-making power to the people, instead of individuals. Individuals are much easier to bribe than communities. And if someone can successfully bribe an entire community to pass legislation he wants? So be it! All of the citizens succumbing to the bribe have free will, they can do what they want with their vote, even sell it.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say some people rejected the decision made by the majority of society and by extension the legislation passed via the digital direct democracy representative. There&#39;s actually nothing stopping them from ignoring these laws on their own private property, just like now. They just can&#39;t do it in public. It is pretty unlikely that people (or even existing leaders) would pass legislation implanting a guard or a camera in everyone&#39;s private property. I argue that most people won&#39;t want to live in anarchy, at least until we have better technology. All of those who want to pool resources can. People who don&#39;t want to, don&#39;t have to. You can&#39;t benefit from society&#39;s resources though, without submitting to the laws it creates. Explain to me how this isn&#39;t fair.</p>

<p>Is it fair for the 50% + 1 to force their beliefs on the 50% -1? There are a lot of people who simply refuse to endorse (by voting) the use of violence by government to force their beliefs on others. Your comments make it clear that you <em>do</em> endorse government initiating violence on individuals to force your beliefs on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Revolution, in the traditional sense simply perpetuates the cycle.  In order to achieve real and lasting change we need to transcend this cycle. </p>

<p>According to Weishaupt there are 5 stages of human history;</p>

<p>&quot; (4) Bureaucracy, the result of the synthesis of stage 3 failing. A spiritual void where absolutely no deity would be acknowledged. People cannot abide this void and escape into fantasy, drugs, or madness. During this phase the destruction of the middle class takes place. </p>

<p>(5) Aftermath, where society implodes and reverts to chaos. The bureaucracy crashes under the weight of its own red tape and things spiral out of control. Magic and nature now rule again, and the cycle is in preparation to begin again. Hence the Scottish Rite 32° motto: “Order from Chaos&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is something I&#39;ve thought about many times before. If revolution were to occur in the US, I really doubt more than maybe 60% percent of the country would be for it. With that said, the government would have pretty good backing to justify things like killing those revolting. I feel like if they wanted to wipe out the people causing problems, there would be nowhere to hide. What would stop them from flying drones equipped with thermographic cameras over those people and wiping them out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But dont you think a lot of it would come down to the terminology mainstream news outlets/gov use to refer the revolters? Specifically, if the official narrative is that these are extremists or whatever, I could see a lot of people swallowing it- military included - just as they have been for years.</p>

<p>And aren&#39;t the people who are attracted to the military in the first place really into the whole heirarchy/&quot;don&#39;t question orders&quot; thing? US soldiers already are given a plausible enough justification (for them) for attacking US citizens, apparently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two parts to any revolution. The first part, the long part, is convincing the people. Then the last part is fairly quick, at least if the first part was done properly. </p>

<p>In the American revolution the people were convinced before July 4, 1776. Then the rich ran as fast as they could to get in front of the revolution and to pretend they were its leaders. Most of the actual fighting was in the war for independence, cause the revolution part was over.</p>

<p>In the French revolution there was little fighting. The day came when the French military and police would not protect the king. In the Russian Revolution the day came when the military and police would not protect the Czar. It was only with the western funding of the forces of the formerly rich that there was much fighting in Russia. In Vietnam the revolutionaries, for years, again and again wanted to fight but Ho Chi Minh (Nguyễn the Patriot), kept telling them &quot;No, No, not yet. The time is not yet.&quot; When there was finally a revolution there was one death, the king abdicated and the revolution was complete. It was only the French and later American arming of the Vietnamese minion class and getting them to fight that produced the carnage we saw on TV.</p>

<p>But in all these cases, the actual revolution part was nearly bloodless. But first we have to convince the people. Then the tyrants fall at a touch. </p>

<p>And after the convincing, then there has to be a spark. It was famine in France and Russia that sparked their revolutions. The defeat of the Japanese that sparked the Chinese and Vietnamese revolutions as the defeat of Britain by the French allowed the American revolution to take root. </p>

<p>The spark will always come. But first we must educate people in the need for revolution, for the spark to take flame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you are forgetting while those trump cards will work in a war that is against a foreign nation, that will not work here.  Is america going to nuke itself? I doubt it.  It forces a mandatory &quot;Boots on the ground&quot; type of war.  I have said this before, if we can make the war not profitable than we have won before it even starts, and it never will.  All we have to do is be not worth fighting.  All these assholes want is more money.  If they have to pay money for bombs to bomb us, lose tax money almost entirely (as they are waging a war against people who once payed taxes), accommodate all the military people who did not go awol (As most will not fire on the US) and then rebuild the whole infrastructural after they fuck their own country up they stand to lose a ton of money on that war.  So, essentially all we have to do is maintain a place of readiness and the war will never happen.  They will know (because they are not as stupid as they act) that they cannot profit from it and therefore will not go ahead with it.  They will realize that it is far more profitable to be at least accommodating enough to us to where the majority of the country does not realize their oppression. </p>
