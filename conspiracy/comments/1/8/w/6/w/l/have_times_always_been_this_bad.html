<p>Have things always been this bad? I realize the internet and info-sharing has at least made it appear that way. I see so much about wars and injustices, and revolution, I just wonder if people have always been this way or is this generation actually experiencing something different?  Is it actually time to start a “resistance” of some sort? Could we discuss? </p>

I began by researching 9/11 and after a while it is very disturbing to realize how long we (the general public) have been lied to and manipulated. Prior to 9/11 I knew things were kind of messed up and I also knew that George W Bush was very bad news, but since 9/11 it has gotten increasingly crazy, almost too hard to believe. Personally I am not sure if anything can save the country anymore.  </p>

<p>Yes, any anyone with a high school level grasp of history can attest to.</p>

<p>There has always been corruption. There has always been abuse. There have always been wars, and those wars have always been driven by less than noble purposes. There have always been revolutions. There have always been powerful people living on the backs of the lower classes.</p>

<p>People love, love, <em>love</em> to look back with rose-colored glasses and talk about how things have gotten worse from when they were younger. People have been talking that rubbish for as long as people have been talking.</p>

<p>Hell, anyone who I ardently into conspiracy theory and has been for a long time will tell you, if they&#39;re honest, that this &quot;things have never been this bad, revolution is right around the corner&quot; talk has been going on for years and years and years. Each new administration is the one that will finally declare martial law. Each year there are new cries of, &quot;the revolution is near.&quot;</p>

<p>But the fact is, as anyone with an education knows, wars, injustices, revolution, none of these things are modern phenomenom, nor are they somehow far more prevelant now than in the past. Even the most basic study of history makes that clear.</p>

<p>You can believe the facts, or you can believe those who rabidly blame teh jOOs for every ill they see in the world.</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s what people <em>do</em>. It&#39;s what they&#39;ve always done. They look back and say, &quot;Things were better when ...&quot;</p>

<p>They&#39;ve done it forever. Try reading some historical journals, philosphy, commentary, and so on, or even just simply talking to retirees how <em>their</em> parents and grandparents talked. People decry the state of the world and say it&#39;s getting worse. Young people just don&#39;t get it, etc etc.</p>

<p>The lament is as old as the hills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is definitely becoming a darker and more evil world by the decade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one with even the most basic grasp of the depravity and evil in humankind&#39;s history would make that claim. No one with an education that includes actual history would make such a claim. The absolute laundry list of evils and injusties and depraved things that were simply <em>accepted</em> western society but which have slowly been set behind makes the claim that today&#39;s world is &quot;darker and more evil&quot; laughable on its face.</p>

<p>While certain things <em>are</em> getting worse, especially with regard to the scope of government powers, a myriad other things have done nothing but <em>improve</em>.</p>

<p>The claim is about as credible as end of the world claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in the 50s you could leave your front door unlocked</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most communities, you still can. Even when compared to the 1950s, a rare and brief period of economic prosperity that was also a rare and brief period with historic lows in crime (making such comparisons foolish, as any comparison to a best case or worst case is), violent crime figures violent crime figures are not way off the mark.</p>

<p>In fact, in America, at least, they&#39;ve been <em>dropping</em> for years. Urban centers continue to have troubling crime rates and the worst continue to be dangerous places, but small town America and suburbia is hardly a great deal more dangerous than it was years ago, and the numbers bear this out.</p>

<p>This is, once again, people saying &quot;things were better when...&quot; even if the facts don&#39;t bear out the claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you could ask anyone to do anything for you, now noone wants to know</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re a paranoid shut-in, maybe. I&#39;ve never had trouble with getting or giving help with a broken down car on the side of the, helping people with groceries, etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what kind of world you live it, but it isn&#39;t mine.</p>

<p>this whole post of yours is a sad attempt at sounding educated... historical journal give me a break, who told you that would be a great way of sounding smart to potential conspiracy theorists?

    <div class="md"><p>Today is better than most other times. It depends on when you want to compare &quot;now&quot; to, and what particular demographic you want to compare it to. Up until about 150 years ago, a substantial fraction of people lived in slavery. It wasn&#39;t until the 1920 that women had the right to vote. So, you know ... if you&#39;re comparing &quot;now&quot; to then, you have to add the caveat that you&#39;re just talking about middle-class white males. And really, any time under Jim Crow and segregation would probably be worse than now if you&#39;re not adding that caveat in.</p>

<p>It also depends on what part of the world you&#39;re talking about. Living in Soviet Russia was undoubtably worse than living in the United States of America, and even with all the shit that Russia does today, Russia is still a better place to live in than any time in its past.</p>

<p>So if we confine &quot;where&quot; to mean the United States of America, and we can probably agree that the world wars were worse than the current day (being drafted, internment camps, suspicion of spies, the government literally developing doomsday weapons), then we&#39;re basically left with the time period from 1945 to now. (And if you&#39;re talking about men and women of all colors, then I think you&#39;re basically left with the time period from 1970 to now.)</p>

<p>So I guess I&#39;m left wondering what you mean by &quot;this bad&quot;. We no longer live under the threat of the Cold War and looming nuclear war. The economy isn&#39;t great, but that&#39;s not really all that atypical - the longest period of sustained growth and prosperity was in the 1990s, which is why it might be seen that way (brought to a close by 9/11 and the dot-com bubble bursting). If you&#39;re talking about what the government is doing ... well, it depends on what you believe they&#39;re doing. The government from the 40s to today was involved in lots of overthrows of democratically elected leaders in lots of countries around the world, involved itself in multiple proxy wars, spied relentlessly on its people, ran experiments on people without consent, arrested people for freely speaking their minds, etc.</p>

<p>I guess my opinion is that we&#39;re not living in the best possible time, but that it&#39;s far from the worst. The reason that people have this perception that now is the worst possible time can mostly be attributed to psychology and an increased flow of information.</p>

<p>No they used to be a lot worse. If anything the last few decades have been the exception. Running hot water, electricity, tv, internet abundant food, automobiles, heating, ac, social security, etc. Hell you don&#39;t even need to work for half of theses if you get a gov&#39;t check.

    <div class="md"><p>Politely disagreeing.   Although technology has made a more comfortable and convenient lifestyle for humans; I think the answer to OP&#39;s question is : depends on who you ask.</p>

<p>Middle-aged, middle-class, white male -no.
Black woman -yes.</p>

<p>I have a very light skin grandmother who use to &quot;pass &quot; when she was younger.   She has some stories to tell.  She questioned everything and instilled that in me.  Look at people like Malcolm X talking about the conspiracy against an entire race of people and when he realized it went beyond race; that all people were in this mess together -bam, dead for having a big mouth and educating people.</p>

<p>I think the internet gives a wider audience which is good.  However, every idiot has a blog and that maybe ain&#39;t so good. </p>

<p>Also maybe I just don&#39;t read up on my history enough, but wasn&#39;t Malcolm X for all intents and purposes a black supremacist? I don&#39;t think he ever spoke about white people being oppressed. If I&#39;m wrong about that feel free to correct me though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure it was so much a counter offer so much as a correction.  It depends on who you ask this question.  For some people it may be worse.  Not everyone wants to participate in our current ways of living and have no choice but to participate.</p>

<p>Perception is reality and we all perceive differently.</p>

<p>Malcolm X wasn&#39;t a black supremest so much as an educator to the black people in the USA.  For centuries they were told their natural features were ugly and they were flawed in all aspects of life due to their ethnicity.  He preached the opposite, educated the ignorant and those in delusion. He wanted to empower the black community and have independence and self reliance ...  By any means necessary.  </p>

<p>After a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he worshipped the same religion side -by -side with all pigmented people, he came to realize that oppression is larger than race. Not only is the oppressed person deserving of compassion, but the oppressor too is living in delusion and the confines of this system.   When he returned and spoke of a larger &quot;conspiracy &quot;, if you will,  he was quickly assassinated. </p>

<p>People will be killed today for having too powerful a voice that persuades others from the status quo.  So no, it hasn&#39;t changed for those people.</p>

<p>My only point is : it depends on who you ask!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it hasn&#39;t; and I am old enough to have watched it happen. It all <em>really</em> went to hell when they assassinated Kennedy, which was actually a silent Federal-Reserve/CIA coup that made the US subservient to the whims of the Club Of Rome globalists who own the international banks which compose the Federal Reserve, and who decided in 1968 that the American standard of living, which had become the envy of the world, had to go, because they thought (and still do) that the planet could not sustain the rest of the world trying to live so well (the matter was really that the privileged class felt threatened by the democracy and republic a global middle class would bring). But we didn&#39;t feel the full impact of it until 1971, when it was clear all our gold had been stolen by said globalist banksters, and Nixon took the US off the gold standard, allowing the dollar to be entirely fiat currency. Then the lives of working people suddenly started going to hell; money, jobs, family-life, social-life, religious-life, housing, cars, music, movies, clothes; the whole lot; and they&#39;ve been going to hell ever since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a dinosaur of the interwebs (late 40&#39;s), I feel I have an interesting vantage point on what has occurred over the last couple of decades.  </p>

<p>I think there are two large paradigm shifts occurring, simultaneously ...</p>

<p>1st - 9/11 has had a massive effect on personal freedoms inside and outside of the USA. Zionism has been gaining momentum. Many in the &quot;West&quot; just support the Israel lobby, without thinking rationally and regardless of the specifics of any proposed policy. The Persian is the &quot;boogey man&quot; in this new world reality. Look at the recent UN vote on Palestine&#39;s future to see how Zionism has taken hold in our &quot;western world&quot;. Also, countries are lining up with their support for an eventual conflict - I live in Canada and we are more like American lapdogs everyday that goes by.</p>

<p>2nd - Literacy and the internet has changed the game. Ignorance is now a choice, not an inevitability. Religion is quickly eroding, pockets of resistance against blind statism and many people are questioning the motives of what the military does. MOOCs are an example of the coming changes to acquiring knowledge, due to the web. The shit that TPTB got away with in the past is now immediately scrutinized and openly debated. </p>

<p>There is still widespread ignorance, but those who suffer from this do so by choice. We have a real shot at winning this battle if we can keep the 1% from turning the internet into &quot;cable 2.0&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compared to what though? 100 years ago you probably wouldn&#39;t have lived past 45. Some of your children probably would have died during birth if not your wife. If they did live there was the possibility of polio and other terrible disease afflicting them. If we go back farther the numbers get worse. Go back to the middle ages and you have to contend with black plague which decimated Europe. Not to mention corruption of government is nothing new and has happened since we started forming them. Rome was a war machine fueled by the spoils of conquered lands, much like the us now, and I&#39;m sure Rome wasn&#39;t the first.</p>

<p>Shit has always been bad, the problem is we only have such a small slice of time to compare it to that it seems like its getting worse for us but it might just be another dip and it will go back up. I&#39;m sure when Rome fell people figured civilization was over, but it was just another empire that fell and more rose to take it&#39;s place.</p>

<p>So I have no choice but to focus on my family, water, shelter, clothing, and food...One thing is for sure, the cost of living has risen since I was a child 35 or so years ago. It is getting more difficult for a person to get by doing what they would like to do, and spending more time doing what they &quot;have&quot; to do just to live.</p>

<p>Nostalgia counts for a lot, and so does subjective situation, but I think most of us here (opinion) think that, overall, the United States is in a decline.</p>

<p>If this shit continues and there&#39;s no revolution, I&#39;ll eat my hat.

Occupy leaders have been targeted for assassination by the state. Anonymous is getting locked up. Bradley Manning and Julian Assange are effectively imprisoned or worse.

I&#39;m anticipating a hyperinflationary collapse, as I think that printing money is the easiest and most expedient way out of the chronic mismanagement of the economy over the past 30 years.</p>

<p>So far, they haven&#39;t let me down. Gold from $500 to $1600 and bitcoins from $5 to $29.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1963 was the peak of the good old days? The year Kennedy was shot? Police turning dogs and fire hoses on blacks trying to integrate? George Wallace declaring &quot;segregation forever&quot;? Self-immolating monks? CIA action all over the place (notably Ecuador and the Dominican Republic)? The Cold War? Vietnam? Do we just have a totally different understanding of history, or is your view of the rest of the 20th century so bleak that you would still call 1963 the peak of the good old days?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Housing was affordable. Jobs were plentiful. 1964 was also the Summer of Love. As far as Kennedy, well, that&#39;s part of why you might think of it as a peak too? I mean, the quality of political leadership has steadily declined ever since, if you think about it. </p>

<p>If you take a look at a constant dollar DJIA chart, 1965 was the real peak. Ever since then, we&#39;ve been going sideways, the crumbling and decline has more or less been papered over and TV&#39;d away. </p>

<p>Even the .com bubble in the &#39;90s only managed to get us, again in constant dollar terms, only slightly higher than the 1965 high. Very slightly when looked upon at those time scales.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it, all this is out there on the web.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect. The year 1967 is considered the so-called Summer of Love.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t bother to address the idea that you cherry pick a few relatively minor things to back your claim that it was the peak of the modern era, completely ignoring the slew of negatives that existed alongside the positive.</p>

<p>Honestly, if you think the tail end of a housing boom outweights the social ills of the day and somehow makes everything into a golden period, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d trust your assessment of <em>any</em> era.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess here&#39;s where we run into problems with how we define good and bad. To me, a strong economy is meaningless if black churches are getting bombed and people are getting lynched for speaking out against segregation. But if you define good and bad by employment numbers and the strength of the dollar, then I guess I can see where you&#39;re coming from. I just disagree that it&#39;s the most important metric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to look deeper. Why would blacks suddenly get uppity? The American dream had reached them; their standard of living had increased, and they were starting to feel entitled to things. The Club Of Rome saw this problem spreading to the whole world, were it allowed to continue; it had to be stopped, and while they offered American blacks civil rights with one hand, they stopped, and then reversed, the real problem of an increasing standard of living with the other; not just for blacks, but for all working Americans.</p>
