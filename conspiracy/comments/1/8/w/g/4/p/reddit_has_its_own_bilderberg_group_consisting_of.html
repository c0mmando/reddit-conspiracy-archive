       I mean if you're even seeing this kind of elitist/secret behavior for a bunch of internet moderators, you are seeing the Bilderberg group and other secret societies on a much smaller scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do people do this? Why do they want to form these secret 'clubs'? What is the point? It seems petty and idiotic.

       He is only hinting at the existence of what is in reality an NY inner circle (it extends elsewhere, but this is the primary clique).
      </p>
      <p>
       They are the operatives of payola for Advance Publications. You really think the sears
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RltB0.png">
        fax fiasco
       </a>
       was the only time Advance Publications et al ordered a hit on a thread?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about when
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/S08Jt">
        these
       </a>
       comments turn into

        this barren wasteland
       </a>
       ? Atlantic Records seems to have got on the phone pretty quick to quell the that twitter bomb. God forbid team breezy stops buying those itunes singles!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, watching masta come in claiming hate speech was behind the removal was hilarious as that imgur album promulgated throughout the land. More suspicious because masta was also posting advice in ideasfortheadmins asking for power to mass delte comments without having to confirm each and every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, what about the
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17n20m/applebees_fires_waitress_for_exposing_pastors/">
        Applebee's thread

       in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       which was deleted from the front page by moderators?
      </p>
      <p>
       See, the sears fax fiasco must lead us to ask these questions. Otherwise people like those

       fuckers will continue to take paylola and degrade the very fiber of an aggregate by facilitating payola on a large scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       This happen on subs starting about 50,000 or 100,000; but it is chump change at that point. Big money subs are a huge clique and SEO spamming is seriously dangerous.

       </a>
       are but a few of the examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think, albeit on a mundane level, this
       <a href="/r/soccer">
        /r/soccer
       </a>
       mod said it best.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HQGetan.png">
        "We have had people offer us money in the past to put us on the approved submitter list and help them get their stuff to the front page."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I think both VA and PIMA knew about this payola. PIMA went public about it and he's gone, just look at the rat pack's subreddit
       <a href="/r/risingthreads">
        /r/risingthreads
       </a>
       and you'll see what I mean about PIMA. VA resigned from
       <a href="/r/wtf">
        /r/wtf
       </a>
       after the Chris Brown thread was deleted. Then SRS randomly starts targeting him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, don't even get me started on the hit bridages like SRS which are allowed to go around group voting and doxxing people because it furthers the interests of the red lettered people. "Oh, we didn't ban that subreddit which was drawing negative media attention to us when we hand out our business cards at Advance Publications events, that guy resigned because his personal information was released by a know SA troll and we allowed the article to promulgate until he feared for his life and left the site. That's why it's gone".
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking payola man. Leave the internet alone you greedy fucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I think this place was started for this purpose. Alexis got 20,000 in seed money from whom? And where was the idea pitched? And what company bought it first? All interesting questions. Monetize. Monetize. Monetize. It's the American way.

       Fascinating read. To be fair though, reddit isn't really for us. It's for undiscerning consumers who can be easily swayed by an anonymous blurb's assertion of authority. We're the unwanted remnants of an idealistic and relatively archaic internet... dinosaurs waiting to go extinct... on reddit, at least. Monetize indeed.

       You don't want to comment on this as well D_E? Perhaps Andrew will join us as well for a conversation about for whom reddit is really making money. Making pages load artificially slowly to encourage more gold subscriptions wasn't good enough for the big boys?

       1) Did VA resign (*from r/wtf) due to the Chris Brown thread being censored? Don't bother lying again, I have the screengrabs from his internetama from right after the incident.

       1) Then why did Masta begin by cliaming he removed it for hate speech until he realized someone screengrabbed the comments, only then switching to the lynch mob excuse.

       No one disputes that. Rather it is how they make money on which my attention is focused. Advertising is okay, payola is unjust and, if exposed, would make people leave the site.

         I don't believe masta ever said that. I believe you are full of shit about that one. It doesn't really matter though because he can remove whatever he wants from his own subreddit.

         I personally do not give  a fuck if he hit hurt. He could beat her again and it wouldn't change my day at all. It has nothing to do with me.

         yes, censorship by the company that owes me nothing is totally fine. If I don't like it, I will leave.

         no because the other mods would see that happening. Bots are voted in or out of subreddits.

       Bye for now Andrew. See you in a few months. I like when you get angry, leads me to believe I'm on the right path. That's the beauty of conjecture though, you get more out of the response than you do from the content.

       1) fuck you for that sentence you dick. 2) How about when his PR firm whitewashes the incident from biting her and viciously brutalizing her into "he hit her" such that team breezy won't stop buying itunes singles?

       No "endgame" will ever make everyone happy.
You can either properly educate, which takes time and resources, but most people want to see their goals come to light sooner than later.

      <p>
       It is much more efficient to trick/brainswash/bait and switch.  If done correctly most people will contribute without knowing.

       In this situation, it would be fairly hard to discuss the future of this site if everyone could chime in whenever they want.  As long as the public is notified of the "best" solution before they attempt to implement it, there really is no problem.  These people have worked for what they have, we have not.  We should still get a say, but we have no right to be part of early idea think tanks we do not directly contribute to in a meaningful way.

       It's simple, people are only capable of effective communication in small groups.  Real communication is not 1 way like posting on reddit, it's 2 (or more) way and requires back and forth through multiple iterations.  This breaks down completely if the group gets too large so to maintain effective communication you have to exclude most people and form a small group that can effectively communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are of course consequences to this that we see everyday as elitism, exclusion, etc.  But there sadly isn't any other option.

       The most important goal of
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       humans was to control other humans, and that was only after it was understood that humans could be more efficient than pack animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your parroted ideology ignores completely that humans quest for
       <em>
        knowledge
       </em>
       above all else. Some for power over themselves, and yes some for power over others.
      </p>
      <p>
       But saying THE MOST IMPORTANT goal has ALWAYS been control over other Humans is a textbook psychopath thing to say.

       game theory indicates that psychopaths would enjoy a great advantage over passive knowledge seekers.
      </p>
      <p>
       in short time, the psychopaths will dominate society, while others cope with the psychopath dominated society.    It's sick people all the way down.

       LOL&lt; the better question is:
 why is what other people are taking about any of your business?
Do  you have a secret that you have told someone else?  Or made a plan to do something and its important that no one else knows?  Then you know your answer.

       For a long long time, smart people and people in charge were killed for just being smart by being labeled witches and such. I think we're just now at the point where people can handle reality and truth. I hope its soon, the human IQ is dropping yearly. Who knows what happens when it goes too far

       i'm not sure if any have been peer reviewed. but multiple studies have been done since the 50's that have only showed this to be true. lack of peer review doesn't mean it isn't so, as i can't find anything to the opposite.
