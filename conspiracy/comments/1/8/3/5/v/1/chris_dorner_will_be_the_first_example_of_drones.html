<p>Just now on CNN the founder of &#39;SEAL Survival LLC&#39; was talking on CNN and said the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...And talking about drones. This would be the perfect perfect opportunity to use a drone to find this guy&quot;</p>

<p>They just confirmed they are using &quot;Air resources with FLIR&quot; to hunt the area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read his full, unedited Manifesto here - this dude is pissed, and if what&#39;s said within is accurate, he has every right to be:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/TAzPRfPy">http://pastebin.com/TAzPRfPy</a></p>

<p>Damn, did they ever piss off the wrong guy.</p>

<p>From the Manifesto: &quot;I know your TTP&#39;s, (techniques, tactics, and procedures). Any threat assessments you you generate will be useless. This is simple, I know your TTP&#39;s and PPR&#39;s. I will mitigate any of your attempts at preservation. ORM is my friend. I will mitigate all risks, threats and hazards. I assure you that Incident Command Posts will be target rich environments. KMA-367 license plate frames are great target indicators and make target selection even easier.</p>

<p>I will conduct DA operations to destroy, exploit and seize designated targets. If unsuccessful or unable to meet objectives in these initial small scale offensive actions, I will reassess my BDA and re-attack until objectives are met. I have nothing to lose. My personal casualty means nothing. Just alike AAF&#39;s, ACM&#39;s, and AIF&#39;s, you can not prevail against an enemy combatant who has no fear of death. An enemy who embraces death is a lose, lose situation for their enemy combatants.</p>

<p>Hopefully you analyst have done your homework. You are aware that I have always been the top shot, highest score, an expert in rifle qualifications in every unit I’ve been in. I will utilize every bit of small arms training, demolition, ordnance, and survival training I&#39;ve been given.</p>

<p>Do you know why we are unsuccessful in asymmetrical and guerrilla warfare in CENTCOM theatre of operations? I’ll tell you. It&#39;s not the inefficiency of our combatant commanders, planning, readiness or training of troops. Much like the Vietnam war, ACM, AAF, foreign fighters, Jihadist, and JAM have nothing to lose. They embrace death as it is a way of life. I simply don&#39;t fear it. I am the walking exigent circumstance you created.</p>

<p>The Violence of action will be HIGH. I am the reason TAC alert was established. I will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty. ISR is my strength and your weakness. You will now live the life of the prey. Your RD&#39;s and homes away from work will be my AO and battle space. I will utilize every tool within INT collections that I learned from NMITC in Dam Neck. You have misjudged a sleeping giant. There is no conventional threat assessment for me. JAM, New Ba&#39;ath party, 1920 rev BGE, ACM, AAF, AQAP, AQIM and AQIZ have nothing on me. Do not deploy airships or gunships. SA-7 Manpads will be waiting. As you know I also own Barrett .50&#39;s so your APC are defunct and futile.</p>

<p>You better have all your officers radio/phone muster (code 1) on or off duty every hour, on the hour. Do not attempt to shadow or conduct any type of ISR on me. I have the inventory listing of all UC vehicles at Piper Tech and the home addresses of any INT analyst at JRIC and detachment locations. My POA is always POI and always true. This will be a war of attrition and a Pyrrhic and Camdean Victory for myself. You may have the resources and manpower but you are reactive and predictable in your op plans and TTP&#39;s. I have the strength and benefits of being unpredictable, unconventional, and unforgiving. Do not waste your time with briefs and tabletops.</p>

<p>Whatever pre-planned responses you have established for a scenario like me, shelve it. Whatever contingency plan you have, shelve it. Whatever tertiary plan you&#39;ve created, shelve it. I am a walking exigent circumstance with no OFF or reset button. JRIC, DOJ, LASD, FBI and other local LE can’t assist and should not involve themselves in a matter that does not concern them. For all other agencies, do not involve yourself in this capture or recovery of me. Look at the big picture of the situation. They (LAPD) created the situation. I will harm no outside agency unless it is a deadly force/IDOL situation. With today&#39;s budgeting and fiscal mess, you guys can not afford lose several officers to IOD or KIA/EOW. Plus, other officers should not have to take on the additional duties and responsibilities of dead officers. Think about their families, outside agencies, Chiefs/Directors.</p>

<p>Outside agencies and individual officers on patrol. If you recognize my vehicle, and confirm it is my vehicle thru a dmv/want warrant check. It behoves you to respond to dispatch that your query was for information purposes only. If you proceed with a traffic stop or attempt to notify other officers of my location or for backup you will not live to see the medal of valor you were hoping to receive for your actions. Think before you attempt to intervene. You will not survive. Your family will receive that medal of valor posthumously. It will gather dust on the fireplace mantel for years. Then one day, it will go in a shoe box with other memories. Your mother will lose a son or daughter. Your significant other will be left alone, but they will find someone else to fill your void in the future and make them just as happy. Your children, if you have them, will call someone else mommy or daddy. Don&#39;t be selfish. Your vest is only a level II or IIIA, think about it.</p>

<p>No amount of IMINT, MASINT, and ELINT assist you in capturing me. I am off the grid. You better use your feet, tongue and every available DOD/ NON-DOD HUMINT agency, contractor to find me. I know your route to and from home, and your division. I know your significant others routine, your children&#39;s best friends and recess. I know Your Sancha&#39;s gym hours and routine. I assure you that the casualty rate will be high. Because of that, no one will remember your name. You will merely be a DR# and &quot;that guy&quot; who was KIA/EOW or long term IOD/light duty in the kit room. This is exactly why &quot;station 500&quot; was created. Unfortunately, orphanages will be making a comeback in the 21st century.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s just baiting them in to commit acts of murder like they did on the two women in the blue truck. Brilliant in all honesty. Now that the LAPD has committed a blatant murder they will have to be ultra cautious, giving him an advantage.</p>

<p>Edit: as I have replied multiple times further down in this thread, they did not die. I had initially assume that from the picture of the shot up truck. I am sorry for the confusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem why his report on his training officer kicking the subject was not believed was that he waited two weeks to make the report - only immediately after he received a negative performance evaluation from said training officers.</p>

<p>Additionally three hotel workers who witnessed the arrest said they did not witness any violence. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how true above is, it was reported by LAtimes.com. But there&#39;s usually more to these things than the triggerman is saying. </p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;d also like to ad that the manifesto is definitely not the ramblings of a madman it was said to be in the media. Only crazy bit is going after children of cops, you cant choose your parents after all. He shot two innocents, but then again LAPD had <em>no problem</em> opening up on a random car whose occupants they couldn&#39;t even see .. that&#39;s actions of madmen. </p>

<p>I detest ALL violence!  However, innocence is rare.  Violence has become a vile part of our &quot;civilized &quot; culture.   </p>

<p>I think the point this guy is making is much larger ....do you think Palestinian children are innocent? How about Iraqi&#39;s, Afghans? The rage should be with every person who watches daily injustice and does nothing.  When you hear a friend use the word nigger, call someone a fag do you stand up?  Are you innocent? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points, and all very valid, but, if he was really <em>that</em> pissed at the commissioner, then he should have shot the fucking commissioner <em>himself</em> - not his daughter and her husband.  I think the point he was trying to make would have been a bit more cogent if he would have offed someone much closer to the source of his disgruntlement.</p>

<p>Again, however, you raise valid points.  As such, and using your own decent logic, both you AND me and everyone pretty much is likely <em>really</em> complicit in all the bullshit that is going on in the world.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s a good question, but 1) I&#39;m not 100% sure someone as corrupt as the police commissioner has a sufficient grasp of his wrong doing to really understand that THAT is the reason his kid got offed, and 2) even he DOES have that level of understanding, Dorner (if, again, he <em>did</em> in fact do the deed) did <em>not</em> in any way do himself any favors by offing them.  I think he would have had so much more of the public on his side otherwise.  For these two reasons, therefore, I really think it would have been better if the commissioner himself would have just been offed.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> indeed horrible...I keep thinking about how we as citizens can come together and form some sort of &quot;Citizens&#39; Militia&quot; or something to fucking <em>fight back</em>.</p>

<p>And then what though?  What do you - what do <em>we</em> - do if/when &quot;all hope is lost&quot;?  Do we just crawl up in a ball and allow TPTB to continue forcefully prison fucking us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t get here is that this guy killed 3 people. THREE! </p>

<p>But as a result of the manhunt, TWO innocent people have already been shot because the cops went all gung ho trying to protect themselves. </p>

<p>I thought they were supposed to protect US! </p>

<p>For this reason alone, the public should be outraged. </p>

<p>I wish people would listen to what the man says, but nope; he&#39;s labeled a &quot;crazy&quot; person by the media now. So no one will listen. Knee-jerk, reactionary, no thought process involved. Bills to pay, kids to feed, stuff to buy. Ain&#39;t no body go time fo dat. </p>

<p>Even the cops themselves said right on the news: &quot;Why would you testify against an officer? You don&#39;t do that.&quot; WTF? That&#39;s a big enough red flag for me right there to doubt anything the news says. </p>

<p>We should be demanding that the LAPD cease all intrusion upon ordinary citizens in this manhunt, and that Chris Dorner be captured alive so that he can tell his side of these events. Any thing other than this will result in a HUGE independent investigation into police actions, if such a thing is even possible anymore. </p>

<p>Those policemen should be so fucking scared to shoot at anything, let alone a innocent bystander. Instead, they just fire at will like it&#39;s just some sort of game or movie. They should be frightened at the thought of being held accountable, but apparently they know that&#39;s never going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem why his report on his training officer kicking the subject was not believed was that he waited two weeks to make the report - only immediately after he received a negative performance evaluation from said training officers.</p>

<p>Additionally three hotel workers who witnessed the arrest said they did not witness any violence. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how true above is, it was reported by LAtimes.com. But there&#39;s usually more to these things than the triggerman is saying. </p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;d also like to ad that the manifesto is definitely not the ramblings of a madman it was said to be in the media. Only crazy bit is going after children of cops, you cant choose your parents after all. He shot two innocents, but then again LAPD had <em>no problem</em> opening up on a random car whose occupants they couldn&#39;t even see .. that&#39;s actions of madmen. </p>
