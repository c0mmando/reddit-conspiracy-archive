    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, brother <em>no</em>.  We the people - the <em>civilians</em> - can&#39;t sit around waiting for the military and the police force to revolt because it is THEY that are the ones amongst us that are <em>most</em> brainwashed and indoctrinated by the 1% slave masters.  I <em>really</em> don&#39;t think that it will be THEY who start the revolt.  I think what needs to happen is the people themselves - the civilian citizenry - need to revolt, but we need to do it in such a way that ultimately TAKES the military and police for <em>with</em> us and puts them on our side.  Way easier said than done, of course, because it will be the military and the police force that will be the first ones set on us to attack us and protect that evil system once we do start revolting, but we simply cannot wait for them to be the ones to revolt because in all likelihood, they simply WON&#39;T revolt.  They themselves need a catalyst...and WE the citizenry would be that catalyst.  We can&#39;t wait for them to do it because they are the idiot watch/guard dogs of TPTB, have been HEAVILY indoctrinated and brain washed in that capacity, and will in all likelihood NOT just go AWOL on their leaders/masters/owners of their own accord.  Again, they need a catalyst, and the catalyst has to be <em>us</em> - the citizenry - fighting back because we simply can&#39;t take the manipulation and oppression any more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Militias of typical Americans revolting will be painted all over the media as crazy loony conspiracy nutters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then it&#39;s ALL of our jobs to - each and everyone of us - embody the spirit and turn <em>into</em> a Martin Luther King Jr., a Malcolm X, a John F Kennedy.  We need to embody their stance and their direction and their willingness to not only stand against the system, but to ARTICULATE their beliefs strongly and intelligently so that everyone around understands that we&#39;re not just a bunch of stupid dogs rioting, but, instead, an intelligent, coordinated people that will NOT allow ourselves to continue further being enslaved as has definitely been happening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However Police have handcuffs. They have guns. They have &quot;authority&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck that.  We still have the 2nd Amendment.  <em>We</em> have guns.  We have fucking NUMBERS.  We can absolutely have coordinated mobility if we were to only STRIVE for that and come together as one.  We as a citizenry need to put whatever petty problems and issues we have aside and come together as <em>one</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They need to get off their asses(I know there must be some reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) and talk to their commanders in chief, talk to their sheriffs or whoever is in charge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na, man.  We can&#39;t wait for them because they&#39;re the ones chasing after Dorner right now calling him a crazed lunatic even though he may very well be anything BUT that.  As far as they&#39;re concerned, they&#39;re - again - on the side of the 1%.  They do what their masters say right now, and w/the help of the MSM, they paint anybody they&#39;re after as a bad guy to vilify them and help them go after them more easily.  Again, they&#39;re too indoctrinated right now to go on our side this soon.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but this seems to be the case/truth right now, I feel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Demand that these politicians be indicted for treason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TPTB laugh at that &quot;demand for justice!&quot; shit.  &quot;Sign this petition, everyone!  We need to send them a <em>message!</em>&quot;  Fuck that.  The message that needs to be sent is a message of ACTION - not a message of pen and ink and legal minutia.  I really wish it WAS as easy as some sort of red tape haggling.  All this would be a lot easier.  But it&#39;s not.  I really think the only way that anything will really change and get done is with physical <em>action</em>.  The people as a physical <em>body</em> need to stand up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are all responsible for arresting criminals and that is exactly what needs to happen right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WE as a citizenry need to be responsible for that I think.  Sounds crazy, I know, but I don&#39;t think the police force will do it.  The police force are their watch dogs - their protectors.  They&#39;re not going to harm their masters, my man.  That would be biting the hands that feed them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Criminals at the Federal level need to be arrested.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I fully agree.  Their direct slave/employees (police) are not likely to do it, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it comes down to revolution, I support it. But will grieve the loss of many honest hard-working Americans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re grieving the loss of all of our lives and freedoms RIGHT NOW.  It&#39;s just a much slower burn that is happening.  The &quot;Totalitarian Tip Toe&quot; of TPTB has hypnotized the masses into not understanding and seeing the fact that they area absolutely ENSLAVING us in front of our very eyes as we speak.</p>

<p>We are ALREADY loosing our lives by virtue of allowing ourselves to slowly but surely get more and more shackled every day.  I for one am not afraid to loose my life for the cause of fighting for our freedoms.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t grieve for  me.  Don&#39;t morn my loss under such circumstances if it comes to it.  I&#39;d rather die fighting hard for our freedoms than continue living with a noose of state oppression continuing to tighten and tighten around my neck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe there is a quicker solution which may still require violence - these powers will not give up easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they won&#39;t - you are correct about that.  However, if we literally ALL stand up as one American public, I feel we can put real fear into them.</p>

<p>Remember, after all:  <a href="http://torgro.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/fig-132.jpg">We are not the Liliputians.  It is <em>WE</em> that are the sleeping giant.</a>  We just need to WAKE THE FUCK UP, cuz once we do, those Goddamn little manipulative Liliputians (i.e. the 1%) that have been slowly tying us down more and more will be running like little cockroaches because as ONE ORGANISM we can absolutely <em>crush</em> them.</p>

<p>Individually and separated as we currently are, however?  We have no chance whatsoever against them.  They are small, but very intelligent and 100% conniving and evil.</p>

<p>We need to come together AS ONE and be the giant that we are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think your 2 cents are very good, but I think there needs to be a <em>shift</em> in the thinking...but then again, that&#39;s just my own 2 cents as well. :)  Ultimately, you and I are 100% on the same team.  We must not forget that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no. There was some confusion in the response you posted.  For some reason, the &quot;context&quot; didn&#39;t register when I clicked on it, so I didn&#39;t know what your own question was referring to.  Now I see it, however, so I can respond more adequately to the question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where? you see any legislation that looks even remotely like that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about legislation.  It&#39;s about ACTION.  Posting legislation toward something the public is currently generally against and something as big as a repeal on the 2nd Amendment is not something you do. That&#39;s not how something like that gets done.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called Problem-Reaction-Solution.  Ever heard of it?  You MAKE the people literally beg you to do the very thing they were previously against because you (i.e. TPTB) engaged them with a FF attack that kills quite a few of the public and scares the shit out of them and make them go &quot;Please please do something to help us!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s how it works.  If you&#39;re looking for legislation, then you&#39;re looking in the wrong place altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think it means to &#39;repeal the 2nd amendment&#39;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think a <em>start</em> to repealing it involves <em>exactly</em> what the government is already proposing.  They&#39;re proposing some sort of ban on assault weapons, etc.  Hell New York state&#39;s already put that up.</p>

<p>And what is the justification for this?  &quot;Look at the Colorado shootings!  Look at Sandy Hook!  Look at what Dorner is doing&quot;</p>

<p>...and the game goes on and on...the anty keeps being raised...until the people really DO go &quot;Holy shit!  Help us big brother!  Help us!&quot;</p>

<p>Big Brother:  &quot;Well we&#39;ll have to ban all guns in order to help YOU the citizens!&quot; (lol)</p>

<p><del>Citizens</del> Sheep:  &quot;Yes yes!  Do it!  Ban them!&quot;</p>

<p>And voilà, no more 2nd.  THAT&#39;S when the legislation gets put in.  After all the mess though.  Not before.</p>

<p>No, not really. People have been saying this shit for years and it&#39;s completely devoid of reality. If anything the supreme court has gone the other way. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s called the Hegelian dialect, you twat. I&#39;m well aware. You&#39;ve given yourself a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, Dorner &#39;only&#39; makes sense in the scheme of a false flag attack therefore it is a false flag attack, therefore it must be the Hegelian dialect at work. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what is the justification for this? &quot;Look at the Colorado shootings! Look at Sandy Hook! Look at what Dorner is doing&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But no one is claiming this except for <em>you</em>. Banning some assault weapons isn&#39;t the same thing as starting to repeal the second amendment. I&#39;m not going to have an earnest conversation with you if you <em>are</em> going to jump to conclusions. There have been previous assault weapons bans, and they have lapsed. The evidence stands against you. What&#39;s the timeframe now that New York passed this? When do you become wrong? Or are you correct in perpetuity because &#39;ther gonn terk mah guns&#39;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Big Brother: &quot;Well we&#39;ll have to ban all guns in order to help YOU the citizens!&quot; (lol)</p>

<p>This is just you. You are the only person here. Gun control advocates don&#39;t want to ban guns. You should probably socialize more. </p>

<p>No, you didn&#39;t. You even said you stopped reading. You certainly <em>didn&#39;t</em> comprehend.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to discuss with me, don&#39;t post at me. You are only posting to show everyone that you think you are so smart that you don&#39;t have to explain yourself. But it&#39;s obvious that you don&#39;t actually have a point to make.</p>

<p>When can we be realistic and analyze the situation and discuss whether or not things are as as you claim? You don&#39;t seem to be willing to discuss why my assessment is inaccurate. And it&#39;s because that would be inconvenient? As opposed to your page-long shpiel about how this must be the hegelian dialect? And you don&#39;t even know it by that name anyway...</p>

<p>Again, incorrect.  I DID read it.  I may not have read the whole mess, but I certainly read <em>some</em> of &quot;it&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You certainly <em>didn&#39;t</em> comprehend.</p>

<p>Ha.  Now <em>that&#39;s DEFINITELY</em> incorrect.  I absolutely comprehended it.  That&#39;s actually the reason I stopped reading it.  It&#39;s because I comprehended that you didn&#39;t know what the fuck you were talking about. lol.  Matter of fact, I&#39;d say I comprehended what you wrote a lot more than even you yourself did.</p>

<p>Again, that&#39;s why I stopped reading.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re not interested in discussing.  You&#39;re interested in ad hominems and proving yourself right.</p>

<p>lol.  I totally admit that I&#39;m (obviously) not above using ad hominems either, but still.  Don&#39;t say I&#39;m not willing to discuss.  I&#39;m just not willing to hear tripe.  There&#39;s enough of that on this fucking website.  I don&#39;t want to be fucking BOMBARDED with it...so I just as well blow off some people that stick their own heads TOO deeply in their own asses...and it seemed that that&#39;s EXACTLY where you were going...so I just said &quot;Okay.&quot; and just stopped reading.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not willing to continue talking if someone it more apt to not be TOO jerky.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope.  I know it does seem like that, but I&#39;m not.  Matter of fact, I&#39;m <em>so</em> not that I&#39;m willing to start afresh with you here if you wish.  If you want to wipe the slate clean and start all over and communicate a bit more amicably, I&#39;m willing.</p>

<p>Matter of fact, I won&#39;t even read any more of what you&#39;ve written in this response because I wouldn&#39;t doubt that it has more stupid shit in it and it might just cause me to say &quot;Fuck you&quot; again or something like that. lol.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even fucking REMEMBER what the hell we were even talking about in the first place, but if you wish to back track and start all over and get to the core of the issue again, then go ahead and do so and, if you&#39;re cool, I&#39;ll be cool too.</p>

<p>Peace,</p>

<p>No. I&#39;m not interested in blindly accepting your judgements of what is and isn&#39;t a false flag and the logical leaps you require to make your point. You miss the entire mechanism between banning assault weapons and taking your guns. That&#39;s kinda massive.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t. That&#39;s why you posted about it twice, and basically a third time. You can call it tripe all you want, but short of explaining why, you are proving my point.</p>

<p>What wasn&#39;t amicable about my posts? Where I called you a twat for trying to lecture me on something you don&#39;t even know the formal name of? I feel like that&#39;s an appropriate response to someone so full of themselves. How about you go back to two posts ago when you started your whole nonsensical tirade? I don&#39;t need a fresh start when it&#39;s <em>you</em> posting about everything <strong>besides</strong> whether or not Dorner is a conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>Oh, I get it. Let me try just projecting my own insecurities via lols and personal attacks because I&#39;m not willing to actually discuss anything. Is that better? Is that what you feel an appropriate emotional response would be?</p>
