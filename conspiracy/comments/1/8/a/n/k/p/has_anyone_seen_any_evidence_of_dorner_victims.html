       They're pushing the 2nd amendment repeal REAL fucking hard - and they obviously have no problem whatsoever with shooting and killing as many innocent people as they have to in order to get this thing going.

      <p>
       Think about that for a moment.  The country you/we live in is being run by people 100% willing to kill as
       <em>

       100% agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO the police/military really need to be the ones to revolt. Militias of typical Americans revolting will be painted all over the media as crazy loony conspiracy nutters.
      </p>
      <p>
       However Police have handcuffs. They have guns. They have "authority". They need to get off their asses(I know there must be some reading
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ) and talk to their commanders in chief, talk to their sheriffs or whoever is in charge. Demand that these politicians be indicted for treason. I don't care if they serve on the department in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, DC, Florida, or Georgia. They are all responsible for arresting criminals and that is exactly what needs to happen right now. Criminals at the Federal level need to be arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it comes down to revolution, I support it. But will grieve the loss of many honest hard-working Americans. I believe there is a quicker solution which may still require violence - these powers will not give up easily. But make the people who GET PAID TO DO THIS SPECIFIC JOB deal with the arrests and the violence and the criminals.

      <p>
       Just my 2 cents.

       No, brother
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       .  We the people - the
       <em>
        civilians
       </em>
       - can't sit around waiting for the military and the police force to revolt because it is THEY that are the ones amongst us that are
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       brainwashed and indoctrinated by the 1% slave masters.  I
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       don't think that it will be THEY who start the revolt.  I think what needs to happen is the people themselves - the civilian citizenry - need to revolt, but we need to do it in such a way that ultimately TAKES the military and police for
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       us and puts them on our side.  Way easier said than done, of course, because it will be the military and the police force that will be the first ones set on us to attack us and protect that evil system once we do start revolting, but we simply cannot wait for them to be the ones to revolt because in all likelihood, they simply WON'T revolt.  They themselves need a catalyst...and WE the citizenry would be that catalyst.  We can't wait for them to do it because they are the idiot watch/guard dogs of TPTB, have been HEAVILY indoctrinated and brain washed in that capacity, and will in all likelihood NOT just go AWOL on their leaders/masters/owners of their own accord.  Again, they need a catalyst, and the catalyst has to be
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       - the citizenry - fighting back because we simply can't take the manipulation and oppression any more.

       So then it's ALL of our jobs to - each and everyone of us - embody the spirit and turn
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       a Martin Luther King Jr., a Malcolm X, a John F Kennedy.  We need to embody their stance and their direction and their willingness to not only stand against the system, but to ARTICULATE their beliefs strongly and intelligently so that everyone around understands that we're not just a bunch of stupid dogs rioting, but, instead, an intelligent, coordinated people that will NOT allow ourselves to continue further being enslaved as has definitely been happening.

       Na, man.  We can't wait for them because they're the ones chasing after Dorner right now calling him a crazed lunatic even though he may very well be anything BUT that.  As far as they're concerned, they're - again - on the side of the 1%.  They do what their masters say right now, and w/the help of the MSM, they paint anybody they're after as a bad guy to vilify them and help them go after them more easily.  Again, they're too indoctrinated right now to go on our side this soon.  It's unfortunate, but this seems to be the case/truth right now, I feel.

       TPTB laugh at that "demand for justice!" shit.  "Sign this petition, everyone!  We need to send them a

All this would be a lot easier.  But it's not.  I really think the only way that anything will really change and get done is with physical
       <em>

       WE as a citizenry need to be responsible for that I think.  Sounds crazy, I know, but I don't think the police force will do it.  The police force are their watch dogs - their protectors.  They're not going to harm their masters, my man.  That would be biting the hands that feed them.

      <p>
       We're grieving the loss of all of our lives and freedoms RIGHT NOW.  It's just a much slower burn that is happening.  The "Totalitarian Tip Toe" of TPTB has hypnotized the masses into not understanding and seeing the fact that they area absolutely ENSLAVING us in front of our very eyes as we speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are ALREADY loosing our lives by virtue of allowing ourselves to slowly but surely get more and more shackled every day.  I for one am not afraid to loose my life for the cause of fighting for our freedoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't grieve for  me.  Don't morn my loss under such circumstances if it comes to it.  I'd rather die fighting hard for our freedoms than continue living with a noose of state oppression continuing to tighten and tighten around my neck.

       No they won't - you are correct about that.  However, if we literally ALL stand up as one American public, I feel we can put real fear into them.

       No no. There was some confusion in the response you posted.  For some reason, the "context" didn't register when I clicked on it, so I didn't know what your own question was referring to.  Now I see it, however, so I can respond more adequately to the question.

      <p>
       It's not about legislation.  It's about ACTION.  Posting legislation toward something the public is currently generally against and something as big as a repeal on the 2nd Amendment is not something you do. That's not how something like that gets done.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called Problem-Reaction-Solution.  Ever heard of it?  You MAKE the people literally beg you to do the very thing they were previously against because you (i.e. TPTB) engaged them with a FF attack that kills quite a few of the public and scares the shit out of them and make them go "Please please do something to help us!"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how it works.  If you're looking for legislation, then you're looking in the wrong place altogether.

       I think a
       <em>
        start
       </em>
       to repealing it involves
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what the government is already proposing.  They're proposing some sort of ban on assault weapons, etc.  Hell New York state's already put that up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what is the justification for this?  "Look at the Colorado shootings!  Look at Sandy Hook!  Look at what Dorner is doing"
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and the game goes on and on...the anty keeps being raised...until the people really DO go "Holy shit!  Help us big brother!  Help us!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Big Brother:  "Well we'll have to ban all guns in order to help YOU the citizens!" (lol)

        Citizens
       </del>
       Sheep:  "Yes yes!  Do it!  Ban them!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And voilà, no more 2nd.  THAT'S when the legislation gets put in.  After all the mess though.  Not before.

       It's called the Hegelian dialect, you twat. I'm well aware. You've given yourself a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, Dorner 'only' makes sense in the scheme of a false flag attack therefore it is a false flag attack, therefore it must be the Hegelian dialect at work.

       But no one is claiming this except for
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       . Banning some assault weapons isn't the same thing as starting to repeal the second amendment. I'm not going to have an earnest conversation with you if you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       going to jump to conclusions. There have been previous assault weapons bans, and they have lapsed. The evidence stands against you. What's the timeframe now that New York passed this? When do you become wrong? Or are you correct in perpetuity because 'ther gonn terk mah guns'?

       No. I'm not interested in blindly accepting your judgements of what is and isn't a false flag and the logical leaps you require to make your point. You miss the entire mechanism between banning assault weapons and taking your guns. That's kinda massive.

       Oh, I get it. Let me try just projecting my own insecurities via lols and personal attacks because I'm not willing to actually discuss anything. Is that better? Is that what you feel an appropriate emotional response would be?

       Well, if we already had drones, they should be able to play back the tape and see him approaching the victims location.  But then they'd also be able to play the tape back and have video evidence of the cops shooting up the paperboy.  Wonder which would be pasted on CNN?

       I love though that when we watch the LAPD press conferences, they say "We
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that Dorner killed these people." They don't even know! But most of the media takes that and says that he is the one who did it, we don't have a shred of proof, but that's what we're gonna tell ya.

       I live in riverside, and have seen pictures of the officer killed. There was a witness on site that saw the shooting and followed until he lost the vehicle. They have not released the witnesses name. The intersection of Arlington/magnolia is an odd one. Even if there were a red light camera there it would not be able to see the entire intersection, due to its curvature.

       he's not appearing in videos calling obama a liar.  (it's not evidence -- just common sense.)

       edit/ps.  by the way, the double that obama had killed was just that -- the double that the CIA/MOASSAD propped up for the video cameras.  (it's pretty well know that the real OBL died -- inconveniently -- during the bush administration.)
