       Because if you think about it, Seattle recently just returned their drones, so wouldn't it make sense that the people behind the scenes were losing money, so they needed to create a "scenario" in which to use the drones and prove how effective they can be.

       The Dorner operation is the last test. The government has violated every single protection the people have against them, and now they are just shooting random citizens. That there weren't instant riots proves that the government can do whatever the hell it pleases to the people with no fear of reprisals. The American people are livestock, and they will be treated like livestock, because they allow it. Drones, checkpoints, warrantless searches of people's homes. At this point they could line people up and cap them in the skull, because really, what the fuck would anyone do about? Write a blog post? Make a youtube video? Americans are the most pathetic people on the planet, fuck 'em.

       It's a good question.  We'd have to look back and see what it was that sparked the LA riots.  It wasn't just Rodney King or the shitty court drama we were all offered.  There were generations of tension.  Things haven't changed all that much in impoverished neighborhoods, so what is it that they have done to tone down everyone's ire?  Are people more complacent?  Why?  Are they less aware somehow?  Maybe it is a combination of disinformation, electing a "black" president to keep the minorities feeling like things have changed and our diet that makes us all sluggish depressed cattle.  All assumptions on my part.  No sources, unfortunately.

       Agree with everything . The United States Government is the biggest terrorist cell in the world . Americans are the biggest pussies and are scared shitless of everything and will believe anything the "higher powers" tell them .

       It's true. One kid gets shot in London and people set the country on fire. Not saying this is a total parallel, or that rioting in that case was for the right reasons, but it makes me feel slightly better living in the UK, that people are prepared to step out into the street when their patience and understanding reaches breaking point.

       It was often touted in the media as being the spark for the riots, but the real reason is far more involved than that. The fact that Duggan (a known gangster) was black led to a rise in accusations of police racism and discontent felt amongst certain parts of the black community in London. The vast majority of rioters weren't protesting his death though - the causes were largely socio-economic, such as poverty, dissatisfaction with the government, lack of education, societal problems, gang culture, and simply bored kids with a sense of criminal opportunism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I suppose Duggan's shooting was
       <em>
        a
       </em>
       contributory spark to the whole series of events, but it was by no means the sole reason.

       Yeah, i knew why it escalated to the levels it did. Like you say, the Duggan thing was just a spark to something that had undoubtedly been brewing for a long time.

       Maybe people have become so isolated from one another that our empathy is now almost extinct.  The idea that, "That could be me or my loved one" no longer applies because we all feel so distant from each other.  We are trained to be xenophobic by our news.

       First, I read this thinking, "Hey, those are interesting coincidences." And I even checked out nlp on wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then I remembered that the Bin Ladens are not a fictional family. Even if you think 9/11 was an inside job and OBL is the boogeyman scapegoat the government has presented to us, the family name is real. I think it really is just a coincidence.

       When speaking with friends/family about this I found it so interesting that they were able to accept this man being killed - while holding some cognitive dissonance and stating "but just this once drones are bad."  There is no "just this once".  This is setting a dangerous precedent.

       I personally think the media's over reaction is only to make money. In french we have a motto for mainstream medias: SSS, which means Sex, Sang (blood), Sports. This combinaison is the best one to entertain people, sadly.
This is all what matters in our society, please don't take every massively mediatised event as a conspiracy

       I am not american but.
America is a massive country with a lot of serial killers and Crime in general , there are people going to jail for double and triple murders everyday and some aren't caught. But as soon as something goes to mainstream media or looks bad on the government straight away there is all out manhunt and confusion. so cases like these just lead me to believe that all this is nothing more than propaganda  and as someone already said it is just an excuse to test and maybe get the general public comfortable with something  like those drones in this case. Who knows maybe soon USA will have a courfiew and Giant killer robots patrolling every area and Americans will blindly believe that is OK because they will slowly be programmed to think that way.
I think Americans should wake up and smell the bullshit and do something about it.

       They use drones all the time along the border and in washington state (to track cattle rustlers) and have for the last 5 or 6 years. No Law Enforcement agency arms their drones, it's really no different than flying helicopters, it's the same scenario, aerial survalience.

       I try not to be overly conspiratorial. I don't believe most conspiracies but I do love a good story and reading anything that's a good thought exercise.
       <strong>
        However
       </strong>
       some parts of this just seem too coincidental for coincidence. It's like if you were going to write the script for a movie starring the ultimate bad guy in order to convince people that assassinating citizens on American soil via drones is now OK.

       You have a guy who used to be a cop, but was fired and supposedly disgraced. People kind of don't like that. But wait, there's a twist.  He's turned against the heroic police who keep us all safe and plans to become a cop-killer. So not only is he a cop-killer, but he's a traitor to the boys in blue as well. People really don't like that. But wait, that's not all! There's more! He didn't just kill cops, he did the only thing that could possibly be worse. He killed their innocent families who weren't cops just because they were related to police. Now how much do you hate him? It's like the backstory was tailor-made to create the only villain people could possible hate more than pedophiles.

       I'm sure events like "Wag the Dog" happen all the time as a matter of course and policy. I'm aware of exactly 0 evidence that this is the case with Dorner. But if it were a designed op I'm fairly confident it would look exactly as it does now.

       If you follow 4chan, you'll have noticed that many tragedies have been clearly mentioned before they happened on the boards (they're not fake, I saw them first-hand, and it has happened multiple times)

       Not saying I definitely believe it but there's a possibility
