       Ok I know I'm not the only one who will think of this but, there is NO way that anyone with half a brain cannot hear this news and not think that there isnt something fishy here. The pope doesn't just resign ( at least not in the last 609 year's) without there being a reason. This is not a man that is showing any signs of ill health at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       What could the real reason be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what does this mean for the predictions of St. Malachi? If you believe this series of predictions, Benedict is the LAST pope before the FINAL pope. The one that will help usher in the end of time for the church.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?

       Are you reffering to the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Popes">
        Prophecy of the Popes
       </a>
       written by Saint Malachy which states that the next pope will oversee the church during Armageddon and that he will have the title 'Peter the Roman"? Personally I find it creepy that that Ratzinger's current
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarcisio_Bertone">
        right hand man
       </a>
       fits the bill exactly for both the 'Peter' and 'Roman' part of the name. Tarcisio Bertone's full name is Tarcisio
       <strong>
        Pietro
       </strong>
       Evasio Bertone.  Bertone was born in
       <strong>
        Romano

       Canavese, Piedmont.  Interesting to say the least.

       I've worked in a hostel for some months in a very active suburban city.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a guy who was telling me about how the Royal Family and Church would do a reenactment of the Bible, with full-on Jesus coming back and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remembered this when it was announced that Prince William and Kate are going to have a baby. I love to speculate and I would be so amused if they announced this is the baby jesus or the anti christ or whatever bullshit they invent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine the entertainment??

       Seems William fits the role of the Anti-Christ. He will be 33 soon, The age Jesus started his ministries or whatever, he is the son of Diana and Heir to the throne of David, etc...

       I've been waiting to see if Ratzinger would either die or stand down because as well as the prophecy of the popes I've read that the second to last pope was only meant to be in power for a short time which has now come to pass.

       Whats even more interesting is the Vatican's involvement in the suppression of final part of the Fatima prophecies.  Specifically Ratzinger and Bertone were involved.  This whole story gets really interesting when you take into account the final part of the Fatima prophecy foretells that Ratzinger would be assassinated and then succeeded by the 'last' pope.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Cardinal Bertone even wrote a
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Fatima-Cardinal-Tarcisio-Bertone/dp/B00378L4T8">
        book
       </a>
       on it!  Of course Bertone's book hides the true ending to these series of strange upcoming events.

       Also consider that he may have been politically assassinated by the molestation scandals. He did not have to in fact be physically assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we see at least some sentiments out there that he is stepping down due to the child molestation issues. It could very well be that there is a far bigger and deeper body of evidence against the church, and him specifically, covering this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This evidence could be used against him to get him to resign.

       But what is the difference, him resigning, if we can safely say the whole catholic church and their comrades are involved in these scandals? How would changing popes alleviate that?
      </p>
      <p>
       All popes always tell how that should be persecuted, how the catholic church condemns it etc. and none seem to take any action.

        <strong>
         In October 2011 Cardinal Turkson called for the establishment of a “global public authority” and a “central world bank” to rule over financial institutions that have become outdated and often ineffective in dealing fairly with crises.
        </strong>
        The document, Towards Reforming the International Financial and Monetary Systems in the Context of a Global Public Authority was very specific, calling for taxation measures on financial transactions. It notes that “The economic and financial crisis which the world is going through calls everyone, individuals and peoples, to examine in depth the principles and the cultural and moral values at the basis of social coexistence,” it said. The document condemned what it called “the idolatry of the market” as well as a “neo-liberal thinking” that it said looked exclusively at technical solutions to economic problems. “In fact, the crisis has revealed behaviours like selfishness, collective greed and hoarding of goods on a great scale,” it said, adding that world economics needed an “ethic of solidarity” among rich and poor nations.[11][12]
An accomplished polyglot, Turkson is able to speak English, Fante, French, Italian, German, and Hebrew, in addition to understanding Latin and Greek.

       From what I've gathered this document was a condemnation of the current banking structure. If the Vatican Bank didn't have the history of shady dealings, I'd be more open to allowing a traditionalist, Catholic &amp; moral reformation of the banking system on a global level.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this dude is going to have to win the hearts and minds of a lot of skeptics. Especially if he straight up tells Bankers and Americans they are Selfish, collective greed filled, hoarders who worship the false "idol of the Market."
      </p>
      <p>
       Those words give me some hope, but I know how fleeting words can be from our human leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, if I was convinced that a Catholic banking system based on morality could replace or compete with a Rothchild Banking system based on material, I'd be willing to try it. At least the Catholic majority is accountable to someone who threw bankers out of the temple. That said, WWJD?

       He is basically spouting UN propaganda in a roundabout way.  "selfishness, collective greed and hoarding of goods" can be applied to the middle class of America, very easily.  This guy is pushing collectivism and forced poverty worldwide in the name of "social equity". I just read an article where this guy is interviewed about the UN's Millennium Development Goals, he is advocating changing the definition of "poverty" from monetary deficiency to lack of societal structures.  Meaning you can drain the money out of people as long as there are schools, hospitals and police they are not impoverished.  Think about the ramifications of that.  The Agenda 21 plan includes taking money from the "rich nations" and building up the societal structures in all of the developing countries, taxing the "first world" based on your "carbon footprint" and giving that money not to the people, but to the governments to build "sustainable cities".  This is central planning on a worldwide scale, communism worldwide.

       I already see this from your perspective. I'm trying to see it from his. He is defining poverty as have vs have not in NON-MATERIAL terms. The example he uses is the Congo being poverty because they don't have internet. I fail to see in that article where it states anything about wealth distribution. I have yet to see this man define wealth as a monetary asset, and nor should he if he is true to the faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was in his position, a major world player from an impoverished nation, I would be playing the hand I had been dealt. The UN can be a platform, though it's not very valued in my opinion, a den of vipers and thieves perhaps. But the Cardinal doesn't hide the fact that money, in its current form has created the unrest or crisis in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was curious if you think it's a negative thing to change the definition of poverty from monetary deficiency to lack of social structures. I am in total agreement with the Cardinal that the Human is a Social being. I do not agree with the Utopian Socialist philosophy. Therefore the negotiation of the two would be what? The sheep can't govern themselves, and the 'wealthy' shouldn't be shepherds because they have green paper in their wallets.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mention "drain the money," but what IS money? It doesn't exist except for the fact we accept it. IF the same can be said for God and god is accepted universal Love, than Money is accepted universal Evil. An Anti-Christ, is it not?

       The lack of funds creates the poverty, not the lack of social structures.  Think Soviet Russia, there were the social structures, yet no one could accumulate wealth(outside of the inner party) and people were impoverished and unhappy because they basically had what they were given and that's it.  No chance for improved standard of living, which is the point of capitalism.  You create your own life.  You get out what you put in.  If you don't put in much and work for someone making minimum wage your whole life, you deserve what you get, if you work hard and maybe even start your own business you make more and have a better standard of living on your own.  If your parents worked hard and they accumulated wealth and they pass it on to you, you can work up(or down) from there.  Money is units of work.  If you don't have a reward for your work, there is no incentive to work.  If you want to have a productive society there needs to be a way to delineate work from a trade and barter system to a system with money where the trading happens with units of work.  If that makes sense.  Money is only accepted as an evil because people get greedy.  You can make money and be rich but not evil, there are a lot of people like that.  My grandfather is a millionaire, owns a lot of property, yet he has supported entire poor families and put them up in the homes he owns, FOR FREE, and paid their bills.  Does then having money make him evil?  It's all in how it's used.  Dick Cheny, is evil, he used evil to make money and uses his money for evil things, he should have his money confiscated and given to the third world countries he has helped destroy.  But not MY money, I shouldn't have to be taxed because someone on the other side of the planet, that I have zero influence on, isn't doing as well as me.  That is ridiculous.

       I agree with everything you said. But let's again look at this from the other side. What if you were the poor soul born on the other side of the world that is not doing as good as you? That doesn't have a millionaire grandfather. For argument sake, this person has the same IQ as you now, the same drive and common sense. Yet this person has less. While things are not meant to be fair, if there was a way to help someone on the other side of the planet would you, not your grandpa, not a tax, would you be willing to begin an influence and help that person?
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't fool yourself, work doesn't equal money in Capitalism. I'm a former Small Business Owner and know quite a bit about the ways one makes money in this system. It has all to do with relationships. I'm sorry but work has little to do with prosperity. You can labor in the fields for 16 hours a day, every day for 365 days and make less money than I do sitting at a desk for 1/3rd that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are we to determine whose units of work hold more value? In a perfect capitalist system the market would decide this. We wouldn't have to decide. But because of the 'miracle' and perceived value of compound interest and commission and fee based liquid trading there is no scale. The latter two things that DO NOT fall under a unit of "work"

       What I would do to help someone on the other side of the planet is buy their product.  If they have the drive, they can figure it out.  I am an advocate of trading between all nations, international commerce, the internet age can easily facilitate this.  A beaded necklace from Africa made in a small village somewhere, a coat made in Iran, a pair of sandals made in Central America, all of those things I would gladly buy.

       Work doesn't equal money, I never said that.  A dollar is a unit of work, meaning that you can trade units of work for other items instead of having to barter and trade several items to get what you wanted initially.  As a small business owner you know this:  In order to start that small business you needed something called "capital".  That capital was either borrowed, or saved up from earning units of work, either way, work was needed to acquire that capital.  The bank can loan that money because other people who acquired units of work, are loaning the bank money at a price, which then the bank loans out at a price to churn a profit/pay the employees for their work.  Any product that is sold was created using some sort of labor, shipped using labor, manufactured using labor, all the way down to raw material mining using labor, all payed for by using a unit of trade for work, namely money.  You can labor in the fields for low pay if that is what is available, if you don't like it get some people together and state that your effort is worth more.  You can sit in a desk and make more money because you PUT MORE units of work in the form of money into your business, something that guy in the field
       <em>
        could do
       </em>
       if he budgets and saves up, maybe buys his own field and hires other people to do the work.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Who are we to determine whose units of work hold more value?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The value of work is not based on the physical aspect, but on the value of what you are doing, if your job is only worth $10 an hour to an employer in the scope of the job required, then you have the choice to not take that job.  If you are offered a job at less than you feel your time is worth you can offer to work for more, if you are denied then the job wasn't worth your time, or you can settle for less than you feel you are worth.  Most people tend to do that instead of finding a job that they feel is worth their time.  This isn't a complicated concept but it takes a bit to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stock brokers and the like are trading units of work and they are making what people are willing to pay them to do that work.  Everyone is making what someone is willing to pay them to do the certain job they are hired for.  If you are making less than you desire, save up, invest, start your own business etc.

       Than you agree that the Internet is a service and should be installed in poverty filled remote areas of the Congo, just like Cardinal Peter suggested?
      </p>
      <p>
       It may seem like the internet is simply a $20 a month fee to us here in America, but if you don't have a cable, in the ground or on the wire, that was placed in your village by a government, or corporate entity, than there is no place to "invest" your $20.

       Your model of finance hasn't changed, I agreed in my last post that indeed, this is how the perfect system of capitalism would appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perfect system cannot be ran by imperfect humans. It's not possible. Anyone who shows me a perfect capitalist plan is just as delusional as the man who shows me a socialist Utopia.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as it buggs myself to hear it from my own mouth, only a system that is accountable to something "higher" than a human being, can be operated with perfection. I also believe that if there was a higher power than humans, that power would not be interested in capital gains, paper money, monetary value of physical labor, and projects done with profitable margins for the sake of profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we all have dreams, even the least of our people, a guy who thinks a lot like you, with no internet, trying to sell your grandfather a necklace he made, with parts he had to steal from a tree that grew on property he will never own.

      <p>
       When your material world fails to satisfy, remember him. Because on that day, it will be his simple life you wish you could have saved up and invested in, not the other way around.

       Not exactly.  Those people living out there in the jungle have been living like that for centuries upon centuries, why force our culture onto them?  These people are literally forcing western culture on indigenous tribes.  I am saying you build up the "developing nations" through trade, it can happen over the internet in bigger cities, maybe through a middleman that has a local market set up.
      </p>
      <p>
       You contradict yourself here:  you say that money isn't anything, yet these people are striving to MAKE money.  For what?  If it isn't anything, they should be able to live off the land, like they have been doing, for thousands of years.  Once again you're ascribing western ideals onto unrelated peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of Agenda 21 is to "empower women" chapter 24 I believe.  That whole scheme is ridiculous, they are taking the women out of these remote villages and throwing them in cities to get "educated" while the men remain in the little towns to die alone, the women are getting slowly migrated into the cities and metropolitan regions.  This is part of the plan, however, to move people off of the land and into cities.  All in the name of "empowerment" while their cultures get uprooted and trampled on.  Is that anyone's right?  Who has the right to destroy a culture in the name of "progress"?

       That doesn't make sense as austerity measures are put in place in order to further cut taxes on the wealthy and elite corporations. It's not so the middle class can be selfish.

       I wouldn't call it communism and I wouldn't call it social equity. The plans of what you are talking about are already in place in many places in Africa and they are mainly resource grab and land grabbing. it has done nothing for the environment and the poor in Afrca. You Will notice that sustainability does not apply to big corporations, it applies to small farmers and land owners...like saying livestock and farming are "unsustainable".

       The problem is that the danger comes covered in a nice package.

       It's the same thing they've been selling to us all these years: freedom, free-market, democracy etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to guarantee our "freedom" so they spy on us to prevent us from "terrorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       They want us to be in a "democracy" to give us apparent power of choice when in the end they have puppets in both(or more) parties.

       I'd say never trust a hierarchical institution. Specially one that for centuries have proved that they will do anything do further their own agenda and interests.

       A: had a code of ethics that they have been "trying" to follow for 2000 years, and can be, at any time, held accountable to the teachings of Jesus, who was a wonderful Philosopher, and to many much more than that.

       So you admit that you only have a half brain?  I can totally see that.  Fully formed fully functional brains are a big help in understanding complex political and social agendas that may traverse several areas of civilization.  I know you're stuck on some things, but maybe one of the nurses in your group home can help you with some research.

       See your problem is you're not thinking it through very well. Why would big multinational corporations and a private, unelected, unaccountable organization like the UN want to undo the mess that their owners caused?  Oh wait, you still think the UN is a legit governing organization and was somehow legally voted into existence by the citizens right?  See you must be right brained because that's a big stretch of the imagination.

       do you understand that this is a non-binding voluntary PLAN OF ACTION its just an outline of how to utilize resources more effectively and space more effectively.. you somehow turn it into a plan to control all of our lives..

      <p>
       edit: and they want to undo the mess that their owners caused because its going to cost them big time in the future at best they care about their wallets .. they don't give a shit about controlling you because they already do

       Guess what... the US.... volunteered, and is implementing the PLAN OF ACTION.  That is what we have been trying to tell you.  non-binding just means that you won't be penalized for not going along, but get this, THEY'RE DOING IT.  It's blatantly obvious to anyone actually looking and not worrying about whether its "binding" or not, which is pointless.  But you're so stuck on the whole "non-binding", what does it matter if it's "non-binding" if they're going through with it?  They don't spend billions of dollars getting a plan made and then just not do it you fuckin dupe!

       Given the recent total exposure of the catholic church as having intentionally covered up thousands of cases child abuse the world over, Id say the "extreme persecution" bit fits at least. As for the destruction of the "city of 7 hills" here is a list of what it could refer to:

       It's quite within the realm of possibility that there existed a sentient species of animal during the hundreds of millions of years that dinosaurs existed, to be destroyed by a meteor. That we are the first of civilized species to ever emerge in the unimaginably long history of life on this planet is an assumption.

       Still, this probably won't be the last pope and SURELY has nothing to do with the end of the world or even the end of Rome for that matter.

      <p>
       If you want fuel for more apocalyptic scare... Go ahead and think about the 44 meter asteroid that'll pass closer than the orbit of our own satelites this Friday. Or the one, much bigger, that'll pass so close in December that it "should" be as bright as the moon in the northern hemisphere sky. Both are guaranteed misses but i'm sure someone will find some weird prophecy / religious reason to claim it'll be turned slightly and hit us.

       You have to remember who put together the bible in the first place, The catholic church and there commitee.  If they had a prophecy which dictated the end of there organization or rome or the world even do you think they would let that information out willingly or try to discredit any mention of it so that know one is the wiser when those things come to pass.You have to play the devil's advocate when dealing with such things.  To blindly look at it through your own perspective or even someone elses without looking at the big picture or from all angles is never going to get to the truth whatever the truth may be.

       These apocalyptic prophecies are great for the church because it gives them even more power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self-fulfilling or not, it "shows" for believers how the Church is right and the Bible is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides that when in fear believers will certainly follow their figure of power advices, that case being the Pope/Vatican/Church.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the "antichrist" were to come and they said that he is "demonizing" or some bs like that, you would see people turning against each other, thus accomplishing a major step of their agenda which is depopulating the Earth.

       Interesting to note that when referring to John II the prophecies are right. He was born on a solar eclipse and his Mass of Requiem happened on a solar eclipse also.

       If you check out the wikipedia page for
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Popes#Petrus_Romanus">
        The Prophecy of the Popes
       </a>
       , it's very possible that the section with the "Petrus Romanus" being the last pope was
       <em>
        added
       </em>
       hundreds of years after the original prediction (the original manuscript may have been forged as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, this whole "prophecy" is still something that has been in the cards for a long time...it's part of the directed history that's been at work for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems a lot of popes were chosen--or chose names--that would "fit" with the prophecy to make themselves seem more legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something tells me this Peter Turkson guy
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       be chosen--it fits too well with this whole directed history thing. A black US president and a black pope to usher in the end of an age?
      </p>

       You can't make this shit up.

       Malachi never said the NAME of the Pope, just a Symbolic Representation of hi.

       Pope JP II had Parkinson's and served as pope until his last day.  From Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Despite difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, trouble hearing and severe osteoarthrosis, he (JP II) continued to tour the world, although rarely walking in public.

       I know nothing about Catholicism, Vatican law or the associated religious texts, just pointing out that Benedict is the first pope to step down for ANY reason, ill health or no.

       Apparently the last section of the prophecy that includes the bit about Peter the Roman
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Popes#Petrus_Romanus">
        may have been added hundreds of years after the original prophecy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bit hard to fathom, but I think this has been planned for centuries...it's all part of the directed history we've been living in.

       Since Ratzinger was elected as pope there has been a massive movement away from Christianity in the Western world, especially by young people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only chance the church has is if there is a liberal reawakening. For instance, during the Great Depression priests would be in the picket lines leading sermons during strikes. Nowadays, the church resembles Satanism in that it is a cult of self where you pray for personal wealth.

       You're right. I got excited and should have expressed myself differently. I had generalized 'liberal awakening' with a substantial change of any variety. For instance, accepting at least some proven science in to their beliefs.

       Yes I saw the article (and re read it just now incase i was wrong) but, as i said..if I needed to set up an easy escape for someone (who happens to be one of the oldest popes in 300 years) That would be a good excuse..it just seems to me that with all the investigations, that this is all a little too convenient.

       I am claiming that its awfully suspicious that his health has gone from good to bad in the matter of 1 year. And Yes i know hes 85, and at that age its not that unusual for health to decline rapidly...but to me..this all seems just a bit suspicious that ALL of a sudden he decides to quit..its like somone planning a big trip then committing suicide before taking it.

       I know that it was from 2011, he took office in 2005. according to the article his health has been in decline for a few year. And yes I do find it hard that the POPE wishes to retire...once you are the Vicar of Christ you dont just decide that....Eh...Ive had enough and wanna go fishing now.

       A: I didn't post anything fot karma 
B: I didn't suggest that he was doing anything illegal. I nearly questioned the timing and reasoning.
C: He is not some 85 year old stock broker or lawyer, he's the proverbial head of the largest organization of religious belief on the planet. A man who is by virtue of his position " infallible" ( that means incapable of error when in matters of faith or morality since your probably to stupid to know what that word mean). He is the one person on earth who for ( more than a billion) Catholics, directly speaks for God. I find it suspicious that he is the 1st person in 700 years to hold this title, that has decided to just hang it up and "retire".

       This church in the last 15 years has seen 3 major coverups publicly blow up in their face, lost a great number of followers because of their willfulness to turn a blind eye toward organized child molestation, serious financial crimes and many other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ratzinger ( before becoming Benedict) was known as the " Bulldog of the Vatican" for his strict views on church doctrine. Why then would a man with such dedication and passion for his faith, church and beliefs all of a sudden announce that in less than 3 weeks he's retiring unless there is other reasons for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be that he's being forced out? 
Is he trying to save the church over all from another huge scandal that he may have personal involvment and/or knowledge of? 
Could he know something major is going to happen that the rest of us do not know about yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the answer, but if me asking a question that I wish to explore or learn about makes me a bad person?...well I suppose I can live with that.

       There is nothing that says a pope can't retire. He is 85 fucking years old.  If anything we (not r/conspiracy "we" just "we" in general) should be saying look at the balls on this guy for being the first pope in 600+ years to retire.

        Also what does this mean for the predictions of St. Malachi? If you believe this series of predictions, Benedict is the LAST pope before the FINAL pope. The one that will help usher in the end of time for the church. Thoughts?

       St. Malachy is self-fulfilling prophecy. If they don't want a pope named Peter, then they should pick Pope Steve or whatever. It's not a complex issue.

       And who is to say they don't choose their names based on it? I mean, it's a document that has been around for a very, very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be very easy to look at that list and say, "Oh, okay, they prophesied that the next pope's name have an olive involved somewhere.... Benedictine Order has an olive branch in their crest, I SHALL BE BENEDICT."
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if they know the next guy named "Peter" is going to be a bad thing, why not elect a pope 1.) not named peter, and 2) tell him not to call himself peter? Crisis averted.

       He was charged with CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, February 14, 2011 at the International Criminal Court, Den Haag. Kevin Anett charged him, the Queen and PM Harper for their involvement in the residential schools, 50,000 murdered native children.

       This post is ridiculous. There is no factual basis for a "conspiracy". Do you think the
       <em>
        pope
       </em>
       would resign because of child molestation? I mean please, we have seen hundreds to thousands of cases and barely a handful of
       <em>
        bishops
       </em>
       took responsibility and resigned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, there is no basis to argue that this man is "in perfect health" (as OP suggested), for all we know he could have been diagnosed with a terminal or even mental disease (in an early stadium). And in the end, give him some privacy. Come on, he looks healthy to you, therefore there must be something fishy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, there's the example of the last pope who was virtually unable to reign due to his condition. It's not like we can't learn from history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth, is it really that unbelievable that the pope actually did that
       <em>
        for the catholic church
       </em>
       ?
      </p>

       But well, I guess this subreddit will soon find undeniable proof. I heard his father was going to testify in the LIBOR scandal.

       Those men are not the Pope. To say that a bishop was touching little boys is nowhere near the same as saying that the Pope is proven to touch little boys.

       You know this is the Church we're talking about right? Learning from history is not one of their strong points. Also, it's expected that the Pope remain in office until death. So, being terminally ill is no reason to step down unless (like you say) it would effect his abilities. And if that was the case, you'd know about it.

       You seriously think that the Vatican could not keep the pope's health problems private? The vatican has an own infirmary (though to large hospital) and he probably has a personal doctor. Also, nobody said that he was in the hospital. He simply stated that is health condition is making him too weak for his, extremely stressful, position. And I already made the point that he could have been diagnosed with a difficult disease, maybe in an early phase. All these things can happen without causing major stirs in the media.

      <p>
       The church may may be far from being a progressive organization, but do you really think that none of its members change their views over time? Benedict XVI. was also pretty close to the former pope, so he would have first hand experience of his later years.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        it's expected that the Pope remain in office until death. So, being terminally ill is no reason to step down unless (like you say) it would effect his abilities. And if that was the case, you'd know about it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, it's not. The Catholic church's canon law . The fact that it's unusual doesn't mean that there is something "fishy" about it. After all, it's probably a sign for improvement. Having a pope as old as the hills with weak physical and mental health has occured in the past. That doesn't mean it has to stay this way forever. Again, "even" the church evolves over time.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What? Resign because something he did would make the church as a whole look bad? No, that's not unbelievable at all.

      <p>
       No, I meant that it is entirely possible that he honestly resigns because he feels he can not execute his office properly anymore. Some people
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       feel responsibility. It's not like everybody in a position of power is a psychopathic maniac, like this subreddit always suggests. Especially considering the fact that a person like the pope has dedicated his whole life to the church. Totally unrealistic that he would have a serious emotional investment in it, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Being sceptic about things is great, but jumping to conclusions like everybody here does without anything substantial is mad. As of right now, there is basically no factual evidence for anything fishy or conspirational about this. Yet, as always, this place goes mad with conclusions within hours.

       What? I wasn't accusing the pope of touching little boys. I was giving a comparison. The ACTUAL accusation is that he is involved in covering for others that DO abuse children. And luckily for you and everyone in the church there will never be a trail of evidence. Aside from witnesses. But, you'll all just pass them off as crazy or opportunistic. The pope is a better man and therefore everyone else is lying. Right?

       No, I think the Vatican can keep a great many things secret. He's old and has the frailty that comes with age. But, he's not ill. At least there's no 'factual evidence' that says he's sick. There IS however accusations from a couple different angles against this guy. The child abuse and financial corruption (that has evidence) But, it's everyone else that's lying and taking advantage right? This guy is the Pope after all. He can do no evil.

       It absolutely is EXPECTED that the Pope holds his office until death. It's is NOT required as stated by Cannon 332. With that said 4 popes in history have resigned and the last one was over 600 years ago. To say it's unusual is putting it mildly. And considering the circumstances that have unfolded during this guys reign how is it so inconceivable to you that just MAYBE this guy is stepping out for other reasons?

Show us video footage, medical documents and a stool sample or I believe it's a false flag. Oh wait, how do we know the video footage and the written documents weren't faked? Also, please sit down and shit in front of us so we know this is

       Implying that he's resigning due to accusations made against him is not a wild guess. Implying that there's no grounds for that sort of thought. He's being accused of incredible crimes. It's absolutely plausible that there's something else going on.

       I think you may be lost. This is a subreddit for conspiracy theories. It's what goes on in this subreddit. They take the news and try to think of the underlying reasons and or consequences for said news. Right or wrong... that's what a theory is. And it's ok to be wrong. Being proven wrong brings you closer to the truth. Even if it's not what you want it to be.

       That's not exactly true. You're speaking generally. You need to realize that if you keep seeing things pop up over and over... that there are more than just a couple people here. And rarely do people search for and thoroughly read older posts related to what they're creating new topics for. And if you're referring to people that just won't listen... why are you arguing with them? There's people like that on both sides.

       He's tired and worn out. That's to be expected from a man of his age. He's also about to be the first pope in history to step down because he's tired and has aching bones. We don't expect a physically active pope going around and saving the masses. He's supposed to be a wealth of knowledge and wisdom. He can do this from the comfort of his moving platform. And considering that he's still well written and well spoken it's likely he still qualifies for the job.

       In the case of the pope resigning, how exactly do you provide evidence of a mans intentions? And I'll reiterate... if there was evidence it wouldn't be a conspiracy theory or in this subreddit.

       Claiming a man, that has been accused of aiding child molesters (with witnesses) and has also been accused of incredible financial crimes (with physical evidence), is quitting his post early because of other than honorable intentions isn't exactly an extraordinary claim. Is it the truth? Who knows. This is a theory. When there's proof of it being true it's no longer a conspiracy theory. It's the truth.

       Your totally right and I have never said that he has has, but lets be realisitic here. For the past 200 years the Church has had an on going culture that covered up and hid these (and many other) crimes. Is it too far out in left field to think that he may have had personal knowledge and chose to cover something even worse up?

       You are totally correct on that. However I will point out that 90% of those in office stay there out of a sense of duty and even when JPII was damn near incapacitated he still was able to do the work of the church..

       And you think they may not have learned something from this? Benedict was pretty close to JPII., so he has some first hand experience with this kind of stuff.

       The guy is 85 years old. It's not unusual at all to have serious health problems with that. Plus the guy has an extremely stressful job. Health problems at this age would be a serious thing for everybody as old as gim, let alone somebody in this position.

       I simply don't understand how the idea that somebody would actually make a reasonable decision like this is apparently so unbelievable that there has to be something more going on.

       I don't really see anything as of yet.  When this Pope took over he was understood to be a "transition" pope (whatever that meant) and I think I even recall discussion in the media that this guy probably would not be around as long as past Popes because of the reasons for choosing him in the first place (to be a transitional pope).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still unsure as to what the catholic church was hoping to transition toward...and I'd still be shocked if they picked a non-European.

       I believe that if a prophecy can exist that long ago...it can also be used as a guideline for more fear mongering on that level. Think about it. These plans for this type of world have been going on for more than a thousand years....so the possibility of it being used as a tool are just as good as any other reason. Just my two cents.

       The great star likely refers to sirius, the Dog Star part of the constellation canis  major (big dog). I'm thinking Nostradamus was foretelling an event with that star and the pope resigning fits perfectly with the pontiff changing his territory. There is quite a bit of cultural and historical reference  to sirius being connected with Armageddon, enlightenment, and the return of the messiah be it in Egyptian history, Persian, Hindu and Almost every other civilization we study.

       I would guess his personal assistant has found something highly incriminating. There was a "trial" started recently in Vatican city because his assistant leaked a bunch of the pope's "personal documents".
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps there has been something uncovered during pre-trial sessions or during evidence sessions that would look bad for the church (I snicker as I say that, considering their history of child abuse).
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also guess this resignation is a legal/ technical means for him to exit and seal evidence without shaming the church publicly. Of course, very few of us will ever really know what has prompted this action.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: someone also mentioned the native genocide case in Canada involving the federal government of Canada and the queen. This news could be part of that larger issue too.

       I think you're spot on. Nothing could make him look more guilty than to quit being the Pope. Whatever he's accused of we can wager safely that he was indeed guilty of it. And what could be so damning to the church that he the POPE would be 'forced' out? Child abuse? Drugs? Advocating mass murder? Anything involving MONEY? What is the church up to THIS time?

       There is a trial involving Native genocide in Canada - 500K Native children have been disappeared! They have found little skeletons buried all over the grounds of residential schools from coast to coast.

      <p>
       FYI, the Canadian government, the Queen and the Pope are on the hook for this. It would not surprise me if this case at The Hague was at the centre of his "retirement".

       Some time back, the Catholic church revised their position on extra terrestrial life. They switched from a solid no, to a stand that God created the universe, so life may exist away from Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Curiosity is drilling away on Mars right now searching for the building blocks of life in an ancient riverbed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Curiosity found that proof, or even proof of life existing off world, the whole world would be gripped by science. Religious beliefs are in free fall around the world already, something like this would be a game changer.

       Honestly?  St. Malachi's "predictions"?  What makes you think the RCC are not playing along with these so called predictions in order to throw people off?  The Jesuits are behind everything, from 9/11 to almost every single war on the planet.  The Jesuits control EVERYTHING.

       With that rant over with, I find this very interesting.  I think that they are trying to fill the gap with a younger Pope so that he can push Sunday Laws or the mark of the Roman Catholic Church.

       Just in time for Obama's first ever visit to Israel in March. I cannot help but think these events are related. How would you usher in a New World Order without the Pope? Answer: Get your own Pope propped up. My two cents.

       On a...well, related note, according to ancient religions, including that of Alchemy, and the Zodiac, we are entering the second to last phase of the Universe - Aquarius, then Capricorn (it goes in reverse).

       The Alchemy and Zodiac inferences you're making are completely false.  We are - according to the zodiac (alchemy has no bearing on it) entering the age of Aquarius.  This process is on a cusp for 100s of years though.  Yes it goes backwards because its based on the suns progression.  But by both those system's Aries is considered the 'beginning' so that would make aquarius the 3rd age not the 12th. Additionally, there is no 'end' just like the mayan calendar because its a circle (just like a clock doesnt have an 'end').
      </p>

       Basically everything you said here is completely misconstrued.

       Do I have to prove you wrong now too? Alright, I'm going to go make some food, and when I come back I'll post all of my resources. And here's a piece of advice in life: just because you
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       something is wrong or misconstrued, doesn't mean they are. It could just mean that what you know of the subject are half-truths, distortions, or blatant falsehoods. I would almost put money on the fact that what you know of Alchemy and the "zodiac" are not remotely close to their ancient forms. Be back soon ; )

       Are you reffering to the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Popes">
        Prophecy of the Popes
       </a>
       written by Saint Malachy which states that the next pope will oversee the church during Armageddon and that he will have the title 'Peter the Roman"? Personally I find it creepy that that Ratzinger's current
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarcisio_Bertone">
        right hand man
       </a>
       fits the bill exactly for both the 'Peter' and 'Roman' part of the name. Tarcisio Bertone's full name is Tarcisio
       <strong>
        Pietro
       </strong>
       Evasio Bertone.  Bertone was born in
       <strong>
        Romano
       </strong>
       Canavese, Piedmont.  Interesting to say the least.

       Whats even more interesting is the Vatican's involvement in the suppression of final part of the Fatima prophecies.  Specifically Ratzinger and Bertone were involved.  This whole story gets really interesting when you take into account the final part of the Fatima prophecy foretells that Ratzinger would be assassinated and then succeeded by the 'last' pope.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Cardinal Bertone even wrote a
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Fatima-Cardinal-Tarcisio-Bertone/dp/B00378L4T8">
        book

       on it!  Of course Bertone's book hides the true ending to these series of strange upcoming events.

       It's quite within the realm of possibility that there existed a sentient species of animal during the hundreds of millions of years that dinosaurs existed, to be destroyed by a meteor. That we are the first of civilized species to ever emerge in the unimaginably long history of life on this planet is an assumption.
