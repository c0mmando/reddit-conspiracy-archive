    <div class="md"><p>The difference between children and adults is that children have a better ability to stave off the physical effects of &#39;shock&#39;. Shock could be described as a person&#39;s ability to shunt blood, clot, ect. in their body system in an attempt to return to homeostasis (a chemical and biological/structural internal balance). So over a period of time after injury, children may appear to be doing just fine and then &#39;drop&#39; rapidly, while an adult could start showing signs of shock right way, e.g., low blood pressure, rapid heart rate. Adult bodies can&#39;t compensate for the loss of blood as well as children can, in some cases. As far as dealing with penetrating trauma, such as those inflicted by a bullets, both adults and children alike will experience the same mortality rate depending on where the trauma was received. Essentially, a person&#39;s age does effect their ability to physiologically compensate for the trauma received, but a gun shot to a vital organ is a gun shot to a vital organ, without regard for age (developmental time line). I speak from years of experience as a flight medic for the US army and a paramedic in the civilian field, just so you don&#39;t think I&#39;m blowing smoke, I have researched this subject. As far as studies go, medicine is well versed in how forces and energy can effect the human body. Crack a medical book for more info, or wiki it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But the energy transfer by a bullet, especially a rifle cartridge, and subsequent temporary cavity/hydrostatic damage would be devastating if the organ is the size of the cavity created itself - as opposed to an adult where the energy transfer has much more resistance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOYPxiRldaE">For instance, here is a video</a> from the great group on you tube, Brass Fetcher, of a 5.56 cartridge - that temporary cavity would be devastating to a smaller body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess my point was that if a child and an adult were both shot in their liver, then they would both have a bullet hole through their liver and most likely bleed out unless treated. I can agree with you about cavitation being more devastating when using high velocity rounds. I can see your point about a pressure wave when expanding inside an adults body cavity it would displace or effect a lot less tissue than when compared to a child&#39;s body cavity. But would a child die faster from such a wound than an adult would with the same wound? It&#39;s really hard to know for sure without specific examples to compare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an expert but logic dictates that children are going to be more likely to be killed than adults. Especially when they&#39;re stuck in a classroom with a killer.</p>

<p>And the data is fairly meaningless really: for example, the Aurora shooting happened in a dark cinema, compared to the Newtown shooting in a school classroom in daylight. Which would you expect to have a greater proportion killed than wounded?</p>

<p>I believe everything that I&#39;m told by the media on this one.  </p>

<p>I doubt there would have been many wounded, because we were shown that there definitely weren&#39;t many wounded.  How more obvious can it be made?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a layman here with an engineering mindset.  If there any scientific studies done with bullets and people, it was probably done with cadavers and not live children, unless the Nazis were interested in that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Possibly the relative mass and heart-rate compared to an adult might lead to a faster bleed-out?  Also, a child is a small target to begin with, so if one was hit at all, their small limbs give higher odds that the bullet would happen to land on their center of mass, being their head or body.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In response to your first paragraph. Medicine is constantly evolving and growing as we learn more. Unfortunately people are being shot daily so there is no shortage of what we can collectively learn in regards to what is the best method of treatment and what are the best rehabilitation methods. Medical enthusiasts have plenty of cases to review (new ones generated daily) and we have a very vivid picture on what works best and what isn&#39;t as effective. I hope this gives you a better idea on how the field of medicine grows just like any other science. EDIT: is not are</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb and guess that little kids are way different than adults. Yeah, adults are larger targets, but they are old enough to 1) realize that death is permanent, 2) if they don&#39;t move they are going to fucking die, and 3) be smart about how they get away. 5 year olds are going to first off freeze in fright. Some will eventually move, others won&#39;t. Those who move aren&#39;t going to do anything rreally smart. Maybe they hide under a desk. Maybe they go into a corner or run back against the wall instead of to the exit. 5 year olds won&#39;t flee unless told to do so. Most importantly, the bullet is going to do more damage to their smaller bodies so if they are shot anywhere in the torso or head, they are done. In this case, even a shot to the leg would have been lethal because the child would have bled out before help arrived. It doesn&#39;t take long for a five year old to bleed out. I think that picking on the kill ratio is barking up the wrong tree.</p>

<p><a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/2012/12/24/the-sandy-hook-massacre-unanswered-questions-and-missing-information/">Why Were Medical Personnel Turned Away From the Crime Scene?</a></p>

<p>Oddly enough medical personnel are forced to set up their operation not at the school where the dead and injured lay, but rather at the fire station several hundred feet away. This flies in the face of standard medical operating procedure where personnel are situated as close to the scene as possible. There is no doubt that the school had ample room to accommodate such personnel. Yet medical responders who rushed to Sandy Hook Elementary upon receiving word of the tragedy were denied entry to the school and forced to set up primary and secondary triages off school grounds and wait for the injured to be brought to them.</p>

<p>Shortly after the shooting “as other ambulances from neighboring communities rolled up, sirens blaring, the first responders slowly realized that their training would be tragically underutilized on this horrible day. ‘You may not be able to save everybody, but you damn well try,’” 44 year old emergency medical technician James Wolff told NBC News. “’And when (we) didn’t have the opportunity to put our skills into action, it’s difficult.’”<a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/20/16026666-you-feel-helpless-first-responders-rushed-to-school-after-shooting-only-to-wait?lite">9</a></p>

<p>In light of this, who were the qualified medical practitioners pronounced the 20 children and 7 adults dead? Who decided that none could be revived? Carver and his staff are apparently the only medical personnel to have attended to the victims—yet this was in the postmortem conducted several hours later. <strong>Such slipshod handling of the crime scene leaves the State of Connecticut open to a potential array of hefty civil claims by families of the slain.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of different conspiracy theories around Sandy Hook. They all basically say that the government planned the shooting in order to gain support for gun control. Some believe the shooting never happened at all, others say the shooting happened but not the way the news reported it. I would say there are 3 possible pieces of evidence for a conspiracy.  </p>

<p>1) Allegedly hiring &quot;crisis actors&quot; to play the role of grieving parents on TV. The Robbie Parker clip is pretty disturbing, he appears to smiling and laughing seconds before getting into character for a tear-filled press release.</p>

<p>2) Conflicting news reports from the first few days (shooter&#39;s name, what guns he used, second suspect caught in the woods, etc.). Easily debunked by the fact that any major event has wrong information reported while it is happening. </p>

<p>3) Missing proof that the shooting actually happened, primarily photographs of the surviving children being evacuated. A lot of people on this sub want to see photographs that were either never taken, or not allowed to be released. Like pics of the dead kids, or pics of the kids waiting at the firehouse, which may have been under heavy guard who knows. I agree that more photographs would answer a lot of questions but who knows when the press got there and what they were allowed to see going on. </p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t buy into the conspiracy, but it is interesting to read about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the small-scale, the motive is to create public debate about gun control and gain support for banning assault rifles. On the large-scale, the motive is to systematically disarm citizens, starting with assault rifles, but eventually removing all firearms from society in order to facilitate a totalitarian takeover. Gradually remove guns from private citizens so we can&#39;t fight back when the government comes to round us all up into concentration camps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we&#39;re just talking about the cafe? Okay, 20 killed 12 wounded. Still unsure where your 96% comes from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>every one of the twenty dead in the Broad Arrow Cafe was killed with an accurate single shot to the head</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, let&#39;s look at that. I&#39;d like to see what source the authors have to back up that claim. I would have thought autopsy results would be fairly uncontroversial.</p>

<p>Yet here&#39;s what was stated in court at Bryant&#39;s sentencing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The single shot which killed Mr. Ng struck him in the <em>neck</em> and death was instantaneous...the muzzle of the firearm was close to him when fired because there was gun powder stippling around the entrance wound.</p>

<p>Miss Scott...was shot <em>in the back of the head</em>...he would have been <em>quite close to her</em> at the time of firing the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. Nightingale...was then shot, a single shot to the <em>neck area</em> causing fatal injuries</p>

<p>Bryant moved at close quarters to shoot Kevin Sharpe, Wally Bennett and Ray Sharpe...Mr. Bennet was shot in the <em>neck</em>...the Accused is at their bodies standing behind them pointing the gun and <em>touching them almost with the barrel of the weapon</em>...Mr. Kevin Sharpe was shot <em>twice</em>, once in the arm and once in the top of the head</p>

<p>placed the muzzle of the gun <em>near Mrs. Howard’s head</em> and shot her <em>a second time</em>.</p>

<p>Whilst Mrs Loughton and her daughter were <em>on the floor</em>, Bryant shot Mrs Loughton in the back and shot Sarah in the head.</p>

<p>He then shot Elizabeth Howard through the <em>right arm and chest</em>...She received a further gunshot wound through the <em>chest</em></p>

<p>Bryant fired <em>twice</em> at Mr. Winter, the first shot struck him as he was getting up, injuring his hand, neck and chest, and the second shot struck Mr. Winter in the head.</p>

<p>He shot Mr. Jary through the right side of the <em>neck</em> at <em>close range</em>. They had no where to go.</p>

<p>Mr. Nash was <em>covering his wife’s body</em> with his.  He was also shot in the head near the left ear.</p>

<p>most of [the shots] struck targets when fired at either <em>point blank or close range</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the points I am making are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Not all 20 dead were killed with a shot to the head</p></li>
<li><p>Not all 20 dead were killed with single shots</p></li>
<li><p>Bryant tried and failed to kill a number of people</p></li>
<li><p>Many of those who were shot in the head were shot without warning and/or at very close range with little or no opportunity to escape</p></li>
<li><p>Some were shot in the head whilst lying on the ground or shielding others</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t think what he did was an &quot;almost impossible achievement&quot;. But I&#39;d really like to know where the authors got that information about all 20 victims being shot in the head.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know of any evidence that there was even a body before it was anonymously picked up and cremated?  What evidence has convinced  you that there was one?</p>

<p>Also, assume there is a body, and a gun with fingerprints next to it.  That&#39;s hardly conclusive.  It&#39;s also possible to place fingerprints on a gun posthumously.  </p>

<p>Besides, have you seen photos of a bloody gun on a body with fingerprints confirmed through a match?   </p>

<p>How are you going to match the fingerprints?  There&#39;s no body.   Did they take Adam&#39;s prints from the corpse and confirm it?  I must have missed that inconclusive evidence - how did you see it?   </p>

<p>No answer = capitulation.</p>

<p>No answer still, but here&#39;s an interesting post from you.</p>

<p>[–]fluntcap 4 points 3 hours ago*</p>

<p>Don&#39;t want to be a dick but do you have any evidence if it was him that did it? Don&#39;t want to start an internet crusade on an innocent man in case he isn&#39;t the prick that did it.</p>

<p>EDIT: Yeah I&#39;ve checked out her Facebook, she&#39;s saying it&#39;s him, I&#39;ll keep an eye out</p>

<p>Possibly the relative mass and heart-rate compared to an adult might lead to a faster bleed-out?  Also, a child is a small target to begin with, so if one was hit at all, their small limbs give higher odds that the bullet would happen to land on their center of mass, being their head or body.  </p>

Adult bodies can&#39;t compensate for the loss of blood as well as children can, in some cases. As far as dealing with penetrating trauma, such as those inflicted by a bullets, both adults and children alike will experience the same mortality rate depending on where the trauma was received. Essentially, a person&#39;s age does effect their ability to physiologically compensate for the trauma received, but a gun shot to a vital organ is a gun shot to a vital organ, without regard for age (developmental time line). I speak from years of experience as a flight medic for the US army and a paramedic in the civilian field, just so you don&#39;t think I&#39;m blowing smoke, I have researched this subject. As far as studies go, medicine is well versed in how forces and energy can effect the human body. Crack a medical book for more info, or wiki it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In response to your first paragraph. Medicine is constantly evolving and growing as we learn more. Unfortunately people are being shot daily so there is no shortage of what we can collectively learn in regards to what is the best method of treatment and what are the best rehabilitation methods. Medical enthusiasts have plenty of cases to review (new ones generated daily) and we have a very vivid picture on what works best and what isn&#39;t as effective. I hope this gives you a better idea on how the field of medicine grows just like any other science. EDIT: is not are</p>

<p>What eyewitness evidence are you talking about? Is there anyone who survived that claims they saw this happen and who did it alone? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m talking about all the people who saw him go in there with a gun and start shooting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forensic evidence? </p>

<p>As in fingerprints on the guns, the fact they have his fucking body etc. </p>
