      <p>
       I was awake and surfing image boards / social networks the other morning when the Dorner story first broke.  I physically saw the Google cache of his Facebook posts including the manifesto with my own two eyes before it was wiped that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can say without a doubt that the "long version" of the manifesto is the original.  It was originally posted on February 4th so either Dorners FB was hacked and the manifesto was completely fabricated a week before this all went down, or everything, including all the crazy talk, are his words.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this all mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Dorner probably has legitimate complaints about the LAPD, who as everyone should know, is corrupt as the day is long.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think he may really be a batshit "wind up toy" who OD'd on the systems koolaid.  We all know the media can't make him fit the mass shooter profile if he loves Piers Morgan and wants Hillary 2016, so the redacted version was put out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media then reported on the long version as well and have gone into full demonization mode against Dorner.  This has led to those less skillful at discerning media trickery to believe that he is a legitimate vigilante who is being demonized by the media with a fake version of the manifesto, et cetra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except that a vigilante doesn't openly advocate killing people randomly, killing innocent people, or killing people based on racial prejudice.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my 2 cents, take it or leave it.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Don't ask me for the evidence of the web cache, it's long gone other than some screenshots of it floating around somewhere.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I won't be answering questions from obvious trolls/COINTELPRO/shills so don't even bother.

       What is a feature?  A news reporter saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We do know the page was started on the 21st of January"  The next day 200 pictures were uploaded?

       I think you are stuck caught in the lie that was offered.. it being 2 years old.    Who says that?  Because they claim they saw it once, but only because they say they saw it once?

       CNN is actually showing the page.   They are saying that THEY don't accept it as evidence.   I happen to agree with them.  It's not unheard of.  I also agree with the weather report sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some facts are easily verifiable,  others have no credibility, like being told it's 2 years old from some random poster, because he says so and only because he says so.

       This presents a false dichotomy.  There are other possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he wrote a letter exposing the department that was altered in order to set him up.   Someone simply made the page
       <a href="http://leaksource.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/lapd-cop-killer-christopher-dorners-facebook-page-created-january-21st-2013/">
        on 21st of january, 2013

       then could have uploaded  photos, and the altered letter, now a manifesto of a cop run amok.

       No, it doesn't.  The account was years old, it was clearly Dorners facebook.  I totally understand your position there and I had considered it, but the age of the fb profile precluded this as a possibility.  Hence why I said either they hacked it and planted the manifesto, or it's real.

       Where did you get the information the account was years old?  I provided a link that shows the page was made on Jan 21st.   Did you watch the report?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they hacked it and planted it, Dorner might have still wrote a part of it about the incidents, and much was added - the threats etc. maybe he's not out to kill anyone, is already dead, or running for his life.

       I didn't see a cache or a facebook account.    You tried to convince me by telling me it was years old, when the information from people that actually saw the page is that it was created 2 weeks ago.

       Either way, there's no page, no cache, and the letter would be inadmissable as evidence.   I'm calling you on it and saying it's BS.  Prove it.

       No, I have sources.  I think it's very ironic for you to ask me for one after I ask you for ANYTHING that would back up what you are saying besides your own words for it.

      <p>
       You have failed, and I don't owe you anything.  If anyone is interested in how old the account really was, that information is all over this subreddit and the rest of the internet for the last two days.  Find it yourself..

       Ironic too because I can't even find your cache.. and nobody can.. you saw it.  Like a fairy.

       Edit:  I posted a thread with a pretty good source saying it was 2 weeks old and describing when things were uploaded.   Instead of downvoting it you might retract your thread, make a public apology and never show your ugly amoral shill lies around here again.
