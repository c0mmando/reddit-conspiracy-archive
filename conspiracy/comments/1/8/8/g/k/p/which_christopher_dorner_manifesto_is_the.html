        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-02-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/OWNtheNWO.html">OWNtheNWO</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was awake and surfing image boards / social networks the other morning when the Dorner story first broke.  I physically saw the Google cache of his Facebook posts including the manifesto with my own two eyes before it was wiped that day.</p>

<p>I can say without a doubt that the &quot;long version&quot; of the manifesto is the original.  It was originally posted on February 4th so either Dorners FB was hacked and the manifesto was completely fabricated a week before this all went down, or everything, including all the crazy talk, are his words.</p>

<p>So what does this all mean?</p>

<p>I think Dorner probably has legitimate complaints about the LAPD, who as everyone should know, is corrupt as the day is long.</p>

<p>But I think he may really be a batshit &quot;wind up toy&quot; who OD&#39;d on the systems koolaid.  We all know the media can&#39;t make him fit the mass shooter profile if he loves Piers Morgan and wants Hillary 2016, so the redacted version was put out.  </p>

<p>The media then reported on the long version as well and have gone into full demonization mode against Dorner.  This has led to those less skillful at discerning media trickery to believe that he is a legitimate vigilante who is being demonized by the media with a fake version of the manifesto, et cetra.</p>

<p>Except that a vigilante doesn&#39;t openly advocate killing people randomly, killing innocent people, or killing people based on racial prejudice. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my 2 cents, take it or leave it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don&#39;t ask me for the evidence of the web cache, it&#39;s long gone other than some screenshots of it floating around somewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>I won&#39;t be answering questions from obvious trolls/COINTELPRO/shills so don&#39;t even bother.</p></li>

<p>This presents a false dichotomy.  There are other possibilities.</p>

<p>Maybe he wrote a letter exposing the department that was altered in order to set him up.   Someone simply made the page <a href="http://leaksource.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/lapd-cop-killer-christopher-dorners-facebook-page-created-january-21st-2013/">on 21st of january, 2013</a> then could have uploaded  photos, and the altered letter, now a manifesto of a cop run amok. </p>

<p>From whistleblower to fugitive in a few easy steps.   The media are absolutely bulimic with this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t.  The account was years old, it was clearly Dorners facebook.

<p>If they hacked it and planted it, Dorner might have still wrote a part of it about the incidents, and much was added - the threats etc. maybe he&#39;s not out to kill anyone, is already dead, or running for his life.</p>

<p>You have failed, and I don&#39;t owe you anything.  If anyone is interested in how old the account really was, that information is all over this subreddit and the rest of the internet for the last two days.  Find it yourself.. </p>

<p>Ironic too because I can&#39;t even find your cache.. and nobody can.. you saw it.  Like a fairy.</p>

<p>Edit:  I posted a thread with a pretty good source saying it was 2 weeks old and describing when things were uploaded.   Instead of downvoting it you might retract your thread, make a public apology and never show your ugly amoral shill lies around here again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL your pathetic attempt at ramming your agenda down reader&#39;s throats is failed.  Let them make up their own mind when the facebook page was started.  There are others that can verify it.  I&#39;m so happy to see you attack CNN in your desperation.  This was an epic fail.  Thanks for making my night.  Goodnight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that there is no discoverable objective fact that the facebook page was started 2 weeks ago?</p>

<p>I think you are stuck caught in the lie that was offered.. it being 2 years old.    Who says that?  Because they claim they saw it once, but only because they say they saw it once?   </p>
