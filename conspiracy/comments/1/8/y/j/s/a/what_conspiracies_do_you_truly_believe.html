        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I confess I have weak spot for some &quot;conspiracy theories,&quot; but not because I believe secret organizations like the Illuminati, the Bilderberg Group, the the CIA/ NSA orchestrate plots, widespread fraud, and other schemes.</p>

<p>Rather, it&#39;s because conspiracies happen all the time. A conspiracy, in its simplest form, is an unlawful agreement by two or more persons who endeavor to achieve an unlawful end. The criminal law may or may not require that they take affirmative step towards that goal (rather than mere discussion). If you and I agree to steal a car and crash it into the Westboro Baptist Church, and then we actually steal the car... we&#39;ve conducted grand larceny and conspiracy, even though the final act is incomplete (&quot;inchoate&quot;).</p>

<p>Also, we know that organizations like the CIA have actively equipped rebel leaders abroad (a plethora of coups) and that the FBI unlawfully surveilled American social and political groups domestically (COINTELPRO). The coups would violate the domestic conspiracy law of the targeted nation, and COINTELPRO violated the law here. These are not conspiracy theories... they&#39;re conspiracy truths.</p>

<p>So, what &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; are you not just suspicious of/ iffy about... but actively believe? I&#39;ll start.</p>

<p><strong>I believe former Enron CEO <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Lay">Ken Lay</a> faked his death.</strong> IIRC:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He was an extremely wealthy man who had the means, motive, opportunity, and connections to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>He had been convicted of securities charges, and was likely to receive a life sentence perhaps 6 months after his alleged death.</p></li>
<li><p>His death occurred before his appeals were exhausted. Thus, the conviction was vacated and his estate protected.</p></li>
<li><p>His &quot;death&quot; occurred at a remote location in Colorado on a holiday weekend, at his vacation home there. His autopsy, cremation, and funeral came to pass relatively soon thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>His death was such that the Colorado corner, Rbt Kurtzman, is the lone government official providing confirmation of his death. There is no other medical or photographic source. Kurtzman alone. The deaths of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were treated with far more incredulity.</p></li>
<li><p>He had financial and political connections at the highest level of state and federal government, and they had political reasons (at least) to facilitate or at least permit his escape.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus: if I were Ken Lay, I&#39;d try to pull off the same thing, and you probably would too.</p>

<p>So, is Ken Lay dead? Maybe. Was he murdered? Maybe. By whom: his wife, to protect the estate? Maybe. Or was it the government? Maybe. Was he placed in witness relocation? Maybe. I don&#39;t know, but I think he faked his own death because he had 10 millions reasons to.</p>

<p><strong>What conspiracy theories do you believe?</strong></p>

<p>*EDIT, wow, lots of great responses here. Thanks to all for keeping the discussion civil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could go for days, but Ill put some strong points down.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This is a big one, The Soviets didn&#39;t come to the conclusion that it was a hoax. They were very smart, they saw the footage, they could pickup broadcasts from the spacecraft themselves. If the enemy of your state, the people that will do ANYTHING to make your country and government appear bad isnt willing to call it a fake, it probably wasn&#39;t.</p></li>
<li><p>The Rocket. The Saturn V is the largest, most powerful rocket ever built. It did launch, the 500,000 people at Kennedy Space center on launch day can attest to that. Why build the world&#39;s only human rated moon capable rocket and not go? It took billions to make that kind of hardware, and to  not use it for its intended purpose, and to do so on many different occasions doesnt make any sense. </p></li>
<li><p>Pictures of the landing sites from space. NASA&#39;s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has taken photos of the landing sites from low lunar orbit. Confirming these is evidence from a Japanese orbiter, an Indian orbiter, and get this, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings#SELENE_photographs">Chinese Orbiter</a></p></li>
<li><p>Ill stop here, but theres way more I could cover. Watch this video of the lunar <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o3Oi9JWsyM">rover</a>. Notice the way the dust settles. On Earth, the dust would kick up into a cloud and linger for a very long time. Because the moon is a vacuum, the dust kicks into perfect parabolic arcs, and settles onto the ground with no cloud of dust trailing the rover. The speed at which the dust settles is even indicative of an environment with 17% Earths gravity. Unless the US government created a vacuum chamber the size of a warehouse (unlikely) and managed to turn down the gravity (impossible) there is no way that footage was filmed on the Earth.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>everyone in nirvana&#39;s heyday knew kurt to be 5&#39;7&quot; (if that)</p>

<p>they are the same height.  more confirmation.   besides, people tend to get shorter as they get older..  kurt was not 5&#39;9</p>

<p>he was only slightly taller than nirvana&#39;s first drummer chad channing (1988 - 1990) who stood just 5&#39;6&quot;</p>

<p>Kurt himself said he was 5 ft 7. Kurdt Donald Cobain was five foot 7. Yes he had scoliosis which gave him bad posture...exp the song (Pennyroyal Tea). Kurts driving liscense says 5&#39;7. Their is 0 doubt in my mine that 5 foot 7 was his height and I wish someone would correct the 5&#39;9 nonsense.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met them both, on multiple occassions. Kurt in 1989 and 1990 (and saw him in 1994, but did not meet him that time; they were too big by then), and Rivers in 1994 (twice), 1995, and 1997. Rivers Cuomo is shorter than Kurt Cobain, and shorter than me. He also has tiny, meek hands. Cobain was about the same height as me, maybe slightly taller. His hands also did not operate like dead fish.</p>

<p>Telling only half the story does not make your theory true. Goat Punishment is <em>not</em> a Nirvana covers band. They did <em>one</em> show that was Nirvana covers. They also did another that was just Oasis covers. Other Goat Punishment shows have been covert &quot;warm-up&quot; shows to practice material for upcoming Weezer shows.</p>

<p>Correct, Rivers&#39; voice sounds nothing like Kurt&#39;s. He did a fine job with the covers, but there is no mistaking the two vocalists.</p>

<p>Rivers only occasionally uses his power voice - when he does it&#39;s too obviously Kurt.. besides, it&#39;s not good for your voice, I bet years of touring singing like that can RUIN your vocal chords, and it would be wise to stop.</p>

<p>some people have an ear to tell cellists apart, they can recognize a certain pianist.. same with guitar.  the expression is key.   Rivers is a natural.</p>

<p>Rivers did indeed rehearse as a reformed Nirvana, and they did tour with Foo Fighters.. sure, I understand why so sensitive about it, but it&#39;s a massive fraud on all the fans to fake your death like that - even if fitting.</p>

<p>They got signed because they were good, and because they were lucky enough to secure a couple of decent opening slots that put them in front of reps, and because they had an excellent demo.</p>

<p>It happens. I had a band that secured a few good opening gigs for national acts. My band, however, sucked, so nothing came of it.</p>

<p>Weezer had some strong opening slots (while Nirvana was otherwise engaged, natch) and aggressively pushed their demo, The Kitchen Tapes. They got noticed. They got signed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s kind of how it <em>works</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and Ric Ocasek produces their debut album</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has produced over 30 records, a number of them by relatively small bands. It&#39;s not at all unusual for a band the label thinks could hit it big to secure a name producer. It&#39;s part of what they&#39;re investing in.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the pesky fact that while demoing and later recording the first Weezer album, along with other Weezer material, Nirvana was playing shows.</p>

<p>Plus that crazy &quot;they don&#39;t sound anything alike&quot; thing.</p>

<p>They gigged around LA for a while, most notably opening for Keanu Reeves band Dogstar, as well as Wax, who had some buzz going in the scene at the time and has a minor hit with &quot;California,&quot; and 4AD (and later DGC) artists That Dog. They were noticed at a music showcase.</p>

<p>Do you just repeat stuff you&#39;ve read or that suits your beliefs? Goat Punishment is not their &quot;secret Nirvana cover band.&quot; They did a <em>single</em> show of mostly Nirvana covers - which really isn&#39;t a big deal. Other bands have done it. Local H, for example, has done a number of Nirvana cover shows, and Scott Lucas at least actually <em>sounds</em> Kurt Cobain, whereas Cuomo does not.</p>

<p>Huh? I didn&#39;t say it was a conflict with Nirvana dates. I&#39;m explaining to you that they had some solid opening gigs that got them in front of A&amp;R reps looking for the next big thing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s sort of how the industry works.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s kind of how it works. You attract interest, the label invests in you, you get a solid producer (and I&#39;ve already pointed out that this was far from the first time Ocasek produced an obscure band), and they try to launch your career so they can make money.</p>

<p>Nevermind that I&#39;ve actually met both Kurt Cobain and Rivers Cuomo, both more than once, and <em>they are not the same person</em>.</p>

<p>You know how people can tell violinists, pianists and cellists from listening to them?    I listened to a lot of Weezer doing Nirvana covers (as goat punishment)   He&#39;s very good.. so good in fact that Nirvana &#39;reunited&#39; with Rivers and were going to tour..   I&#39;d love to hear the tapes.. presumably they were too good.</p>

<p>I&#39;m serious.. but not so serious that I&#39;d go shouting it around to everyone I know.. some people obviously want their privacy and will do a lot to keep it.   The thing that bugs me is that so many people were truly depressed and even commit suicide over what was possibly a faked death.   I can understand where he&#39;s coming from.. really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your &quot;evidence&quot; is all subjective, though. They don&#39;t look too alike to me (and if you believe they do look alike then I guess this whole plot fell at the plastic surgery hurdle - one of the easiest hurdles to overcome, you&#39;d assume), nor does their guitar playing sound more alike than any other two guitarists playing the same kind of music to me.</p>

<p>This seems to be a classic case of confirmation. You think they look and sound kind of alike so you&#39;ve convinced yourself that coincidences are evidence that they&#39;re the same person and are ignoring the fact that it&#39;s unlikely that Cobain would be able to get away with doing this.</p>

<p>You can see where Cobain is coming from? Really? What motive would he have to fake his death - and come back as another rock star?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not speculation. Let&#39;s assume &quot;Rivers&quot; is an entirely invented person. People within his record label would have to know about it, his bandmates would have to know about it, his family - his daughter at least - would surely know about it, and that&#39;s just off the top of my head. These people all know people and it&#39;s unlikely they&#39;d be able to keep their mouths shut about this for so long if it&#39;s true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  I think it&#39;s less nefarious than ensuring that products actually malfunction in order to bring you in to buy the next thing.  Rather, apple or any business does not offer you <em>exactly</em> what you want when you want it - however, they offer a pretty good product that you still want, which you buy, then regret buying when a newer, better thing comes out quickly afterward. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing though: maybe they could have made the better, newer product at the time you bought the first and relatively inferior one.  You didn&#39;t expect the release of the superior form of the product you bought to happen so rapidly.</p>

<p>Case in point: the new Apple iPad mini.  It&#39;s a nifty, if unnecessary, device.  But, it doesn&#39;t have a HD screen even though Apple definitely could manage to build it with one.  I predict that in a year or so there will be an iPad mini with the retina display similar to the full-size iPad.  People who own the original iPad mini will look at the new one and see that it is obsolete.  </p>

<p>This, I believe, is what is actually practiced when people talk about planned obsolescence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that&#39;s a common enough one... but which theory? That it&#39;s a false flag operation? That they let it happen?

    <div class="md"><p>Well, structurally speaking, I&#39;ve seen enough convincing testimonies and logic through Architects/Engineers for 911 truth as well as Pilots for 911 truth. Both very concise and well orchestrated documentaries. Enough to make me think that the towers were a controlled demolition, or at least it seems a lot more likely they were a controlled demolition than anything else. There&#39;s too much scientific evidence contained in those documentaries to deny it. I mean, do people honestly think that towers, constructed to withstand the collapse given if an airplane struck, suddenly collapsed to the ground after hours of burning did so because the structural steel melted? </p>

<p>In addition, there are many witness testimonies that have been blocked from mainstream media/what have you that further lead me to believe they were a controlled demolition. That being said I was really young at the time of 9/11, I think around 6 or 7. Didn&#39;t know what the fuck was going on. </p>

<p>In essence, I usually take various conspiracy theories with a relative grain of salt, but too much adds up to see 9/11 as anything else. I can&#39;t prove or know for a fact what happened because I wasn&#39;t there, but this is my opinion. Regardless of the truth it was an absolute tragedy and whoever was responsible (let&#39;s just say the American gov&#39;t) is twisted and sick as fuck to destroy thousands of innocent lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See this is my issue with 9/11, there &quot;supposed science&quot; defending both sides of the arguments, like for example the popular mechanics debunking stating of the whole conspiracy, although on the flip side theirs a lot of science claiming the other side that it was controlled demolition and all that.

    <div class="md"><p>There was an OP earlier in the day that posted this Good source, The NIST Report he posted here does not support the Official theory and Debunks the Popular mechanics theory. They actually state that there were not high enough temperatures( not more  than 600 celsius) in WTC 1 and 2. This was the First time I looked through this official report and Frankly I am  now 100% convinced of demolition, and the conspiracy. NIST Kinda indicates the demolition by lying about temperatures. Their report outlines these LIES.Anyone reading that should go mad and should have a heart attack! It is absurd!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FDA knows that it&#39;s dietary recommendations are wrong. They know the link they have claimed between saturated fat to cholesterol to heart disease is wrong. They know that sugar and other carbohydrate is the real culprit. They know that cholesterol is necessary and good, and that low cholesterol causes cancer. They know saturated fat is necessary and good for humans. They know that carbohydrate consumption causes diabetes and the cure for diabetes is to stop eating carbohydrates. They also know that cancer cells eat glucose, and cutting carbohydrate goes a long way towards putting cancer into remission. They also know many modern diseases are caused by industrial foods, in particular gluten grains, vegetable oils and sugar. They know this because the science is there for anyone who goes looking for it. They know they&#39;ve made a terrible mistake.</p>

<p>The FDA&#39;s incorrect diet recommendations have given rise to a massive processed food industry. This industry is all based around the lie that low fat/high carbohydrate is healthy. But now the food industry are making too much money and won&#39;t allow the truth to be told. The pharmaceutical industry, too, makes billions out of statin drugs even though it&#39;s well known these create more premature deaths than they save. They are happy for people to continue eating the crap they have been told to eat.</p>

<p>Add to the mix the misguided vegan/buddhist/PETA/environmentalist lobby trying to get people to stop eating animals. You&#39;re now talking about trying to turn around the Queen Mary in order for the truth to be told.</p>

<p>The antidote, for starters, is a paleo (<a href="/r/paleo">/r/paleo</a>) diet, which, as you&#39;d expect, is ridiculed by the diet/nutrition industry, all in the pay of these large companies. In a nutshell, you must cut out gluten, sugar and vegetable oil. Also be vary wary of dairy, only eat it if you are convinced you can handle it.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to know more read Good Calories, Bad Calories (aka the Diet Delusion) by Gary Taubes to find out how this sorry state of affairs came about. </p>

<p>In summary, a coalition of the pharmaceutical industry, the processed food industry, the animal rights lobby and the vegan lobby are making sure that the truth about what food is really good for humans is being kept from us. The result is a population fat, sick and stupid (and therefore much less a threat to TPTB).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can attest that paleo is healthy as fuck. I&#39;ve never done it, as i&#39;m too lazy and was into powerlifting at the time, so just stuffing myself with carbs and protein was the best way to get progress. But for general health and fitness etc, there&#39;s nothing better. I actually know a guy who&#39;s into strongman/powerlifting and sticks to a paleo diet - he&#39;s 295lb, lean, drug free, and deadlifts 700lb raw. He&#39;s also a genetic freak, as 99.9% of people couldn&#39;t do that without drugs, but it just shows that it works, you just have to adjust it to what your goals are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree in general, and the medical/ nutritional case for the paleo diet and the wrongness of the FDA&#39;s recommendations have been made in many places, and especially well by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Taubes">Gary Taubes</a> in his book as you mentioned and in NY Times Magazine articles &quot;What if It&#39;s all Been A Big Fat Lie?&quot;</p>

<p>But, I don&#39;t see this as a &quot;conspiracy&quot; by the FDA and agribusiness, so much as the result of bad science in out-dated FDA standards related to heart disease being influenced by corporate lobbying and regulatory capture/ revolving door politics.</p>

<p>The influence of major lobbying interests on FDA and other agencies is clear, but I see that as a failure of policy safeguards against outside influence.</p>

<p>Now, you have two trends: the old-guard with outdated science blaming fat and cholesterol and new critics, like you and Taubes and many others, who think ketogenic and paleo diets are the healthier kind and know sugar and carbs are the real culprit. These two cultures are now working out their differences at the FDA and in society in general.</p>

<p>Whatever the reasons for the FDA being wrong in its recommendations, we agree that they are wrong and the American diet is a toxic combination.</p>

<p>Also, I will say that the general diet recommendations suggest by other critics, like Michael Pollan (&quot;eat real food, not too much, and mostly plants&quot;) differs from Taubes and the ketogenic approach, but a plant-based diet/ Mediterranean diet is nevertheless healthier than the sugar/ carbo-heavy approach from FDA and agribusiness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thumb scan video was note even remotely reminiscent of Bill Hicks.  They are both Texans and have different degrees of a very <em>slight</em> southern drawl.  Perhaps as a non-Texan the voices sound cliche and simliar, but personally I can tell the difference</p>

<p>I guess I can see what you are talking about very slightly in the Heckler video, but only with the one phrase &quot; I want you to go find a fucking soul&quot; though it honestly doesn&#39;t sound like Alex Jones, just maybe the sort of thing we could expect him to say.</p>

<p>I did my best to close my eyes and imagine one or the other saying it, but in the end it is irrelevant: one quote (even if delivered in pitch-perfect style and form) would not convince me they might be the same person.  I simply require a little more before my imagination can run quite so wild.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that I am familiar with a wide range of Texan accents (commonly more subtle than either of these) and they really don&#39;t sound that similar in my opinion.</p>

<p>Being on the internet has taught me that non-Texans uniformly categorize Texans into one, very large group with little to no disparities between parties.  </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we all &quot;sounded the same&quot; to non-Texans, as typically Americans can only recognize two British accents on a large and smoothly transitioning scale of dialects: proper and cockney.</p>

<p>However, all that aside, Jim Morrison is pretty interesting. When you think of what he stood for... it was a kind of faux spiritualism (the doors are a metaphor for access... break on through etc.) and total hedonism. The whole &#39;60s movement seems to have been perverted from its peace-loving roots to become a drug-fueled party, which escalated to harder drugs in the 70s and 80s. The whole sexual liberation thing was a mixed blessing (STDs, unwanted pregancies etc. and I don&#39;t care what anyone says but the pill screws with your endochrine system and people should stay away from it).</p>

<p>And when you look at all the people who came out of the whole 60s flower power thing, are any of them staying true to all that peace and love stuff? I think not... that generation seems to be all out for themselves...</p>

<p>personally, i&#39;ve never had cancer.</p>

<p>some people that have used it say it didn&#39;t completely cure them, but some say it did. however, the people who say it did not cure them completely stopped chemo therapy. which i assume eating oil that taste like shit is a lot better than chemo therapy, especially when it has better results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Kim Jung Il is still alive, he brainwashed a kid (named him Kim Jung Un) and is try to pull his country out of the shit that its in. </p>

<p>Hear me out, North Korea has absolutely nothing that anyone else wants, IE no oil, no natural resources, no great thinkers, fuckin nothing. So how does Kim Jung Il get his country back on the map and still keep his extravagant way of life? He wants to kick sand in the face of the most advanced country on the planet. He knows that we know how small his nukes are and even if they launch them they will be shot down. The states won&#39;t use nukes against them because that would be like kicking a puppy into traffic(the rest of the world would see it like that) also NK is pretty small as in size, and strategic strikes would be more efficient. 
All he has to do is have Il piss everyone off, launch a shitty little rocket and its fucking on. Then he orders his men to bunker up and wait for the return volley of fire, and to surrender immediately to the incoming invasion. Sure there will be a couple units that didn&#39;t get the memo and will get fucked up, but hey he has to make it look good right? </p>

<p>Every country the states has gone to war with got rebuilt, and money pumped into it. Kim Jung Un takes the hit, spends the rest of his days in a secret detention center built just for him, and Kim Jung Il sits back like a fat cat(because the world thinks he&#39;s dead, a little plastic surgery would cherry it off) </p>

<p>For those who only see &quot;war is hell&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ve watched way to much Fox News&quot; yes the military did a lot of good in Iraq, and Afghanistan and it will continue to do so, just because the military got out doesn&#39;t mean that the money did.  How much do you think it costs to rent Rammstein Air Force base from the Germans? The money doesn&#39;t leave. </p>

<p>Please feel free to attempt to shoot holes in this theory or add to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate all conspiracy theories and theorists. I think that they rely too much on pre-conceived notions and build up a narrative based on that while ignoring contradictory information.</p>

<p>That being said, there was a huge amount of stuff in the Chris Dorner case that was outright phoney. I do believe that he was unjustly fired for breaking unspoken oaths between police officers. I do believe that some members of the LAPD were gunning for blood when they were looking for him and had no intent of taking him alive. I don&#39;t think he was a good guy at all, after all he did threaten to murder some 35 people including innocent children. I don&#39;t think that he knew some dark secret that the LAPD was trying to suppress. I just think that the cops were nervous  about their &quot;gray area&quot; (and &quot;black area&quot;) tactics getting too much publicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seriously contradict yourself in this poorly worded and grammatically awful post. I understand attempting to troll a community (one that I happen to mostly disagree with so I can see why you would attempt to). However, if you are not trolling and in fact are a true believer, then you do more harm to your cause then if you simply stayed quiet. The general lack of knowledge that this post conveys is enough to discount your post, but the real clincher is your NSA rant. You say there is no point fighting them since they know everything (they do), and then your very next &quot;sentence&quot;--I use sentence in the loosest fashion possible, it might be better to say idea--is a complete rebuttal, that government agencies aren&#39;t as powerful as we think. Last time I checked, the NSA was a government organization. I am sorry, but if your&#39;re trolling, you could have done a much better job and of you&#39;re serious, then you should have just stayed quiet rather than afflict a largely coherent group with your rambling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, religious hatred aside, the currency may have been debt free but it was also worthless, or would be as soon as any of the armament factories attempted to cash in the government money. Hitler and his main banker Hjalmar Schacht financed the rearmament of Germany with Mefo bills, a currency backed by a fictional company that accumulated ridiculous interest. This way, the rearmament did not contribute to debt but was still funded. Since these bills were refundable in reichsmarks, the second these companies decided to convert to real money, Germany&#39;s economy would have collapsed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, it is both. Prescott Bush was a US Senator that invested in Nazi Germany before and during WW2 as well as the allies, and held gold on behalf of nazis, and thus made a fortune doing so. </p>

<p>When WW2 ended the USA brought dozens of Nazi scientists over to work on rocket techonology. The entire base of NASA was created by nazi&#39;s. Some were just nazi&#39;s by name, but others believed in the master race and other nazi propaganda BS, which was covered up from the public. </p>

<p>Then Prescott&#39;s son George Bush became the head of the CIA and then the president of the USA, followed by his son George Jr. becoming President.</p>

<p>All coincedence? They dont give a shit about the USA and they have been in positions of power since ww2.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re a detective now you&#39;re not allowed to believe in coincidence&quot;</p>

<p>For example, you seem to readily believe that a facebook page made a few weeks ago, that had 200 photos uploaded the next day contains a manifesto that you believe is accurate and was posted by the deceased whistleblower.  I find that dangerous.</p>

<p>help me what? did you ever meet him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve met them both, on multiple occassions. Kurt in 1989 and 1990 (and saw him in 1994, but did not meet him that time; they were too big by then), and Rivers in 1994 (twice), 1995, and 1997. Rivers Cuomo is shorter than Kurt Cobain, and shorter than me. He also has tiny, meek hands. Cobain was about the same height as me, maybe slightly taller. His hands also did not operate like dead fish.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s that whole &quot;they sound nothing alike&quot; thing.</p>
