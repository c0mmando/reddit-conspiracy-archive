<p>We left and the government we left in power collapsed, no different than what happened to the Soviets in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>We won plenty of battles but could never hold ground.  Same problem in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The military comes in, tells the civilians to leave, flattens the town and then declare it secure.  Within 2 months the fighters have moved back in and you are at square 1.</p>

<p>This is how insurgencies work, I have given you like half a dozen examples of small forces being able to hold much larger forces in fear.  Northern Ireland, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Algeria, Mali.....all 1st world Armies going up against normal people with small arms.  Basically I am saying that your whole notion about America being able to bomb anyone into submission is wrong.</p>

<p>Because reality is more complicated than conspiracies.  In Iraq most people had a greater loyalty to their religious sect, then their clan, then their family, being an &quot;Iraqi&quot; was way down on the list.  Afghanistan on the other hand has really never have a strong central government.  The locals don&#39;t want those assholes in Kabul or Kandahar telling them what to do and they will fight to see that it doesn&#39;t happen.  Trying to convince either of these groups to drop everything and start rebuilding a little America is harder than it sounds.</p>

<p>Turn off the TV dude, western nations have NEVER been able to hold any real ground in Afghanistan.  Right now we control (I used that word very loosely) the urban population centers and tend to avoid the poppy producing regions.  That being said, the taliban still openly operates out of Kandahar and carries out suicide attacks in Kabul, behind dozens of ANA checkpoints.  Remember Marjah?  Remember how no one talks about that whole operation now?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You mean like in Afghanistan with the Soviets, Algeria with the French, Vietnam with the French and Americans and Syria with it&#39;s current situation today?  I&#39;m not sure if you noticed but we are still fighting the taliban in Afghanistan TO THIS DAY.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure on amounts, but I certainly remember the pictures of soldiers standing next to poppy fields in full battle gear and tanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure you are talking about the famous Geraldo clip that conspiracy theorist hold up as 100% proof that America is behind the opium trade.  In that video you see US Marines in Helmand (the single largest poppy producing province in the country) guarding fields and an American outpost.  They are not stationed to guard the opium but instead make sure that no one fucks with the farmers.</p>

<p>If you took the time to look at US policy you would see that early in the war AQ was the target and the poppy was ignored.  Within about 4 years post-invasion the policy changed and you went from seeing poppy planted in every available place to only being grown up in the mountains where NATO forces rarely go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, do you think that the US government would ignore all the tax free profit they could potentially make from selling all that heroin and opium? I dont think so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read up on the Afghan opium trade.  The only taxing involved comes from the taliban taking a zakat for every stage of production and transportation.</p>

<p>Not really.  You are seeing the evil hand behind the curtain when in reality it is just a massive amount of ignorance.  The US government makes no money off opium production and actually SPENDS money to eradicate poppy.  Keep in mind, pre-9/11 the DEA had better contacts inside the country than the CIA did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what should the solution be?  We have people determined to kill Americans, we know where they operate and we know the local government isn&#39;t doing shit to stop it.  Logistically, does it not make more sense to go seek out those people or to build a 200 foot wall around your house and hope nothing bad happens?</p>

<p>I disagree with a lot of US foreign policy when it comes to terrorism but it doesn&#39;t change the reality that a minority of fundamentalist Muslims are willing to use violence to get their way.  If you look back at history, the US never planned on invading Afghanistan.  We send in CIA paramilitary and JSOC operators with duffel bags full of cash to buy local armies.  Look up Operation Anaconda, American soldiers and special operators were killed because the administration didn&#39;t want to send regular military into the country to rescue them and look like the Soviets.</p>

<p>The reason we are still in Afghanistan today is because there is no easy way out.  We are HEMORRHAGING money over there and even if we had every member of the military working in the drug trade, we would still be losing hundreds of millions of dollars a day.</p>

<p>Most of the largest military contractors have limited exposure in Afghanistan.  How many F-22&#39;s do you think we are losing over the skies of Central Asia?  The bulk of the cash comes from building and developing new shit, not in supplying troops in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>That is a conspiracy theory I have not seen.  It makes very little sense since everything fired at us is of Russian design and mainly Iranian origins.</p>

<p>It might have had something to do with two story house sized pieces of burning steel, glass and other building materials falling from hundreds of feet.  But then again what do I know.....</p>

<p>That being said, don&#39;t try and divert this conversation away from Afghanistan.  Based on what you have said so far it is pretty clear that you have not researched the conflict or the country all that well.  If you would like I can give you some resources to help you out.</p>

<p>DEA get tipped off about heroin production facilities. they roll in, meanwhile CIA are in their ears, guiding their every move. DEA picks up a few bricks and arrest a the guys working there. they publicise the raid, get commendations while the CIA ops take the bricks off their hands and send them to europe and america in private planes with ambassadorial immunity. they get moved and the money goes to fund HUMINT operations around the world.</p>

<p>So you believe it just because it fit&#39;s your worldview?  There are very real firewalls between the different federal agencies.  Unless they are in a fusion center you are never going to get a CIA employee whispering in the ear of a DEA team.  CIA Paramilitary/SAD and DEA FAST teams are independent groups.</p>

<p>Have you seen the black budget recently?  There is no need to arrange illicit activities for Afghans we like, we simply give them pallets full of cash, no questions asked.  Do you have any sources on the CIA smuggling in Afghanistan?</p>

<p>The CIA paying a guy who is in the drug business is not the same as the CIA transporting heroin.  Do yourself a favor a read Dexter Filkins&#39; book on Afghanistan.  It will provide some much needed context to the whole situation.</p>

<p>no it&#39;s not but then again the majority of what happens in <strong>classified</strong> operations is publicised on the fucking news.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>as i said before, the majority of the work the CIA does is classified, it would be no surprise if they kept their official rank in the secret services of the world a secret. </p>

<p>all in all your point is mute. you have no idea how deep this could possibly go, you would never know. secret services employ just that; secrets. this is why i think it&#39;s more than likely there is something strange going on in the poppy fields and the global drug trade, specifically involving many other secret services let alone the CIA. also citing mossad is hardly convincing me, israel goes out of it&#39;s way to portray themselves as the greatest nation in the world and that includes showing off their prowess on the global espionage stage, something a more modest country would never even consider. i mean if you&#39;re trying to control the largest superpower in the world under the pretence of freedom, while still trying to engineer a thin veil of leadership over the world through foreign affairs, war and espionage, the majority of the time using fairly loose morals and fear, you hardly want everyone on the planet knowing how much you do control in the background as well. </p>

<p>the united states wants a friendly eye cast towards their leadership, not the scorn they&#39;ve desperately tried to pawn off on other superpowers such as russia and china. no wonder mossad is so open, the US is using the blatent israeli lapdog as a puppet to show the rest of the nations&#39; leaders how dangerous and brutal they can be, while the general populace considers them as just another ally.</p>

<p>so yeah, keep believing no foul play has ever gone on in afghanistan or any of the other phony wars used to exercise control and fear over the rest of the world. they&#39;re nice, happy, friendly people that want nothing more than to deliver democracy and freedom to the constricted and dominated peoples of the world. that one mil. kill count in iraq should tell you all you need to know, frankly.</p>

<p>Research that incident, it was a plane previously owned by a CIA contractor.  If the used car your dad drives today was once owned by a crack dealer, is your father by default a crack dealer or would we need more evidence to make a claim like that?</p>

<p>It could be argued that Afghanistan is controlled by the &quot;west&quot; given that the last several years the country has been thoroughly occupied by U.S. military forces (and their allies).  Since you are obviously a sbject-matter expert on the origins of black market goods in the U.S., perhaps you could enlighten the folks here as to where heroin originates?</p>

I am expected to stand up in court and not mention the fact the Government is the number one drug supplier in the world. It&#39;s apparatus for dealing with niggers is implace to show they are doing something against all these filthy niggars and the drugs they are dealing. The whole court will be attended by the well salaried and protected pensions, people who think they are representing the truth, justice, and the law. The hypocrisy, their masters have waged war for the control of heroin, killing milions in process. Not ONE single person from their organization has ever faced charges, and likely never will, while the civilian apparatus with blood on it&#39;s hands profits by making stupid niggars the scapegoat. </p>
