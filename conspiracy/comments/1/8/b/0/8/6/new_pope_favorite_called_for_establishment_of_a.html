        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From Peter Turkson&#39;s wiki page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In October 2011 Cardinal Turkson called for the establishment of a “global public authority” and a “central world bank” to rule over financial institutions that have become outdated and often ineffective in dealing fairly with crises. The document, Towards Reforming the International Financial and Monetary Systems in the Context of a Global Public Authority was very specific, calling for taxation measures on financial transactions. It notes that “The economic and financial crisis which the world is going through calls everyone, individuals and peoples, to examine in depth the principles and the cultural and moral values at the basis of social coexistence,” it said. The document condemned what it called “the idolatry of the market” as well as a “neo-liberal thinking” that it said looked exclusively at technical solutions to economic problems. “In fact, the crisis has revealed behaviours like selfishness, collective greed and hoarding of goods on a great scale,” it said, adding that world economics needed an “ethic of solidarity” among rich and poor nations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s nice to be able to be engaged in financial corruption when you have immunity from prosecution inside Vatican City.</p>

<p>&quot;The Institute was involved in a major political and financial scandal in the 1980s, concerning the 1982 $4.7 billion collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, of which it was a major shareholder. The head of IOR from 1971 to 1989, Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, was under consideration for indictment in 1982 in Italy as an accessory of the bankruptcy; however, he was never brought to trial due to the Italian courts&#39; ruling that the priest, being a high-ranking prelate of the Vatican, had diplomatic immunity from prosecution.[8] As a private organization performing banking-like functions for religious institutions, it is not subject to public scrutiny. It nonetheless, presented a short presentation on its operations in 2012, apparently in response to recent criticism.[9]&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like it wasn&#39;t based on history.  Popes have been molesting children, having orgies, and playing god over world politics for at least a millennium...certainly, if we had a time machine, and went back in time to ask Jesus what he wanted his followers to do, it would NOT  be &quot;start a global central bank&quot;.  Especially seeing as how his perception of bankers as unholy jackals led him to violence inside a temple.</p>

<p>Well, looks like everything on this planet is a complete fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get a good grasp on the different aspects of Agenda 21 and you can literally watch the news every night and watch aspects of it either being promoted as good ideas or being implemented.  This is what the &quot;leaders&quot; are basing their own goals around is fulfillment of this agenda and bringing the world into a global governance structure.  2050 is the goal for world government, although several of the conferences I&#39;ve studied have shown they want to push &quot;fast forward&quot; on the agenda so possibly well before 2050.  People who are naysayers saying that it is benign and not happening don&#39;t see the big picture and don&#39;t see that it is a long-term plan, not just an &quot;okay it&#39;s the 21st century it should be implemented now.&quot;  Those people, are fucking stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, this type of global system sounds far fetched when it&#39;s depicted in novels and movies, because it might be very different to where we are today, or because it might be purposefully exaggerated in its portrayal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Diabolical is an understatement.  They&#39;ve got the education system on lock too, so the new &quot;grads&quot; will be heavily indoctrinated into SUPPORTING this type of system.  I just got done reading a ton of comments on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> talking about how great the UN is and how much good they do for everyone.  I could scream.  Its an unelected, unaccountable, undemocratic PRIVATE ORGANIZATION, attempting to rule the planet.  How is that good you morons!?  But see, people are just all about it, it&#39;s the schools.</p>

<p>You should look into this as well.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_to_Investigate_Tax-Exempt_Foundations_and_Comparable_Organizations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_to_Investigate_Tax-Exempt_Foundations_and_Comparable_Organizations</a></p>

<p>This is the most eye opening investigation done, big Foundations basically funding education and media to subvert the American culture to gradually synthesize it with the Soviet system.  People credit this to the &quot;red scare&quot; but it is a totally separate investigation and it was just exposed never actually stopped, meaning it has more than likely been happening the whole time.  </p>

<p>This is the exact justification of Agenda 21&#39;s &quot;social equity&quot; chapters.  This guy will help push the world bank, which enacts world taxation, which taxes the &quot;rich&quot; countries more than the &quot;developing&quot; countries.  The &quot;idolatry of the market&quot; as he puts it, is literally the FREE MARKET.  This is pretty nutso.</p>

<p>They are going to &quot;redefine&quot; poverty.  From financial poverty to your social &quot;requirements&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy into the prophecies because there is way too much disinformation out there, but I do see connections sometimes.. how odd is it that an engineered financial crisis is possibly followed by a pope coming on with a central world bank agenda?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is weird.  It also seems to go well with the steps listed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA">in this interview</a>.</p>

<p>I had posted this elsewhere, and here&#39;s the little writeup I did about it:</p>

<hr/>

<p>I like this video. The man doing the speaking here is speaking about the USSR and communists, but it isn&#39;t hard to apply the main principles to the USA. According to him, the steps to accruing and centralizing government power are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Demoralization</li>
<li>Destabilization</li>
<li>Crisis</li>
<li>Normalization</li>
</ol>

<p>The interview was given 29 years ago, but he says that &quot;demoralization&quot; is already underway. Fast forward 29 years, and he also hits the nail on the head when it comes to &quot;Destabilization&quot; when he says that they focus on &quot;essentials: economy, foreign relations, defense systems.&quot; So, what do we think the next crisis will be, and what will be the response to it?</p>

<p>As always, history repeats itself, but it is rarely exactly the same the second time around as it was the first. It&#39;s the overall trends that repeat, not the minute details. Does anybody else see the trend?</p>

<hr/>

<p>That pattern always seems to repeat.  Step 1 takes a long time and is always in progress, but they can repeat steps 2-4 seemingly as often as they want.  Applied to the financial crisis and World Bank:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Demoralization:</strong>  Always ongoing.  It was supposedly ongoing during that interview, and I believe that it still is.</li>
<li> <strong>Destabilization:</strong>  I would say that this is the &quot;financial crisis&quot; that you are speaking of.  I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s actually bad enough to be a real &quot;crisis.&quot;</li>
<li> <strong>Crisis:</strong>  Something major happens that is related to step #2.  Maybe the dollar collapses, maybe the price of oil goes through the roof, something like that.</li>
<li> <strong>Normalization:</strong>  In response to the crisis in step #3, a world bank and/or &quot;global public authority&quot; is set up.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apply it to 9/11 if you want:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Demoralization:</strong>  Again, always ongoing.</li>
<li> <strong>Destabilization:</strong>  I was young so I&#39;m unsure about this one, but I&#39;d say terrorism in the Middle East, problems with Israel and its neighbors, the first Gulf War, and things like that.  Things that warmed us up to a fight with Middle Eastern countries/muslims.</li>
<li> <strong>Crisis:</strong>  The actual acts of 9/11.</li>
<li> <strong>Normalization:</strong>  In response to the crisis in step #3, we got the TSA, the Patriot Act, and all that good stuff.</li>
</ol>
