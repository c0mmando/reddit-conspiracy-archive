       So when this all started, and I saw the testimonies from his former boss at the police department (the man who fired him) and a guy he said he looked up to in the navy, they both said that they could not remember him, adding it was odd he wouldn't have noticed someone so large. Not only that, his facebook page (where all of the pictures of him have came from) was created in January. So I thought to myself, they aren't going to find this guy, he doesn't exist. Amidst all the capitol hill hearings on the use of drones on American citizens on American soil, appointing new members to Obama's cabinet, and the fiscal cliff we have put off, it seems to me like this is not only the perfect distraction, but also gets LA ready for the soon to be police state full with police officers shooting citizens, hunting down people with drones, and all out panic/fear. So after already telling myself he doesn't exist I then watch the press conference of the police officer from like Big Bear California or something like that, the place where all the cabins were, they say they found his truck, but that the footprints coming out of the truck didn't lead to the suspect, this makes no sense. It also makes no sense how someone could kill cops in Los Angeles, and just drive out of the city without cops following him, yeah right.. Mark my words, he will never be found, he's our little home grown Bin Laden 2.0. This is just my take on the situation as I've seen it developing.. Let me know what you think
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so, I went on about a bunch of different things above, which ended up confusing some people from my initial thoughts about this, so I'll just simplify the general idea to a few sentences: I think this whole "Dorner Saga" is being carried out by the powers above. I think the motive of this is #1) to gain public support for drones to be used on US citizens on US soil, in light of the Capitol Hill hearings on the subject a few days before this saga. That is what I believe to be the main purpose. Other secondhand effects I think, that I think they planned on as well, is to decensitize (sp) the public to the idea that a police officers life is far more valuable than the average person, and if officers (or other government officials) get attacked, they will stop at nothing to ensure it doesn't happen again even if it means innocent people will get hurt. Now I'm not saying the second part is concrete, just a thought I had. But I feel strongly this saga was designed to gain public support for drones on US citizens on US soil. Just as 9/11 gave us the foot in the door to rape the middle east for a decade, just as Sandy Hook gave us the foot in the door to start disarming the public. You can say you don't AGREE, but to say there isn't motive and results is not a valid argument, at least based off of the arguments I've seen or heard so far.

       This is a poorly conceived "theory".  Any good conspiracy theory worth any consideration would be looking at the motives, and results.  Everything I'm seeing about this story is making people distrust figures of authority and the methods being used.  In the end, this will be a net loss for convincing people to accept more "security".

       you know what? his reasons why may be off, but the rest of his theory does make sense, as i wondered how they wouldn't get the slightest clue from the foot prints of where he is. He's also not trying super hard to convince anyone, nor does he say that he's absolutely postive this is the case. He just writing some ideas he had that he'd like to share.  Perhaps he is not a theorist by profession, and this is just how the situation struck him, which is why you seem to think this is not a "good theory." He never did claim to be a good conspiracy theorist. This did brought some valuable points to my attention though. I'd really like to believe there is a hero like him out there though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just can't believe how quickly they caught Luka Magnotta in another country, but they've yet to find this guy yet who they seem to believe is still in LA.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does lead me to believe he is real is the fact that his "manifesto" has been changed a few times. there are a couple pictures of him. it's believable a man of his age just recently made a facebook account.
      </p>
      <p>
       then there is that (to my knowledge) we haven't heard from friends or family, how convenient that his family does not speak to him anymore. all we know is a man who wishes to remain anonymous and has had his voice aletred on the news for "safety reasons" that says "he does not know him personally, but remembers him years ago from police training because he stood out with a great shot. this man is dangerous and will kill you." how does a man who didn't know him, but went to training some time ago know if he is a good man or dangerous man or not? wtf?
      </p>
      <p>
       many great points to support both sides.

       Let's examine his main theory then:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Dorner does not exist.
       </li>
       <li>
        Dorner was created to make people accept drones and a police state.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       He supports this with:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "the testimonies from his former boss at the police department (the man who fired him) and a guy he said he looked up to in the navy, they both said that they could not remember him"
       </li>
       <li>
        "capitol hill hearings on the use of drones on American citizens"... "gets LA ready for the soon to be police state full with police officers shooting citizens, hunting down people with drones, and all out panic/fear"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I shoot this down with:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        People are less likely to accept any type of authority when police are shooting people up at random looking for Dorner.
       </li>
       <li>
        People are less likely to accept any type of authority when police are painted as corrupt.
       </li>
       <li>
        People are less afraid of Dorner than they are of the police, and thus no real help to making people accept drones.  People are focused on the LAPD's actions, not drones.
       </li>
       <li>
        There are more creative ways to "false flag" people into accepting drones and a police state.  E.G. Stage a false flag where "militia members" shoot police officers trying to serve a warrant.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Again, his theory is junk.

       No, not really. Maybe if you were dumb, and given though logical processes you seem to be applying, that might be the case.

       You act as if there was some recent application of martial law, or gun rights were actually revoked. None of that happened, though don't let your own ignorance get in the way.

       I'll just put this as a retort to your points.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         People are less likely to have support for LOCAL authorities such as the LAPD. But a federal authority that controls drones based in Nevada or Arizona could be considered more trust worthy because it could watch cops and follow vehicles with less collateral damage.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People are less likely to trust LOCAL public authorities but they again could be persuaded to "hire" a privatized police force that has command centers far away and are painted as being less corrupt than those nasty local police.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dorner is less frightening than the police but let me ask you this. Local law enforcement hires then fires a "man" that then goes apeshit and begins shooting at cops and killing related civilians. That's still a pretty terrifying thing. What if he despised latinos or transvestites or any other group because of something they'd done to him. A guy like Dorner could just crop up and start killing with his own personal arsenal. This becomes anti-gun ownership and pro-surveillance.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I agree that there are probably better ways to stage a false flag but this way has its merits. He's a hard to find local that's hiding out in LA. The cops can't find him and begin shooting anything they think resembles him. This would be so much better if there were drones that could just fly over and pick out all the cars that matched his and follow them until a suspect is found.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now I'm not saying OP is right but at the same time there's always a chance.

       The general public is not that sophisticated to ascribe federal agents as being more trustworthy because the local LAPD is corrupt.  They probably don't know the difference between the county Sheriff and the LAPD.

       Generally speaking, we "conspiracy theorists" are under attack, and the main stream media will use all the ammo possible to make these theories look like crap.  We don't need weak theories such as this.  It only add to the perception of looking like nuts.  Weed out the bad ones, and keep the ones that provoke real questions.

       Did anyone stop to think that what if this is what they want? For citizens to get behind a hero rather than be afraid of a boogeyman? I am not saying I agree or disagree with OP or you but what I am saying is conspiracy theorists have been gaining a lot of ground and this could easily be another technique they have devised for an agenda to push through.

       He seems like a modern folk hero,... sticking it to the man? As far as media reporting goes, I have heard more about his supposed "supporters" than anything significant to the actual case. When the trail became cold in the search, the news shifted to covering the "corruption" angle. This is the realized Django Unchained drama.

       To add to two of your last points, maybe the installation of cameras, both static and mobile would help to mitigate the distrust held mutually by the public and police? More accountability I'd say. As for using more creative means to push an agenda, I'd bet that we have only seen the opening acts as of yet. Stay tuned.

       My theory as well.  He was mentally disturbed.  He burned the truck, found a nice secluded spot (maybe pre planned) and then offed himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also brings to mind the manhunt for Eric Rudolf.  He hid for quite a while, not in the mountains where the search took place but near enough to Murphy, NC so that he was able to dumpster dive behind a local supermarket to keep himself fed.

       On this Monday back to the grind, everyone I've spoken to about it knows of it on pretty simple terms. Basically, that an ex-cop went psycho because he got fired and there's a million dollar bounty on him. And the police accidentally shot up a car, thinking it was him. No outrage, no wondering why.

       I've thought about this as well, and if it is a top down conspiracy, then they chose a horrible candidate. He is Good looking, honorable in his intentions, well spoken(from his manifesto) and in general a very likable character.  I know a lot of people who have been telling me he is their hero.

       It's easy to look at a clear psycho and assume he would've found some way to murder people. It's not so easy to say the same of a normal person. You can argue that if only he didn't have guns, that maybe he would've gotten help instead of resorting to the readily available violent path.

       That does not fly either.  If you need to cover something up, simply make it look like a random shooting or gang violence.  Don't invent someone that does not exist and do a state wide manhunt.

       You are missing the big point. Capitol Hill was having a hearing a few days before this saga about the legality of using drones on US citizens on US soil. Then a few days later, this perfect situation of when it would "be good" to use drones on Americans, thus gaining support so it can be abused in the future. You can say you don't agree, but the motives and results are there.

       Then it's a case of "never let a good crisis go to waste", not a "black flag".  E.G. "We can use this Dorner thing to make news stories about drones.  Call up our news buddies and have them draw up a story about it."

       No. Once again you are missing the point. They started talking about using drones against US citizens on US soil on Capitol Hill before this. Then this happens and he's the poster child for using drones on US citizens.

       It's not, but it's not overtly promoting this agenda either.  That's the point.  If this is a "false flag" with the intent of promoting drones, one can imagine far better ways of doing so.  The drone stories are more congruent with a "never let a good crisis go to waste" scenario, where it was an afterthought to write stories about using drones to track Dorner.  Thus I think "events are real, but the narrative is being manipulated".  "Events are fake to create a narrative" does not fit.

       Thanks for admitting you were wrong about that, I know it was probably hard. So now I'll ask you another direct question, which could help illustrate this for you. So, you think that a few days before Dorner decides he's going on this rampage, Capitol Hill has a hearing talking about the legality of using Drones on US citizens, which was met by scrutiny on both sides, saying it was "a slippery slope". Then Dorner went on his rampage, they are using drones to find him, and now no one is saying they shouldn't be able to. That is nearly statistically impossible just so you know. So you think that everything just perfectly fell into place? I'll repeat, perfectly fell into place. So to clarify, you not only disagree with the idea that they created this situation that has perfectly allowed the US to quietly allow drones to be used on citizens on soil, in writing now, but think it is not even possible? And you believe that these two events perfectly fell into place? To be clear

       This is way to elaborate to make people accept drones, as people are more focused on the LAPD and how the officers are acting, not the drones.

       Well, actually you're wrong on that. There was an outcry from not only republicans, but also democrats that this was "a slippery slope". Now no one is questioning it. Secondly, you're opinion is that people are more concerned with LAPD, but today after I posted this and went to work at Culvers we talked once again what a slippery slope this was, although we did indeed mention how fucked up it was that they shot the hell out of that truck. Thirdly, just because you're brain is too small to comprehend this, and the jigsaw is a little bit tough, doesn't mean it's not a possibility.

       Id be inclined to agree with you, if most of LA weren't treating Dorner like a freakin folk hero.  If Dorner had run amok and targeted civilians/random folk and then took to the hills it'd be more plausible.  As it stands now, having him be the Hero Gotham Deserves targeting corrupt cops and shit doesnt seem like itll benefit the government.

       Notce also how much social media has played into this whole thing. He posted his manifesto on facebook, people have been blowing up twitter about it, etc. It's a great way to monitor sentiments that are negative and even potentially violent to the establishment.

       It's also great fuel for an assault weapons ban, which Dorner even calls for in his manifesto

       Just like that really weird screen shot someone took of some guy claiming to be a lower level DHS - it's all about information dissemination.  The control of information flow.

       You know I have thought about this, and sometimes it seems you need an extreme situation to make people agree to something they don't want. Like the TSA, Homeland Security, and The Iraq and Afghanistan wars would have never happened without 9/11. This may be the beginning af a campaign to have an increased drone presence in the US.

       Maybe, but that campaign would be more effective if people were afraid of Dorner.  I dont think the average citizen of LA is afraid of him, I think they are afraid of the police.

       But it's not about what the people think in 2013. Maybe even in 2001, but not anymore, my friend. We don't declare wars anymore - we send in mercenaries after general conflict - they do what they want without the consent of the people. The nature of government is to poke - to prod - to test the waters for eternity, and they have been doing this decades now. It is all coming to fruition. They are realizing that they can literally get away with anything because the thought of armed revolt is so far from people's minds - people like Dorner and view him as hero? Yeah, so what? It's not like anyone's copying him or rallying behind him. They realize the people are just talk, they're all pussies.

       In a way it does help the Illuminati.
They don't want cops to treat people like human beings. Best way to accomplish this? Fear. Make the cops fear the populace at large. Make them fear "rogue" cops out to kill them. Make them fear libertarians, survivalists and "domestic terrorism".
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're afraid for your life, you tend to forget about compassion for your fellow human being and just get your job done, no matter what it is.

       What this sort of attention does is simple: turns the strong against the weak. What I mean to say is that the powers that be know of the differentiating views between police and citizens after having politely implanted all of this power to police officers for years, granting them substantial immunity from a number of different prosecutions and allowing them to operate above the law. This, obviously, has angered citizens over time and it's overflowing now. Now what you have here are people who don't give a shit about the police, and the police not respecting people who don't give a shit about them. You attack the moral and strength of a population of people, not by killing them and attacking them directly, but rather you get them to attack, belittle and destroy each other.

       That's a development that they will have to sell to the mainstream public before they can do it, and if the mainstream public in California isnt afraid of Dorner then their argument will fall a little flat, unless im vastly overestimated the popular support he has.

       I actually feel the same way about this situation, I'm an IT in the navy, so i figured of course he would have a digital footprint some where on the NMCI network, or on the old IT21 system, especially since he was a supposed LT. Theres nothing absolutely anywhere on him, and everything I can find dates back to 90 that i can look for. Very very weird. Ive never seen anything like it before.

       I understand, another poster indicated as much before I posted my last post. My advice stands. Baiting can work, but it's too easy to get egg on your face and let them chalk up a win. It's like poker in the sense that you often don't profit by winning the most or biggest pots, but but by minimizing your losses in the hands between the big pots that seem to be making you the money.

       I think you're right. All these victims and yet we haven't seen any of them. How about the people the police shot? I haven't any of those either. They are training people to get used to abuse.

       A friend of a friend knows the Quan woman, for what it's worth.  I fully believe that SH and WTC7 were hoaxes, but there were real victims in both of those events.  Thus, I'm not saying the guy may not be made up an perhaps this is a conspiracy.  But that doesn't mean there haven't been victims in this event too.

       Exactly, and legitimize the use of drones on US citizens on US soil, that they conveniently were having hearings on days before this whole saga. And even if the victims were real all they have to do is shoot them, and say "Dorner did it" just like in 9/11 which legitimized the US going over to the middle east and fucking their world up in the name of "peace". Just like Sandy Hook was the catalyzing event that got gun control pushed via executive order. So I feel like it is very possible at least some of the victims could be real, as in the cases of these other events, but just like in those events it was the government who did it, and then had to create a new set of laws that fuck the average person so they can fix this "problem". But yeah I haven't seen much on the victims, if anyone has links please post them!

       Netsec amatuer here. 10 seconds is simply ridiculous, command and control would take longer than that to confirm, but in theory what you're talking about is possible. But in reality, 'chris' could take a number of simple steps to hide his location
      </p>
      <p>
       The character of chris seems incongruant. Why does somebody who believes corruption is commonplace in law enforcement support gun control? How does somebody with top secret clearance write so poorly.

       Nah, it isn't a requirement to be smart, unfortunately. I'm in the Air Force, and have secret clearance, with many friends who have top secret. Based on my day to day interactions with some, I often wonder how the hell they got into the military in the first place, much less given a top secret lol.

       Mostly they look at past convictions and your debt-to-income ratio, in case someone wants to offer you money in exchange for some information.

       What I am seeing is people who think they know need more evidence. I think this is smart because in the world of the internet and Tv we need more then just wolf blizer saying something and we believe him.
And yes this investigation so far seems fishy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it kinda crazy that so many things are coming together so fast. now i know humans are kinda dumb, and i think one of our fatal flaws is that we have an amazing ablitiy to conect dots that dont need to be. im not saying they dont, im just saying we can find a connection to things even if they do or do not connect. Kinda why the whole idea of conspiracys exsist for good and for bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       What im gettign at is that we have the state of the states as they are an economy falling on its face and then WHAM we find out today the pope is out soon. now im not somebody who knows a lot about the pope. but i do know that many times i have seen
       <a href="http://images.4chan.org/x/src/1360581337964.jpg">
        this image floating around

       and it makes me wonder whats going on and how they knew it would be short. then again... i may be making dots connect that don't really exists.

       That image makes no sense. Benedict ruled "only a short time" (8 years) but John Paul I's
       <strong>
        33 day
       </strong>
       tenure isn't worth mentioning as short? How about the 7-year tenure of John XXIII being a "short time"? Why start in 1929? Go back just a decade or two more and you've got John Paul I falling into the "one yet to come" slot. But then the prophecy doesn't work... which is why you'll see this updated once the next Pope doesn't cause the end of the world.

       I agree with you 100% this should not be happening.. I love how they can just pass bill that under our noses and now we have drones flying in our skies.. The sad thing is that the logic of most Americans is 'oh its going to protect me... I don't do anything wrong or illegal anyway..'  what they don't realize is there is no privacy anymore but they apparently don't care about this..
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is one thing to surveil America via drone .. that is bad enough alone.. but making claims that there will be attacks on US soil is just completely ridiculous.. there is not a soul out there that would support that that does not have stock in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Manufacturing

       I was trying to find who makes the US surveillance drones but wasn't having luck.  I can only hypothesize that the main companies are heavily embedded in the industrial military complex.  I have a hard time trusting any arms manufacturing company these days.

       My only question is how is he able to be in hiding for so long when everyone in the entire country knows what he looks like? I would imagine if your picture is being put on the news in every city in the country, it would be extremely hard to go anywhere without being noticed by someone and yet, not a single person has seen him? Is it even possible to pull something off like that?

       I think you might want to take a step back on this one.  Most people in the US don't get the majority of their news off the internet.  Most Americans don't watch a 24 hour news networks.  Most Americans don't care enough.  Most of them MAY have heard of him, but that's about it.

       Well, being as he hasn't shot at the LAPD, I'm gonna guess it's pretty easy. What research have you done on the story before making this post? For instance, there's a years-old news article about him returning a bunch of lost cash from his college years. That's a big question mark to your theory, for starters.

       Well, he's a cop. Depending on his years of experience, he'd know all the procedures they'd use to track him. So if he's smart and paid attention during other hunts and investigations, it is possible he could stay one step ahead of the cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be more interesting when he gets caught and what he looks like compared to the current photos.

       If we sacrificed JFK in the interests of the Military Industrial Complex, unsuccessfully tried to implement Operation Northwoods to get us into war with Cuba, faked the Gulf of Tonkin incident to get us into Viet Nam, sacrificed 3000+ Americans to get us into 2 fake wars over seas and launch a war on "Terror" which never has an end and Obama signs the NDAA , the gun debate only serves to make people buy guns....
      </p>

       would they sacrifice 3 people, pin it on an ex military, good cop, Patsy like Dorner only to get people comfortable with a heavier police presence and now drones in the air as surveillance in the name of public safety?

       Nobody actually saw the face of the masked Aurora killer. Nobody actually saw Lanza's face at Sandy Hook. Did anyone actually see.Dorner murder someone?  And notice how the Dorner thing popped up in time to drown out any more Sandy Hook news. And who rewrote/edited the Dorner manifesto?  Did he even write the original at all? I suspect that when they do get 'Dorner', the victim will be caught with an assault weapon, then blown into unrecognizability. And then Feinstein will tout it as more reason to remove all weapons from the public.  It all seems like an evil game. I'm betting we will see more high publicity murders until they get their way and grab all the guns.

       I actually feel the same way about this situation, I'm an IT in the navy, so i figured of course he would have a digital footprint some where on the NMCI network, or on the old IT21 system, especially since he was a supposed LT. There's nothing absolutely anywhere on him, and everything I can find dates back to 90 that i can look for. Very very weird. I've never seen anything like it before.

       Notice chris is not a particularily likeable guy, nor does he present his case well. A federal agency would remain unconcerned with public opinion of the lapd.

       It's not just about the LAPD.  In order to maintain control you have to "program" people to accept authority.  If they are burned by the LAPD, that "programming" is damaged or destroyed.

       He worked for the police department. So obviously some of them know him personally. He had a case before the review board when he got terminated. His family members and people affiliated with the police department who knew him during his time as an LAPD officer have all talked about him.

       This is the problem with 99.9999% of outlandish conspiracy theories. When you have to "explain away" so many logical explanations and facts  to justify an outlandish view, then it is extremely likely that the "conspiracy theory just isn't true.

       Chris is a wetwork specialist inserted into the police dept shortly after his 'return' from the reserves, with the goal of creating a situation like this and then escaping, in order to move public opinion towards favoring stricter national security controls. That wouldn't be too difficult to explain, and requires only a few people to be in on it.

       very few. the reason for this is because the ones the government aren't behind also get shown little to no light by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, even the ones the government are not behind, the news still reports false information on. this much i am 100% sure of as i've dealt with news people very many times living in the ghetto. i'm not black, but as someone said before in another post, it's always about putting the blame on the no good dirty nigger. it's not hard to see that.

       You have to look much more deeper then just shootings, ect. In sociology I payed attention to one concept/theory especially well and that was the Social-Conlict theory. The way society is studied and looked at in reference to this theory of how it operates, is that a select few (the elite/old money/ ancient family/ secret societies/ etc) do all in their power to maintain that power and uphold the status quo. When you start to realize who truly benefits from every single event, you start to understand that nature of certain choices, how the media (owned by a few) portray certain events and play mind tricks on you to engage you and have you support their cause. For example: Why legalize weed when so many people would lose so much money from it? The private industries cannot monopolize it because it's very easy for ANYONE to grow. Why allow a cure for cancer if it would screw over the medical industries? Why have a war on terror (an endless war with no clear enemy or end)? Simply to justify the undeniable increase in arms and loss of privacy until the point where their power is unchallengeable. Ideology is much more powerful when the public opinion sways against and sees the true nature of their authority. This is not a conspiracy in the terms that it is made up, fictional, or a delusional thought. This is logical assertions toward a human condition in which natural resources are mined from the ground and sold back to us as if we have no stake in the ownership of it.

       I would say that the government is probably using this situation to their advantage more than anything else.  They see an opportunity here.  Get the drones out, get people to like them more on US soil.  Probably stick with just the non-lethal ones for the time being... but just for the time being.  Make baby steps forward in exacting more control.

       I've been thinking that he didn't exist for a couple of days.  I think they riled up the cops and the people about a completely fictional person. I have no proof or theory as to why but I'm sure this is a political agenda of some kind in the making.  When the former chief who supposedly gave him his coin that he sent, shot full of holes, to Anderson Cooper, and the guy said he had no memory of him whatsoever that's when I first started thinking he was total fiction.

       Weather he's real or not, this event does do a few other things. It shows the powers that be how many people would support this kind of action against the police and who, if copycats start to spring up, the then have an excuse to crack down with an even bigger police state. It also furthers the anti gun agenda they have.

       His military records were put out pretty quick, which have been proven by past friends and other military persons.. Same as personal things. 
Looks like he tried to build up a career in the Navy and the LAPD... Didnt work in either so he stewed about it for several years until this.

       In the Navy, he made Lieutenant in 4 years, which is the minimum time-in-rank required (must have 2 years as O-1 to be eligible for O-2, 2 years as O-2 to be eligible for O-3) meaning he was promoted 2 times each on his first time eligible. I'd say he did pretty well in the Navy, especially considering he was a reservist.

       If the guy doesn't even exist and this is a false-flag operation designed to distract and/or manipulate public perception on guns, it's only succeeded in accomplishing the exact opposite. This whole thing is generating massive public unrest while exposing the true nature of the LAPD and various other police departments.

       While I understand the sentiment about the corrupt nature of our 'authority figures', vigilantism is dangerous, when the mobs rule you end up with mob rule.  Ask the french how well their Vigilante justice worked out for everyone.

       i was kind of thinking that perhaps dorner himself is real ... but perhaps all of these years of training, and pushing - it would take a unique mindset to do what he is doing. and a very incredibly strong ethical &amp; moral compass... that is coincidentally a bit, just a tiny, skewed. what if the gov't took chris dorner, average nice guy soldier, and turned him into chris dorner, killing machine... and what if just a few days ago, or weeks ago, someone felt the need to pop that little killing machine on? obviously he snapped; i guess i'm just saying that i think there's a possibility that he was essentially brainwashed because of his strict ethics etc, but he seems to have a somewhat weak sense of "self"  - thereby making him an excellent brainwashee, coerced type.

       I like your theory but the problem I see is that you think the government created a hero for the people. Why I say that is because everyone I talk to so far seems to agree with what he is doing. he doesn't want to target citizens, only the government, because the government is corrupt with people who will not police themselves, so he's going to do it for them.

       I have an additional conspiracy theory to the "innocent citizens" he has killed in addition to the cops he got from his list.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the LAPD wanted to demonize him and because they are the LAPD they can point at anyone as the killer. Why not finger our modern day Anti-hero to diminish his cause to the people he is saying that he is standing up for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Therein lies a conundrum because the LAPD are taking actions against the people, making public statement against Dorner, in the fashion to which his outlines in his manifesto.

       Just a theory here. But maybe that want to make a hero for the people. Maybe let it get so big that people actually start to riot then they can start  enforcing the things the powers have wanted to enforce police states, drones in America, marshal law, and so on. Think about it if there is civil conflict then it would be easier to get things started in order to "protect law enforcement and government officials". Again just a thought. But make  L.A look like a battle zone and most of the rest of American's would be afraid the same thing could happen in their area and go along easier with the government's orders

       I think it is possible. I didn't want to believe this could all be a put on at first because I wanted to believe that some guy was killing cops and paying them back. But it's really strange how the story has suddenly gone silent. I think that could be accounted for by the unexpected happiness and joy that this "dorner rampage" caused.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the powers that be stepped on a landmine by accident. I bet it must really shock them just how many people are prepared to embrace a cop killer in this day and age.

        So when this all started, and I saw the testimonies from his former boss at the police department (the man who fired him) and a guy he said he looked up to in the navy, they both said that they could not remember him, adding it was odd he wouldn't have noticed someone so large. Not only that, his facebook page (where all of the pictures of him have came from) was created in January. So I thought to myself, they aren't going to find this guy, he doesn't exist.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is pretty poor reasoning. He may not have considered a need for facebook before January. Also I'm pretty sure that the Chief at the time saw a lot of officers in day to day and in meetings, a lot of them probably fit Dorners basic description and would blur into each other as would their relevant cases.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Amidst all the capitol hill hearings on the use of drones on American citizens on American soil, appointing new members to Obama's cabinet, and the fiscal cliff we have put off, it seems to me like this is not only the perfect distraction, but also gets LA ready for the soon to be police state full with police officers shooting citizens, hunting down people with drones, and all out panic/fear.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       AFAIK drones came out of a Mail/Express story. The two papers aren't known for being exactly accurate especially in the case of the former that used to run made up millitary stories that no other paper would touch. On about the SAS being hot on the heals of Osama Bin Laden was one. Appeared in no other national newspaper, but front page headline for the Mail (also known as the Fail, Fascist, Nazi).
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly drone is a wide ranging term, and tbh I can make one using a web cam and Arduino system to send pictures from a remote control plane (you can get auto pilot type shields for them now). They're probably using camera drones if at all, it's safer than using helicopters and risking policemen and they won't be using armed drones as they don't have the best track record for collateral damage, something that wouldn't be welcome at all in LA.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So after already telling myself he doesn't exist I then watch the press conference of the police officer from like Big Bear California or something like that, the place where all the cabins were, they say they found his truck, but that the footprints coming out of the truck didn't lead to the suspect, this makes no sense.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why? If it was snowing there then his tracks would get covered, he could have found alternate routes and gone through scrub to lose his tracks, if he finds an area with little snow and goes there then he won't really leave tracks, if he walks down a road before people are looking for him his tracks may blend into others or get trodden by others or just not appeared on compacted snow.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It also makes no sense how someone could kill cops in Los Angeles, and just drive out of the city without cops following him, yeah right.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In that case you are an idiot. This isn't GTA where cops randomly appear and chase you and there aren't security cameras absoloutely everywhere. Secondly Dorner looks like a million people or more in the world and probably a lot like everyone else in the areas he's moving in. First someone has to notice his vehicle and reg, then they have to do checks to locate the area of the vehicle and make sure it's the right one and if he changed his plates that will confuse the ANPR as that means it won't be looking for the plates he switched for. It's also confusing as the basic description is a big black guy driving a pretty stereotypical looking Utility Truck. There must be a shed load of people fitting that description in California. Now imagine on the street, he's a big black guy wearing plain clothes that look like a lot of other plain clothes in these colours unless he got changed recently. Now add in the probability he's moving around at night for the most part. Hmmmm...
      </p>

        Mark my words, he will never be found, he's our little home grown Bin Laden 2.0. This is just my take on the situation as I've seen it developing.. Let me know what you think
Ok so, I went on about a bunch of different things above, which ended up confusing some people from my initial thoughts about this, so I'll just simplify the general idea to a few sentences: I think this whole "Dorner Saga" is being carried out by the powers above. I think the motive of this is #1) to gain public support for drones to be used on US citizens on US soil, in light of the Capitol Hill hearings on the subject a few days before this saga. That is what I believe to be the main purpose. Other secondhand effects I think, that I think they planned on as well, is to decensitize (sp) the public to the idea that a police officers life is far more valuable than the average person, and if officers (or other government officials) get attacked, they will stop at nothing to ensure it doesn't happen again even if it means innocent people will get hurt. Now I'm not saying the second part is concrete, just a thought I had. But I feel strongly this saga was designed to gain public support for drones on US citizens on US soil. Just as 9/11 gave us the foot in the door to rape the middle east for a decade, just as Sandy Hook gave us the foot in the door to start disarming the public. You can say you don't AGREE, but to say there isn't motive and results is not a valid argument, at least based off of the arguments I've seen or heard so far.
For people confused about the drone issue, this was taken off of this thread

        I made a new post, so if you want to keep the convo going this post is much more concrete and less thoughts, more just layed out simply

       I'm not shooting down your theory but the tracks from the burnt out vehicle could have been covered since he's probably got survival training. Also, I don't even believe he was at the vehicle when it blew up. That was a decoy and maybe he even set a charge on it or something seeing as though he has reportedly got demolition and ordnance training.

       Did someone fake up that lengthy court appeal?  that's a lot of work and a lot of foresight.  It's easier for me to believe he doesn't exist because he was killed for attempting to blow the whistle.

       Yeah well, the 'coincidental number' that shows up all the time is a lot of bull plop.  I number of motivated friends and I did about a 6 month long search into numerology and found that there's almost no connection between any type of event and any number. It only shows up because you are looking for it in the same way the guy who convinced us to look into it was positive 42 was 'the' number.  You can understand his mistake having read A hitchhikers guide to the galaxy too many times.  And he always replied
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2">
        "But look at all the things that happened that day!"

       Yeah you're probably right. I barely even need to think about it now, but you're absolutely right. This has been the strategy since 9/11.

       No. I'm just freshly awakened to the concept. The more I think about it the more it seems obvious that the strategy is genius. Anyone who questions the official story gets laughed at, and the publics opinion gets formed by the media instead of the public. I guess we're at a point in history where the individual no longer exists unless he has money... but then again it's sorta always been like that.

       Not as much the police as a whole. So I've always thought about 1-2% of officers are probably just agents posing as officers. So I'd think there are a good number of the LAPD that are part of "the agenda" or whatever you want to call the CIA/FED/NATO etc. So I do think some of the people who were killed, were actually killed, but by CIA agents and then it was blamed on Dorner (just like the Batman shotting). But the media is definitely involved

It was assumed that he perished in the hills of the Big Bear mountain range, but apparently he was living as a lift operator going by the name "huggy bear". After being cornered by Seal team 6 and being taken out in a fire fight, insurgent Dorner was given an immediate burial at sea at an undisclosed location on-top of bear ridge."

       So they produce a fake manifesto exposing major corruption in the LAPD? Yeah, surely that's in the interest of your "powers that be" (lol) and a completely logical step. There would have been no other way to do it.

       You're looking at the pieces, check out the picture. If you want to federalize local police, where would you start? By showing it works in a small town or by showing that a large city's police force is incompetent? I hope this guy is real and does have information to expose corruption and what have you, but I wouldn't be overly surprised if it was a false flag

       I bet all of those hearings in Washington are cover for something else they are trying to sneak in the back door. Did you know that the Benghazi hearings were meant to help Obama push Shariah law into US? True story.

       Not as much the police as a whole. So I've always thought about 1-2% of officers are probably just agents posing as officers. So I'd think there are a good number of the LAPD that are part of "the agenda" or whatever you want to call the CIA/FED/NATO etc. So I do think some of the people who were killed, were actually killed, but by CIA agents and then it was blamed on Dorner (just like the Batman shotting). But the media is definitely involved

       I have an additional conspiracy theory to the "innocent citizens" he has killed in addition to the cops he got from his list.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the LAPD wanted to demonize him and because they are the LAPD they can point at anyone as the killer. Why not finger our modern day Anti-hero to diminish his cause to the people he is saying that he is standing up for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Therein lies a conundrum because the LAPD are taking actions against the people, making public statement against Dorner, in the fashion to which his outlines in his manifesto.

        Lemme get this straight OP. You're saying they had the police work with the media to masquerade a plot in order to make drones on US soil legal?

       Yes, kind of like what they did in 9/11 or Gulf of Tonkin etc... You find it unusual that the media and government lies to get public support?
