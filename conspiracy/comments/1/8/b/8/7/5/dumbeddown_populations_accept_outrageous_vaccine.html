<p><em>Monday, February 11, 2013 by: Jon Rappoport</em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve written articles attacking the theory and practice of vaccination from a variety of angles. But the whole issue also needs to be approached from the perspective of logic.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, generations of people have been shut out of learning logic in school. They don&#39;t know what it is. Therefore, vaccine advocates have been able to peddle their basic theory without much challenge.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time to put an end to that free ride.</p>

<p>First of all, I need to point out a massive contradiction. When a person receives a vaccine, it&#39;s said that his body produces antibodies against a particular germ and this is a good thing. Vaccination thus prepares the body for the day when that germ will really make its attack, at which point the immune system (including antibodies) will mount a successful defense.</p>

<p>However, let&#39;s look at another venue: for many diseases, when a person is given a blood test to see if he is infected, quite often the standard for infection is &quot;presence of antibodies.&quot;</p>

<p>This makes no sense at all. If vaccination produces those antibodies, it is heralded as protection. But if a diagnostic blood test reveals those same antibodies, it&#39;s a signal of infection and disease.</p>

<p>Vaccine-produced antibodies=health. Antibodies naturally produced by the body=illness.</p>

<p>Logically speaking, you resolve a contradiction by dropping one of the two sides and admitting it is false. Or you go deeper and reject some prior premise that led to the contradiction in the first place.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s go deeper. What does vaccination supposedly do to &quot;prepare&quot; the body against the future invasion of a particular germ? It stimulates the production of antibodies against that germ.</p>

<p>Antibodies are immune-system scouts that move through the body, identify germs, and paint them for destruction by other immune-system troops.</p>

<p>However, since the entire immune system is involved in wreaking that destruction, why is bulking up one department of the immune system---antibodies---sufficient to guarantee future protection?</p>

<p>On what basis can we infer that bulking up antibodies, through vaccination, is enough?</p>

<p>There is no basis. It&#39;s a naked assumption. It&#39;s not a fact. Logic makes a clear distinction between assumptions and facts. Confusing the two leads to all sorts of problems, and it certainly does in the case of vaccination.</p>

<p>Furthermore, why does the body need a vaccine in order to be prepared for the later invasion of germs? The whole structure/function of the immune system is naturally geared to launch its multifaceted counter-attack against germs whenever trouble arises. The antibodies swing into action when a potentially harmful germ makes its appearance, at age five, eight, 10, 15.</p>

<p>It&#39;s said that vaccination is a rehearsal for the real thing. But no need for rehearsal has been established.</p>

<p>And why are we supposed to believe that such a rehearsal works? The usual answer is: the body remembers the original vaccination and how it produced antibodies, and so it&#39;s better prepared to do it again when the need is real. But there is no basis for this extraordinary notion of &quot;remembering.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s another assumption sold as fact.</p>

<p>The terms &quot;prepared for the real thing,&quot; &quot;rehearsal,&quot; and &quot;remember&quot; aren&#39;t defined. They&#39;re vague. One of the first lessons of logic is: define your terms.</p>

<p>A baby, only a few days old, receives a Hepatitis B vaccine. This means the actual Hep-B germ, or some fraction of it, is in the vaccine.</p>

<p>The objective? To stimulate the production of antibodies against Hep-B. Assuming the baby can accomplish this feat, the antibodies circulate and paint those Hep-B germs for destruction now.</p>

<p>From that moment on, the body is ready to execute the same mission, if and when Hep-B germs float in the door.</p>

<p>But when they float in the door, why wouldn&#39;t the body produce antibodies on its own, exactly as it did after the vaccination was given? Why did it need the vaccination to teach it how to do what it naturally does?</p>

<p>And why should we infer the baby body is undergoing an effective rehearsal when vaccinated, and will somehow remember that lesson years later?</p>

<p>The logic of this is tattered and without merit.</p>

<p>To these arguments of mine, some vaccine advocates would say, &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t matter because vaccines work. They do prevent disease.&quot;</p>

<p>Ah, but that is a different argument, and it should be assessed separately. There are two major ways of doing that. One, by evaluating claims that in all places and times, mass vaccination has drastically lowered or eliminated those diseases it was designed to prevent. And two, by a controlled study of two groups of volunteers, in which one group is vaccinated and the other isn&#39;t, to gauge the outcome.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the first method of assessment. Those who claim that vaccines have been magnificently effective in wiping out disease have several major hurdles to overcome. They have to prove, for each disease in question, that when a vaccine for that disease was first introduced, the prevalence of the disease was on the rise or was at a high steady rate in the population.</p>

<p>Why? Because, as many critics have stated, some or all of these diseases were already in sharp decline when the vaccines were introduced for the first time.</p>

<p>For example: &quot;The combined death rate from scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough and measles among children up to fifteen shows that nearly 90 percent of the total decline in mortality between 1860 and 1965 had occurred before the introduction of antibiotics and widespread immunization. In part, this recession may be attributed to improved housing and to a decrease in the virulence of micro-organisms, but by far the most important factor was a higher host-resistance due to better nutrition.&quot; Ivan Illich, Medical Nemesis, Bantam Books, 1977</p>

<p>In other words, for reasons having nothing to do with vaccination, the diseases were on the way out. Nutrition had improved, sanitation was better, etc.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s see the proof, for every disease which vaccines are supposed to prevent, that those diseases were significantly raging in the population when the vaccines were first introduced.</p>

<p>Then let&#39;s also see proof that, after the introduction of vaccines, the diseases in question weren&#39;t merely given new labels (or redefined) to hide the fact that they weren&#39;t really going away. There is testimony, for example, that in America, the definition of paralytic polio was changed after the introduction of the Salk vaccine, and by the new more restricted definition, far fewer cases of polio could be diagnosed---thus making it seem the vaccine was effective.</p>

<p>There are also questions about the success of the famous smallpox vaccine campaign in Africa and Latin America. When all was said and done, were new cases of smallpox then diagnosed as meningitis? Was destruction wreaked by the vaccine then called AIDS?</p>

<p>Researchers, including Robert Gallo, have warned that the smallpox vaccine, when given to people whose immune systems are already grossly weakened, can destroy what&#39;s left of the immune system---and immune-defense destruction is the hallmark of the definition of AIDS.</p>

<p>The second major way of assessing the success of mass vaccination is through a proper controlled study.</p>

<p>For any vaccine, this is how it would be done. Assemble two large groups of people. Total, at least eight thousand. Make sure these two groups are very well matched. That means: similar in age; very similar in medical history and medical drug history; similar exposure levels to environmental chemicals; very close nutritional levels, status, and dietary habits.</p>

<p>The first group gets the vaccine. The second group doesn&#39;t. They are tracked, with very few dropouts, for a period of at least eight years. The INDEPENDENT researchers note how many from each group get the disease the vaccine is supposed to prevent. They note what other diseases or health challenges the volunteers encounter.</p>

<p>Such a study, using these proper standards, has never been done for any vaccine.</p>

<p>If that fact seems rather illogical, you&#39;re right. It is.</p>

<p>Finally, vaccine advocates need to prove that substances in vaccines like mercury, formaldehyde, and aluminum, although classified as toxic when studied alone, are somehow exonerated when shot directly into the body through a needle. The (absurd) logic of this needs to be explained fully.</p>

<p>This is not a matter of claiming that &quot;a particular disease,&quot; like autism, isn&#39;t caused by a particular chemical, like mercury. That&#39;s a logical ruse all on its own. We are talking about harm caused by toxins under any name or no name. When a person ingests cyanide, do we say he has a disease? Of course not.</p>

<p>Children in school, their parents, and teachers have never been exposed to logic, so it&#39;s easy to sell them vaccines as valid. But selling is not the same thing as science.</p>

<p>And &quot;being a scientist&quot; is not the same thing as knowing what science and logic actually are. The same fact can be applied to news anchors, public health officials, and politicians. They can say &quot;the evidence for vaccinating is overwhelming,&quot; but so can a parrot in a cage, with enough training.</p>

<p>Of course, these so-called experts won&#39;t come out and engage in a serious debate about the theory and practice of vaccination. They refuse to.</p>

<p>Millions of people around the world would eagerly watch a true extended debate on the subject. Such debate used to be a standard practice when logic was studied, when it was understood to be vital for deciding the truth or falsity of a position.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s all about PR and propaganda, the modern version of logic for the dumbed-down crowd.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the only way to test for a disease. You see, there are these things called symptoms...</p>

<p>If there are antibodies there, they must have been produced because of some &#39;trigger&#39; for them. That might be a vaccination, or it might be the disease itself. Assuming you have never had the vaccination, then you must have the disease, right? And assuming you have, it&#39;s much less likely to be the real disease. The two possibilities (&quot;Vaccine-produced antibodies=health&quot; and &quot;Antibodies naturally produced by the body=illness&quot;) are entirely separate and not comparable.</p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t need to be a basis for it or an explanation. We just need to show that it works. And it does.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not presented as a formal definition or proof. It&#39;s an easily understandable shorthand and metaphor.</p>

<p>Practice. You get better at playing the piano with it. You get better at playing baseball with it. You get better at fighting off disease with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To these arguments of mine, some vaccine advocates would say, &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t matter because vaccines work. They do prevent disease.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep. What&#39;s your point?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, for reasons having nothing to do with vaccination, the diseases were on the way out. Nutrition had improved, sanitation was better, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t show that vaccines weren&#39;t part of the reason, just that they weren&#39;t the whole reason. Nobody is arguing that they were the whole reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first group gets the vaccine. The second group doesn&#39;t. ... Such a study, using these proper standards, has never been done for any vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s unethical. We have evidence that vaccines work, so conducting a study denying people of that just to satisfy conspiracy theorists is stupid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Children in school, their parents, and teachers have never been exposed to logic...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evidently not by your twisted definition. Kinda doesn&#39;t matter though when your definition is wrong. You&#39;re cherry-picking your logic and intentionally ignoring major things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, these so-called experts won&#39;t come out and engage in a serious debate about the theory and practice of vaccination. They refuse to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they already have. They don&#39;t need to. It&#39;s a waste of time. No matter what they say, you people aren&#39;t going to listen anyway.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: By spreading your falsehoods you are a danger to society. The anti-vaccination movement is one of the stupidest things in history. You&#39;re not correct just because you&#39;re &quot;questioning authority&quot;. &quot;Authority&quot; can be right.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m no expert on this particular matter, but the argument about the polio vaccine (or the one I am aware of) is that polio was in steep decline before the vaccine was introduced to the population, and the vaccine had no discernible effect in the eradication of the disease.

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of problems with that explanation. Namely, the correlation between vaccination rates and rates of polio. When we saw the Muslim clerics rail against the vaccines as poison, we saw rates rise. After continued efforts, rates fell. There is also a problem with the mechanism of sanitation causing polio specifically, while we have a very solid understanding on the mechanism of polio vaccines. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ahealedplanet.net/medicine.htm">The Medical racket by Wade Frazier</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The standard history books fail to mention that Pasteur’s early experiments with his vaccine were disastrous.  Pasteur’s plagiarized vaccine was used on thousands of sheep in Southern Russia.  The vaccine was administered to 4564 sheep, and 3696 died almost immediately from the vaccine.[218]  Pasteur had to pay for all the animals he killed with his “preventive.”  The numbers show similar success with Pasteur’s rabies vaccine.  He may have even invented a new disease with that vaccine.  Time and again, the actual effects of vaccination show something very different from unqualified success.  A chapter of Hume’s book is devoted to the vaccination lessons of World War I.  Disease caused nearly as many casualties during the disaster at Gallipoli as those dead and wounded in battle, with heavily inoculated troops.  The grand finale of World War I was an “influenza” epidemic that swept the world in 1918-1919, beginning at a U.S. military base and killing probably at least 25 million people and crippling my grandfather, who was in the trenches during World War I.  They thought he was dead, and put him in a makeshift morgue with other soldiers.  He awoke days later in the charnel house, and nearby soldiers were spooked to watch a man crawl out of there.  Rheumatoid arthritis accompanied his illness, which crippled him. </p>

<p>Vaccination is another outcome of Pasteur’s germ theory.  Pasteur was not the first vaccinator, as Edward Jenner and others had the idea for smallpox much earlier, but Pasteur provided the theoretical basis, and he was the first great commercializer of the process.  His anthrax and rabies vaccinations were two early instances of the commercialization of vaccination.  As with fluoridation, assessing vaccine effectiveness is a numbers game.   In Hume’s book, she deals at length with the effectiveness of vaccination, especially Pasteur’s.  Before Pasteur pursued his vaccines, smallpox vaccination became mandatory in England, and the numbers are illuminating.  In 1840, smallpox vaccines became free in England and Wales.  In 1853, the vaccine became compulsory.  In 1867, those who did not submit to vaccination were prosecuted. The deaths in England and Wales from smallpox are presented for the pertinent years.[216]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America&#39;s Medico-Drug Cartel </p>

<p>The medico-drug cartel was summed up by J.W Hodge, M.D., of Niagara Falls, N.Y., in these words: </p>

<p>&quot;The medical monopoly or medical trust, euphemistically called the American Medical Association, is not merely the meanest monopoly ever organized, but the most arrogant, dangerous and despotic organisation which ever managed a free people in this or any other age. Any and all methods of healing the sick by means of safe, simple and natural remedies are sure to be assailed and denounced by the 
arrogant leaders of the AMA doctors&#39; trust as fakes, frauds and humbugs. </p>

<p>Every practitioner of the healing art who does not ally himself with the medical trust is denounced as a &#39;dangerous quack&#39; and impostor by the predatory trust doctors. Every sanitarian who attempts to restore the sick to a state of health by natural means without resort to the knife or poisonous drugs, disease imparting serums, deadly toxins or vaccines, is at once pounced upon by these medical tyrants and 
fanatics, bitterly denounced, vilified and persecuted to the fullest extent.&quot;</p>

<p>The Purchase of Public Opinion 
In the following years, not only newsmen, but whole newspapers were bought, financed or founded 
with Rockefeller money. So Time Magazine, which Henry Luce started in 1923, had been taken over 
by J.P. Morgan when the magazine got into financial difficulties. When Morgan died and his financial 
empire crumbled, the Thorough FaceliftHouse of Rockefeller wasted no time in taking over this lush 
editorial plum also, together with its sisters Fortune and Life, and built for them an expensive 14-story 
home of their own in Rockefeller Center —. the Time &amp; Life Building. 
Rockefeller was also co-owner of Time&#39;s &quot;rival&quot; magazine, Newsweek, which had been established in 
the early days of the New Deal with money put up by Rockefeller, Vincent Astor, the Harrimann family 
and other members and allies of the House. </p>

<p>Millions of Dollars Free Publicity 
Another interesting revelation in the article of Time was that many years ago already Singer &quot;was 
pleasantly surprised when Britannica approached him to distill in about 30,000 words the discipline 
that is, at its heart, the systematic study of what we ought to do.&quot; So now we touch the subject of 
sponsorisation and patronage. They don&#39;t always mean immediate cash but, more important, long-term 
profits. 
Many decades ago the Encyclopedia Britannica moved from Oxford to Chicago because Rockefeller 
had bought it to add much needed luster to the University of Chicago and its medical school, the first 
one he had founded. Peter Singer, &quot;the world&#39;s greatest animal defender&quot; who keeps a door permanently 
open to vivisection and the lucrative medical swindle, gets millions of dollars free publicity thanks to 
the worldwide engagement of the Rockefeller Foundation and the media makers who are in no position 
to oppose it. 
From the article in Time we also learned that Singer&#39;s mother had been a medical doctor in the old 
country, which could mean that little Peter started assimilating all the Rockefeller superstition on 
vivisection with his mother&#39;s milk. </p>

<p>Well, in fairness those are two different things. And neither of them is actually what Rappoport has done in the article you pasted into the title of this thread. It&#39;s more of an opinion piece - an opinion of a scientifically unqualified journalist, using a weak understanding of the subject matter to extend his ideas. Why are you taking what he says as fact, when he is quite clearly totally unqualified in what he&#39;s talking about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya we&#39;re bat shit insane. let me guess? everyone in LA is bat shit insane too for standing up for Dorner for going against corruption that they know exists. Or has the shootings at innocent people and no one arrested or in jail been justified to you by the reason of &quot;mistaken identity&quot;? Why aren&#39;t those officers in jail? </p>

<p>Does it not make sense that Dorner was dismissed instead of taken to trial because he&#39;d win based on his evidence of the police brutality he tried to put an end to?</p>

<p>You&#39;re completely right however, none of us really know the facts. However, am I going to trust someone who is known for being one of the most corrupt groups in their country? Or am I going to trust the person who has gained popularity for trying to take a stand against this corruption, even if it means his own life, which we all know it will. Which side will you choose? </p>

<p>Mimicking Monsanto’s PR, Gates used Bollywood actors to strongly promote his vaccine campaign to ‘eradicate polio’ across India. Vaccines ware given to Indian children. Have they brought health?</p>

<p>From “Polio programme: let us declare victory and move on” by Neetu Vashisht and Jacob Puliyel at Medical Ethics <a href="http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/202co114.html:">http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/202co114.html:</a></p>

<p>“In 2011 there were an extra 47500 new cases of NPAFP [non-polio acute flaccid paralysis]. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Through this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated.”</p>

<p>The Oral Polio Vaccines were given to Indian children. The CDC dropped the OPV from its vaccine schedule in the US because it was <strong>causing polio</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody needs to be confused but EVERYBODY better be darn well frightened about taking ANY vaccine, under ANY circumstance, for ANY reason, at ANY time in their life.&quot;--Dr Duffy DC</p>

<p>&quot;I have been on the staff of the New Jersey State Department of Health, and was in complete charge of the Monmouth County Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center. For the past three years I have been director of the Homestead Rehabilitation Institute (and still am as of this writing). My experiences have enabled me to observe from within the workings of official medicine. At first I could not believe what I saw...Were the truth concerning medical treatment and so-called prevention ever to leak out, the stench of it would obliterate the public confidence in the medical profession and put an end to the fantastic drug profits.&quot;---Dr. Milton Fried, D.C., 1956 (Poisoned Needle by McBean p192)</p>

<p>&quot;What, then, is the value of vaccination? We firmly believe that it has no value at all.   Its supposed value has been deduced from incorrect reasoning on the part of its advocates. Were small-pox as prevalent and as fatal now as in the eighteenth century, it might even be justifiable to have recourse to inoculation—either by variolous or vaccine matter. History, however, has demonstrated that towards the close of the last century, when Jenner introduced his system, small-pox had gradually died out, as we shall presently show. Even in Jenner&#39;s day small-pox had lost its virulence.&quot;---Dr. Charles T. Pearce, M.D.  [1868 Book: Essay on Vaccination]</p>

<p>&quot;I once believed in Jenner; I once believed in Pasteur. I believed in vaccination. I believed in vivisection. But I changed my views as the result of hard thinking.&quot;--Dr Hadwen</p>

<p>&quot;I have no faith in vaccination; nay, I look upon it with the greatest possible disgust, and firmly believe that it is often the medium of conveying many filthy and loathsome diseases from one child to another, and no protection whatever against small pox. Indeed, I consider we are now living in the JENNERIAN epoch for the slaughter of innocents, and the unthinking portion of the adult population.&quot;---W. J. COLLINS, M.D., B.S., B.Sc. (Lond.) M.R.C.S  (Letter to Vaccination Inquirer)</p>

<p>&quot;The &#39;victory over epidemics&#39; was not won by medical science or by doctors--and certainly not by vaccines.....the decline...has been the result of technical, social and hygienic improvements and especially of improved nutrition.  Here the role of the potato...deserves special mention.....Consider carefully whether you want to let yourself or your children undergo the dangerous, controversial, ineffective and no longer necessary procedure called vaccination, because the claim that vaccinations are the cause for the decline of infectious diseases is utter nonsense.&quot;--The Vaccination Nonsense (2004 Lectures)---Dr. med. G. Buchwald  ISBN 3-8334-2508-3  page 108.</p>

<p>&quot;The greatest threat of childhood diseases lies in the dangerous and ineffectual efforts made to prevent them through mass immunization.....There is no convincing scientific evidence that mass inoculations can be credited with eliminating any childhood disease.&quot;--Dr Robert Mendelsohn, M.D.</p>

<p>&quot;Amazingly, vitamin C has actually already been documented in the medical literature to have readily and consistently cured both acute polio and acute hepatitis, two viral diseases still considered by modern medicine to be incurable.&quot; - Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD</p>

<p>&quot;Modern medicine&quot; may well be defined as &quot;the experimental study of what happens when poisonous chemicals are placed into malnourished human 
bodies.&quot; -- A. Saul, Contributing Editor, Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine -- <a href="http://www.orthomed.org">http://www.orthomed.org</a></p>

<p>&quot;The efforts of the medical profession in the US to control:...its...job it proposes to monopolize.  It has been carrying on a vigorous campaign all over the country against new methods and schools of healing because it wants the business...I have watched this medical profession for a long time and it bears watching.&quot; - Clarence Darrow, (1857-1938).</p>

<p>&quot;An enormous mass of experience, both of homeopathic doctors and their patients, is invoked in favor of the efficacy of these remedies and doses.  But the regular profession stands firm in its belief that such experience is worthless and the whole history is one of quackery and delusion.&quot; - William James (1842-1910).        </p>

<p>The whole entire existence of the pharmaceutical industry is based on presentation of false science, and advertising this false science and drumming it into the minds of gullible people who have no curiosity to find out why that is so. The Water Cure: An interview with Dr. Batmanghelidj</p>

<p>The carpenter desires timber, the physician disease. ---Rig Veda IX. 7.9</p>

<p>I find medicine is the best of all trades because whether you do any good or not you still get your money.  ---Moliere: &quot;A Physician in Spite of Himself,&quot; 1664</p>

<p>It is time to lay to rest the notion that germs jump into people and cause diseases. ----Emanuel Cheraskin, M.D., D.M.D. in Vitamin C: Who Needs It?</p>
