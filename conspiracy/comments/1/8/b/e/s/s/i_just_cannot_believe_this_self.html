       Last week I was freaking out because there were going to be drones patrolling Tennessee highways by September.
This week I am completely astonished - we are already playing out in our national dialogue the necessity of drones.  And nobody. even. blinks.
I am buckled in - because shit is seriously about to hit the fan.

       You're right. To be fair (to all of us who are horrified) a LOT of people have not only blinked but are raising the alarm. It's just that our voices aren't broadcast on the national airwaves.

       But there is a remnant that sees what has happened to our country.

       It's weird, like i keep trying to explain some of this shit to even just my family, and nobody cares. We don't live in the US, so they assume it won't affect us, because, y'know, the US usually keeps themselves to themselves with regards to their international policies, right?

       I keep telling myself this shit is going to get very serious within 15-20 years, yet the way things are going i can't help but think it's gonna be much sooner.

       And MUCH more effective means of tracking.  Like...
       <em>
        MUCH
       </em>
       more effective.  Drones, for one, don't need roads like squad cars and, being a lot smaller than helicopters, can track someone running in the woods in a manner that copters never would be able to.  And, like you said, are a

        lot

       They likely won't be armed. Just like police helicopters don't have missiles and machine guns on them.

       Yea, they'll tell you they aren't armed.  But, really... how would anyone know if they were or weren't?  You'll never see one first hand as they fly thousands of feet in the air.

       The media can pick and choose what they report, and eye witnesses can be blown off or silenced. Look at what's happening to all the whistle blowers. They're getting killed, imprisoned, or silenced. The last thing the people should do is trust their government.

       The internet exists so that our oppressors can watch us talk about them, our future plans, and ourselves. You'll notice you don't have the ability to do that with them. They meet in secret, around the globe, and discuss matters you are not allowed to know about. Meanwhile, the sheep baaaa, baaaa, baaaa, all over the internet about their bugout plans, protest organization, and personal belongings. Hey want some guns? Just check out r/guns, cause people love taking pictures of their safe and forgetting to scrub the metadata.

       TN here. I have not heard of this. However, I remember when we started getting camera's that detect speed in city streets and everyone was a gasp by it...why? we all motherfucking speed at some point and eventually received tickets. We got mad, made some waves in the courts and now they hardly send out these tickets. (OR people don't mind paying tickets)
The states agenda will crumble once enforcing this in TN. No one wants it if they are targeting us "the speeders". THE only way this becomes effectively efficient is if the Federal gov't takes over.
       <br/>
       How would they(state) make money on it if they didn't use it for speeders?

       That's really scary, I hear nothing like this happening in Cali but I heard that they are going to place certain people in death camps (including me) in any time period. I had also heard that the government is going to play out a little fake terrorist attack in March or April so be prepared.

       Well I can't provide evidence on something that I heard from since I don't know, especially when I HEARD it. Meaning you hear about it but you don't know if its true, hence get the source. Yeah I am am the idiot because I actually understand the concept of well "heard of something.

       A friend of mind told me that he got it from a raido station, a conspiracy radio station where they provide evidence towards that. My brother who is also into this even gave me some papers on how Obama is making a fund for a prison camp. I am personally very up and down about this conspiracy stuff but then again I never bothered to look into the evidence. I don't even know the name of the radio station my friend listens to.

       Meh it was just something my brother told me about. I never really bothered to actually dig in with this sorta thing. Even if I go to a death camp, what can I do about it anyway? Hide? fake my death? live in the woods somewhere? That would be funny but they may just track my down anyway. Ah what a world lol.

       No I was very aware that it was out of the odd, which was why I never bothered to get into it, but sometimes things that are out of the odd, are usually given facts and people do do think out of the odd due display higher levels of intelligence. Yet being a tad more open minded is rather a good thing is it not?

       I never said I believed it and with my previous comments, I claimed that I don't know if it's true or not. I never make conclusions without evidence or with a logical analysis. Also not beliving in something because it's out of the odd, does not make you irrational it makes you central.

       I meant to say that placing a theory out of the odd, does not make you irrational it just makes you more open and less closed minded, since you would define "logic" in a more central area, or what you are use seeing.

       I mean you can still apply that stuff with logic as it is. We did with many inventions and that worked out just fine.

       Are you using google translate or something? What does 'placing a theory out of the odd' mean?

       Yes that is true in some cases but in a way you also agree and I had did the same. You can still apply logic with something out of the odd but the main confusion that you are getting that they're is a difference for being central rather than being logical.
      </p>
      <p>
       As in central I mean something that you are use you ect. I think we are meeting on the same page here. Even thought you are kind of an idiot.
