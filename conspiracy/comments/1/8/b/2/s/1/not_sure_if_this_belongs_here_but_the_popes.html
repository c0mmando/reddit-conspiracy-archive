        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In case you missed it: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18axbi/pope_pope_benedict_xvi_to_resign_the_pope_is_to/">Pope Pope Benedict XVI &#39;to resign&#39;. The Pope is to resign at the end of this month in an entirely unexpected development, reports from the Vatican say.</a></p>

<p>Not sure how many of you are familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Popes">Prophecy of the Popes</a>, but it&#39;s basically a collection of cryptic messages relating to each pope since the 12th century. A surprising number of these have been somewhat accurate (as accurate as cryptic messages can be).</p>

<p>Benedict is the second to last Pope on the list. If it holds true, there will only be one more pope: &quot;Peter the Roman&quot;</p>

<p>The last prophecy reads: &quot;In the extreme persecution of the Holy Roman Church, there will sit [i.e., as bishop].
Peter the Roman, who will pasture his sheep in many tribulations:
and when these things are finished, the city of seven hills will be destroyed,
and the terrible judge will judge his people.
The End.&quot;</p>

<p>If that wasn&#39;t creepy enough for you, guess what the name of the apparent favorite for succession is? <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18axbi/pope_pope_benedict_xvi_to_resign_the_pope_is_to/c8d699u">Peter</a> <sup>Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson</sup></p>

<p>Not sure if this is the right place for prophecies and such but I thought you guys might be interested. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to say that if the end of the world does come on the heels of the final pope it&#39;s a manufactured end. And not the end foretold in the biblical scipture. </p>

<p>The bible specifically states that no man will know the time of the end. And the the lord comes as thief in the night. </p>

<p>So whatever end is alleged to follow this new pope it will end that was premeditated and perpetrated entirely by humans with no divine influence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many speculated that when Benedict took over his term would be short. John Paul II had a long tenure as Pope, and that a shorter term Pope would be good because, again, speculation, the next Pope would be the first from either South America or Africa. For example,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Turkson"> Cardinal Turkson</a> will quite possible be a long term Pope. At age 64 we could be looking at a 15-20 year term just a bit of time frame.</p>

<p>My family is Catholic and I went to Catholic elementary and high schools. These are the things I heard when JPII died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I&#39;m a sarcastic jerk, not a troll.</p>

<p>But that still doesn&#39;t invalidate my point that the prophecy is talking about the destruction of the city of Rome rather than the end of the world that OP is talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was simply the final place of education for him, though. Is there any precedent of a last degree being cause for referring to a person as being of that place? It seems a stretch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He studied at St. Teresa&#39;s Seminary in the village of Amisano and Pedu before attending St. Anthony-on-Hudson Seminary in Rensselaer, New York, where he obtained a Masters in Theology. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop John Amissah on 20 July 1975.
Turkson was a professor at St. Teresa&#39;s Minor Seminary from 1975 to 1976, whence he entered the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, earning a licentiate in Sacred Scripture in 1980. He returned to St. Teresa&#39;s for a year,1980–81, and became vice-rector at St. Peter&#39;s Seminary in 1981. He also did pastoral work in a parish annexed to the seminary. In 1987, he returned to the Pontifical Biblical Institute to receive a doctorate in Sacred Scripture (1992).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let&#39;s say this Peter Turkson really does get picked as the pope... you would completely forget about the prophecy just because he wasn&#39;t born in Rome? </p>

<p>Also another point to consider is he did spend 4 years in Rome while in school there. He is also is the current president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. I have no clue about this so I am just guessing but could one assume he currently lives in Rome while serving as president?</p>

<p>It also occurs to me, we&#39;re talking about an English interpretation of a Latin passage, so there may be other valid literal interpretations of the words.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s certainly one of the most compelling prophecies I&#39;ve read.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The young lion will overcome the older one,
On the field of combat in a single battle;
He will pierce his eyes through a golden cage,
Two wounds made one, then he dies a cruel death.<br/>
(Century 1, Quatrain 35)</p>

<p>This quatrain foretelling the death of King Henry II of France in a jousting accident is one of the most famous, predocumented, and perhaps one of the most studied.</p>

<p>In June 1559, Henry II ignored all warnings that Nostradamus gave him and participated in a jousting tournament against the Comte de Montgomery. Both men used shields embossed with lions. Montgomery was six years younger than Henry. A tournament is a field of ritual single combat. </p>

<p>During the final bout, Montgomery failed to lower his lance in time. It shattered, sending a large splinter through the king&#39;s gilded visor (golden cage). Along with minor punctures in the face and throat, there were two mortal wounds. One splinter destroyed the king&#39;s eye; the other impaled his temple just behind the eye. Both penetrated his brain. Henry lingered for ten agonizing days before dying a cruel death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And a skeptic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The young lion will overcome the old one
on the field of battle in single combat:
He will put out his eyes in a cage of gold:
Two fleets one, then to die a cruel death.</p>

<p>Four years after Nostradamus wrote this prophecy, King Henry II of France was killed by a lance in the eye at a match with the younger Captain Montgomery. However, the match was not a battle, it was held at a party to celebrate a peace-treaty (quite the opposite of a field of battle). Many people say that this quatrain made Nostradamus famous in his own time, but it was not until 48 years after his death that this was first printed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could also say that the Holy Roman Catholic Church turned it&#39;s back on the European belief that it was privately owned Roman banks that lent more money than they had led to the war hungry growth and collapse of the Roman Empire. The Church was convinced by the Templars (secret order of a supreme ruling elite, the decendants of which still influence the world&#39;s private banking system), to lend money-debt, a practice deemed to be un-Christian like. No longer.</p>

<p>Since then, private banks have been issuing bank notes (money) at an interest effectively creating money for them at a price the public has yet to afford. They (the shadow governments) use this money-debt milked from their debt-slaves to finance the growth of their respective nation&#39;s Empire while the Church (the media) condone it by saying the &quot;savages need our civility to save their soul&quot; and gets a cut of the money-debt. War funded by capitalists thickens the shackles of debt worn by the public. </p>

<p>Fast forward to modern times and we see the decendants of the old shadow government running the new shadow government funding the expansion of a New World Empire with new money-debt milked from their new debt-slaves while it&#39;s all condoned by the media (the church) by saying the &quot;savages need our civility to save their soul&quot; for a price.</p>

<p>A shadow governing elite which rules over debt-slaves has an end goal of global supremacy. They&#39;ve existed for centuries if not longer and have been slowly conquering the globe and imprisoning its people with perpetual debt under the banner of &quot;God&quot; and His holy tollerance for social-darwinism. You can&#39;t possibly believe that St. Malachy, writer of the Profecy of the Popes, was divinely inspired.</p>

<p>Think about it in this light: if the word of &quot;God&quot; professes the end all war that creates the apocalypse (WW3), then it must be a part of &quot;God&#39;s&quot; plan. Therfore, WW3 was the work of &quot;God&quot;, not the shadow government.</p>

<p>tl;dr: The Church is a tool for the debt-rich rulers of the shadow government and their campaign for a New World Empire based on social-darwinistic philosophy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the prophecies don&#39;t give a name.  It&#39;s a phrase which describes the man who becomes the pope or something about their reign.  For instance:</p>

<p>John Paul II</p>

<p>“De labore Solis”</p>

<p>Pope John Paul II’s motto, according to the prophecy, is “From the labour of the sun” or “Of the eclipse of the Sun.”</p>

<p>Pope John Paul II was born Karol Wojtyla on May 18, 1920, during a solar eclipse. He died on April 8, 2005, during a partial solar eclipse</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree, and most of the later ones are often grasping at straws to fit the person to the prophecy.  I just wanted to point out the prophecies don&#39;t name names, otherwise finding the next pope would be a much easier job for the cardinals each time and that Peter guy from Africa would be a shoo in this time around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prophecies are interpreted as &quot;fulfilled&quot; by people who believe in prophecies.  The papacy is a political position.  I doubt the Prophecy of the Popes has had or will have any effect on the choice of a new shill for the rubes.  Ratzinger&#39;s retirement (Chosen of god? Nah.  Imma go nap now.) probably signals an end to the catholic church as we know it.  Personally, I&#39;m all in favor of accelerating the eventual withering of the church so we can repurpose the buildings.  &quot;Thanks for the pretty buildings, but the paedo thing was a bit much.

    <div class="md"><p>How can anybody say if God exists or not?  Something that created the universe and life would probably not be part of the universe or made from the same things as it.   It would be even more beyond our comprehension than what a galaxy is to a flea.  Who can rationalize something that is simultaneously aware of everything.  I think its awesomely presumptuous to say that there is no God because we can&#39;t point at him or he doesn&#39;t do tricks for us. </p>
