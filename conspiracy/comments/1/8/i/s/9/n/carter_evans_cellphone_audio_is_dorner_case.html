Not trying to defend the police but if a heavily armed suspect  with the intent to kill and suited in protective gear is trying to come out in the open the only option would have been to shoot. That doesn&#39;t justify them burning the place though but other than &#39;pushing him back&#39; I don&#39;t see what else they could have done in this situation. </p>

<p>told him to lie on the ground. It&#39;s their job to capture people alive., even if 5 minutes before the suspect was shooting at them. might not be a nice job in this fashion, but nobody forced them to take it.</p>

<p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via phone): Anderson, I just spoke with Chief Kirk Ellington of the U.S. Marshal Service. He&#39;s a district chief out in California. He just told me that at one point during the standoff, the suspect tried to escape. He said he tried to escape out the back. I&#39;m not sure exactly where the back is in relation to where -- you know, some of the pictures that we were seeing, but he said he tried to escape at the back and was pushed back inside.</p>

<p>Not clear how he was pushed back inside. I asked him when that occurred during the sequence, and he said about the time when the fire started. He also -- I asked him about any weapons that he had, what kind of weapons. They&#39;re not sure what kind of weapons that he had in there. It was his understanding at that time when I just spoke to him that there were no hostages in there. But again that&#39;s -- that was his understanding at time.</p>

<p>That&#39;s -- I don&#39;t think that&#39;s been confirmed yet by anyone at this point. But he did tell me that at one point the suspect tried to escape out the back and was pushed back inside. </p>

<p>This sounds like it happened before law enforcement moved in to do &quot;the burn&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s more like I think you are getting the wrong impression about whether it is something a person can accomplish within reasonable means.</p>

<p>If you want to know some reasonable ways to get better at lying, the book Dancing Naked in the Mind Fields has some information on controlling galvanic skin response that might be useful.  As for controlling cranial nerve responses, I think it might be possible for Felix Baumgartner.</p>

<p>No, YOU are ignoring the point man, ffs..</p>

<p>You keep bringing up these very specific points, as if I was saying something otherwise. &quot;Within reasonable means&quot; -- Sure, the guy might have to practice for 10 god damn years relentlessly to be able to do it, and even then, it&#39;s still likely he could fail.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it is going to easy, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s probable, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s <strong>possible,</strong> and you really don&#39;t understand </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say within reasonable means, relative ease, ease in general, or anything else. </p>

<p>No. I&#39;m just not a moron that thinks anytime anything happens on the news its a false flag attack.</p>

<p>People didn&#39;t speculate, they said it <strong>was</strong>. </p>

<p>Your whole point doesn&#39;t make sense. Due process? The police are allowed to kill people they are in shootouts with. They can do it from a helicopter or a roof top, what&#39;s the difference with the drone? Specifically legally. </p>

<p>You see, my point isn&#39;t that it&#39;s dumb to speculate. My point is that it&#39;s dumb to speculate unintelligently and in ignorance of actual law and precedent. </p>

<p>It would be pretty silly to stage a false flag attack to push for something that <strong>wasn&#39;t</strong> prohibited. Besides that, a framework for what you said they were doing never appeared.</p>
