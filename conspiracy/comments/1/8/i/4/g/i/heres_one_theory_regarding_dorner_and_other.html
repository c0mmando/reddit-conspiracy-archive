        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-02-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/no1113.html">no1113</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems TPTB know we the people have been starting to get pretty hip to their M.O.  Think about it.  They did 911 and, at least initially, <em>EVERYBODY</em> in America absolutely believed them hook, line, and sinker that it was some terrorists in the middle east - &quot;They hate us for our fweedums!!&quot; - so they had the full blessing of most of the American public to go and start bombing some brown people over yonder.</p>

<p>Since that time, however, a good portion of the population now understand what a false flag (FF) attack is, and know <em>very well</em> what the &quot;Problem-Reaction-Solution&quot; paradigm is all about.</p>

<p>As a result, TPTB are REALLY not having a very easy time pushing forward more draconian legislation to enslave the masses.  911 skyrocketed a LOT of our IQs in terms of just how fucking evil some (all?) of those beings that rule this planet are.  The masses are generally MUCH more likely to critically question any mass shooting or &quot;national tragedy&quot; that happens as a result now.</p>

<p>&quot;Who benefits?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Follow the money trail.&quot;</p>

<p>These are things firmly embedded in the minds of many of us at this point, and we are quick to say &quot;FUCK YOU&quot; to the MSM as well in a manner that was never the case before.</p>

<p>With that in mind, it seems that there is a race going on at this point.  As I&#39;ve said before, the &quot;Totalitarian Tip Toe&quot; has officially turned into a full on &quot;Totalitarian Sprint&quot; as TPTB are racing to clamp down on as many of our freedoms as possible and are REALLY starting to just rush as many FF attack after FF attack on us as possible in an attempt to simply bombard the public with fear and death in the hope that the people will just say &quot;Aaaahhhrgh!  Fuck it!  Big Brother, HEEELLLLP US!  Make it all stop!  Take all this chaos from us SOMEHOW!!&quot;</p>

<p>Thing is, though, that the reason they&#39;re rushing to get all this done at this point is because the public has actually begun to WAKE UP to all the bullshit TPTB are responsible for.  We&#39;ve been waking up for some time now to just how evil and lying they are and also waking up to just how much of this society and this world they control - the government and the media are in their pocket.  <em>They</em> pull the strings.  Not a president of this or whatever other country.</p>

<p>A lot of the public is much more aware now and they want to hurry up and enslave us before <em>everybody</em> wakes up (because there indeed are many people still very much asleep, unfortunately).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t recall as many calamitous national tragedies all taking place back to back as quickly as the Colorado shooting, the Sikh Temple shooting, the Sandy Hook shooting, and now this Dorner fiasco?</p>

<p>What the fuck?</p>

<p>And think about just how fucking absolutely STINKY each of those tragedies were in terms of unanswered questions, in terms of HUGE holes in the MSM narrative, in terms of inconsistencies and contradictions left and right.  It&#39;s like a lot of these scenarios have certain characteristics about them that just SCCREEEAM false flag all over them.</p>

<p>Stay fucking <em>diligent</em>.  Keep your eyes open, and remain <em>very</em> critical of ANYTHING the fucking MSM says about any type of reported tragedy.</p>

<p>TPTB are <em>definitely</em> willing to kill a shit ton of people in the name of staging a FF attack - so don&#39;t think that my or anyone&#39;s saying that a national tragedy was &quot;fake&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen or people didn&#39;t die.  People can <em>definitely</em> die in false flag attacks.</p>

<p>Just know what the real reasons are behind them.</p>

<p>They&#39;re trying HARD to push their agenda of complete control.</p>

<p>Stay strong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, however make sure not to understate your opinion allowing them to fill in the gap. I usually throw out that I&#39;m a constitutionalist I&#39;m not a history major but I agree with almost all of the original wording now the deciphering of the intent has a whole field involved with it and I don&#39;t have time at the moment to research all of that. This way I&#39;m removing the blurry line of where I stand, I stand with both feet in the republic, I&#39;m not wishy washy, I believe the constitution is a great formula for society and some of the alterations are completely unnecessary but that&#39;s for another debate. Also a majority of people have done absolutely no work on their critical thinking or general thinking skills, you will never reach these people because they have forsaken their oath as an American for the dollar or whatever swings their fancy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Of course.  The more a people realize that &quot;All is One&quot;, put their differences (almost always nothing but petty) aside, and come together upholding that very truth (that we are all one), the less anyone will ever have the ability to rule over them.  Not only are we VERY ruled over now, but the truth of the matter is that I wouldn&#39;t be the least surprised if those supposed &quot;virtues&quot; such as &quot;Personal individuality!&quot; and &quot;Uniqueness!&quot; that TPTB/MSM have brainwashed and indoctrinated the entire nation from birth to value are nothing more than a complicated method of actually keeping the citizenry from realizing that - individual and unique as we all indeed very much <em>are</em> - what we REALLY all are is <em>ONE</em> being.  We all indeed are unique and individual rain drops, but we have allowed ourselves to get SO lost in the vicissitudes and pitfalls of this idea of &quot;separate and INDIVIDUAL uniqueness&quot; that we have made the egregious error of forgetting the fact that each and everyone of those unique and individual raindrops mean almost nothing until they ALL come together as ONE and form <em>the one, great ocean</em>.  Once they do that, they can&#39;t be stopped.</p>

<p>Individually, they are easy to conquer - almost effortlessly so.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve never come together as one people, however...so it&#39;s easy to deal with us and control us.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Correct.</p>

<p>That we live in Democracy, that we are free, that money has value, that you will get a fair trial, etc.  These things and more are all total lies.</p>

<p>...that individuality &quot;at ALL costs and at the exclusion of everything else&quot; is something we should actually strive for (another lie).</p>

<p>Not sure that&#39;s going to happen <em>initially</em>.  I would imagine if WWIII is going to happen, it will involve more conventional battle first.  Otherwise it will likely be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory">pyrrhic victory</a> for whoever set off the blast.</p>

<p>Also, however, it&#39;s already been said by a few types that WWIII already HAS started.  It just hasn&#39;t hit US shores...yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If they&#39;re being pressured into making moves, it&#39;s by the economy, not by us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re not being pressured by the economy.  They ARE the economy.  They <em>run</em> the economy.  That makes no difference to them.  The economy - i.e. money - is just a method they use to enslave the people.  That&#39;s all it is.  It&#39;s a conduit that makes it easier to trap and enslave the public.</p>

<p>That public, however, <em>is</em> indeed starting to wake up.  <em>That&#39;s</em> a problem because the more awake the public is, the more the public will realize that what&#39;s happening is that they&#39;re being fooled and bamboozled and tricked and slowly (quickly?) enslaved...and the more the public becomes aware, the more it <em>will</em> resist and fight.</p>

<p>Therefore, although TPTB may still not be feeling all THAT much pressure (if for no other reason other than their understanding of just how stupid the vast majority of the public actually is), it does indeed seem that they are beginning to ramp up their b.s.  It does indeed feel that they are tightening the grip of full control a bit more quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, how much of the population questions things in the way we do here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the way we do here?  Not too many.  You&#39;re right about that.  However, we question things A <em>LOT</em> here...and that&#39;s really the way it really <em>should</em> be, but even though the rest of the population absolutely doesn&#39;t question things as much as we do, I think they are indeed beginning to stir a bit...In other words, the sleeping giant of the dumb masses is indeed beginning to question just a bit.  This is shown in the fact that the government&#39;s public acceptance rating is at an all time low.  Even grandma and grandpa are aware that &quot;something&quot; bad is up even though they may not be critical enough to understand exactly what and how or to what extent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d say 1% is really pushing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s an issue of degrees.  Although most certainly aren&#39;t &quot;totally&quot; awake, I do think that a lot are in the &quot;Hey, what the fuck is going on here?  This really isn&#39;t like it used to be.  Something definitely feels off...&quot; stage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidence will never trump belief when it comes to the masses, this has been shown for thousands of years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definitely seems true for a <em>lot</em> of the masses, unfortunately, but I think there are some on the fence enough that will understand what&#39;s happening with a bit of information.  I don&#39;t generally disagree with this, however (again, unfortunately).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have to change peoples&#39; minds with things they can relate to. The gun laws changing, Internet privacy etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree.  And right here I think you just brought up one example in particular (the 2nd amendment) the changing of which really CAN wake certain people up that were otherwise dead set on being closed minded with regard to the corruption and treachery that exists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are things that actually affect the population in their cozy day-to-day lives, which is all they care about. If we can make them question the reasoning behind those things, then we can start to show people hard evidence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is 100% true and valid on your part.  Well said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately it will have to get much worse, before we can convince even a small amount of people that these freedoms they&#39;re losing are part of a larger agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And by that time, it may be too late.  At the moment when the sleeping giant REALLY realizes it&#39;s being enslaved, the entire cage will already have been built around it and it will be too late for it to attempt to get out.</p>

<p>Fucking sucks...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do slightly disagree with the point you made on the economy, as yes, they control a lot of the money, but unfortunately for them, the rest of the world knows how these things work. They have to abide by <em>some</em> rules when it comes to things like printing money, paying debt etc. The system can&#39;t carry on the way it is now, if it was just the Federal Reserve that was in charge of everything, then sure, they could do what they want, but the rest of the world actually has people watching what they&#39;re doing, even if they&#39;re not doing a particularly good job.</p>

<p>The eastern economies aren&#39;t doing as badly as the western ones at the moment, and if the economic crisis was allowed to run it&#39;s course, the west would become pretty much secondary to the emerging economies in the east. But they ain&#39;t gonna let that happen. As you say, what happens in America, and even the EU, they largely control, but they can&#39;t effectively control the development of eastern nations. Not without carrying out a plan (what the actual plan is, i have no idea, but i think we can all have a pretty good guess) to change the way things are going right now.</p>

<p>The rest of the world has certainly caught up a lot in terms of their (our) understanding, but I think they still know quite a lot bit more than we do about monetary minutia, unfortunately.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Like who?  I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, as I won&#39;t pretend to know a whole heck of a lot in this area...but are you referring to organizations like the UN?  I&#39;m not sure if you are, but if you are, then I&#39;d say the UN is little more than a joke designed to, much like government itself, give the people the impression that there is a regulatory organization &quot;helping to maintain peace and equanimity in the world&quot; when, in reality, things continue on just as contrived and corrupt as ever - often with the HELP of those organizations that are supposed to exist to prevent such corruption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The eastern economies aren&#39;t doing as badly as the western ones at the moment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  You are correct.  I was thinking about that as I was posting my previous comment.  The Fed, I guess it could be said, is in control of the <em>West</em>...not so much the East, perhaps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but they can&#39;t effectively control the development of eastern nations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps one of various things the West (and particularly the U.S.) has over the East is the military?  I only wonder about this and don&#39;t indeed know if the U.S. does actually have the world&#39;s strongest, most powerful military.  Russia?  China?  Is the U.S. military stronger than them?  I would tend to say yes, but I&#39;m also not certain, as I haven&#39;t studied or researched that dynamic much.</p>

<p>This is my point. They are losing economic power, but that doesn&#39;t matter when your military spending is almost 50% of the world&#39;s total.</p>

<p>People seem to think that Russia and China are some sort of big threat to the US in military terms. They really, really aren&#39;t. Not to mention that whatever the US does will most likely be supported by the forces of the EU, the UK especially. Add that to the UN forces, and you&#39;ve got yourself a very dominant force.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t pointing to anyone in particular - economists would be a good example. They report what goes on in the world in term of money, and i don&#39;t know how difficult it would be to hide economic manipulation, but i&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Smart.  I agree with you.  Arm up.  Believe it or not, I&#39;ve actually never shot a gun in my life (aside from a bb and pellet gun - which, of course, doesn&#39;t count).  Might be doing so pretty soon though.  All the same, I still 100% support the American public arming up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying that the government is good enough to mastermind a plot to destroy the twin towers and pin the blame on some boogie man in the middle east yet inept enough to have found Dorner&#39;s wallet in 3 places including next to his charred body? You cannot have it both ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh.  No.  The government alone has little to do with everything that&#39;s going on.  Things are a <em>lot</em> bigger and more convoluted than it seems you have any idea about.  Don&#39;t get mad or upset at that.  Just be open to the information that exists regarding a very complicated reality.</p>
