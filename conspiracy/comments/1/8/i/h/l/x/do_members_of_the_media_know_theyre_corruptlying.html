Now the Elite own the two largest wire services in the world, where most newspapers get their news. The Rothschilds have control of all three U.S. Networks, plus other aspects of the recording and mass media industry according to research by Eustice Mullins in his book &#39;Who Owns the TV Networks&#39;.</em></p>

<p><em>Paul Julius Reuter noticed that, with the electric telegraph, news no longer required days or weeks to travel long distances. In the 1850s, the 34-year-old Reuter was based in Aachen – then in the Kingdom of Prussia, now in Germany – close to the borders with the Netherlands and Belgium. He began using the newly opened Berlin–Aachen telegraph line to send news to Berlin. However, the telegraph did not extend the 76 miles (122 km) to Brussels, Belgium&#39;s capital city and financial center. Reuter saw an opportunity to speed up news service between Brussels and Berlin by using homing pigeons to bridge that gap.</em></p>

<p><strong>In 1851 Reuter moved back to London and set up an office at the London Stock Exchange. Reuter founded Reuters, one of the major financial news agencies of the world.</strong></p>

I know alot a professionals in the science field that start to feel this way when their work becomes evil, and when they try to speak out, people blind to truth and the establisments system(the dumb do-gooders as I call them) will come out to burn them at the stake.

    <div class="md"><p>You should be aware that almost all news today is &quot;canned&quot;. </p>

<p>Meaning investigative reporters dont exist anymore in corporations. The Associated Press sends out a wire and every newpaper, tv station and radio station uses that same AP script. Also only 3 corporations, own 95% of all US newpapers, tv stations and  radio stations. </p>

<p>I found it odd that no one ever asks why, if TV stations are competeing for viewers and ratings, why do they use the same stories?</p>

<p>An example, i served on a gand jury for 6 months. 20 of the 23 cases would have made for a movie or proper new story. But we all heard about Scott Peterson in CA or some other sensationalize single story.</p>

<p>If station A beats Station B to the story and there is nothing more to know at the time, why do they stay focused on that single story rather than use a different, local and equally compelling story?</p>

<p>The news is more complacent than people realize. </p>

<p>if it&#39;s done out of pure ignorance</p>

<p>I used to think they lied knowingly and happily. Now I changed my mind:</p>

<p>Every journalist/talking head/commenter came through a series of filters - private schools, clubs, circles, relationships. They were selected out of many.</p>

<p>They live in world, where following the orders of one&#39;s immediate superior means prosperity and career. Where &quot;You are thinking too much&quot; is a grave warning. It is a different world.</p>

<p>They do everything as they were taught - namely, they let their bosses worry. It worked for their parents. It is working now for their bosses. There is no sign that it will not work for them. So they do as they are told.</p>

<p>TLDR: They are not corrupt: they are as normal as everyone <em>around them</em>. They are not lying: they keep themselves detached, unaware of what they are saying, because awareness might invite thinking, and thinking is for the bosses. They live in a different world with different rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, It&#39;s not hard to tell that they know exactly what they are doing. You can see this from their body lagnuage, and their voice and tone.</p>

<p>For example, when I was watching (was it CBS?) News, the way the lady was saying &quot;there was a brief exchange of gunfire&quot; you can tell in her voice she&#39;s lying. Because many of us saw the video they gave us alone, and you can multiply brief by 1000. Also, I&#39;m sure Anderson Cooper knew he was on a green screen and not at a funeral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always wondered this. Either they are seduced by the money and fame that comes along with being in the media and don&#39;t care that they are spreading lies, or they are ignorant to the fact that what they are telling people is a lie, or they are all mind controlled puppets of the elite.  I think the last possibility is far fetched, because that would be such a huge operation. But hey, stranger things have happened...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Investigative journalists barely even exist these days it seems. It&#39;s called &#39;the press&#39; for a reason and they too often fail to live up to that ideal. Most of the jack asses that infest our MSM are just mouthpieces on the &#39;official&#39; megaphone. They aren&#39;t reporters, they&#39;re relays. I&#39;m sure a lot of them could be oblivious to what kind of tools they really are but some of them have to realize it. It&#39;s obviously a concerted effort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Members of the media know full well that they are corrupt/lying, but as jakenichols said, everything that any media outlet you know of (whether the outlet is local or nationwide) gets is from the Associated Press, or AP. I am somewhat ashamed to admit it, but I work with the media. I don&#39;t write, report, or publish stories, I&#39;m simply a background man. But from what I can tell in my experience, members of &quot;the media&quot; honestly just don&#39;t care. Very, very few members are in that line of work because they truly care about what information gets out there. Some join to be on TV, others join because they love working with video/audio/camerawork etc. (myself included). So, to answer simply, they do know they&#39;re corrupting, but most of them simply don&#39;t give a damn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some know.  The issue is not if they know, but if they care.  They don&#39;t care.  That&#39;s what you have to remember, they do not care.  If someone is a corrupt liar, they will lie and deflect when confronted about it.  You can catch them in a lie, and they will lie about that too or simply change the subject.  </p>
