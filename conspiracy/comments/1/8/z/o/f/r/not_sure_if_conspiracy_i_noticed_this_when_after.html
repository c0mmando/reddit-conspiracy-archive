Ive noticed that in the old textbooks they teach us how to do each problem step by step and also teaches the concept of what we are learning and how the equations are derived. However, in the new textbooks that we use in school it only shows you the shortcuts to get the problem done and doesn&#39;t give you much background on what we are learning. It just tells you how to solve a given problem by following the rules like machine.Could the industry be trying to hide this information from us to stop us from thinking abstractly? Could they be trying to make it so we only know enough to make them rich?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Abstract thinking abilities have increased for the last several decades. They don&#39;t care about people&#39;s thinking they care about people&#39;s action. Yes school does make people obedient and breaks their will and makes them feel they cannot improve conditions or defeat problems (because they cannot change or improve anything about school they don&#39;t like).</p>

<p>But tptb are not crushing abstract thinking. They are more interested in crushing or suppressing real world action and no a great abstract thinker, a great scientist, does not automatically make a person who puts things into action, and gets things done. Many intellectuals have even been bad at business (more about taking effective action).</p>

<p>I believe it&#39;s more than just that industry. The industry is a part of our education/indoctrination system, which ultimately means the government has their own say in how textbooks are made. The government wants to prevent abstract thinking.</p>

<p>Consider that, and think about how much college debt students are picking up now, consider that more and more jobs (read: controlled by corporations) require college degrees even at $10/hour wages, and think about indentured servitude (which is mostly a euphemism for slavery) while watching this video:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The government wants to prevent abstract thinking.&quot;</p>

<p>Well then they are being the opposite of effective:</p>

<p>&quot;Flynn in his 2007 book What Is Intelligence? further expanded on this theory. Environmental changes resulting from modernization — such as more intellectually demanding work, greater use of technology and smaller families — have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities.&quot;</p>

<p>(On improved abstract thinking results on tests by newer generations.)</p>

<p>A different researcher argues it is not modern living that has improving abstract thinking but instead literacy rates. Literacy rates have also improved why wouldn&#39;t the government stop people from learning how to read?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is unlikely (maybe it has happened in the last 10 years with more standardized testing).</p>

<p>But before that the direction for quite a while in education has been moving away from memorizing a set of steps like a machine towards trying to get children to understand what they are doing. &quot;New math&quot; was one of the attempts of trying to get children to understand and think about what they are doing.</p>

<p>Ironically whenever the move is towards teaching for more higher order thinking and understanding instead of memorization the majority of people decry the higher order material as an attempt to &quot;dumb down&quot; the current generation, or that it already has, when the opposite is true.</p>

<p>People love to make comments about how stupid today&#39;s young people are if they haven&#39;t learned specific little facts like all the state capitals, or other specific knowledge that is generally not indicative of ability to reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t tried to confirm that this is a real 1895 grade 8 exam but assuming that it is, it is not harder than what grade 8 students learn today. It seems harder than it is because some of the words and measurements are archaic or not often used today.</p>

<p>Here are some science questions from a 2012 grade 8 science exam:</p>

<p>---&quot;3 Which statement is an inference?
(1) A thermometer shows that the air temperature
is 56°F.
(2) A mineral sample of galena produced a 
gray-black streak when tested.
(3) Based on previous data, ten hurricanes may
occur in the year 2013.
(4) A weather vane indicates the wind is coming
from the west.&quot;</p>

<p>---&quot;Describe the process that most likely caused the change in the positions of South America and Africa over
the last 65 million years.&quot;</p>

<p>---&quot;The sum of all chemical reactions that take place
within an organism is known as&quot;
(1) evolution (3) circulation
(2) metabolism (4) reproduction</p>

<p>&quot;At which location (on a diagram) does the water have the greatest
kinetic energy?&quot;</p>

<p>Here are some questions from grade 8 math exam today:</p>

<p>There&#39;s more to school textbooks.</p>

<p>About a month ago I got my hands on a school (middle school) language texbook from one on the former Yugoslavian countries. They, naturally, use sentences to teach language, but these sentences were nothing like what we had had in school, in a different country, decades ago. Stuff along the lines of &quot;It&#39;s normal for the Parliament to legalize gay marriage.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aspiring math teacher here. This is why people fucking hate math. Teachers aren&#39;t really encouraged to actually teach you anything, just show you how to do the problems. You never learn why, so when you have to apply it, it&#39;s hard cause you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>Charlotte Iserbyt is the consummate whistleblower! Iserbyt served as Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), U.S. Department of Education, during the first Reagan Administration, where she first blew the whistle on a major technology initiative which would control curriculum in America&#39;s classrooms. Iserbyt is a former school board director in Camden, Maine and was co-founder and research analyst of Guardians of Education for Maine (GEM) from 1978 to 2000. She has also served in the American Red Cross on Guam and Japan during the Korean War, and in the United States Foreign Service in Belgium and in the Republic of South Africa. Iserbyt is a speaker and writer, best known for her 1985 booklet Back to Basics Reform or OBE: Skinnerian International Curriculum and her 1989 pamphlet Soviets in the Classroom: America&#39;s Latest Education Fad which  covered the details of the U.S.-Soviet and Carnegie-Soviet Education Agreements which remain in effect to this day. She is a freelance writer and has had articles published in Human Events, The Washington Times, The Bangor Daily News, and included in the record of Congressional hearings.</p>

<p>&quot;She was born in 1930 and attended Dana Hall preparatory school and Katharine Gibbs College in New York City, where she studied business. Iserbyt’s father and grandfather were Yale University graduates and members of the <strong>Skull and Bones secret society</strong>.</p>

<p>She is known for writing the book <strong>The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America</strong>. The book claims that changes gradually brought into the American public education system attempt to eliminate the influences of a child’s parents (<strong>religion, morals, national patriotism</strong>), and mold the child into a member of the proletariat in preparation for a <strong>socialist-collectivist world of the future</strong>. She alleges that these changes originated from plans formulated primarily by the <strong>Andrew Carnegie Foundation</strong> for the <strong>Advancement of Education and Rockefeller General Education Board</strong>, and details what she says are the psychological methods used to implement and effect the changes.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a problem everywhere, I tutor my nieces sometimes and I noticed that while they teach the second grade to multiply, they do not teach them the multiples of each number and the same with division. They teach them division of two digit numbers without showing the long division process. Hence, the kids never know what they are doing. Another thing, physics is another subject completely removed from elementary and secondary education in North America, You have to enroll first year university to learn basic grade 10 physics concepts . So the whole first /second university year is waste for anyone coming from Europe or Asia or Africa. An education system so lacking and redundent, It numbs any bright student to complete nothingness.</p>
