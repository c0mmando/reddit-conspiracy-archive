       In case you haven't seen it yet,
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T6cG7FC71c">
        here
       </a>
       is clear-as-day audio evidence that LAPD officers
       <a href="http://youtu.be/sisVskohj1k">
        intentionally set fire to the Dorner cabin
       </a>
       . Also,
       <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Vp_Lc2IWNL/">
        reports
       </a>
       indicate that Dorner attempted to flee the blaze, perhaps to surrender, but
       <a href="https://twitter.com/sabzbrach/status/301512912302919680/photo/1">
        was forced back inside
       </a>
       to die by fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       This man is dead now and there is nothing we can do about it. What we CAN do is ensure that the outrage that accompanies true knowledge of HOW this man died is not confined to this sub, and most certainly we can make absolutely certain the fabricated story that you can bet has already been canned and set to be delivered to the media does not have a leg to stand on.

      <p>
       <strong>
        Make sure everyone you know and their mother knows the LAPD are a bunch of jack-booted, hood-and-sheet wearing cowards who penned this human being in like an animal and watched him burn

        Christopher Dorner was burned alive by the LAPD

Dorner has been active in what sounds like five counties (LA, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego) and who knows how many cities. Nothing good can come from blaming people for things they clearly weren't responsible for. LAPD has done plenty of bad shit, but today's events probably aren't on that list.

       Cool. This may not be obvious if you're not from the area but the cities/counties involved are totally different in terms of culture/geography/etc - not arguing against the "cops stick together" angle, but remember that Dorner (allegedly) killed one San Bernardino deputy today and wounded another, so the local people have their own motive for revenge; and the San Bernardino deputies are probably more sympathetic to the Riverside city cops who were shot versus the LAPD cops (and WTF were LAPD officers in an LAPD squad car doing in Corona? They were like 50 miles away from their home turf.)

       Honestly, I saw as much as everyone else did, which was nothing at all. For all I know, there was never a Chris Dorner. I don't think any of the "evidence" would hold up in a court of law.

       I have considered this as well, especially the audio recording where they talk about being
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       the house and finding blood spatter in the corner, then they decide to "go ahead with the burner plan...like we talked about". All the evidence incinerated in the blaze and no video from above "for the protection of the officers".

       For full disclosure, my cousin is a San Bernadino sheriff's deputy. I very rarely talk with him, live on the other side of the country, and haven't heard from him since this incident. He may have been present, I honestly don't know. It doesn't influence my opinion here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is (not only) my speculation that in local police jargon, pyrotechnic tear gas canisters are called "burners," possibly a reference to
       <a href="http://www.tomahawkburnsafe.com/BurnSafe-Instructions.html">
        BurnSafe brand
       </a>
       tear gas made in San Bernadino county and used by various law enforcement agencies in SoCal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible that each reference to a "burn" or "burning him out" is just carelessly replacing the term "smoke him out" with said jargon. That's exactly what tear gas is meant to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is known, however, that pyrotechnic tear gas canisters can cause fires. This should be obvious in the wake of the Waco siege. The San Bernadino sheriff's deputies assuredly knew that this would be a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, though, IF Dorner was still armed and at times firing at law enforcement officers, said officers were fully within their rights to take lethal action against him. This is why it isn't illegal for SWAT snipers to take out suspects. The use of tear gas canisters is a common, non-lethal standard way to encourage surrender and gain a tactical advantage in SWAT situations, even with the expected possibility of igniting fires. That doesn't really make it a conspiracy, it's just how such situations often end; taking a hostile suspect alive is less important than the lives of the police officers that are trying to subdue and arrest him.

       Maybe he was getting too popular? A lot of people were starting to cheer him on. The cops didn't want him to become a martyr. So, they burned the house down and declared him dead.

       Are you sure? He was never convicted. Having looked at different sources the police lied before, during, and post death (including evidence). I'm not saying he did or he didn't, but I don't think the police deserve any credibility given that.

       He was disgruntled, I'm not commenting about how the police are corrupt or whatever. He obviously killed a few people and had no intention of clearing his name of whatever he was implicated in.  &lt;shrug&gt; Conspiracy theorys are just for people that have nothing better to do.

       Murdering someone because you got fired is not excusable no matter the circumstances. Justice? What justice? Lots of people commit suicide by cop. Dorner obviously didn't have a point, he was going for revenge.

       Thanks for posting OP. Extremely happy this is getting attention as I basically said the same thing. We must tell the truth and continue the fight. As far as I'm concerned the most accurate thing I heard on TV was that Dorner was shot by Larry the limo driver.

       the internet blew up on day one about Dorner. If we know somethings up, they know somethings up and they're trying to fix it asap.

      <p>
       Now theyre saying charred remains of a body found and a wallet was also found with Dorners Id's

       He should have called a lawyer to set up the surrender. Lawyer would establish a meeting place and time where the cops could take him into custody, and would observe the process to make sure the cops behaved appropriately.

       No-one has confirmed his death yet. I'm still clinging on to the faint hope he got away even after they say he's dead (which I have no doubt they will). Anyone know if you can be 100% a body is somebody in particular after burning to ash?

       Conspiracy mind coming out. Government are going to say he's dead. I don't know if he is or not but we are getting told that either way. So if he's alive then the government sure cant retract the statement if he does carry on. Anymore retributions he does get (again if he is still alive) will not be reported as him. He would need to come out on video with today's paper and say he's still alive. Of course that is of he wants to.

       He may have existed, but he may have been dead this whole time and they were just setting up / manufacturing the whole scenario.  So you have to ask "Why?"  What is to be gained from creating another false flag?  Think it through.

       I wonder if anyone else agrees with me that something is not right about this man firing a burst in the direction of a fellow officer as well as directly into smoke. The crazier part of my brain is thinking only someone firing blanks would do that. "I can't see anything, and Dave is down there, but fuck it, PEW PEW!"

       I found it strange when the BBC showed the CNN footage of the live gunfight. It looked staged... and I think it was. I think Dorner was as much a crazy lone murderer as Wade Page, Adam Lanza and James Holmes. I think you're being played, America. Now Obama has demanded a fresh vote on gun laws - that was quick - and his own tone suggests he's for tighter ones. The majority will vote for strictness out of a belief that it's the moral thing to do.

       This is a retired military opinion. What took place at that cabin was an act of tactical warfare. Not law. No different than calling in an air strike to have A-10's level the structure. The question we have before us is: When did the Police cross from upholding the law to engaging in tactical war fare? The threat present from the cabin was not a threat to any inicent parties. Questionably a limited threat to law enforcement who had control of the area. War fare tactics applied, he was exicuted. And the press covering that simple fact up worries me.

       I'm not a Dorner supporter - he may have had a legitimate beef against the LAPD, but killing his attorney's daughter, boyfriend, and some uninvolved cops from other departments was totally unjustified and wrong. And I can't say that I'm disappointed if a kidnapper/carjacker/murderer dies.

       On the other hand, I'm really not comfortable with summary execution by law enforcement.

       As well as somebody who was mentally ill, still hopelessly obsessed about a job he'd lost years earlier. Life throws lots of unpleasantness into all of our paths, thankfully the majority of us are able to deal with it without embarking on murderous rampages. If he wanted to further his cause of exposing police corruption, he could have achieved significantly more by remaining
       <em>
        alive
       </em>
       and getting his message out by other means. This man was ill, and lacked the ability to cope with things in a rational manner. I don't believe he was an inherently evil man and I'm damn sure he's not a martyr or hero. Just a victim of his own mental illness.

       I'm not happy with this outcome, but unfortunately Dorner's own actions made an unhappy outcome inevitable.

       Yeah that was a bit of a knee jerk response by me to the endless 'government' theories.  It seems according to

       that his mother is likely narcissistically abusive or cold. Narcissistically abusive parents can be really tormenting.  But this also adds more weight to his real mental disintegration like with Adam Lanza (seemingly very left wing) and his mother with her house full of guns.

       Just saying. Also, it's quite a sensationalized jump to say he was murdered. He wasn't rescued because he was openly hostile to police, it would have been foolish to attempt to approach him when he proved several times his willingness to open fire.

       The discussion of "placing burners" by the cops is pretty scary, given that the cabin was then engulfed in flames within minutes. Sounds like they meant to burn him out or kill him with fire/smoke.

       That seems to be the consensus, but, geez, it's hard to think of a worse slang term for them, given how this turned out. I guess next time they'll call them the "fluffy bunny kissers" or something.

       It's unfortunate to be sure. Don't get me wrong, the police handled this very poorly, but I do not believe that they threw any specialized fire starters into the building. Whether or not they knew the tear gas would start a fire is anyone's guess.

       There are reports someone tried to surrender and was pushed back inside of the house. Regardless of the criminal, they aren't supposed to shoot first. Yes their lives are in danger, that is the risk of being a cop. But their main goal is to catch him, arrest him, and bring him to justice, not to execute street justice on him.

       Resistance to what?  An ignorant world view.  Ignorance is corrected with learning, not firepower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say your friends are in front of a tank, and are about to be crushed to death by it.  The tank's moving along at 5 miles an hour, and your friends are making pretty good pace at 6 miles an hour, but they're slowing down with exhaustion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things look dire.  The tank operator is laughing hysterically, and shooting tank ammunition off to the sides of your friends.   But wait!  The side door to the tank is hanging off.  Go in the tank and beat up the operator, and then shut it off.   He's just a 140lb kid, and he can't operate the tank and fight you at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What were you planning to do,
       <em>
        get in front of the tank and push against it

       This is my thought exactly.  Or maybe he was killed in the explosion/fire in his truck, and they spun the story from there.

       My co-worker went to high school with Dorner and remained in touch with him on FB. I'm pretty sure he's not a plant sent to my company ten years ago to support a future conspiracy involving an imaginary rogue cop.

       Resistance to what?  An ignorant world view.  Ignorance is corrected with learning, not firepower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say your friends are in front of a tank, and are about to be crushed to death by it.  The tank's moving along at 5 miles an hour, and your friends are making pretty good pace at 6 miles an hour, but they're slowing down with exhaustion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things look dire.  The tank operator is laughing hysterically, and shooting tank ammunition off to the sides of your friends.   But wait!  The side door to the tank is hanging off.  Go in the tank and beat up the operator, and then shut it off.   He's just a 140lb kid, and he can't operate the tank and fight you at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What were you planning to do,
       <em>
        get in front of the tank and push against it
       </em>
       ?  Duh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clear analogy?
