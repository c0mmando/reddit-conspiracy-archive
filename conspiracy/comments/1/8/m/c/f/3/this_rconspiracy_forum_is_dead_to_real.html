       I have been here for a while. This is probably my third name I have used, maybe? I assure you, most of us old timers are still here. We are just getting buried by users with multiple accounts. I am not saying remove every mod, but I am saying we need a fresh injection of new mods. I mean zero disrespect when I say this, but I don't think most of the mods even frequent this subreddit. This is just my opinion, of course. No need to crucify me!

       Conspira ad infinitum - This subreddit constantly has people who think everything is a conspiracy.
      </p>

       Eventually objective people see the motive behind the conspiracies. Most people here will ignore the facts that do not support their agenda and objective people see that.

       does not trust the government/main stream media and therefore everything has to turn into some evil plan. Skeptics do not trust the media/government either but we largely attribute their mistakes to just general incompetence/laziness rather then a master plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love conspiracies but that does not mean I believe in them. The ironic part is people like Alex Jones and A&amp;E 911truth are the real conspiracy. They financially exploit the paranoid. That is where this subreddit should focus.
      </p>

       Skeptics like myself pretty much declared victory when this subreddit turned into "The Jews did it." That is the lowest form of ideological ignorance.

       Jewish ethnocentricism is the cause of a lot of the worlds problems. Mossad is the king of false flag terrorism. Nice job equating it to "the jews did it" though.

       I would say you're welcome, but I didn't prove any point you made. Are you denying that people of Jewish origin are heavily overrepresented in media, government and finances? Do you think this is because they are gods chosen or because they have a culture of sticking to themselves and looking out for their own interests?

       A person who immerses themselves in alternate truths and alleged realities might find themselves disenfranchised by how our social construction of reality has been tampered with and he might settle into a forced self-view of disillusioned awareness.

       Not as far as I know. But even if there is they'll quickly get infiltrated as well. Two subreddits that I subscribe to that are loosely related are
       <a href="/r/anythinggoesnews">
        /r/anythinggoesnews
       </a>
       which is really just exactly what it's titled and
       <a href="/r/countermine">
        /r/countermine
       </a>
       which is probably the best collection if articles you'll find but it's just a single guy and there are rarely comments. Maybe that could change although I'd hate to see that go to shit.

       /Conspiracy is still a viable forum with apparently honest mods as far as I can see..  However, it has been under vicious attack by JCM267's /conspiratard, which constantly floods itself with mocking material seemingly intended to demonize all conspiracy inquiry. They also have cross-links likely used to send their people over here to vote-game; never mind their facetious sidebar 'rule'. They break it a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that sincere inquiry belongs here, and it should not be intimidated by the obvious social media manipulators.

       Been here for a long while I love it here in life things change evolve n grow. That's the problem with old timers they are sick in their ways. ... And if half of what we discuss here in /conspiracy is because the old times sat back and Allowed those in control to give us these conspiracies to discuss.

       they are still keeping tabs on both of us. on and off line. and it's really the NSA that does this stuff, now, primarily, as far as I'm aware.

       the best that can be done about them is to just drop some info in the thread, not to debate, but to prevent them from gang gate keeping, which becomes easier to spot after one has been in here long enough.

       nothing so vast is that monolithic
      </p>
      <p>
       the nsa still has access to every ISP and can tap at other core points as well. so they get everything that isn't encrypted and they have the ability to correlate that so anonymizing isn't strong. Encryption works, but if you read in those communities you will find that the NSA and the government is heavily involved. Is it possible that certain encryption methods have weaker key ranges that can allow for enough discovery to bring the range of brute force tactics into computational practicality? You'd have to be
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       intelligent to be able to figure it out. They operate enough clandestine entry and exit nodes to be able to correlate activity and 'break' the idea of tor as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       the idea that 'everything' on the internet is operated by 'them' is kinda childish. you can go set up your own anonymizer at any data center

       This subreddit is people who read news stories, completely make up some far fetched alternate story without evidence and then post it here with a question mark on the end.

       If a celebrity dies in a car crash tomorrow it will be because they "knew something".

       If one of the cameras on the curiosity rover breaks it will be posted as government sabotage.

       they are still keeping tabs on both of us. on and off line. and it's really the NSA that does this stuff, now, primarily, as far as I'm aware.

       and yes, even in the time that i've been here, the sheer quantity of trolls has rapidly exceeded the rate at which the quality of their methods has grown.

       the best that can be done about them is to just drop some info in the thread, not to debate, but to prevent them from gang gate keeping, which becomes easier to spot after one has been in here long enough.

       nothing so vast is that monolithic
      </p>
      <p>
       the nsa still has access to every ISP and can tap at other core points as well. so they get everything that isn't encrypted and they have the ability to correlate that so anonymizing isn't strong. Encryption works, but if you read in those communities you will find that the NSA and the government is heavily involved. Is it possible that certain encryption methods have weaker key ranges that can allow for enough discovery to bring the range of brute force tactics into computational practicality? You'd have to be
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       intelligent to be able to figure it out. They operate enough clandestine entry and exit nodes to be able to correlate activity and 'break' the idea of tor as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       the idea that 'everything' on the internet is operated by 'them' is kinda childish. you can go set up your own anonymizer at any data center
