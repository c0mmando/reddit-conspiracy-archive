    <div class="md"><p>Conspira ad infinitum - This subreddit constantly has people who think everything is a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Eventually objective people see the motive behind the conspiracies. Most people here will ignore the facts that do not support their agenda and objective people see that. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does not trust the government/main stream media and therefore everything has to turn into some evil plan. Skeptics do not trust the media/government either but we largely attribute their mistakes to just general incompetence/laziness rather then a master plan.</p>

<p>I love conspiracies but that does not mean I believe in them. The ironic part is people like Alex Jones and A&amp;E 911truth are the real conspiracy. They financially exploit the paranoid. That is where this subreddit should focus.</p>

<p>Skeptics like myself pretty much declared victory when this subreddit turned into &quot;The Jews did it.&quot; That is the lowest form of ideological ignorance.</p>

<p>Jewish ethnocentricism is the cause of a lot of the worlds problems. Mossad is the king of false flag terrorism. Nice job equating it to &quot;the jews did it&quot; though.</p>

Two subreddits that I subscribe to that are loosely related are <a href="/r/anythinggoesnews">/r/anythinggoesnews</a> which is really just exactly what it&#39;s titled and <a href="/r/countermine">/r/countermine</a> which is probably the best collection if articles you&#39;ll find but it&#39;s just a single guy and there are rarely comments.

However, it has been under vicious attack by JCM267&#39;s /conspiratard, which constantly floods itself with mocking material seemingly intended to demonize all conspiracy inquiry. They also have cross-links likely used to send their people over here to vote-game; never mind their facetious sidebar &#39;rule&#39;. They break it a lot.</p>

<p>the best that can be done about them is to just drop some info in the thread, not to debate, but to prevent them from gang gate keeping, which becomes easier to spot after one has been in here long enough. </p>
